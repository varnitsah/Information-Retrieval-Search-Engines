15330094	bohns standard library  the prose works of jonathan swift  vol x   illustration jonathan swift on the bust by rouldiac in trinity college dublin   the prose works  of  jonathan swift dd  edited by  temple scott  vol x  historical writings  1902     introduction   of late years that is to say within the last thirty odd years there has existed a certain amount of doubt as to whether or no the work known to us as the history of the four last years of the queen was really the product of swifts pen that a work of this nature had occupied swift during his retirement at windsor in 1713 is undoubted that the work here reprinted from the edition given to the world in 1758 by an anonymous editor from a copy surreptitiously taken by an anonymous friend to use mr churton collinss summary is the actual work upon which swift was engaged at windsor is not so certain let us for a moment trace the history of what is known of what swift did write and then we shall be in a better position to judge of the authenticity of what we have before us  all that we know of this work is gathered from swifts correspondence as published by sir walter scott in his edition of swifts works issued in 1824 the first reference there made is in a note from dr william king to mrs whiteway from which we gather that swift towards the end of the year 1736 was meditating the publication of what he had written in 1713 as to the history writes king the dean may be assured i will take care to supply the dates that are wanting and which can easily be done in an hour or two the tracts if he pleases may be printed by way of appendix this will be indeed less trouble than the interweaving them in the body of the history and will do the author as much honour and answer the purpose full as well  this was written from paris under date november 9th os 1736 it can easily be gathered from this that the tracts referred to are the tracts on the same period which swift wrote at the time in defence of the oxford ministry they are given in the fifth volume of this edition  on december 7th 1736 king was in london and he immediately writes to swift himself on the matter of the history i arrived here yesterday he says and i am now ready to obey your commands i hope you are come to a positive resolution concerning the history you need not hesitate about the dates or the references which are to be made to any public papers for i can supply them without the least trouble as well as i remember there is but one of those public pieces which you determined should be inserted at length i mean sir thomas hanmers representation this i have now by me if you incline to publish the two tracts as an appendix to the history you will be pleased to see if the character given of the earl of oxford in the pamphlet of 1715 agrees with the character given of the same person in the history1 perhaps on a review you may think proper to leave one of them quite out you have i think barely mentioned the attempt of guiscard and the quarrel between rechteren and mesnager but as these are facts which are probably now forgot or unknown it would not be amiss if they were related at large in the notes which may be done from the gazettes or any other newspapers of those times this is all i have to offer to your consideration  footnote 1 see note on page 95 of this volume  there is thus no doubt left as to which were the tracts referred to by king and as to the desire of swift to include sir thomas hanmers representationtwo points that are important as evidence for the authenticity of the edition issued by lucas in 1758  towards the middle of 1737 it must have become common knowledge among swifts friends in london that he was preparing for publication his history of the four last years of queen annes reign possibly king may have dropped a hint of it possibly swift may have written to others for information and assistance be that as it may on april 7th 1737 the earl of oxford son of swifts old friend wrote to swift as follows       one reason of my writing to you now is next to my asking     your forgiveness this i am told that you have given leave and     liberty to some one or more of your friends to print a history     of the last four years of queen annes reign wrote by you      as i am most truly sensible of your constant regard and sincere     friendship for my father even to partiality if i may say so     i am very sensible of the share and part he must bear in such a     history and as i remember when i read over that history of     yours i can recollect that there seemed to me a want of some     papers to make it more complete which was not in our power to     obtain besides there were some severe things said which might     have been very currently talked of but now will want a proper     evidence to support for these reasons it is that i do entreat     the favour of you and make it my earnest request that you will     give your positive directions that this history be not printed     and published until i have had an opportunity of seeing it     with a liberty of showing it to some family friends whom i     would consult upon this occasion i beg pardon for this i hope     you will be so good as to grant my request i do it with great     deference to you if i had the pleasure of seeing you i would     soon say something to you that would convince you i am not     wrong they are not proper for a letter as you will easily     guess  it is evident that swift had gone so far as to consult with faulkner on the matter of the printing of the history because he was present when oxfords letter arrived and he tells us that swift answered the letter immediately and made him read the answer the purport of which was that although he loved his lordships father more than he ever did any man yet as a human creature he had his faults and therefore as an impartial writer he could not conceal them  on the 4th of june 1737 swift wrote at length to oxford a letter in which he details the circumstances and the reasons which moved him to write the history the letter is important and runs as follows      my lord      i had the honour of a letter from your lordship dated april     the 7th which i was not prepared to answer until this time     your lordship must needs have known that the history you     mention of the four last years of the queens reign was     written at windsor just upon finishing the peace at which     time your father and my lord bolingbroke had a misunderstanding     with each other that was attended with very bad consequences     when i came to ireland to take this deanery after the peace was     made i could not stay here above a fortnight being recalled by     a hundred letters to hasten back and to use my endeavours in     reconciling those ministers i left them the history you     mention which i finished at windsor to the time of the peace     when i returned to england i found their quarrels and coldness     increased i laboured to reconcile them as much as i was able i     contrived to bring them to my lord mashams at st jamess my     lord and lady masham left us together i expostulated with them     both but could not find any good consequences i was to go to     windsor next day with my lordtreasurer i pretended business     that prevented me expecting they would come to some     agreement but i followed them to windsor where my lord     bolingbroke told me that my scheme had come to nothing things     went on at the same rate they grew more estranged every day my     lordtreasurer found his credit daily declining in may before     the queen died i had my last meeting with them at my lord     mashams he left us together and therefore i spoke very freely     to them both and told them i would retire for i found all     was gone lord bolingbroke whispered me i was in the right     your father said all would do well i told him that i would     go to oxford on monday since i found it was impossible to be of     any use i took coach to oxford on monday went to a friend in     berkshire there stayed until the queens death and then to my     station here where i stayed twelve years and never saw my lord     your father afterward they could not agree about printing the     history of the four last years and therefore i have kept it to     this time when i determine to publish it in london to the     confusion of all those rascals who have accused the queen and     that ministry of making a bad peace to which that party     entirely owes the protestant succession i was then in the     greatest trust and confidence with your father the     lordtreasurer as well as with my lord bolingbroke and all     others who had part in the administration i had all the letters     from the secretarys office during the treaty of peace out of     those and what i learned from the ministry i formed that     history which i am now going to publish for the information of     posterity and to control the most impudent falsehoods which     have been published since i wanted no kind of materials i knew     your father better than you could at that time and i do     impartially think him the most virtuous minister and the most     able that ever i remember to have read of if your lordship has     any particular circumstances that may fortify what i have said     in the history such as letters or materials i am content they     should be printed at the end by way of appendix i loved my     lord your father better than any other man in the world     although i had no obligation to him on the score of preferment     having been driven to this wretched kingdom to which i was     almost a stranger by his want of power to keep me in what i     ought to call my own country although i happened to be dropped     here and was a year old before i left it and to my sorrow did     not die before i came back to it again as to the history it     is only of affairs which i know very well and had all the     advantages possible to know when you were in some sort but a     lad one great design of it is to do justice to the ministry at     that time and to refute all the objections against them as if     they had a design of bringing in popery and the pretender and     farther to demonstrate that the present settlement of the crown     was chiefly owing to my lord your father  the earl of oxford had failed to extract the manuscript from swift for the purpose he had expressed in his letter but his friend and swifts old friend erasmus lewis who had been undersecretary of state during lord oxfords administration came to the earls assistance he had not written to swift for many years but on june 30th 1737 he took occasion to renew the correspondence and referred to the proposal for publishing the history in a manner which leaves no doubt as to who suggested to him to write        now i name him i mean lord oxford let me ask you if it     be true that you are going to print a history of the four last     years of the queen if it is will not you let me see it before     you send it to the press is it not possible that i may suggest     some things that you may have omitted and give you reasons for     leaving out others the scene is changed since that period of     time the conditions of the peace of utrecht have been applauded     by most part of mankind even in the two houses of parliament     should not matters rest here at least for some time i presume     your great end is to do justice to truth the second point may     perhaps be to make a compliment to the oxford family permit me     to say as to the first that though you know perhaps more than     any one man i may possibly contribute a mite and with the     alteration of one word viz by inserting parva instead of     magna apply to myself that passage of virgil et quorum pars     parva fui as to the second point i do not conceive your     compliment to lord oxford to be so perfect as it might be     unless you lay the manuscript before him that it may be     considered here  on the 4th of july 1737 oxford replied to swifts letter of the 4th of june referring to it as of the 14th of june and emphasizes his earnest wish to see the manuscript he also asks that it may be permitted him to show it to some friends      good mr dean      your letter of june 14th in answer to mine of the 7th of     april is come to my hands and it is with no small concern that     i have read it and to find that you seem to have formed a     resolution to put the history of the four last years of the     queen to the press a resolution taken without giving your     friends and those that are greatly concerned some notice or     suffering them to have time and opportunity to read the papers     over and to consider them i hope it is not too late yet and     that you will be so good as to let some friends see them before     they are put to the press and as you propose to have the work     printed here it will be easy to give directions to whom you     will please to give the liberty of seeing them i beg i may be     one this request i again repeat to you and i hope you will     grant it i do not doubt that there are many who will persuade     you to publish it but they are not proper judges their reasons     may be of different kinds and their motives to press on this     work may be quite different and perhaps concealed from you      i am extremely sensible of the firm love and regard you had for     my father and have for his memory and upon that account it is     that i now renew my request that you would at least defer this     printing until you have had the advice of friends you have     forgot that you lent me the history to read when you were in     england since my father died i do remember it well i would     ask your pardon for giving you this trouble but upon this     affair i am so nearly concerned that if i did not my utmost to     prevent it i should never forgive myself  while this correspondence was in progress swift had given the manuscript to lord orrery to hand over to dr king on june 24th 1737 king wrote to swift stating that he had received a letter from mrs whiteway in which he was told to expect the manuscript from the hands of lord orrery to mrs whiteway he replied on the same day that he would wait on lord orrery to receive the papers on july 23rd 1737 lord orrery wrote to swift informing him that dr king has his cargo  with the knowledge that the manuscript was on its way to king swift wrote the following reply to lewiss letter      july 23 1737      dear friend      while any of those who used to write to me were alive i always     inquired after you but since your secretaryship in the queens     time i believed you were so glutted with the office that you     had not patience to venture on a letter to an absent useless     acquaintance and i find i owe yours to my lord oxford the     history you mention was written above a year before the queens     death i left it with the treasurer and lord bolingbroke when i     first came over to take this deanery i returned in less than a     month but the ministry could not agree about printing it it     was to conclude with the peace i staid in london above nine     months but not being able to reconcile the quarrels between     those two i went to a friend in berkshire and on the queens     death came hither for good and all i am confident you read     that history as this lord oxford did as he owns in his two     letters the last of which reached me not above ten days ago     you know on the queens death how the peace and all     proceedings were universally condemned this i knew would be     done and the chief cause of my writing was not to let such a     queen and ministry lie under such a load of infamy or posterity     be so illinformed c lord oxford is in the wrong to be in     pain about his fathers character or his proceedings in his     ministry which is so drawn that his greatest admirers will     rather censure me for partiality neither can he tell me     anything material out of his papers which i was not then     informed of nor do i know anybody but yourself who could give     me more light than what i then received for i remember i often     consulted with you and took memorials of many important     particulars which you told me as i did of others for four     years together i can find no way to have the original delivered     to lord oxford or to you for the person who has it will not     trust it out of his hands but i believe would be contented to     let it be read to either of you if it could be done without     letting it out of his hands although perhaps that may be too     late  swift is evidently about to accede to the desires of his two friends and lewis in his reply takes it for granted that the manuscript will soon be in his possession for perusal and examination      london aug 4 1737      i assure you my dear dean twas matter of joy to me to     receive a letter from you and i hope tis an earnest of many     more i may have hereafter before you and i leave this world     though i must tell you that if you and i revive our former     correspondence you must indulge me the liberty of making use of     another hand for whether it be owing to age or writing     formerly whole nights by candlelight or to both those causes     my sight is so far impaired that i am not able without much     pain to scratch out a letter      i do not remember ever to have read your history i own my     memory is much decayed but still i think i could not have     forgotten a matter of so much consequence and which must have     given me so great a pleasure it is fresh in my mind that lord     oxford and the auditor desired you to confer with me upon the     subject matter of it that we accordingly did so and that the     conclusion was you would bury everything in oblivion we     reported this to those two i mean to his lordship and his     uncle and they acquiesced in it now i find you have finished     that piece i ask nothing but what you grant in your letter of     july 23d viz that your friend shall read it to me and forbear     sending it to the press till you have considered the     objections if any should be made      in the meantime i shall only observe to you in general that     three and twenty years for so long it is since the death of     queen anne having made a great alteration in the world and     that what was sense and reason then is not so now besides i     am told you have treated some peoples characters with a     severity which the present times will not bear and may possibly     bring the author into much trouble which would be matter of     great uneasiness to his friends i know very well it is your     intention to do honour to the then treasurer lord oxford knows     it all his family and friends know it but it is to be done     with great circumspection it is now too late to publish a     pamphlet and too early to publish a history      it was always my opinion that the best way of doing honour to     the treasurer was to write a history of the peace of utrecht     beginning with a short preamble concerning the calamitous state     of our debt and ending with the breaking our army and     restoring the civil power that these great things were     completed under the administration of the earl of oxford and     this should be his epitaph lord bolingbroke is undoubtedly     writing a history but i believe will not live to finish it     because he takes it up too high viz from the restoration in     all probability hell cut and slash lord oxford this is only my     guess i dont know it      king must have taken the manuscript to lord oxford and lewis     and been present at its reading when that reading actually took     place is not ascertainable but there is no doubt that before     march 15th 1738 king was aware of the criticisms made on it     on that day he writes to mr deane swift explaining that he has     been obliged to defer the publication until he has received     swifts answers to the objections made by the friends who read     it on april 25th 1738 king wrote again to mr deane swift     regretting that he could not see him because i might have     talked over with you all the affair of this history about which     i have been much condemned and no wonder since the dean has     continually expressed his dissatisfaction that i have so long     delayed the publication of it however i have been in no fault     on the contrary i have consulted the deans honour and the     safety of his person in a word the publication of this work     as excellent as it is would involve the printer publisher     author and everyone concerned in the greatest difficulties if     not in a certain ruin and therefore it will be absolutely     necessary to omit some of the characters  from which we gather that lewis and the friends had been able to show king the extreme inadvisability of publishing the work swift knew nothing of this at the time but lewis did not long keep him in doubt and the letter lewis wrote swift on april 8th 1738 sets forth at length the objections and criticisms which had so changed kings attitude      london april 8 1738      i can now acquaint you my dear dean that i have at last had     the pleasure of reading your history in the presence of lord     od and two or three more who think in all political     matters just as you do and are as zealous for your fame and     safety as any persons in the world that part of it which     relates to the negotiations of peace whether at london or at     utrecht they admire exceedingly and declare they never yet saw     that or any other transaction drawn up with so much     perspicuity or in a style so entertaining and instructive to     the reader in every respect but i should be wanting to the     sincerity of a friend if i did not tell you plainly that it     was the unanimous opinion of the company a great deal of the     first part should be retrenched and many things altered      1st they conceive the first establishment of the south sea     company is not rightly stated for no part of the debt then     unprovided for was paid however the advantages arising to the     public were very considerable for instead of paying for all     provisions cent per cent dearer than the common marketprice     as we did in lord godolphins times the credit of the public     was immediately restored and by means of this scheme put upon     as good a footing as the best private security      2d they think the transactions with mr buys might have been     represented in a more advantageous light and more to the honour     of that administration and undoubtedly they would have been so     by your pen had you been master of all the facts      3d the d  of ms courage not to be called in question      4th the projected design of an assassination they believe     true but that a matter of so high a nature ought not to be     asserted without exhibiting the proofs      5th the present ministers who are the rump of those whose     characters you have painted shew too plainly that they have not     acted upon republican or indeed any other principles than     those of interest and ambition      6th now i have mentioned characters i must tell you they were     clearly of opinion that if those you have drawn should be     published as they now stand nothing could save the authors     printer and publishers from some grievous punishment as we have     no traces of liberty now left but the freedom of the press it     is the most earnest desire of your friends that you would strike     out all that you have said on that subject      thus my dear dean i have laid before you in a plain manner     the sentiments of those who were present when your history was     read if i have mistaken in anything i ask pardon of you and     them      i am not at liberty to name those who were present excepting     only the e  of od who has charged me to return you his     thanks for what you have said of his father      what i have to say from myself is that there were persons in     the company to whose judgment i should pay entire deference i     had no opportunity of paying any on this occasion for i     concurred in the same opinion with them from the bottom of my     heart and therefore conjure you as you value your own fame as     an author and the honour of those who were actors in the     important affairs that make the subject of your history and as     you would preserve the liberty of your person and enjoyment of     your fortune you will not suffer this work to go to the press     without making some or all the amendments proposed i am my     dear dean most sincerely and affectionately yours      el      i thank you for your kind mention of me in your letter to lord     oxford      i had almost forgot to tell you you have mistaken the case of     the d of s which in truth was this that his grace     appearing at court in the chamber next to the councilchamber     it was apprehended he would come into the cabinetcouncil and     therefore the intended meeting was put off whereas one would     judge by your manner of stating it that the council had met     and adjourned abruptly upon his taking his place there      i must add that if you would so far yield to the opinions of     your friends as to publish what you have writ concerning the     peace and leave out everything that savours of acrimony and     resentment it would even now be of great service to this     nation in general and to them in particular nothing having     been yet published on the peace of utrecht in such a beautiful     and strong manner as you have done it once more my dear dean     adieu let me hear from you  it is to be presumed that swift was again persuaded to abandon the publication of his history nothing further is heard of it except a slight reference by pope in a letter he wrote to swift under date may 17th 1739 in which pope informed him that bolingbroke who is writing his history of his own time has expressed his intention of differing from swifts version as he remembers it when he read the history in 1727 the variation would relate in particular to the conduct of the earl of oxford  slight as this reference is there is yet enough in it to suggest another reason why swift should withhold the publication of his work it might be that this expressed intention of bolingbrokes to animadvert on his dear friends conduct would just move swift to a final rejection of his intention and so possibly prevent bolingbroke from publishing his own statement however the manuscript must have been returned for nothing more was heard of it during swifts lifetime  swift died in 1745 and thirteen years later appeared the anonymously edited history of the four last years is this the work which swift wrote in 1713 which he permitted pope and bolingbroke to read in 1727 and which he prepared for publication in 1737  in 1758 there was no doubt whatever raised although there were at least two persons alive thenlord orrery and dr william kingwho could easily have proved any forgery had there been one  the first suspicion cast on the work came from dr johnson writing in his life of swift of the published version he remarks that it seemed by no means to correspond with the notions that i had formed of it from a conversation that i once heard between the earl of orrery and old mr lewis in what particulars this want of correspondence was made evident johnson does not say in any case his suspicion cannot be received with much consideration since the conversation he heard must have taken place at least twenty years before he wrote the poets life and his recollection of such a conversation must at least have been very hazy johnsons opinion is further deprived of weight when we read what he wrote of the history in the idler in 1759 the year after its publication that the history had perished had not a straggling transcript fallen into busy hands if the straggling manuscript were worth anything it must have had some claims to authenticity and if it had then johnsons recollection of what he heard orrery and lewis say twenty years or more after they had said it goes for very little  sir walter scott concludes from the fact that swift sent the manuscript to oxford and lewis that it was afterwards altered in accordance with lewiss suggestions but a comparison of lucass text with lewiss letter shows that nothing of the kind was done  lord stanhope had very great reason to doubt the authenticity of the history and considered it as falsely ascribed to swift what this very great reason was his lordship nowhere stated  macaulay in a pencilled note in a copy of orrerys remarks now in the british museum describes the history as wretched stuff and i firmly believe not swifts but macaulay could scarcely have had much ground for his note since he took a description of somers from the history and embodied it in his own work as a specimen of what somerss enemies said of him if the history were a forgery what object was gained in quoting from it and who were the enemies who wrote it  when in 1873 lord beaconsfield then mr disraeli made a speech at glasgow in which he quoted from the history and spoke of the words as by swift a correspondent in the times criticised him for his ignorance in so doing but the discussion which followed in the columns of that periodical left the matter just where it was and indeed justified beaconsfield the matter was taken up by mr edward solly in notes and queries but that writer threw no new light whatever on the subject  but the positive evidence in favour of the authenticity is so strong that one wonders how there could have been any doubt as to whether swift did or did not write the history  in the first place we know that swift was largely indebted for his facts to bolingbroke when that statesman was the war secretary of queen anne a comparison of those portions of swifts history which contain the facts with the bolingbroke correspondence in which the same facts are embodied will amply prove that swift obtained them from this source and as swift was the one man of the time to whom such a favour was given the argument in favour of swifts authorship obtains an added emphasis  in the second place a careful reading of the correspondence between swift and his friends on the subject of the publication of the history enables us to identify the references to the history itself the characters are there sir thomas hanmers representation is also there and all the points raised by erasmus lewis may be told off one by one  in the third place dr birch the careful collector had in 1742 access to what he considered to be the genuine manuscript this was three years before swifts death he made an abstract of this manuscript at the time and this abstract is now preserved in the british museum comparing the abstract with the edition published in 1758 there is no doubt that the learned doctor had copied from a manuscript which if it were not genuine was certainly the text of the work published in 1758 as the history of the four last years but dr birchs language suggests that he believed the manuscript he examined to be in swifts own handwriting if that be so there is no doubt whatever of the authenticity birch was a very careful person and had he had any doubts he could easily have settled them by applying to the many friends of the dean if not to the dean himself moreover it is absurd to believe that a forged manuscript of swifts would be shown about during swifts lifetime without it being known as a forgery mrs whiteway alone would have put a stop to its circulation had she suspected of the existence of such a manuscript  finally it must be remembered that when the history was published in 1758 lord orrery was still living if the work were a forgery why did not lord orrery expose it nothing would have pleased him more he had read the manuscript referred to in the correspondence he had carried it to oxford and given it to king at swifts request he knew all about it and he said nothing  these considerations both negative and positive lead us to the final conclusion that the history published in 1758 is practically the history referred to in swifts correspondence and therefore the authentic work of swift himself we say practically  because there are some differences between it and the text published here the differences have been recorded from a comparison between lucass version and the transcript of a manuscript discovered in dublin in 1857 and made by mr percy fitzgerald mr fitzgerald found that this manuscript contained many corrections in swifts own handwriting at the time he came across it the manuscript was in the possession of two old ladies named greene granddaughters of mrs whiteway and grandnieces of swift himself on the titlepage there was the following note  this is the originall manuscript of the history corrected by me and given into the custody of mrs martha whiteway by me jonathan swift june 15 1737 seven  i send a fair copy of this history by the earl of orrery to be printed in england  jonath swift  mr fitzgerald was permitted to make a collation of this manuscript and his collation he sent to the late john forster it is now in the victoria and albert museum south kensington2  footnote 2 i regret that i have been unable to trace the existence of this manuscript of swifts history mr fitzgerald himself has no recollection of having made the collation fortyfive years ago he writes is a long time to look back to and he cannot recall the fact  if this manuscript be what on the face of it it claims to be then the question of authenticity is for ever settled as we have no doubt on this point the corrections and variations between this manuscript as collated by mr percy fitzgerald and the lucas version have been noted in the present edition  in 1752 lord orrery issued his remarks on the life and character of swift the work obtained for him a certain notoriety and brought down upon him some severe censure from the friends of swift who were still alive but whatever may have been orrerys private opinion of swift that should not invalidate any information as to fact of which he had the knowledge to speak writing in that book of the history he says dr swift left behind him few manuscripts not one of any consequence except an account of the peace of utrecht which he called an history of the four last years of queen anne the title of an history is too pompous for such a performance in the historical style it wants dignity and candour but as a pamphlet it will appear the best defence of lord oxfords administration and the clearest account of the treaty of utrecht that has hitherto been written3  footnote 3 second edition pp 206207  the most ardent and devoted of swifts admirers could hardly find a juster criticism of the work it should satisfy any unprejudiced reader of the printed history as we now have it and to that extent emphasize the authenticity  an interesting sidelight on swifts history is thrown by chesterfield in a letter he wrote to dr chenevix bishop of waterford on may 23rd 1758 we must believe that the noble lord wrote in good faith and certainly in the full belief that the work he was criticising was the work of swift chesterfields criticism points directly to swift as the author since his justification for bolingbrokes story is to be found in the work as lucas printed it in 1758 speaking of the history chesterfield calls it a party pamphlet founded on the lie of the day which as lord bolingbroke who had read it often assured me was coined and delivered out to him to write examiners and other political papers upon that spirit remarkably runs through it macarteney for instance murdered duke hamilton4 nothing is falser for though macarteney was very capable of the vilest actions he was guiltless of that as i myself can testify who was at his trial on the kings bench when he came over voluntarily to take it in the late kings time there did not appear even the least ground for a suspicion of it nor did hamilton who appeared in court pretend to tax him with it which would have been in truth accusing himself of the utmost baseness in letting the murderer of his friend go off from the field of battle without either resentment pursuit or even accusation till three days afterwards this lie was invented to inflame the scotch nation against the whigs as the other that prince eugene intended to murder lord oxford by employing a set of people called mohocks which society by the way never existed was calculated to inflame the mob of london swift took those hints de la meilleure foi du monde and thought them materials for history so far he is blameless5  footnote 4 see page 178 of this volume  footnote 5 chesterfields works pp 498499  ignoring chesterfields indignation we must believe that the references made by him to macartney and eugene must have been in the manuscript bolingbroke read else how could bolingbroke tell chesterfield of their meaning if this be so we have a still further warrant for a strong presumption in favour of authenticity there can really be very little doubt on the matter  what we may doubt however is not the authenticity but the value of the history as an historical document without question swift wrote in good faith but he also wrote as a partisan and a partisan with an affectionate leaning for the principal character in the drama he was describing orrery was right when he called it a pamphlet and the best defence of lord oxfords administration as a pamphlet and as a defence it has some claim on our attention as a contribution to the history of the treaty of utrecht it is of little account swift could not had he even known everything write the true story of the negotiations for publication at the time in the first place he would never have attempted itthe facts would have been demoralizing and in the second place had he accomplished it its publication would have been a matter for much more serious consideration than was given even to the story he did write for swifts purpose it was much better that he did not know the full extent of the ministrys perfidy his affection for oxford and his admiration for bolingbroke would have received a great shock he knew their weaknesses of character though not their infidelity to honour there can be no defence of the oxford administration for the manner in which it separated england from its allies and treated with a monarch who was well known to it as a political chicaner the result brought a treaty by which louis xiv gained and the allies lost and this in spite of the offers previously made by the bankrupt monarch at gertruydenberg  the further contents of this volume deal with what might better be called swiftiana they include a collection of very interesting annotations made by swift in his copies of mackys characters clarendons history of the rebellion burnets history of his own time and addisons freeholder the notes to clarendon and burnet have always found an important place in the many editions of these wellknown works which have been issued from time to time as here reprinted however they have in all cases been compared with the originals themselves it will be found that very many additions have been made the result of careful comparison and collation with the originals in swifts handwriting  my obligations are again due to mr w spencer jackson for very valuable assistance in the collation of texts to mr george ravenscroft dennis for several important suggestions to mr percy fitzgerald for the use i have made of his transcriptions and to mr strickland of the national gallery of ireland for his help in the matter of swift portraits  i am greatly

who created such a stir in irish politics between the years 1743 and 1750 lord townshend in a letter to the marquis of granby called him the wilkes of ireland as an author he seems to have been very prolific though of no polish in his writings lucass disclaimers of sympathy with the opinions contained in the work he edited are somewhat overstated and his criticisms are petty a full account of this hotheaded physician may be found in the dictionary of national biography it was dr johnson in his life of swift who first published the information that lucas edited this history ts  thus the long wished for history of the four last years of the queens reign is at length brought to light in spite of all attempts to suppress it  as this publication is not made under the sanction of the name or names which the author and the world had a right to expect it is fit some account of the works appearing in this manner should be here given  long before the deans apparent decline some of his intimate friends with concern foresaw the impending fate of his fortune and his works to this it is owing that these sheets which the world now despaired of ever seeing are rescued from obscurity perhaps from destruction  for this the public is indebted to a gentleman now in ireland of the greatest probity and worth with whom the dean long lived in perfect intimacy to this gentlemans hands the dean entrusted a copy of his history desiring him to peruse and give his judgment of it with the last corrections and amendments the author had given it in his own hand  his friend read admired and approved and from a dread of so valuable and so interesting a works being by any accident lost or effaced as was probable by its not being intended to be published in the authors lifetime he resolved to keep this copy till the author should press him for it but with a determined purpose it should never see the light while there was any hopes of the authors own copy being published or even preserved  this resolution he inviolably kept till he and the world had full assurance that the deans executors or those into whose hands the original copy fell were so far from intending to publish it that it was actually suppressed perhaps destroyed  then he thought himself not only at liberty but judged it his duty to his departed friend and to the public to let this copy which he had now kept many years most secretly see the light  thus it has at length fallen into the hands of a person who publishes it for the satisfaction of the public abstracted from all private regards which are never to be permitted to come in competition with the common good  every judicious eye will see that the author of these sheets wrote with strong passions but with stronger prepossessions and prejudices in favour of a party these it may be imagined the editor in some measure may have adopted and published this work as a kind of support of that party or some surviving remnant thereof  it is but just to undeceive the reader and inform him from what kind of hand he has received this work a man may regard a good piece of painting while he despises the subject if the subject be ever so despicable the masterly strokes of the painter may demand our admiration while he in other respects is entitled to no portion of our regard  in poetry we carry our admiration still farther and like the poet while we actually contemn the man historians share the like fate hence some who have no regard to propriety or truth are yet admired for diction style manner and the like  the editor considers this work in another light he long knew the author and was no stranger to his politics connections tendencies passions and the whole economy of his life he has long been hardily singular in condemning this great mans conduct amid the admiring multitude nor ever could have thought of making an interest in a man whose principles and manners he could by no rule of reason or honour approve however he might have admired his parts and wit  such was judged the disposition of the man whose history of the most interesting period of time in the annals of britain are now herein offered to the reader he may well ask from what motives the answer is easily simply given  the causes assigned for delaying the publication of this history were principally these2 that the manuscript fell into the hands of men who whatever they might have been by the generality deemed were by the dean believed to be of his party though they did not after his death judge it prudent to avow his principles more than to deny them in his lifetime these men having got their beavers tobaccoboxes and other trifling remembrances of former friendship by the deans will did not choose publicly to avow principles that had marred their friends promotion and might probably put a stop to theirs therefore they gave the inquisitive world to understand that there was something too strong against many great men as well as the succeeding system of public affairs in general in the deans history of the four last years of the queens reign to admit of a publication in our times and with this poor insinuation excused themselves and satisfied the weakly wellaffected in suppressing the manifestation of displeasing truths of however great importance to society  footnote 2 the causes for the delay in the publication of the history are given at length by the present editor in the introduction ts  this manuscript has now fallen into the hands of a man who never could associate with or even approve any of the parties or factions that have differently distracted it might be said disgraced these kingdoms because he has as yet known none whose motives or rules of action were truth and the public good alone of one who judges that perjured magistrates of all denominations and their most exalted minions may be exposed deprived or cut off by the fundamental laws of his country and who upon these principles from his heart approves and glories in the virtues of his predecessors who revived the true spirit of the british polity in laying aside a priestridden an henpecked tyrannical tool who had overturned the political constitution of his country and in reinstituting the dissolved body politic by a revolution supported by the laws of nature and the realm as the only means of preserving the natural and legal the civil and religious liberties of the members of the commonwealth  truth in this mans estimation can hurt no good cause and falsehood and fraud in religion and politics are ever to be detected to be exploded  insinuations that this history contained something injurious to the present establishment and therefore necessary to be suppressed serve better the purposes of mistaken or insidious malcontents than the real publication can and if any thing were by this or any other history to be shown essentially erroneous in our politics who that calls himself a briton can be deemed such an impious slave as to conceal the destructive evil the editor of this work disdains and abhors the servile thought and wishes to live no longer than he dares to think speak write and in all things to act worthy of a briton  from this regard to truth and to his country the editor of this history was glad of an opportunity of rescuing such a writing from those who meant to suppress it the common cause in his estimation required and demanded it should be done and the sooner it is published he judged the better for if the conduct of the queen and her ministers does not deserve the obloquy that has been long industriously cast upon it what is more just than to vindicate it what more reasonable than that this should be done while living witnesses may yet be called to prove or disprove the several allegations and assertions since in a few years more such witnesses may be as much wanting as to prevent a canonization which is therefore prudently procrastinated for above an age let us then coolly hear what is to be said on this side the question and judge like britons  the editor would not be thought to justify the author of this history in all points or even to attempt to acquit him of unbecoming prejudices and partiality without being deeply versed in history or politics he can see his author in many instances blinded with passions that disgrace the historian and blending with phrases worthy of a caesar or a cicero expressions not to be justified by truth reason or common sense yet think him a most powerful orator and a great historian  no unprejudiced person will blame the dean for doing all that is consistent with truth and decency to vindicate the government of the queen and to exculpate the conduct of her ministers and her last general all good men would rejoice at such a vindication but if he meant no more than this his work would ill deserve the title of an history that he generally tells truths and founds his most material assertions upon fact will i think be found very evident but there is room to suspect that while he tells no more than the truth he does not tell the whole truth however he makes it very clear that the queens allies especially our worthy friends the dutch were much to blame for the now generally condemned conduct of the queen with regard to the prosecution of the war and the bringing about the peace  the authors drawings of characters are confessedly partial for he tells us openly he means not to give characters entire but such parts of each mans particular passions acquirements and habits as he was most likely to transfer into his political schemes what writing what sentence what character can stand this torturewhat extreme perversion may not let me say does not this produce yet thus does he choose to treat all men that were not favourers of the latest measures of the queen when the best that has been said for her shows no more than that she was blindfolded and held in leadingstrings by her ministers  he does not spare a man confessed by all the world to have discharged the duties of his function like a soldier like an hero but charges prince eugene with raising and keeping up a most horrible mob with intent to assassinate harley for all which odious charges he offers not one individual point of proof  he is not content with laying open again the many faults already publicly proved upon the late duke of marlborough but insinuates a new crime by seeming to attempt to acquit him of aspiring at the throne but this is done in a manner peculiar to this author  on the other hand he extols the ministers and minions of the queen in the highest terms and while he robs their antagonists of every good quality generally gives those wisdom and every virtue that can adorn human nature  he is not ashamed to attempt to justify what all thinking good men must condemn the queens making twelve peers at once to serve a particular turn  all these may be ascribed to the strength of his passions and to the prejudices early imbibed in favour of his indulgent royal mistress and her favourites and servants3 the judicious will look through the elegant clothing and dispassionately consider these as mere human errors to which no wellinformed mind can assent the editor thinks himself bound to protest against them  footnote 3 that swift should have a strong partiality to harley and st john by whom he was respected and trusted to a most uncommon degree is natural and obvious but upon what ground queen anne who disliked his person and obstructed his preferment is here termed his indulgent mistress the author of this preface ought to have condescended to explain s   he makes a few lapses on the other side without being as clear as an impartial historian would choose to appear he more than hints at the queens displeasure at its being moved in parliament that the prince elector should be invited to reside in england to whose crown he was by law declared presumptive heir but is always open upon the queens insisting on the pretenders being sent out of franceit is easy to see how incompatible these things appear nothing could tend more to secure the hanover succession and to enlarge its benefits to britain than the bringing over the successor who should in every country be well instructed in the language customs manners religion and laws of his future subjects before he comes to hold the reins of government and our author does not take the proper care to inform us how far the french thought fit to comply with banishing the pretender their dominions since many still live in doubt that if he was sent out of france he was sent into england  but there is one expression of our author too perverse too grossly abused to admit of any apology of any palliation it is not to be supposed that he was ignorant of any word in the english language and least of all can he be supposed ignorant of the meaning of a word which had it been ever so doubtful before had a certain meaning impressed upon it by the authority of parliament of which no sensible subject can be ignorant  notwithstanding this where our author speaks of the late king james he calls him the abdicated king and gives the same epithet even to his family though this weak illadvised and illfated prince in every sense of the word with romans and english and to all intents and purposes abdicated yet can he in no sense be called abdicated unless the peoples asserting their rights and defending themselves against a king who broke his compact with his subjects and overturned their government can be called abdication in them which no man in his senses can be hardy enough to support upon any principle of reason or the laws of england let the reader judge which this is most likely to be error or design  these exceptions the editor thought himself bound to make to some parts of this work to keep clear of the disagreeable imputations of being of a party of whatsoever denomination in opposition to truth and the rights and liberties of the subject  these laid aside the work will be found to have many beauties many excellencies some have of late affected to depreciate this history from an insinuation made only since the authors death to wit that he was never admitted into the secrets of the administration but made to believe he was a confident only to engage him in the list of the ministerial writers of that reign  the falsehood of this will readily appear upon perusal of the work this shows he knew the most secret springs of every movement in the whole complicated machine that he states facts too well known to be contested in elegant simplicity and reasons upon them with the talents of the greatest historian and thus makes an history composed rather of negotiations than actions most entertaining affecting and interesting instead of being as might be expected heavy dull and disagreeable  it is now fit to apologize for some errors which the judicious must discover upon a perusal of this work it is for this among other reasons much to be lamented that this history was not published under the authors own inspection it is next to impossible to copy or print any work without faults and most so where the authors eye is wanting  it is not to be imagined that even our author however accurate however great was yet strictly and perfectly correct in his writings yet where some seeming inaccuracies in style or expression have been discovered the deference due to the author made any alteration too presumptuous a task for the editor these are therefore left to the amending hand of every sensible and polite reader while the editor hopes it will suffice that he should point out some of those errors which are to be ascribed either to transcribers or the press and which may be rectified in the manner following in reading the work4  footnote 4 here follows list of errata these errors have been corrected in the present edition  and thus with these and perhaps some few such like corrections it is hoped this work will be found completely correct     the authors preface1  footnote 1 the time when it was written does not appear but it was probably many years after the queens death n first published in 1765 wsj   having written the following history at windsor in the happy reign of her majesty queen anne of ever glorious blessed and immortal memory i resolved to publish it for the satisfaction of my fellowsubjects in the year 1713 but being under a necessity of going to ireland to take possession of the deanery of st patricks dublin i left the original with the ministers and having stayed in that kingdom not above a fortnight i found at my return that my lord treasurer oxford and the secretary my lord bolingbroke who were then unhappily upon very ill terms with each other could not agree upon publishing it without some alterations which i would not submit to whereupon i kept it by me until her majestys death which happened about a year after  i have ever since preserved the original very safely too well knowing what a turn the world would take upon the german familys succeeding to the crown which indeed was their undoubted right having been established solemnly by the act of an undisputed parliament brought into the house of commons by mr harley who was then speaker  but as i have said in another discourse2 it was very well understood some years before her majestys death how the new king would act immediately upon his entrance in the choice of those and those alone whom he resolved to trust and consequently what reports would industriously be raised as well as spread to expose the proceedings of her majesty herself as well as of her servants who have been ever since blasted as enemies to the present establishment by the most ignorant and malicious among mankind  footnote 2 memoirs relating to the change in the queens ministry see vol v of present edition ts  therefore as it was my lot to have been daily conversant with the persons then in power never absent in times of business or conversation until a few weeks before her majestys death and a witness of almost every step they made in the course of their administration i must have been very unfortunate not to be better informed than those miserable pamphleteers or their patrons could pretend to at the same time i freely confess it appeared necessary as well as natural upon such a mighty change as the death of a sovereign that those who were to be in power upon the succession and resolved to act in every part by a direct contrary system of politics should load their predecessors with as much infamy as the most inveterate malice and envy could suggest or the most stupid ignorance and credulity in their underlings could swallow  therefore as i pretend to write with the utmost impartiality the following history of the four last years of her majestys reign in order to undeceive prejudiced persons at present as well as posterity i am persuaded in my own mind as likewise by the advice of my oldest and wisest friends that i am doing my duty to god and man by endeavouring to set future ages right in their judgment of that happy reign and as a faithful historian i cannot suffer falsehoods to run on any longer not only against all appearance of truth as well as probability but even against those happy events which owe their success to the very measures then fixed in the general peace  the materials for this history besides what i have already mentioned i mean the confidence reposed in me for those four years by the chief persons in power were extracted out of many hundred letters written by our ambassadors abroad and from the answers as well as instructions sent them by our secretaries of state or by the first minister the earl of oxford the former were all originals and the latter copies entered into books in the secretaries office out of both which i collected all that i thought convenient not to mention several memorials given me by the ministers at home further i was a constant witness and observer of all that passed and entered every particular of any consequence upon paper  i was so far from having any obligation to the crown that on the contrary her majesty issued a proclamation offering three hundred pounds to any person who would discover the author of a certain short treatise3 which the queen well knew to have been written by me i never received one shilling from the minister or any other present except that of a few books nor did i want their assistance to support me i very often dined indeed with the treasurer and secretary but in those days that was not reckoned a bribe whatever it may have been at any time since i absolutely refused to be chaplain to the lord treasurer because i thought it would ill become me to be in a state of dependence  footnote 3 the public spirit of the whigs ds  i say this to shew that i had no other bias than my own opinion of persons and affairs i preserved several of the opposite party in their employments who were persons of wit and learning particularly mr addison and mr congreve neither of whom were ever in any danger from the treasurer who much esteemed them both and by his lordships commands i brought the latter to dine with him mr steele might have been safe enough if his continually repeated indiscretions and a zeal mingled with scurrilities had not forfeited all title to lenity4  footnote 4 a full account of the severance of the friendly relations between swift and steele is given in the fifth volume of the present edition see pp 276282 ts  i know very well the numberless prejudices of weak and deceived people as well as the malice of those who to serve their own interest or ambition have cast off all religion morality justice and common decency however although perhaps i may not be believed in the present age yet i hope to be so in the next by all who will bear any regard for the honour and liberty of england if either of these shall then subsist or not  i have no interest or inclination to palliate the mistakes or omissions or want of steadiness or unhappy misunderstandings among a few of those who then presided in affairs  nothing is more common than the virulence of superficial and ill informed writers against the conduct of those who are now called prime ministers and since factions appear at present to be at a greater height than in any former times although perhaps not so equally poised it may probably concern those who are now in their height if they have any regard for their own memories in future ages to be less warm against others who humbly differ from them in some state opinions old persons remember at least by tradition the horrible prejudices that prevailed against the first earl of clarendon whose character as it now stands might be a pattern for all ministers although even bishop burnet of sarum whose principles veracity and manner of writing are so little esteemed upon many accounts hath been at the pains to vindicate him  upon that irreparable breach between the treasurer and secretary bolingbroke after my utmost endeavours for above two years to reconcile them i retired to a friend in berkshire where i stayed until her majestys death5 and then immediately returned to my station in dublin where i continued about twelve years without once seeing england i there often reviewed the following memoirs neither changing nor adding further than by correcting the style and if i have been guilty of any mistakes they must be of small moment for it was hardly possible i could be wrong informed with all the advantages i have already mentioned  footnote 5 see vol v of the present editionthe notes on pp 390 393394 420 421 and 426 ts  i shall not be very uneasy under the obloquy that may perhaps be cast upon me by the violent leaders and followers of the present prevailing party and yet i cannot find the least inconsistence with conscience or honour upon the death of so excellent a princess as her late majesty for a wise and good man to submit with a true and loyal heart to her lawful protestant successor whose hereditary title was confirmed by the queen and both houses of parliament with the greatest unanimity after it had been made an article in the treaty that every prince in our alliance should be a guarantee of that succession nay i will venture to go one step farther that if the negotiators of that peace had been chosen out of the most professed zealots for the interests of the hanover family they could not have bound up the french king or the hollanders more strictly than the queens plenipotentiaries did in confirming the present succession which was in them so much a greater mark of virtue and loyalty because they perfectly well knew that they should never receive the least mark of favour when the succession had taken place       the history of the four last   years of the queen  book i   i propose give the public an account of the most important affairs at home during the last session of parliament as well as of our negotiations of peace abroad not only during that period but some time before and since i shall relate the chief matters transacted by both houses in that session and discover the designs carried on by the heads of a discontented party1 not only against the ministry but in some manner against the crown itself i likewise shall state the debts of the nation show by what mismanagement and to serve what purposes they were at first contracted by what negligence or corruption they have so prodigiously grown and what methods have since been taken to provide not only for their payment but to prevent the like mischief for the time to come although in an age like ours i can expect very few impartial readers yet i shall strictly follow truth or what reasonably appeared to me to be such after the most impartial inquiries i could make and the best opportunities of being informed by those who were the principal actors or advisers2  footnote 1 p fitzgerald says faction wsj  footnote 2 swifts informants were of course harley and bolingbroke though the latter stated that swift was given only such information as served the ministrys purpose in the work they had given him for the examiner and the party pamphlets written in their defence it is however quite interesting in this connection to see how closely swifts narrative follows the published political correspondence of bolingbroke ts  neither shall i mingle panegyric or satire with an history intended to inform posterity as well as to instruct those of the present age who may be ignorant or misled since facts truly related are the best applauses or most lasting reproaches  discourses upon subjects relating to the public usually seem to be calculated for london only and some few miles about it while the authors suppose their readers to be informed of several particulars to which those that live remote are for the generality utter strangers most people who frequent this town acquire a sort of smattering such as it is which qualifies them for reading a pamphlet and finding out what is meant by innuendoes or hints at facts or persons and initial letters of names wherein gentlemen at a distance although perhaps of much better understandings are wholly in the dark wherefore that these memoirs may be rendered more generally intelligible and useful it will be convenient to give the reader a short view of the state and disposition of affairs when the last session of parliament began and because the partyleaders who had lost their power and places were upon that juncture employing all their engines in an attempt to reestablish themselves i shall venture one step further and represent so much of their characters as may be supposed to have influenced their politics  on the seventh day of december one thousand seven hundred and eleven began the second session of parliament it was now above a year since the queen had thought fit to put the great offices of state and of her own household into other hands however three of the discontented lords were still in possession of their places for the duke of marlborough continued general the duke of somerset master of the horse and the earl of cholmondeley treasurer of her majestys household3 likewise great numbers of the same party4 still kept employments of value and importance which had not been usual of late years upon any changes of ministry the queen who judged the temper of her people by this house of commons which a landed interest had freely chosen found them very desirous of a secure and honourable peace and disposed5 to leave the management of it to her own wisdom and that of her own council she had therefore several months before the session began sent to inform the states general of some overtures which had been made her by the enemy and during that summer her majesty took several farther steps in that great affair until at length after many difficulties a congress at utrecht for a general peace was agreed upon the whole proceedings of which previous negotiations between our court and that of france i shall in its proper place very particularly relate  footnote 3 see note on p 385 of vol v of present edition ts  footnote 4 p fitzgerald says the ejected party wsj  footnote 5 p fitzgerald adds as it was their duty wsj  the nation was already upon a better foot with respect to its debts for the earl of oxford lord treasurer had in the preceeding session proposed and effected ways and means in the house of commons where he was then a member for providing a parliamentary fund to clear the heavy arrear of ten millions whereof the greatest part lay upon the navy without any new burthen at least after a very few years to the kingdom and at the same time he took care to prevent farther incumbrances upon that article by finding ready money for naval provisions which has saved the public somewhat more than cent per cent in that mighty branch of our expenses  the clergy were altogether in the interests and the measures of the present ministry which had appeared so boldly in their defence during a prosecution against one of their members6 where the whole sacred order was understood to be concerned the zeal shown for that most religious bill to settle a fund for building fifty new churches in and about the city of london7 was a fresh obligation and they were farther highly gratified by her majestys choosing one of their body to be a great officer of state8  footnote 6 dr sacheverell n  footnote 7 a suggestion originally made by swift himself see vol iii p 45 of present edition ts  footnote 8 dr robinson lord bishop of bristol to be lord privy seal original note dr robinson who was appointed bishop of london in 1713 died in 1723 wsj  by this time likewise all disputes about these principles which used originally to divide whig and tory were wholly dropped and those fantastical words ought in justice to have been so too provided we could have found out more convenient names whereby to distinguish lovers of peace from lovers of war9 or those who would leave her majesty some degree of freedom in the choice of her ministers from others who could not be satisfied with her choosing any except such as she was most averse from but where a nation is once

for the principles of loyalty to the church and the preservation of the protestant succession in the house of hanover swift felt that the majority of the people at large were strong for these principles and the party that would openly accept them as its platform would he argued be the party that would obtain the peoples support had bollngbroke not delayed the publication of this tract it might have had great influence in keeping the tories in power see vol v of present edition pp 380 393 ts  as to the disposition of the opposite party we all remember that the removal of the last ministry was brought about by several degrees through which means it happened that they and their friends were hardly recovered out of one astonishment before they fell into another this scene lasted for some months and was followed by a period of rage and despair natural to those who reflect that they have lost a secure game by their own rashness folly and want of common management when at the same time they knew by experience that a watchful and dexterous adversary lay ready to take the advantage however some time before the session the heads of that party began to recollect themselves and rally their forces like an enemy who hath been beaten out of the field but finds he is not pursued for although the chiefs of this faction were thought to have but little esteem or friendship for each other yet they perfectly agreed in one general end of distressing by all possible methods the new administration wherein if they could succeed so far as to put the queen under any great necessity another parliament must be called and perhaps the power10 devolve again into their own hands  footnote 10 p fitzgerald says and the power naturally wsj  the issue and event of that grand confederacy appearing in both houses although under a different form upon the very first day the parliament met i cannot better begin the relation of affairs commencing from that period than by a thorough detection of the whole intrigue carried on with the greatest privacy and application which must be acknowledged to have for several days disconcerted some of the ministry as well as dispirited their friends and the consequences thereof which have in reality been so very pernicious to the kingdom  but because the principal leaders in this design are the same persons to whom since the loss of their power all the opposition has been owing which the court received either in treaties abroad or the administration at home it may not be improper to describe those qualities in each of them which few of their admirers will deny and which appear chiefly to have influenced them in acting their several parts upon the public stage for i do not intend to draw their characters entire which would be tedious and little to the purpose but shall only single out those passions acquirements and habits which the owners were most likely to transfer into their political schemes and which were most subservient to the designs they seemed to have in view  the lord somers11 may very deservedly be reputed the head and oracle of that party he hath raised himself by the concurrence of many circumstances to the greatest employments of the state without the least support from birth or fortune he hath constantly and with great steadiness cultivated those principles under which he grew that accident which first produced him into the world of pleading for the bishops whom king james had sent to the tower might have proved a piece of merit as honourable as it was fortunate but the old republican spirit which the revolution had restored began to teach other lessonsthat since we had accepted a new king from a calvinistical commonwealth we must also admit new maxims in religion and government but since the nobility and gentry would probably adhere to the established church and to the rights of monarchy as delivered down from their ancestors it was the practice of those politicians to introduce such men as were perfectly indifferent to any or no religion and who were not likely to inherit much loyalty from those to whom they owed their birth of this number was the person i am now describing i have hardly known any man with talents more proper to acquire and preserve the favour of a prince never offending in word or gesture in the highest degree courteous and complaisant wherein he set an excellent example to his colleagues which they did not think fit to follow but this extreme civility is universal and undistinguished and in private conversation where he observeth it as inviolably as if he were in the greatest assembly it is sometimes censured as formal two reasons are assigned for this behaviour first from the consciousness of his humble original12 he keepeth all familiarity at the utmost distance which otherwise might be apt to intrude the second that being sensible how subject he is to violent passions he avoideth all incitements to them by teaching those he converses with from his own example to keep a great way within the bounds of decency and respect and it is indeed true that no man is more apt to take fire upon the least appearance of provocation which temper he strives to subdue with the utmost violence upon himself so that his breast has been seen to heave and his eyes to sparkle with rage in those very moments when his words and the cadence of his voice were in the humblest and softest manner perhaps that force upon his nature may cause that insatiable love of revenge which his detractors lay to his charge who consequently reckon dissimulation among his chief perfections avarice he hath none and his ambition is gratified by being the uncontested head of his party with an excellent understanding adorned by all the polite parts of learning he hath very little taste for conversation to which he prefers the pleasure of reading and thinking and in the intervals of his time amuseth himself with an illiterate chaplain an humble companion or a favourite servant  footnote 11 see note on p 29 of vol i of present edition swifts dedication of a tale of a tub to somers strikes a somewhat different note from that of this character ts  footnote 12

he was against engaging in that foolish prosecution of dr sacheverell as what he foresaw was likely to end in their ruin that he blamed the rough demeanour of some persons to the queen as a great failure in prudence and that when it appeared her majesty was firmly resolved upon a treaty of peace he advised his friends not to oppose it in its progress but find fault with it after it was made which would be a copy of the like usage themselves had met with after the treaty of ryswick13 and the safest as well as the most probable way of disgracing the promoters and advisers i have been the larger in representing to the reader some idea of this extraordinary genius because whatever attempt hath hitherto been made with any appearance of conduct or probability of success to restore the dominion of that party14 was infallibly contrived by him and i prophesy the same for the future as long as his age and infirmities will leave him capable of business  footnote 13 see note in vol v p

have rendered26 problematical but if he be among those who delight in war it is agreed to be not for the reasons common with other generals those maligners who deny him personal valour seem not to consider that this accusation is charged at a venture since the person of a wise general is too seldom exposed to form any judgment in the matter and that fear which is said to have sometimes17 disconcerted him before an action might probably be more for his army than for himself18 he was bred in the height of what is called the tory principle and continued with a strong bias that way till the other party had bid higher for him than his friends could afford to give his want of literature is in some sort supplied by a good understanding a degree of natural elocution and that knowledge of the world which is learned in armies and courts we are not to take the height of his ambition from his soliciting to be general for life19 i am persuaded his chief motive was the pay and perquisites by continuing the war and that he had then no intentions of settling the crown in his family his only son having been dead some years before20 he is noted to be master of great temper able to govern or very well to disguise his passions which are all melted down or extinguished in his love of wealth that liberality which nature has denied him with respect of money he makes up by a great profusion of promises but this perfection so necessary in courts is not very successful in camps among soldiers who are not refined enough to understand or to relish it21  footnote 15 for further remarks on

hath risen gradually in four reigns and was much more constant to his second master king james than some others who had received much greater obligations for he attended the abdicated king to the seaside and kept constant correspondence with him till the day of his death he always professed a sort of passion for the queen at st germains and his letters were to her in the style of what the french call double entendre in a mixture of love and respect he used frequently to send her from hence little presents of those things which are agreeable to ladies for which he always asked king williams leave as if without her privity because if she had known that circumstance it was to be supposed she would not accept them physiognomists would hardly discover by consulting the aspect of this lord that his predominant passions were love and play that he could sometimes scratch out a song in praise of his mistress with a pencil and card or that he hath tears at command like a woman to be used either in an intrigue of gallantry or politics his alliance with the marlborough family and his passion for the duchess were the cords which dragged him into a party whose principles he naturally disliked and whose leaders he personally hated as they did him he became a thorough convert by a perfect trifle taking fire at a nickname26 delivered by dr sacheverell with great

lineaments imperfectly drawn that erasmus lewis specially emphasized for omission in his letter to swift already referred to now i have mentioned characters wrote lewis i must tell you that they the

could be secure for britain while spain or the west indies remained in the possession of the bourbon family but her majesty having for reasons which have been often told to the world and which will not soon be forgotten called a new parliament and chose a new set of servants began to view things and persons in another light she considered the necessities of her people the distant prospect of a peace upon such an improbable condition which was never mentioned or understood in the grand alliance the unequal burthen she bore in the war by the practices of the allies upon the corruption of some whom she most trusted or perhaps by the practices of these upon the allies and lastly by the changes which death had brought about in the austrian and bourbon families upon all which motives she was prevailed upon to receive some overtures from france in behalf of herself and the whole confederacy the several steps of this negotiation from its first rise to the time i am now writing shall be related in another part of this history let it suffice for the present to say that such proposals were received from france as were thought sufficient by our court whereupon to appoint time and place for a general treaty and soon after the opening of the session the bishop48 of bristol lord privy seal was dispatched to utrecht where he and the earl of strafford were appointed plenipotentiaries for the queen of great britain  footnote 48 dr robinson afterwards bishop of london original note  the managers of the discontented party who during the whole summer had observed the motions of the court running fast towards a peace began to gather up all their forces in order to oppose her majestys designs when the parliament should meet their only strength was in the house of lords where the queen had a very crazy majority made up by those whose hearts were in the other interest but whose fears expectations or immediate dependence had hitherto kept them within bounds there were two lords upon whose abilities and influence of a very different nature the managers built their strongest hopes the first was the duke of somerset master of the horse this duke as well as his duchess was in a good degree of favour with the queen upon the score of some civilities and respects her majesty had received from them while she was princess49 for some years after the revolution he never appeared at court but was looked upon as a favourer of the abdicated family and it was the late earl of rochester who first presented him to king william however since the time he came into employment which was towards the close of the last reign he hath been a constant zealous member of the other party but never failed in either attendance or respect towards the queens person or at most only threatened sometimes that he would serve no longer while such or such men were employed which as things went then was not reckoned any offence at all against duty or good behaviour he had been much caressed and flattered by the lords of the junto50 who sometimes went so far as to give him hopes of the crown in reversion to his family upon failure of the house of hanover all this worked so far upon his imagination that he affected to appear the head of their party to which his talents were no way proportioned for they soon grew weary of his indigested schemes and his imperious manner of obtruding them they began to drop him at their meetings or contradicted him with little ceremony when he happened to be there which his haughty nature51 was not able to brook thus a mortal quarrel was kindled between him and the whole assembly of party leaders so that upon the queens first intentions of changing her ministry soon after the trial of dr sacheverell he appointed several meetings with mr harley alone in the most private manner in places and at times least liable to suspicion he employed all his credit with the queen to drive on the removal of my lord godolphin and the rest and in the council treated the small remainder who continued some time longer in their places with all possible marks of hatred or disdain but when the question came for dissolving the parliament he stopped short he had already satiated his resentments which were not against things but persons he furiously opposed that counsel and promised to undertake for the parliament himself when the queen had declared her pleasure for the dissolution he flew off in greater rage than ever opposed the court in all elections where he had influence or power and made very humble52 advances to reconcile himself with the discarded lords especially the earl of godolphin who is reported to have treated him at newmarket in a most contemptuous manner but the sincerity of his repentance which appeared manifestly in the first session of the new parliament and the use he might be of by his own remaining credit or rather that of his duchess with the queen at length begat a reconcilement he still kept his employment and place in the cabinet council but had never appeared there from an avowed dislike of all persons and proceedings it happened about the end of summer one thousand seven hundred and eleven at windsor when the cabinet council was summoned this duke whether by directions from his teachers or the instability of his nature took a fancy to resume his place and a chair was brought accordingly upon which mr secretary st john refused to assist and gave his reasons that he would never sit in council with a man who had so often betrayed them and was openly engaged with a faction which endeavoured to obstruct all her majestys measures thus the council was put off to next day and the duke made no farther attempts to be there53 but upon this incident he declared open war against the ministry and from that time to the session employed himself in spiriting up several depending lords to adhere to their friends when an occasion should offer the arguments he made use of were that those in power designed to make an ignominious and insecure peace without consulting the allies that this could be no otherwise prevented than by an address from the lords to signify their opinion that no peace could be honourable or secure while spain or the west indies remained in any of the bourbon family54 upon which several farther resolutions and inquiries would naturally follow that the differences between the two houses upon this point must either be made up by the commons agreeing with the lords or must end in a dissolution which would be followed by a return of the old ministry who by the force of money and management could easily get another parliament to their wishes he farther assured them boldly that the queen herself was at the bottom of this design and had empowered him to desire their votes against the peace as a point that would be for her service and therefore they need not be in pain upon account of their pensions or any farther marks of favour they expected thus by reviving the old art of using her majestys authority against her person he prevailed over some who were not otherwise in a station of life to oppose the crown and his proselytes may pretend to some share of pity since he offered for an argument his own example who kept his place and favour after all he had done to deserve the loss of both  footnote 49 in 1692 on a difference which the

mentioned than whom no man ever appeared to hate them more or to be more pleased at their fall partly from his avowed principles but chiefly from the hopes he had of sharing in their spoils but it fell out that he was no way acceptable to the queen or her new servants these apprehended no little trouble and impediment to the public business from his restless talkative overweening manner if once he was suffered to have any part in affairs and he stood very ill with the court having made a motion in the house of lords and in her majestys presence that the electoral prince of hanover might be invited to reside in england although he had before declared to the queen how much he was against that proposal when it was first offered by the other party however some very considerable employments had been given to his nearest relations and he had one or two offers for himself which he thought fit to refuse as not equal to his merits and character upon the earl of rochesters decease he conceived that the crown would hardly overlook him for president of the council and deeply resented that disappointment but the duke of newcastle lord privy seal dying some time after he found that office was first designed for the earl of jersey and upon this lords sudden death was actually disposed of to the bishop of bristol by which he plainly saw that the queen was determined against giving him any opportunity of directing in affairs or displaying his eloquence in the cabinet council he had now shaken off all remains of patience or temper and from the contemplation of his own disappointments fell as it is natural to find fault with the public management and to assure his neighbours in the country that the nation was in imminent danger of being ruined the discontented55 lords were soon apprised of this great change and the duke of roxburgh56 the earls soninlaw was dispatched to burleigh on the hill to cultivate his present dispositions and offer him whatever terms he pleased to insist on the earl immediately agreed to fall in with any measures for distressing or destroying the ministry but in order to preserve his reputation with the church party and perhaps bring them over to his interests he proposed that a bill should be brought into the house of lords for preventing occasional conformity and be unanimously agreed to by all the peers of the lowchurch57

indeed taken by which it was computed that there would be a majority of ten upon the side of the court i remember to have told my lord harcourt and mr prior that a majority of ten was only a majority of five because if their adversaries could bring off five the number would be equal and so it happened to prove for the mistake lay in counting upon the bare promises of those who were wholly in the interest of the old ministry and were only kept in awe by the fear of offending the crown and losing their subsistence wherein the duke of somerset had given them full satisfaction  with these dispositions of both parties and fears and hopes of the event the parliament met upon the seventh of december one thousand seven hundred and eleven the queens speech excepting what related to supplies was chiefly taken up in telling both houses what progress she had made towards a general peace and her hopes of bringing it to a speedy conclusion as soon as her majesty was withdrawn the house of lords in a committee resolved upon an address of thanks to which the earl of nottingham proposed an addition of the following clause  and we do beg leave to represent it to your majesty as the humble opinion and advice of this house that no peace can be safe or honourable to great britain and europe if spain and the west indies are to be allotted to any branch of the house of bourbon  he was seconded by the earl of scarborough and after a debate of several hours the question for the clause was carried as i remember by not above two voices60 the next day the house agreed with the committee the depending lords having taken fresh courage from their principals and some who professed themselves very humble servants to the present ministry and enemies to the former went along with the stream pretending not to see the consequences that must visibly follow the address was presented on the eleventh to which her majestys answer was short and dry she distinguished their thanks from the rest of the piece and in return to lord nottinghams clause said she should be sorry that any body could think she would not do her utmost to recover spain and the west indies from the house of bourbon

very great majority their address was in the most dutiful manner approving of what her majesty had done towards a peace and trusting entirely to her wisdom in the future management of it this address was presented to the queen a day before that of the lords and received an answer distinguishedly gracious but the other party61 was no ways discouraged by either answer which they looked upon as only matter of course and the sense of the ministry contrary to that of the queen  footnote 61 p fitzgerald says faction wsj  the parliament sat as long as the approaching festival would allow and upon the twentysecond the landtax and occasional bills having received the royal assent the house of commons adjourned to the fourteenth of january following but the adjournment of the lords was only to the second the prevailing party there being in haste to pursue the consequences of the earl of nottinghams clause which they hoped would end in the ruin of the treasurer and overthrow the ministry and therefore took the advantage of this interval that they might not be disturbed by the commons  when this address against any peace without spain c was carried in the house of lords it is not easy to describe the effects it had upon most mens passions the partisans of the old ministry triumphed loudly and without any reserve as if the game were their own the earl of wharton was observed in the house to smile and put his hands to his neck when any of the ministry was speaking by which he would have it understood that some heads were in danger parker the chief justice began already with great zeal and officiousness to prosecute authors and printers of weekly and other papers writ in defence of the administration in short joy and vengeance sat visible in every countenance of that party62  footnote 62 see journal to stella december 13th vol ii p 299 of present edition wsj  on the other side all wellwishers to the queen the church or the peace were equally dejected and the treasurer stood the foremost mark both of his enemies fury and the censure of his friends among the latter some imputed this fatal miscarriage to his procrastinating nature others to his unmeasurable public thrift both parties agreed that a first minister with very moderate skill in affairs might easily have governed the event and some began to doubt whether the great fame of his abilities acquired in other stations were what he justly deserved all this he knew well enough and heard it with great phlegm neither did it make any alteration in his countenance or humour he told monsieur buys the dutch envoy two days before the parliament sat that he was sorry for what was like to pass because the states would be the first sufferers which he desired the envoy to remember and to his nearest friends who appeared in pain about the public or themselves he only said that all would be well and desired them not to be frighted63  footnote 63 see swifts account of an interview with the lord treasurer in his journal to stella december 8th ibid p 296 wsj  it was i conceive upon these motives that the treasurer advised her majesty to create twelve new lords64 and thereby disable the sting of faction for the rest of her lifetime this promotion was so ordered that a third part were of those on whom or their posterity the peerage would naturally devolve and the rest were such whose merit birth and fortune could admit of no exception  footnote 64 see note vol ii p 308 and note vol v p 446 wsj  the adverse party being thus driven down by open force had nothing left but to complain which they loudly did that it was a pernicious65 example set for ill princes to follow who by the same rule might make at any time an hundred as well as twelve and by these means become masters of the house of lords whenever they pleased which would be dangerous to our liberties to this it was answered that ill princes seldom trouble themselves to look for precedents that men of great estates will not be less fond of preserving their liberties when they are created peers that in such a government as this where the prince holds the balance between two great powers the nobility and people it is the very nature of his office to remove from one scale into the other or sometimes put his own weight in the lightest so as to bring both to an equilibrium and lastly that the other party had been above twenty years corrupting the nobility with republican principles which nothing but the royal prerogative could hinder from overspreading us  footnote 65 p fitzgerald says dangerous wsj  the conformity bill above mentioned was prepared by the earl of nottingham before the parliament met and brought in at the same time with the clause against peace according to the bargain made between him and his new friends this he hoped would not only save his credit with the church party but bring them over to his politics since they must needs be convinced that instead of changing his own principles he had prevailed on the greatest enemies to the established religion to be the first movers in a law for the perpetual settlement of it here it was worth observing with what resignation the junto lords as they were then called were submitted to by their adherents and followers for it is well known that the chief among the dissenting teachers in town were consulted upon this affair and such arguments used as had power to convince them that nothing could be of greater advantage to their cause than the passing this bill i did indeed see a letter at that time from one of them to a great66 man complaining that they were betrayed and undone by their pretended friends but they were in general very well satisfied upon promises that this law should soon be repealed and others more in their favour enacted as soon as their friends should be reestablished  footnote 66 it was to the treasurer himself original note scott says that it was written by mr shower on december 20th and that the writer complained that the dissenters had been shamefully abandoned sold and sacrificed by their professed friends wsj  but nothing seemed more extraordinary than the event of this refined management by which the earl of nottingham was so far from bringing over proselytes wherein his abilities fell very short even of the duke of somersets or preserving the reputation of a firm churchman that very few people did so much as imagine he had any such design only when he brought in the bill they conceived it was some wonderful deep reach of politics which they could not comprehend however they liked the thing and without troubling themselves about the persons or motives from whence it rose it had a very speedy passage through both houses it must be confessed that some attempt of this nature was much more necessary to the leaders of that party than is generally thought the desire of power and revenge was common to them all but several among them were also conscious that they stood in need of protection whose safety was therefore concerned in the design of ruining the ministry as well as their ambition the duke of marlborough foresaw those examinations which were afterwards made into some parts of his management and was apprehensive of a great deal more that the parliament would perhaps enquire into the particulars of the negotiation at the hague in one thousand seven hundred and nine for what ends and by whose advice the propositions of peace from france were rejected besides he dreaded lest that mysterious policy might be laid open to the world of desiring the queen to constitute him general for life which was a very tender point and would admit of much proof it is true indeed that whilst the dukes affair was under the consideration of the house of commons one of his creatures67 whether by direction or otherwise assured the speaker with a very serious countenance that the world was mistaken in censuring his lord upon this article for it was the queen who pressed the duke to accept that commission and upon his humble refusal conceived her first displeasure against him how such a defence would have passed if it had been offered in form is easier to be conceived than how any person in his wits could have the confidence to affirm it which last it would indeed be hard to believe if there were any room left for doubt  footnote 67 craggs father to the secretary original note  the earl of godolphin wanted protection notwithstanding the act of general pardon which had been procured by his credit and was principally calculated for his own security he knew that his long neglect of compelling the accomptants to pass their accompts might be punished as a breach of trust he had run the kingdom into immense debts by taking up stores for the navy upon a vast discount without parliamentary security for which he could be able to plead neither law nor necessity and he had given way at least to some proceedings not very justifiable in relation to remittances of money whereby the public had suffered considerable losses the barrier treaty sat heavy upon the lord townshends spirits because if it should be laid before the house of commons whoever negotiated that affair might be subject to the most severe animadversions and the earl of whartons administration in ireland was looked upon as a sufficient ground to impeach him at least for high crimes and misdemeanours  the managers in holland were sufficiently apprised of all this and monsieur buys their minister here took care to cultivate that good correspondence between his masters and their english friends which became two confederates pursuing the same end  this man68 had been formerly employed in england from that republic and understood a little of our language his proficiency in learning has been such as to furnish now and then a latin quotation of which he is as liberal as his stock will admit his knowledge in government reaches no farther than that of his own country by which he forms and cultivates matters of state for the rest of the world his reasonings upon politics are with great profusion at all meetings and he leaves the company with entire satisfaction that he hath fully convinced them he is well provided with that inferior sort of cunning which is the growth of his country of a standard with the genius of the people and capable of being transferred into every condition of life among them from the boor to the burgomaster he came into england with instructions authorizing him to accommodate all differences between her majesty and the states but having first advised with the confederate lords he assured the ministry he had powers to hear their proposals but none to conclude and having represented to his masters what had been told him by the adverse party he prevailed with them to revoke his powers he found the interest of those who withstood the court would exactly fall in with the designs of the states which were to carry on the war as they could at our expense and to see themselves at the head of a treaty of peace whenever they were disposed to apply to france or to receive overtures from thence69  footnote 68 p fitzgerald says gentleman wsj  footnote 69  erasmus lewis in the letter already cited refers to buys and gives the opinion of the gentlemen who had read the history on this matter as follows they think the transactions with mr buys might have been represented in a more advantageous light and more to the honour of that administration and undoubtedly they would have been so by your pen had you been master of all the facts and yet the facts as related by swift in this and the last book of this history are substantially the facts as disclosed in bolingbrokes political correspondence ts  the emperor upon many powerful reasons was utterly averse from all counsels which aimed at putting an end to the war without delivering him the whole dominion of spain nay the elector of hanover himself although presumptive heir to the crown of england and obliged by all sorts of ties to cultivate her majestys friendship was so far deceived by misrepresentations from hence that he seemed to suffer monsieur bothmar his envoy here to print and publish a memorial in english directly disapproving all her majestys proceedings which memorial as appeareth by the style and manner of it was all drawn up or at least digested by some party pen on this side of the water70  footnote 70 see swifts some free thoughts upon the present state of affairs and the note on p 410 of vol v of present edition ts  cautious writers in order to avoid offence or danger and to preserve the respect even71 due to foreign princes do usually charge the wrong steps in a court altogether upon the persons employed but i should have taken a securer method and have been wholly silent in this point if i had not then conceived some hope that his electoral highness might possibly have been a stranger72 to the memorial of his resident for first the manner of delivering it to the secretary of state was out of all form and almost as extraordinary as the thing itself monsieur bothmar having obtained an hour of mr secretary st john talked much to him upon the subject of which that memorial consists and upon going away desired he might leave a paper with the secretary which he said contained the substance of what he had been discoursing this paper mr st john laid aside among others of little consequence and a few days73 saw a memorial in print74 which he found upon comparing to be the same with what bothmar had left

28th of nov9th of dec 1711 wsj  during this short recess of parliament and upon the fifth day of january prince eugene of savoy landed in england before he left his ship he asked a person who came to meet him whether the new lords were made and what was their number he was attended through the streets with a mighty rabble of people to st jamess where mr secretary st john introduced him to the queen who received him with great civility his arrival had been long expected and the project of his journey had as long been formed here by the party leaders in concert with monsieur buys and monsieur bothmar the dutch and hanover envoys this prince brought over credentials from the emperor with offers to continue the war upon a new foot very advantageous to britain part of which by her majestys commands mr st john soon after produced to the house of commons where they were rejected not without some indignation by a great majority the emperors proposals as far as they related to spain were communicated to the house in the words following  his imperial majesty judges that forty thousand men will be sufficient for this service and that the whole expense of the war in spain may amount to four millions of crowns towards which his imperial majesty offers to make up the troops which he has in that country to thirty thousand men and to take one million of crowns upon himself  on the other side the house of commons voted a third part of those four millions as a sufficient quota for her majesty toward that service for it was supposed the emperor ought to bear the greatest proportion in a point that so nearly concerned him or at least that britain contributing one third the other two might be paid by his imperial majesty and the states as they could settle it between them  the design of prince eugenes journey was to raise a spirit in the parliament and people for continuing the war for nothing was thought impossible to a prince of such high reputation in arms in great favour with the emperor and empowered to make such proposals from his master as the ministry durst not reject it appeared by an intercepted letter from count gallas formerly the emperors envoy here that the prince was wholly left to his liberty of making what offers he pleased in the emperors name for if the parliament could once be brought to raise funds and the war go on the ministry here must be under a necessity of applying and expending those funds and the emperor could afterwards find twenty reasons and excuses as he had hitherto done for not furnishing his quota therefore prince eugene for some time kept himself within generals until being pressed to explain himself upon that particular of the war in spain which the house of austria pretended to have most at heart he made the offer above mentioned as a most extraordinary effort and so it was considering how little they had ever done before towards recovering that monarchy to themselves but shameful as these proposals were few believed the emperor would observe them or indeed that he ever intended to spare so many men as would make up an army of thirty thousand men to be employed in spain  prince eugenes visit to his friends in england continued longer than was expected he was every day entertained magnificently by persons of quality of both parties he went frequently to the treasurer and sometimes affected to do it in private he visited the other ministers and great officers of the court but on all occasions publicly owned the character and appellation of a whig and in secret held continual meetings with the duke of marlborough and the other discontented lords where m bothmar usually assisted it is the great ambition of this prince to be perpetually engaged in war without considering the cause or consequence and to see himself at the head of an army where only he can make any considerable figure he is not without a natural tincture of that cruelty sometimes charged upon the italians and being nursed in arms hath so far extinguished pity and remorse that he will at any time sacrifice a thousand mens lives to a caprice of glory or revenge he had conceived an incurable hatred for the treasurer as the person who principally opposed this insatiable passion for war said he had hopes of others but that the treasurer was un méchant diable not to be moved therefore since it was impossible for him or his friends to compass their designs while that minister continued at the head of affairs he proposed an expedient often practised by those of his country that the treasurer to use his own expression should be taken off à la négligence that this might easily be done and pass for an effect of chance if it were preceded by encouraging some proper people to commit small riots in the night and in several parts of the town a crew of obscure ruffians were accordingly employed about that time who probably exceeded their commission and mixing themselves with those disorderly people that often infest the streets at midnight acted inhuman outrages on many persons whom they cut and mangled in the face and arms and other parts of the body without any provocation but an effectual stop was soon put to these enormities which probably prevented the execution of the main design75  footnote 75 erasmus lewis lord oxford and the others who read the ms advised the elimination of this insinuation against prince eugene they thought there was truth in it but a matter of so high a nature as lewis expressed it to swift ought not to be asserted without exhibiting  the proofs the paragraph following the one in the text containing the imputation seems as if it had been written after swift had received lewiss strictures ts  i am very sensible that such an imputation ought not to be charged upon any person whatsoever upon slight grounds or doubtful surmises and that those who think i am able to produce no better will judge this passage to be fitter for a libel than a history but as the account was given by more than one person who was at the meeting so it was confirmed past all contradiction by several intercepted letters and papers and it is most certain that the rage of the defeated party upon their frequent disappointments was so far inflamed as to make them capable of some counsels yet more violent and desperate than this which however by the vigilance of those near the person of her majesty were happily prevented  on the thirtieth day of december one thousand seven hundred and eleven the duke of marlborough was removed from all his employments the duke of ormonde succeeding him as general both here and in flanders this proceeding of the court as far as it related to the duke of marlborough was much censured both at home and abroad and by some who did not wish ill to the present situation of affairs there were few examples of a commander being disgraced after an uninterrupted course of success for many years against a formidable enemy and this before a period was put to the war those who had least esteem for his valour and conduct thought it not prudent to remove a general whose troops were perpetually victorious while he was at their head because this had infused into his soldiers an opinion that they should always conquer and into the enemy that they should always be beaten than which nothing is to be held of greater moment either in the progress of a war or upon the day of battle and i have good grounds to affirm that these reasons had sufficient weight with the queen and ministry to have kept the duke of marlborough in his post if a way could have been found out to have done it with any assurance of safety to the nation it is the misfortune of princes that the effects of their displeasure make usually much more noise than the causes thus the sound of the dukes fall was heard farther than many of the reasons which made it necessary whereof though some were visible enough yet others lay more in the dark upon the dukes last return from flanders he had fixed his arrival to town whether by accident or otherwise upon the seventeenth of november called queen elizabeths day when great numbers of his creatures and admirers had thought fit to revive an old ceremony among the rabble of burning the pope in effigy for the performance of which with more solemnity they had made extraordinary preparations76 from the several circumstances of the expense of this intended pageantry and of the persons who promoted it the court apprehensive of a design to inflame the common people thought fit to order that the several figures should be seized as popish trinkets and guards were ordered to patrol for preventing any tumultuous assemblies whether this frolic were only intended for an affront to the court or whether it had a deeper meaning i must leave undetermined the duke in his own nature is not much turned to be popular and in his flourishing times whenever he came back to england upon the close of a campaign he rather affected to avoid any concourse of the mobile if they had been disposed to attend him therefore so very contrary a proceeding at this juncture made it suspected as if he had a design to have placed himself at their head france popery the pretender peace without spain were the words to be given about at this mock parade and if what was confidently asserted be true that a report was to have been spread at the same time of the queens death no man can tell what might have been the event  footnote 76 see swifts journal to stella letter xxxv vol ii pp 28384 and a true relation of the intended riot printed in scotts edition vol v pp 399413 wsj  the burning of a pope in effigy notes scottin his reprint of what swift called the grub street account of the tumultupon the 17th november the anniversary of queen elizabeths coronation was a favourite pastime with the mob of london and often employed by their superiors as a means of working upon their passions and prejudices a full account of this ceremony is given in his edition of drydens works 1808 vol vi p 222 an account of the attempt to revive an old ceremony referred to by swift was published also in the post boy for november 20th 1711 ts  but this attempt to whatever purposes intended proving wholly abortive by the vigilance of those in power the dukes arrival was without any noise or consequence and upon consulting with his friends he soon fell in with their new scheme for preventing the peace it was believed by many persons that the ministers might with little difficulty have brought him over if they had pleased to make a trial for as he would probably have accepted any terms to continue in a station of such prodigious77 profit so there was sufficient room to work upon his fears of which he is seldom unprovided78 i mean only in his political capacity and his infirmity very much increased by his unmeasurable possessions which have rendered him ipsique79 onerique timentem but reason as well as the event proved this to be a mistake for the ministers being determined to bring the war to as speedy an issue as the honour and safety of their country would permit could not possibly recompense the duke for the mighty incomes he held by the continuance of it then the other party had calculated their numbers and by the accession of the earl of nottingham whose example they hoped would have many followers and the successful solicitations of the duke of somerset found they were sure of a majority in the house of lords so that in this view of circumstances the duke of marlborough thought he acted with security as well as advantage he therefore boldly fell with his whole weight into the design of ruining the ministry at the expense of his duty to his sovereign and the welfare of his country after the mighty obligations he had received from both whig and tory were now no longer the dispute but the queen or the duke of marlborough he was at the head of all the cabals and consults with bothmar buys and the discontented lords he forgot that government of his passion for which his admirers used to celebrate him fell into all the impotencies of anger and violence upon every party debate so that the queen found herself under a necessity either on the one side to sacrifice those friends who had ventured their lives in rescuing her out of the power of some whose former treatment she had little reason to be fond of to put an end80 to the progress she had made towards a peace and dissolve her parliament or on the other side by removing one person from so great a trust to get clear of all her difficulties at once her majesty therefore determined upon the latter as the shorter and safer course and during the recess at christmas sent the duke a letter to tell him she had no farther occasion for his service81  footnote 77 p fitzgerald says immense wsj  footnote 78 p fitzgerald adds being in his nature the most timorous person alive wsj

which is not founded upon virtue and it may be an instruction to princes who are well in the hearts of their people that the overgrown power of any particular person although supported by exorbitant wealth can by a little resolution be reduced in a moment without any dangerous consequences this lord who was beyond all comparison the greatest subject in christendom found his power credit and

fourteenth of january the two houses met but the queen who intended to be there in person sent a message to inform them that she was prevented by a sudden return of the gout and to desire they would adjourn for three days longer when her majesty hoped she should be able to speak to them however her indisposition still continuing mr secretary st john brought another message to the house of commons from the queen containing the substance of what she intended to have spoken that she could now tell them her plenipotentiaries were arrived at utrecht had begun in pursuance of her instructions to concert the most proper ways of procuring a just satisfaction to all powers in alliance with her according to their several treaties and particularly with relation to spain and the west indies that she promised to communicate to them the conditions of peace before the same should be concluded that the world would now see how groundless those reports were and without the least colour that a separate peace had been treated that her ministers were directed to propose that a day might be fixed for the finishing as was done for the commencement of this treaty and that in the mean time all preparations were hastening for an early campaign etc  her majestys endeavours towards this great work having been in such a forwardness at the time that her message was sent i shall here as in the most proper place relate the several steps by which the intercourse between the courts of france and britain was begun and carried on  the marquis de torcy1 sent by the most christian king to the hague had there in the year one thousand seven hundred and nine made very advantageous offers to the allies in his masters name which our ministers as well as those of the states thought fit to refuse and advanced other proposals in their stead but of such a nature as no prince could digest who did not lie at the immediate mercy of his enemies it was demanded among other things that the french king should employ his own troops in conjunction with those of the allies to drive his grandson out of spain the proposers knew very well that the enemy would never consent to this and if it were possible they could at first have any such hopes mons de torcy assured them to the contrary in a manner which might well be believed for then the british and dutch plenipotentiaries were drawing up their demands they desired that minister to assist them in the style and expression which he very readily did and made use of the strongest words he could find to please them he then insisted to know their last resolution whether these were the lowest terms the allies would accept and having received a determinate answer in the affirmative he spoke to this effect  footnote 1 jean baptiste colbert 16651746 marquis de torcy was nephew of the celebrated colbert wsj  that he thanked them heartily for giving him the happiest day he had ever seen in his life that in perfect obedience to his master he had made concessions in his own opinion highly derogatory to the kings honour and interest that he had not concealed the difficulties of his court or the discontents of his country by a long and unsuccessful war which could only justify the large offers he had been empowered to make that the conditions of peace now delivered into his hands by the allies would raise a new spirit in the nation and remove the greatest difficulty the court lay under putting it in his masters power to convince all his subjects how earnestly his majesty desired to ease them from the burthen of the war but that his enemies would not accept of any terms which could consist either with their safety or his honour mons torcy assured the pensionary in the strongest manner and bid him count upon it that the king his master would never sign those articles  it soon appeared that the marquis de torcys predictions were true for upon delivering to his master the last resolutions of the allies that prince took care to publish them all over his kingdom as an appeal to his subjects against the unreasonableness and injustice of his enemies which proceeding effectually answered the utmost he intended by it for the french nation extremely jealous of their monarchs glory made universal offers of their lives and fortunes rather than submit to such ignominious terms and the clergy in particular promised to give the king their consecrated plate towards continuing the war thus that mighty kingdom generally thought to be wholly exhausted of its wealth yet when driven to a necessity by the imprudence of the allies or by the corruption of particular men who influenced their councils recovered strength enough to support itself for three following campaigns and in the last by the fatal blindness or obstinacy of the dutch venturing to act without the assistance of britain which they had shamefully abandoned was an overmatch for the whole confederate army2  footnote 2 alluding to the defeat at denain july 24th 1712 s  those who in order to defend the proceedings of the allies have given an account of this negotiation do wholly omit the circumstance i have now related and express the zeal of the british and dutch ministers for a peace by informing us how frequently they sent after mons de torcy and mons rouille for a farther conference but in the mean time mr horatio walpole secretary to the queens plenipotentiaries was dispatched over hither to have those abortive articles signed and ratified by her majesty at a venture which was accordingly done a piece of management altogether absurd and without example contrived only to deceive our people into a belief that a peace was intended and to shew what great things the ministry designed to do  but this hope expiring upon the news that france had refused to sign those articles all was solved by recourse to the old topic of the french perfidiousness we loaded them plentifully with ignominious appellations they were a nation never to be trusted the parliament cheerfully continued their supplies and the war went on the winter following began the second and last session of the preceding parliament noted for the trial of dr sacheverell and the occasions thereby given to the people to discover and exert their dispositions very opposite to the designs of those who were then in power in the summer of one thousand seven hundred and ten ensued a gradual change of the ministry and in the beginning of that winter the present parliament was called  the king of france whose real interests made him sincerely desirous of any tolerable peace found it impossible to treat upon equal conditions with either of the two maritime powers engaged against him because of the prevalency of factions in both who acted in concert to their mutual private advantage although directly against the general dispositions of the people in either as well as against their several maxims of government but upon the great turn of affairs and councils here in england the new parliament and ministers acting from other motives and upon other principles that prince hoped an opportunity might arise of resuming his endeavours towards a peace  there was at this time in england a french ecclesiastic called the abbé gaultier3 who had resided several years in london under the protection of some foreign ministers in whose families he used upon occasion to exercise his function of a priest after the battle of blenheim this gentleman went down to nottingham where several french prisoners of quality were kept to whom he rendered those offices of civility suitable to persons in their condition which upon their return to france they reported to his advantage among the rest the chevalier de croissy told his brother the marquis de torcy that whenever the french court would have a mind to make overtures of peace with england mons gaultier might be very usefully employed in handing them to the ministers here this was no farther thought on at present in the mean time the war went on and the conferences at the hague and gertruydenberg miscarried by the allies insisting upon such demands as they neither expected nor perhaps desired should be granted  footnote 3 see note prefixed to a new journey to paris in vol v of present edition gaultier although a priest was nothing more than a superior spy in the pay of the french court he had been chaplain to tallard and the disgraced count gallas and was a sort of protégé of the earl of jersey but his character does not bear very close scrutiny the duke of berwick could not have had any high opinion either of the man or his abilities since in the mémoires de berwick vol ii p 122 edit 1780 he is thus referred to sa naissance étoit toute des plus ordinaires et ses facultés à lavenant cest à dire très pauvre st john called gaultier his mercury and de torcy styled him the angel of peace torcys memoires vol ii p 148 edition of 1828 ts  some time in july one thousand seven hundred and ten mons gaultier received a letter from the marquis de torcy signifying that a report being spread of her majestys intentions to change her ministry to take mr harley into her councils and to dissolve her parliament the most christian king thought it might be now a favourable conjuncture to offer new proposals of a treaty mons gaultier was therefore directed to apply himself in the marquiss name either to the duke of shrewsbury the earl of jersey or mr harley and inform the french court how such a proposition would be relished gaultier chose to deliver his message to the second of those who had been ambassador from the late king to france but the earl excused himself from entering into particulars with a stranger and a private person who had no authority for what he said more than a letter from mons de torcy gaultier offered to procure another from that minister to the earl himself and did so in a month after but obtained no answer till december following when the queen had made all necessary changes and summoned a free parliament to her wishes about the beginning of january the abbé after having procured his dismission from count gallas the emperors envoy at that time his protector was sent to paris to inform mons torcy that her majesty would be willing his master should resume the treaty with holland provided the demands of england might be previously granted gaultier came back after a short stay with a return to his message that the dutch had used the most christian king and his ministers in such a manner both at the hague and gertruydenberg as made that prince resolve not to expose himself any more to the like treatment that he therefore chose to address himself to england and was ready to make whatever offers her majesty could reasonably expect for the advantage of her own kingdoms and the satisfaction of her allies  after this message had been duly considered by the queen and her ministers mons gaultier was dispatched a second time to france about the beginning of march one thousand seven hundred and teneleven with an answer to the following purpose that since france had their particular reasons for not beginning again to treat with holland england was willing to remove that difficulty and proposed it should be done in this manner that france should send over hither the propositions for a treaty which should be transmitted by england to holland to be jointly treated on that side of the water but it was to be understood that the same proposition formerly offered to holland was to be made to england or one not less advantageous to the allies for although england would enter most sincerely into such a treaty and shew in the course of it the clearness of their intentions yet they could not with honour entertain a less beneficial proposal than what was offered to the states  that prince as well as his minister mons de torcy either felt or affected so much resentment of the usage the latter had met at the hague and gertruydenberg that they appeared fully determined against making any application to the states where the same persons continued still in power of whose treatment they so heavily complained4  footnote 4 there can be little doubt that de torcys resentment against the dutch as expressed in the first of the propositions above cited was an affected one since it is well known that the dutch were at the very time these propositions were sent to england and even for some time previously engaged in separate overtures with the french court indeed according to prior history of his own time they had been so engaged ever since the breaking up of the gertruydenberg conference and when prior arrived in france in august 1711 he was shown three letters written as from the pensionary but probably by petecum promising louis every advantage if the conference so unhappily broken off at gertruydenberg were renewed the negotiations must be secret and separate reported prior his most christian majesty need only name his own terms swift knew of the existence of at least one of these letters because he was very anxious to obtain it to get some particulars for my history as he notes in his journal one letter of petecums showing the roguery of the dutch see also portland manuscripts vol v p 34 et seq ts  they seemed altogether to distrust the inclination of that republic towards a peace but at the same time shewed a mighty complaisance to the english nation and a desire to have her majesty at the head of a treaty this appears by the first overture in form sent from that kingdom and signed by mons de torcy on the twentysecond of april ns one thousand seven hundred and eleven to the following effect  that as it could not be doubted but the king was in a condition of continuing the war with honour so it could not be looked on as a mark of weakness in his majesty to break the silence he had kept since the conferences at gertruydenberg and that before the opening of the campaign he now gives farther proof of the desire he always had to procure the repose of europe but after what he hath found by experience of the sentiments of those persons who now govern the republic of holland and of their industry in rendering all negotiations without effect his majesty will for the public good offer to the english nation those propositions which he thinks fit to make for terminating the war and for settling the tranquillity of europe upon a solid foundation it is with this view that he offers to enter into a treaty of peace founded on the following conditions  first the english nation shall have real securities for carrying on their trade in spain the indies and ports of the mediterranean  secondly the king will consent to form a sufficient barrier in the low countries for the security of the republic of holland and this barrier shall be such as england shall agree upon and approve his majesty promising at the same time an entire liberty and security to the trade of the dutch  thirdly all reasonable methods shall be thought on with sincerity and truth for giving satisfaction to the allies of england and holland  fourthly whereas the affairs of the king of spain are in so good a condition as to furnish new expedients for putting an end to the disputes about that monarchy and for settling it to the satisfaction of the several parties concerned all sincere endeavours shall be used for surmounting the difficulties arisen upon this occasion and the trade and interest of all parties engaged in the present war shall be secured  fifthly the conferences in order to treat of a peace upon these conditions shall be immediately opened and the plenipotentiaries whom the king shall name to assist thereat shall treat with those of england and holland either alone or in conjunction with those of their allies as england shall choose  sixthly his majesty proposes the towns of aix la chapelle or liège for the place where the plenipotentiaries shall assemble leaving the choice likewise to england of either of the said towns wherein to treat a general peace  these overtures although expressing much confidence in the ministry here great deference to the queen and displeasure against the dutch were immediately transmitted by her majestys command to her ambassador in holland with orders that they should be communicated to the pensionary the abbé gaultier was desired to signify this proceeding to the marquis de torcy at the same time to let that minister understand that some of the above articles ought to be explained the lord raby now earl of stafford was directed to tell the pensionary that her majesty being resolved in making peace as in making war to act in perfect concert with the states would not lose a moment in transmitting to him a paper of this importance that the queen earnestly desired that the secret might be kept among as few as possible and that she hoped the pensionary would advise upon this occasion with no person whatsoever except such as by the constitution of that government are unavoidably necessary that the terms of the several propositions were indeed too general but however they contained an offer to treat and that although there appeared an air of complaisance to england through the whole paper and the contrary to holland yet this could have no ill consequences as long as the queen and the states took care to understand each other and to act with as little reserve as became two powers so nearly allied in interest which rule on the part of britain should be inviolably observed it was signified likewise to the pensionary that the duke of marlborough had no communication of this affair from england and that it was supposed he would have none from the hague  after these proposals had been considered in holland the ambassador was directed to send back the opinion of the dutch ministers upon them the court here was indeed apprehensive that the pensionary would be alarmed at the whole frame of monsieur de torcys paper and particularly at these expressions that the english shall have real securities for their trade c and that the barrier for the statesgeneral shall be such as england shall agree upon and approve it was natural to think that the fear which the dutch would conceive of our obtaining advantageous terms for britain might put them upon trying underhand for themselves and endeavouring to overreach us in the management of the peace as they had hitherto done in that of the war the ambassador was therefore cautioned to be very watchful in discovering any workings which might tend that way  when the lord raby was first sent to the hague the duke of marlborough and lord townshend had for very obvious reasons used their utmost endeavours to involve him in as many difficulties as they could upon which and other accounts needless to mention it was thought proper that his grace then in flanders should not be let into the secret of this affair  the proposal of aix or liège for a place of treaty was only a farther mark of their old discontent against holland to shew they would not name any town which belonged to the states  the pensionary having consulted those who had been formerly employed in the negotiations of peace and enjoined them the utmost secrecy to avoid the jealousy of the foreign ministers there desired the ambassador to return her majesty thanks for the obliging manner of communicating the french overtures for the confidence she placed in the states and for her promise of making no step towards a peace but in concert with them assuring her of the like on their part that although the states endeavoured to hide it from the enemy they were as weary of the war as we and very heartily desirous of a good and lasting peace as well as ready to join in any method by which her majesty should think proper to obtain it that the states looked upon these propositions as very dark and general and they observed how the enemy would create jealousies between the queen their republic and the other allies but they were satisfied it would have no effect and relied entirely on the justness and prudence of her majesty who they doubted not would make the french explain themselves more particularly in the several points of their proposals and send a plan of the particular conditions whereupon they would make a peace after which the states would be ready either to join with her majesty or to make their objections and were prepared to bring with them all the facility imaginable towards promoting so good a work  this is the sum of the verbal answer made by the pensionary upon communicating to him the french proposals and i have chosen to set it down rather than transcribe the other given to the ambassador some days after which was more in form and to the same purpose but shorter and in my opinion not so well discovering the true disposition of the dutch ministers  for after the queen had transmitted the french overtures to holland and the states found her majesty was bent in earnest upon the thoughts of a peace they began to cast about how to get the negotiation into their own hands they knew that whatever power received the first proposals would be wise enough to stipulate something for themselves as they had done in their own case both at the hague and gertruydenberg where they carved as they pleased without any regard to the interests of their nearest allies for this reason while they endeavoured to amuse the british court with expostulations upon the several preliminaries sent from france monsieur petecum a forward meddling agent of holstein who had resided some years in holland negotiated with heinsius the grand pensionary as well as with vanderdussen and buys about restoring the conferences between france and that republic broke off in gertruydenberg pursuant to which about the end of may ns one thousand seven hundred and eleven petecum wrote to the marquis de torcy with the privity of the pensionary and probably of the other two the substance of his letter was to inform the marquis that things might easily be disposed so as to settle a correspondence between that crown and the republic in order to renew the treaty of peace that this could be done with the greater secrecy because monsieur heinsius by virtue of his oath as pensionary might keep any affair private as long as he thought necessary and was not obliged to communicate it until he believed things were ripe and as long as he concealed it from his masters he was not bound to discover it either to the ministers of the emperor or those of her british majesty that since england thought it proper for king charles to continue the whole campaign in catalonia though he should be chosen emperor in order to support the war in spain it was necessary for france to treat in the most secret manner with the states who were not now so violently as formerly against having philip on the spanish throne upon certain conditions for securing their trade but were jealous of englands design to fortify some trading towns in spain for themselves that heinsius extremely desired to get out of the war for some reasons which he petecum was not permitted to tell and that vanderdussen and buys were impatient to have the negotiations with france once more set on foot which if monsieur torcy thought fit to consent to petecum engaged that the states would determine to settle the preliminaries in the midway between paris and the hague with whatever ministers the most christian king should please to employ but monsieur torcy refused this overture and in his answer to monsieur petecum assigned for the reason the treatment his masters former proposals had met with at the hague and gertruydenberg from the ministers of holland britain and holland seemed pretty well agreed that those proposals were too loose and imperfect to be a foundation for entering upon a general treaty and monsieur gaultier was desired to signify to the french court that it was expected they should explain themselves more particularly on the several articles  but in the mean time the queen was firmly resolved that the interests of her own kingdoms should not be neglected at this juncture as they had formerly twice been while the dutch were principal managers of a negotiation with france her majesty had given frequent and early notice to the states of the general disposition of her people towards a peace of her own inability to continue the war upon the old foot under the disadvantage of unequal quotas and the universal backwardness of her allies she had likewise informed them of several advances made to her on the side of france which she had refused to hearken to till she had consulted with those her good friends and confederates and heard their opinion on that subject but the dutch who apprehended nothing more than to see britain at the head of a treaty were backward and sullen disliked all proposals by the queens intervention and said it was a piece of artifice of france to divide the allies besides they knew the ministry was young and the opposite faction had given them assurances that the people of england would never endure a peace without spain nor the men in power dare to attempt it after the resolutions of one house of parliament to the contrary but in the midst of this unwillingness to receive any overtures from france by the queens hands the dutch ministers were actually engaged in a correspondence with that court where they urged our inability to begin a treaty by reason of those factions which themselves had inflamed and were ready to commence a negotiation upon much easier terms than what they supposed we demanded for not to mention the duke of lorraines interposition in behalf of holland which france absolutely refused to accept the letters sent from the dutch to that court were shewn some months after to a british minister there5 which gave much weight to monsieur de torcys insinuations that he knew where to meet with more compliance if the necessity of affairs should force him to it by our refusal and the violence of the states against our entertaining of that correspondence was only because they knew theirs would never be accepted at least till ours were thrown off  footnote 5 matthew prior see note ante p 55 ts the queen sensible of all this resolved to provide for her own kingdoms and having therefore prepared such demands for her principal allies as might be a ground for proceeding to a general treaty without pretending to adjust their several interests she resolved to stipulate in a particular manner the advantage of britain the following preliminary demands were accordingly drawn up in order to be transmitted to france  great britain will not enter into any negotiation of peace otherwise than upon these conditions obtained beforehand  that the union of the two crowns of france and spain shall be prevented that satisfaction shall be given to all the allies and trade settled and maintained  if france be disposed to treat upon this view it is not to be doubted that the following propositions will be found reasonable  a barrier shall be formed in the low countries for the statesgeneral and their trade shall be secured  a barrier likewise shall be formed for the empire  the pretensions of all the allies founded upon former treaties shall be regulated and determined to their general satisfaction  in order to make a more equal balance of power in italy the dominions and territories which in the beginning of the present war belonged to the duke of savoy and are now in the possession of france shall be restored to his royal highness and such other places in italy shall be yielded to him as will be found necessary and agreeable to the sense of former treaties made with this prince  as to great britain in particular the succession to the crown of the kingdoms according to the present establishment shall be acknowledged  a new treaty of commerce between great britain and france shall be made after the most just and reasonable manner  dunkirk shall be demolished  gibraltar and portmahon shall remain in the hands of the present possessors  the english shall have the assiento in the same manner the french now enjoy it and such places in the spanish west indies shall be assigned to those concerned in this traffic for the refreshment and sale of their negroes as shall be found necessary and convenient  all advantages rights and privileges already granted and which may hereafter be granted by spain to the subjects of france or to any other nation whatsoever shall be equally granted to the subjects of great britain  and for better securing the british trade in the spanish west indies certain places to be named in the treaty of peace shall be put into possession of the english  newfoundland with the bay and straits of hudson shall be entirely restored to the english and great britain and france shall severally keep and possess all those countries and territories in north america which each of the said nations shall be in possession of at the time when the ratification of this treaty shall be published in those parts of the world  these demands and all other proceedings between great britain and france shall be kept inviolably secret until they are published by the mutual consent of both parties  the last article was not only intended for avoiding if possible the jealousy of the dutch but to prevent the clamours of the abettors here at home who under the pretended fears of our doing injustice to the dutch by acting without the privity of that republic in order to make a separate peace would be ready to drive on the worst designs against the queen and ministry in order to recover the power they had lost  in june one thousand seven hundred and eleven mr prior a person of great distinction not only on account of his wit but for his abilities in the management of affairs and who had been formerly employed at the french court was dispatched thither by her majesty with the foregoing demands this gentleman was received at versailles with great civility the king declared that no proceeding in order to a general treaty would be so agreeable to him as by the intervention of england and that his majesty being desirous to contribute with all his power towards the repose of europe did answer to the demands which had been made  that he would consent freely and sincerely to all just and reasonable methods for hindering the crowns of france and spain from being ever united under the same prince his majesty being persuaded that such an excess of power would be as contrary to the general good and repose of europe as it was opposite to the will of the late catholic king charles the second he said his intention was that all parties in the present war should find their reasonable satisfaction in the intended treaty of peace and that trade should be settled and maintained for the future to the advantage of those nations which formerly possessed it  that as the king will exactly observe the conditions of peace whenever it shall be concluded and as the object he proposeth to himself is to secure the frontiers of his own kingdom without giving any sort of disturbance to his neighbours he promiseth to agree that by the future treaty of peace the dutch shall be put into possession of all such fortified places as shall be specified in the said treaty to serve for a barrier to that republic against all attempts on the side of france he engages likewise to give all necessary securities for removing the jealousies raised among the german princes of his majestys designs  that when the conferences in order to a general treaty shall be formed all the pretensions of the several princes and states engaged in the present war shall be fairly and amicably discussed nor shall any thing be omitted which may regulate and determine them to the satisfaction of all parties  that pursuant to the demands made by england his majesty promiseth to restore to the duke of savoy these demesnes and territories which belonged to that prince at the beginning of this war and which his majesty is now in possession of and the king consents further that such other places in italy shall be yielded to the duke of savoy as shall be found necessary according to the sense of those treaties made between the said duke and his allies  that the kings sentiments of the present government of great britain the open declaration he had made in holland of his resolution to treat of peace by applications to the english the assurances he had given of engaging the king of spain to leave gibraltar in their hands all which are convincing proofs of his perfect esteem for a nation still in war with him leave no room to doubt of his majestys inclination to give england all securities and advantages for their trade which they can reasonably demand but as his majesty cannot persuade himself that a government so clearsighted as ours will insist upon conditions which must absolutely destroy the trade of france and spain as well as that of all other nations of europe he thinks the demands made by great britain may require a more particular discussion  that upon this foundation the king thought the best way of advancing and perfecting a negotiation the beginning of which he had seen with so much satisfaction would be to send into england a person instructed in his intention and authorized by him to agree upon securities for settling the trade of the subjects of england and those particular advantages to be stipulated in their favour without destroying the trade of the french and spaniards or of other nations in christendom  that therefore his majesty had charged the person chosen for this commission to answer the other articles of the memorial given him by mr prior the secret of which should be exactly observed  mons de torcy had for some years past used all his endeavours to incline his master towards a peace pursuant to the maxim of his uncle colbert that a long war was not for the interest of france it was for this reason the king made choice of him in the conferences at the hague the bad success whereof although it filled him with resentments against the dutch did not alter his opinion but he was violently opposed by a party both in the court and kingdom who pretended to fear he would sacrifice the glory of the prince and country by too large concessions or perhaps would rather wish that the first offers should have been still made to the dutch as a people more likely to be less solicitous about the interest of britain than her majesty would certainly be for theirs and the particular design of mr prior was to find out whether that minister had credit enough with his prince and a support from others in power sufficient to overrule the faction against peace  mr priors journey6 could not be kept a secret as the court here at first seemed to intend it he was discovered at his return by an officer of the port at dover where he landed after six weeks absence upon which the dutch gazettes and english newspapers were full of speculations  footnote 6 see swifts a new journey to paris vol v of this edition pp 187205 wsj  at the same time with mr prior there arrived from france mons mesnager knight of the order of st michael and one of the council of trade to the most christian king his commission was in general empowering him to treat with the minister of any prince engaged in the war against his master in his first conferences with the queens ministers he pretended orders to insist that her majesty should enter upon particular engagements in several articles which did not depend upon her but concerned only the interest of the allies reciprocally with those of the most christian king whereas the negotiation had begun upon this principle that france should consent to adjust the interests of great britain in the first place whereby her majesty would be afterwards enabled by her good offices on all sides to facilitate the general peace the queen resolved never to depart from this principle but was absolutely determined to remit the particular interests of the allies to general conferences where she would do the utmost in her power to procure the repose of europe and the satisfaction of all parties it was plain france could run no hazard by this proceeding because the preliminary articles would have no force before a general peace was signed therefore it was not doubted but mons mesnager would have orders to waive this new pretension and go on in treating upon that foot which was at first proposed in short the ministers required a positive and speedy answer to the articles in question since they contained only such advantages and securities as her majesty thought she had a right to require from any prince whatsoever to whom the dominions of spain should happen to fall  the particular demands of britain were formed into eight articles to which mons mesnager having transmitted them to his court and received new powers from thence had orders to give his masters consent by way of answers to the several points to be obligatory only after a general peace these demands together with the answers of the french king were drawn up and signed by mons mesnager and her majestys two principal secretaries of state whereof i shall here present an extract to the reader  in the preamble the most christian king sets forth that being particularly informed by the last memorial which the british ministers delivered to mons mesnager of the dispositions of this crown to facilitate a general peace to the satisfaction of the several parties concerned and his majesty finding in effect as the said memorial declares that he runs no hazard by engaging himself in the manner there expressed since the preliminary articles will be of no force until the signing of the general peace and being sincerely desirous to advance to the utmost of his power the repose of europe especially by a way so agreeable as the interposition of a princess whom so many ties of blood ought to unite to him and whose sentiments for the public tranquillity cannot be doubted his majesty moved by these considerations hath ordered mons mesnager knight c to give the following answers in writing to the articles contained in the memorial transmitted to him intituled preliminary demands for great britain in particular  the articles were these that follow  first the succession to the crown to be acknowledged according to the present establishment  secondly a new treaty of commerce between great britain and france to be made after the most just and reasonable manner  thirdly dunkirk to be demolished  fourthly gibraltar and portmahon to continue in the hands of those who now possess them  fifthly the assiento or liberty of selling negroes to the spanish west indies to be granted to the english in as full a manner as the french possess it at present and such places in the said west indies to be assigned to the persons concerned in this trade for the refreshment and sale of their negroes as shall be found necessary and convenient  sixthly whatever advantages privileges and rights are already or may hereafter be granted by spain to the subjects of france or any other nation shall be equally granted to the subjects of great britain  seventhly for better protecting their trade in the spanish west indies the english shall be put into possession of such places as shall be named in the treaty of peace  or as an equivalent for this article that the assiento be granted to britain for the term of thirty years  that the isle of st christophers be likewise secured to the english  that the advantages and exemption from duties promised by monsieur mesnager which he affirms will amount to fifteen per cent upon all goods of the growth and manufacture of great britain be effectually allowed  that whereas on the side of the river of plate the english are not in possession of any colony a certain extent of territory be allowed them on the said river for refreshing and keeping their negroes till they are sold to the spaniards subject nevertheless to the inspection of an officer appointed by spain  eighthly newfoundland and the bay and straits of hudson shall be entirely restored to the english and great britain and france shall respectively keep whatever dominions in north america each of them shall be in possession of when the ratification of this treaty shall be published in those parts of the world  the six first articles were allowed without any difficulty except that about dunkirk where france was to have an equivalent to be settled in a general treaty  difficulty arising upon the seventh article the proposed equivalent was allowed instead thereof  the last article was referred to the general treaty of peace only the french insisted to have the power of fishing for cod and drying them on the island of newfoundland  these articles were to be looked upon as conditions which the most christian king consented to allow and whenever a general peace should be signed they were to be digested into the usual form of a treaty to the satisfaction of both crowns  the queen having thus provided for the security and advantage of her kingdoms whenever a peace should be made and upon terms no way interfering with the interest of her allies the next thing in order was to procure from france such preliminary articles as might be a ground upon which to commence a general treaty these were adjusted and signed the same day with the former and having been delivered to the several ministers residing here from the powers in alliance with england were quickly made public but the various constructions and censures which passed upon them have made it necessary to give the reader the following transcript  the king being willing to contribute all that is in his power to the reestablishing of the general peace his majesty declares  i that he will acknowledge the queen of great britain in that quality as also the succession of that crown according to the settlement  ii that he will freely and bonâ fide consent to the taking all just and reasonable measures for hindering that the crowns of france and spain may ever be united on the head of the same prince his majesty being persuaded that this excess of power would be contrary to the good and quiet of europe  iii the kings intention is that all the parties engaged in the present war without excepting any of them may find their reasonable satisfaction in the treaty of peace which shall be made that commerce may be reestablished and maintained for the future to the advantage of great britain of holland and of the other nations who have been accustomed to exercise commerce  iv as the king will likewise maintain exactly the observance of the peace when it shall be concluded and the object the king proposes to himself being to secure the frontiers of his kingdom without disturbing in any manner whatever the neighbouring states he promises to agree by the treaty which shall be made that the dutch shall be put in possession of the fortified places which shall be mentioned in the netherlands to serve hereafter for a barrier which may secure the quiet of the republic of holland against any enterprise from the part of france  v the king consents likewise that a secure and convenient barrier should be formed for the empire and for the house of austria  vi notwithstanding dunkirk cost the king very great sums as well to purchase it as to fortify it and that it is further necessary to be at very considerable expense for razing the works his majesty is willing however to engage to cause them to be demolished immediately after the conclusion of the peace on condition that for the fortifications of that place a proper equivalent that may content him be given him and as england cannot furnish that equivalent the discussion of it shall be referred to the conferences to be held for the negotiation of the peace  vii when the conferences for the negotiation of the peace shall be formed all the pretensions of the princes and states engaged in the present war shall be therein discussed bonâ fide and amicably and nothing shall be omitted to regulate and terminate them to the satisfaction of all the parties  mesnager  these overtures are founded upon the eighth article of the grand alliance made in one thousand seven hundred and one wherein are contained the conditions without which a peace is not to be made and whoever compares both will find the preliminaries to reach every point proposed in that article which those who censured them at home if they spoke their thoughts did not understand for nothing can be plainer than what the public hath often been told that the recovery of spain from the house of bourbon was a thing never imagined when the war began but a just and reasonable satisfaction to the emperor much less ought such a condition to be held necessary at present not only because it is allowed on all hands to be impracticable but likewise because by the changes in the austrian and bourbon families it would not be safe neither did those who were loudest in blaming the french preliminaries know any thing of the advantages privately stipulated for britain whose interests they assured us were all made a sacrifice to the corruption or folly of the managers and therefore because the opposers of peace have been better informed by what they have since heard and seen they have changed their battery and accused the ministers for betraying the dutch  the lord raby her majestys ambassador at the hague having made a short journey to england where he was created earl of strafford went back to holland about the beginning of october one thousand seven hundred and eleven with the above preliminaries in order to communicate them to the pensionary and other ministers of the states the earl was instructed to let them know that the queen had according to their desire returned an answer to the first propositions signed by mons torcy signifying that the french offers were thought both by her majesty and the states neither so particular nor so full as they ought to be and insisting to have a distinct project formed of such a peace as the most christian king would be willing to conclude that this affair having been for some time transacted by papers and thereby subject to delays mons mesnager was at length sent over by france and had signed those preliminaries now communicated to them that the several articles did not indeed contain such particular concessions as france must and will make in the course of a treaty but that however her majesty thought them a sufficient foundation whereon to open the general conferences  that her majesty was unwilling to be charged with determining the several interests of her allies and therefore contented herself with such general offers as might include all the particular demands proper to be made during the treaty where the confederates must resolve to adhere firmly together in order to obtain from the enemy the utmost that could be hoped for in the present circumstances of affairs which rule her majesty assured the states she would on her part firmly observe  if the ministers of holland should express any uneasiness that her majesty may have settled the interests of her own kingdoms in a future peace by any private agreement the ambassador was ordered to say that the queen had hitherto refused to have the treaty carried on in her own kingdom and would continue to do so unless they the dutch constrained her to take another measure that by these means the states and the rest of the allies would have the opportunity of treating and adjusting their different pretensions which her majesty would promote with all the zeal she had shewn for the common good and the particular advantage of that republic as they must do her the justice to confess in the whole course of her reign that the queen had made no stipulation for herself which might clash with the interests of holland and that the articles to be inserted in a future treaty for the benefit of britain were for the most part such as contained advantages which must either be continued to the enemy or be obtained by her majesty but however that no concession should tempt her to hearken to a peace unless her good friends and allies the states general had all reasonable satisfaction as to their trade and barrier as well as in all other respects  after these assurances given in the queens name the earl was to insinuate that her majesty should have just reason to be offended and to think the proceeding between her and the states very unequal if they should pretend to have any further uneasiness upon this head that being determined to accept no advantages to herself repugnant to their interests nor any peace without their reasonable satisfaction the figure she had made during the whole course of the war and the part she had acted superior to any of the allies who were more concerned in danger and interest might justly entitle her to settle the concerns of great britain before she would consent to a general negotiation  if the states should object the engagements the queen was under by treaties of making no peace but in concert with them or the particular obligations of the barrier treaty the ambassador was to answer that as to the former her majesty had not in any sort acted contrary thereto that she was so far from making a peace without their consent as to declare her firm resolution not to make it without their satisfaction and that what had passed between france and her amounted to no more than an introduction to a general treaty as to the latter the earl had orders to represent very earnestly how much it was even for the interest of holland itself rather to compound the advantage of the barrier treaty than to insist upon the whole which the house of austria and several other allies would never consent to that nothing could be more odious to the people of england than many parts of this treaty which would have raised universal indignation if the utmost care had not been taken to quiet the minds of those who were acquainted with the terms of that guaranty and to conceal them from those who were not that it was absolutely necessary to maintain a good harmony between both nations without which it would be impossible at any time to form a strength for reducing an exorbitant power or preserving the balance of europe from whence it followed that it could not be the true interest of either country to insist upon any conditions which might give just apprehension to the other  that france had proposed utrecht nimeguen aix or liège wherein to hold the general treaty and her majesty was ready to send her plenipotentiaries to whichever of those towns the states should approve  if the imperial ministers or those of the other allies should object against the preliminaries as no sufficient ground for opening the conferences and insist that france should consent to such articles as were signed on the part of the allies in the year one thousand seven hundred and nine the earl of strafford was in answer directed to insinuate that the french might have probably been brought to explain themselves more particularly had they not perceived the uneasiness impatience and jealousy among the allies during our transactions with that court however he should declare to them in the queens name that if they were determined to accept of peace upon no terms inferior to what was formerly demanded her majesty was ready to concur with them but would no longer bear those disproportions of expense yearly increased upon her nor the deficiency of the confederates in every part of the war that it was therefore incumbent upon them to furnish for the future such quotas of ships and forces as they were now wanting in and to increase their expense while her majesty reduced hers to a reasonable and just proportion  that if the ministers of vienna and holland should urge their inability upon this head the queen insisted they ought to comply with her in war or in peace her majesty desiring nothing as to the first but what they ought to perform and what is absolutely necessary and as to the latter that she had done and would continue to do the utmost in her power towards obtaining such a peace as might be to the satisfaction of all her allies  some days after the earl of staffords departure to holland mons buys pensionary of amsterdam arrived here from thence with instructions from his masters to treat upon the subject of the french preliminaries and the methods for carrying on the war in his first conference with a committee of council he objected against all the articles as too general and uncertain and against some of them as prejudicial he said the french promising that trade should be reestablished and maintained for the future was meant in order to deprive the dutch of their tariff of one thousand six hundred and sixtyfour for the plenipotentiaries of that crown would certainly expound the word rétablir to signify no more than restoring the trade of the states to the condition it was in immediately before the commencement of the present war he said that in the article of dunkirk the destruction of the harbour was not mentioned and that the fortifications were only to be razed upon condition of an equivalent which might occasion a difference between her majesty and the states since holland would think it hard to have a town less in their barrier for the demolition of dunkirk and england would complain to have this thorn continue in their side for the sake of giving one town more to the dutch  lastly he objected that where the french promised effectual methods should be taken to prevent the union of france and spain under the same king they offered nothing at all for the cession of spain which was the most important point of the war  for these reasons mons buys hoped her majesty would alter her measures and demand specific articles upon which the allies might debate whether they would consent to a negotiation or no  the queen who looked upon all these difficulties raised about the method of treating as endeavours to wrest the negotiation out of her hands commanded the lords of the committee to let mons buys know that the experience she formerly had of proceeding by particular preliminaries towards a general treaty gave her no encouragement to repeat the same method any more that such a preliminary treaty must be negotiated either by some particular allies or by all the first her majesty could never suffer since she would neither take upon her to settle the interests of others nor submit that others should settle those of her own kingdoms as to the second it was liable to mons buyss objection because the ministers of france would have as fair an opportunity of sowing division among the allies when they were all assembled upon a preliminary treaty as when the conferences were open for a negotiation of peace that this method could therefore have no other effect than to delay the treaty without any advantage that her majesty was heartily disposed both then and during the negotiation to insist on every thing necessary for securing the barrier and commerce of the states and therefore hoped the conferences might be opened without farther difficulties  that her majesty did not only consent but desire to have a plan settled for carrying on the war as soon as the negotiation of peace should begin but expected to have the burthen more equally laid and more agreeable to treaties and would join with the states in pressing the allies to perform their parts as she had endeavoured to animate them by her example  mons buys seemed to know little of his masters mind and pretended he had no power to conclude upon any thing1 her majestys minister proposed to him an alliance between the two nations to subsist after a peace to this he hearkened very readily and offered to take the matter ad referendum having authority to do no more his intention was that he might appear to negotiate in order to gain time to pick out if possible the whole secret of the transactions between britain and france to disclose nothing himself nor bind his masters to any conditions to seek delays till the parliament met and then observe what turn it took and what would be the issue of those frequent cabals between himself and some other foreign ministers in conjunction with the chief leaders of the discontented faction  footnote 1 buyss mission seemed to have been to act on behalf of the states general for the purpose of preventing england obtaining any commercial advantage which the states did not share and for causing delays he certainly had no powers to treat definitely and swifts remark is emphasized by the statement in the bolingbroke correspondence vol ii p 25 about him he could only speak as monsieur buys ts  the dutch hoped that the clamours raised against the proceedings of the queens ministers towards a peace would make the parliament disapprove what had been done whereby the states would be at the head of the negotiation which the queen did not think fit to have any more in their hands where it had miscarried twice already although prince eugene himself owned that france was then disposed to conclude a peace upon such conditions as it was not worth the life of a grenadier to refuse them as to insisting upon specific preliminaries her majesty thought her own method much better for each ally in the course of the negotiation to advance and manage his own pretensions wherein she would support and assist them rather than for two ministers of one ally to treat solely with the enemy and report what they pleased to the rest as was practised by the dutch at gertruydenberg  one part of mons buyss instructions was to desire the queen not to be so far amused by a treaty of peace as to neglect her preparation for war against the next campaign her majesty who was firmly resolved against submitting any longer to that unequal burthen of expense she had hitherto lain under commanded mr secretary st john to debate the matter with that minister who said he had no power to treat only insisted that his masters had fully done their part and that nothing but exhortations could be used to prevail on the other allies to act with greater vigour  on the other side the queen refused to concert any plan for the prosecution of the war till the states would join with her in agreeing to open the conferences of peace which therefore by mons buyss application to them was accordingly done by a resolution taken in holland upon the twenty first of november one thousand seven hundred and eleven ns  about this time the count de gallas7 was forbid the court by order from the queen who sent him word that she looked upon him no longer as a public minister  footnote 7 the austrian ambassador ts  this gentleman thought fit to act a very dishonourable part here in england altogether inconsistent with the character he bore of envoy from the late and present emperors two princes under the strictest ties of gratitude to the queen especially the latter who had then the title of king of spain count gallas about the end of august one thousand seven hundred and eleven with the utmost privacy dispatched an italian one of his clerks to frankfort where the earl of peterborough was then expected this man was instructed to pass for a spaniard and insinuate himself into the earls service which he accordingly did and gave constant information to the last emperors secretary at frankfort of all he could gather up in his lordships family as well as copies of several letters he had transcribed it was likewise discovered that gallas had in his dispatches to the present emperor then in spain represented the queen and her ministers as not to be confided in that when her majesty had dismissed the earl of sunderland she promised to proceed no farther in the change of her servants yet soon after turned them all out and thereby ruined the public credit as well as abandoned spain that the present ministers wanted the abilities and good dispositions of the former were persons of ill designs and enemies to the common cause and he gallas could not trust them in his letters to count zinzendorf8 he said that mr secretary st john complained of the house of austrias backwardness only to make the king of spain odious to england and the people here desirous of a peace although it were ever so bad one to prevent which count gallas drew up a memorial which he intended to give the queen and transmitted a draught of it to zinzendorf for his advice and approbation this memorial among other great promises to encourage the continuance of the war proposed the detaching a good body of troops from hungary to serve in italy or spain as the queen should think fit  footnote 8 the austrian envoy at the hague characterized by mr walter sichel as a martyr to etiquette and devoured by zeal for the holy roman empire bolingbroke and his times p 392  ts  zinzendorf thought this too bold a step without consulting the emperor to which gallas replied that his design was only to engage the queen to go on with the war that zinzendorf knew how earnestly the english and dutch had pressed to have these troops from hungary and therefore they ought to be promised in order to quiet those two nations after which several ways might be found to elude that promise and in the mean time the great point would be gained of bringing the english to declare for continuing the war that the emperor might afterwards excuse himself by the apprehension of a war in hungary or of that between the turks and muscovites that if these excuses should be at an end a detachment of one or two regiments might be sent and the rest deferred by pretending want of money by which the queen would probably be brought to maintain some part of those troops and perhaps the whole body he added that this way of management was very common among the allies and gave for an example the forces which the dutch had promised for the service of spain but were never sent with several other instances of the same kind which he said might be produced  her majesty who had long suspected that count gallas was engaged in these and the like practices having at last received authentic proofs of this whole intrigue from original letters and the voluntary confession of those who were principally concerned in carrying it on thought it necessary to show her resentment by refusing the count any more access to her person or her court  although the queen as it hath been already observed was resolved to open the conferences upon the general preliminaries yet she thought it would very much forward the peace to know what were the utmost concessions which france would make to the several allies but especially to the states general and the duke of savoy therefore while her majesty was pressing the former to agree to a general treaty the abbé gaultier was sent to france with a memorial to desire that the most christian king would explain himself upon those preliminaries particularly with relation to savoy and holland whose satisfaction the queen had most at heart as well from her friendship to both these powers as because if she might engage to them that their just pretensions would be allowed few difficulties would remain of any moment to retard the general peace  the french answer to this memorial contained several schemes and proposals for the satisfaction of each ally coming up very near to what her majesty and her ministers thought reasonable the greatest difficulties seemed to be about the elector of bavaria for whose interests france appeared to be as much concerned as the queen was for those of the duke of savoy however those were judged not very hard to be surmounted  the states having at length agreed to a general treaty the following particulars were concerted between her majesty and that republic  that the congress should be held at utrecht  that the opening of the congress should be upon the twelfth of january ns one thousand seven hundred and eleventwelve  that for avoiding all inconveniences of ceremony the ministers of the queen and states during the treaty should only have the characters of plenipotentiaries and not take that of ambassadors till the day on which the peace should be signed  lastly the queen and states insisted that the ministers of the duke of anjou and the late electors of bavaria and cologne should not appear at the congress until the points relating to their masters were adjusted and were firmly resolved not to send their passports for the ministers of france till the most christian king declared that the absence of the forementioned ministers should not delay the progress of the negotiation  pursuant to the three former articles her majesty wrote circular letters to all the allies engaged with her in the present war and france had notice that as soon as the king declared his compliance with the last article the blank passports should be filled up with the names of the maréchal duxelles9 the abbé de polignac and mons mesnager who were appointed plenipotentiaries for that crown  footnote 9 in his letter to sir william windham bolingbroke thus refers to m duxelles the minister who had the principal direction of foreign affairs i lived in friendship with and i must own to his honour that he never encouraged a design which he knew that his court had no intention of supporting p 141 this was written of the time when bolingbroke was in paris an adherent of the pretender ts  from what i have hitherto deduced the reader sees the plan which the queen thought the most effectual for advancing a peace as the conferences were to begin upon the general preliminaries the queen was to be empowered by france to offer separately to the allies what might be reasonable for each to accept and her own interests being previously settled she was to act as a general mediator a figure that became her best from the part she had in the war and more useful to the great end at which she aimed of giving a safe and honourable peace to europe  besides it was absolutely necessary for the interests of britain that the queen should be at the head of the negotiation without which her majesty could find no expedient to redress the injuries her kingdoms were sure to suffer by the barrier treaty in order to settle this point with the states the ministers here had a conference with mons buys a few days before the parliament met he was told how necessary it was by previous concert between the emperor the queen and the states to prevent any difference which might arise in the course of the treaty at utrecht that under pretence of a barrier for the states general as their security against france infinite prejudice might arise to the trade of britain in the spanish netherlands for by the fifteenth article of the barrier treaty in consequence of what was stipulated by that of minister the queen was brought to engage that commerce shall not be rendered more easy in point of duties by the seaports of flanders than it is by the river scheldt and by the canals on the side of the seven provinces which as things now stood was very unjust for while the towns in flanders were in the hands of france or spain the dutch and we traded to them upon equal foot but now since by the barrier treaty those towns were to be possessed by the states that republic might lay what duties they pleased upon british goods after passing by ostend and make their own customfree which would utterly ruin our whole trade with flanders  upon this the lords told mons buys very frankly that if the states expected the queen should support their barrier as well as their demands from france and the house of austria upon that head they ought to agree that the subjects of britain should trade as freely to all the countries and places which by virtue of any former or future treaty were to become the barrier of the states as they did in the time of the late king charles the second of spain or as the subjects of the states general themselves shall do and that it was hoped their high mightinesses would never scruple to rectify a mistake so injurious to that nation without whose blood and treasure they would have had no barrier at all mons buys had nothing to answer against these objections but said he had already wrote to his masters for further instructions  greater difficulties occurred about settling what should be the barrier to the states after a peace the envoy insisting to have all the towns that were named in the treaty of barrier and succession and the queens ministers excepting those towns which if they continued in the hands of the dutch would render the trade of britain to flanders precarious at length it was agreed in general that the states ought to have what is really essential to the security of their barrier against france and that some amicable expedient should be found for removing the fears both of britain and holland upon this point  but at the same time mons buys was told that although the queen would certainly insist to obtain all those points from france in behalf of her allies the states yet she hoped his masters were too reasonable to break off the treaty rather than not obtain the very utmost of their demands which could not be settled here unless he were fully instructed to speak and conclude upon that subject that her majesty thought the best way of securing the common interest and preventing the division of the allies by the artifices of france in the course of a long negotiation would be to concert between the queens ministers and those of the states with a due regard to the other confederates such a plan as might amount to a safe and honourable peace after which the abbé polignac who of the french plenipotentiaries was most in the secret of his court might be told that it was in vain to amuse each other any longer that on such terms the peace would be immediately concluded and that the conferences must cease if those conditions were not without delay and with expedition granted  a treaty between her majesty and the states to subsist after a peace was now signed mons buys having received full powers to that purpose his masters were desirous to have a private article added sub spe rati concerning those terms of peace without the granting of which we should stipulate not to agree with the enemy but neither the character of buys nor the manner in which he was empowered to treat would allow the queen to enter into such an engagement the congress likewise approaching there was not time to settle a point of so great importance neither lastly would her majesty be tied down by holland without previous satisfaction upon several articles in the barrier treaty so inconsistent with her engagements to other powers in the alliance and so injurious to her own kingdoms  the lord privy seal and the earl of stafford having about the time the parliament met been appointed her majestys plenipotentiaries for treating a general peace i shall here break off the account of any further progress made in that great affair until i resume it in the last book of this history                                    the history of the four last  years of the queen  book iii   the house of commons seemed resolved from the beginning of the session to inquire strictly not only into all abuses relating to the accounts of the army but likewise into the several treaties between us and our allies upon what articles and conditions they were first agreed to and how these had been since observed in the first week of their sitting they sent an address to the queen to desire that the treaty whereby her majesty was obliged to furnish forty thousand men to act in conjunction with the forces of her allies in the low countries might be laid before the house to which the secretary of state brought an answer that search had been made but no footsteps could be found of any treaty or convention for that purpose it was this unaccountable neglect in the former ministry which first gave a pretence to the allies for lessening their quotas so much to the disadvantage of her majesty her kingdoms and the common cause in the course of the war it had been stipulated by the grand alliance between the emperor britain and the states that those three powers should assist each other with their whole force and that the several proportions should be specified in a particular convention but if any such convention were made it was never ratified only the parties agreed by common consent to take each a certain share of the burthen upon themselves which the late king william communicated to the house of commons by his secretary of state and which afterwards the other two powers observing the mighty zeal in our ministry for prolonging the war eluded as they pleased  the commissioners for stating the public accounts of the kingdom had in executing their office the preceding summer discovered several practices relating to the affairs of the army which they drew up in a report and delivered to the house  the commons began their examination of the report with a member of their own mr robert walpole already mentioned who during his being secretary at war had received five hundred guineas and taken a note for five hundred pounds more on account of two contracts for forage of the queens troops quartered in scotland he endeavoured to excuse the first contract but had nothing to say about the second the first appeared so plain and so scandalous to the commons that they voted the author of it guilty of a high breach of trust and notorious corruption committed him prisoner to the tower where he continued to the end of the session and expelled him the house1 he was a person much caressed by the opposers of the queen and ministry having been first drawn into their party by his indifference to any principles and afterwards kept steady by the loss of his place his bold forward countenance altogether a stranger to that infirmity which makes men bashful joined to a readiness of speaking in public hath justly entitled him among those of his faction to be a sort of leader of the second form the reader must excuse me for being so particular about one who is otherwise altogether obscure2  footnote 1 see part hist vi 1071 ts  footnote 2 walpole was not too obscure however to be then the object of bolingbrokes attack and in 1726 when bolingbroke had again attacked walpole this time in a letter the latter replied whatever contradictions these gentlemen may have observed in my character there is one which ill venture to assure you you will never discover which is my ever being alarmed at an opposition from one in the impotence of disgrace who could never terrify me in the zenith of his prosperity an answer to the occasional writer ts  another part of the report concerned the duke of marlborough who had received large sums of money by way of gratuity from those who were the undertakers for providing the army with bread3 this the duke excused in a letter to the commissioners from the like practice of other generals but that excuse appeared to be of little weight and the mischievous consequences of such a corruption were visible enough since the money given by these undertakers were but bribes for connivance at their indirect dealings with the army and as frauds that begin at the top are apt to spread through all the subordinate ranks of those who have any share in the management and to increase as they circulate so in this case for every thousand pounds given to the general the soldiers at least suffered fourfold  footnote 3 see the examiner nos 17 and 28 in vol ix of this edition wsj  another article of this report relating to the duke was yet of more importance the greatest part of her majestys forces in flanders were mercenary troops hired from several princes of europe it was found that the queens general subtracted two and a half per cent out of the pay of those troops for his own use which amounted to a great annual sum the duke of marlborough in his letter already mentioned endeavouring to extenuate the matter told the commissioners that this deduction was a free gift from the foreign troops which he had negotiated with them by the late kings orders and had obtained the queens warrant for reserving and receiving it that it was intended for secret service the ten thousand pounds a year given by parliament not proving sufficient and had all been laid out that way the commissioners observed in answer that the warrant was kept dormant for nine years as indeed no entry of it appeared in the secretary of states books and the deduction of it concealed all that time from the knowledge of parliament that if it had been a free gift from the foreign troops it would not have been stipulated by agreement as the dukes letter confessed and as his warrant declared which latter affirmed this stoppage to be intended for defraying extraordinary contingent expenses of the troops and therefore should not have been applied to secret services they submitted to the house whether the warrant itself were legal or duly countersigned the commissioners added that no receipt was ever given for this deducted money nor was it mentioned in any receipts from the foreign troops which were always taken in full and lastly that the whole sum on computation amounted to near three hundred thousand pounds  the house after a long debate resolved that the taking several sums from the contractors for bread by the duke of marlborough was unwarrantable and illegal and that the two and a half per cent deducted from the foreign troops was public money and ought to be accounted for which resolutions were laid before the queen by the whole house and her majesty promised to do her part in redressing what was complained of the duke and his friends had about the beginning of the war by their credit with the queen procured a warrant from her majesty for this perquisite of two and a half per cent the warrant was directed to the duke of marlborough and countersigned by sir charles hedges then secretary of state by virtue of which the paymastergeneral of the army was to pay the said deducted money to the general and take a receipt in full from the foreign troops  it was observed as very commendable and becoming the dignity of such an assembly that this debate was managed with great temper and with few personal reflections upon the duke of marlborough they seemed only desirous to come at the truth without which they could not answer the trust reposed in them by those whom they represented and left the rest to her majestys prudence the attorneygeneral was ordered to commence an action against the duke for the subtracted money which would have amounted to a great sum enough to ruin any private person except himself this process is still depending although very moderately pursued either by the queens indulgence to one whom she had formerly so much trusted or perhaps to be revived or slackened according to the future demeanour of the defendant4  footnote 4 marlboroughs defence of himself may be found in the parliamentary history vol vi 1079 writing to the earl of strafford under date january 27 1711 bolingbroke speaking of this debate on marlborough says what passed on thursday in the house of commons will i hope show people abroad as well as at home that no merit no grandeur no riches can excuse or save any one who sets himself up in opposition to the queen and he might have added to mrs masham it is to be questioned if marlborough would have had to undergo the ordeal of this debate had it not been for the animosity against him on the part of this lady and her royal mistress so deftly aroused by harley ts  some time after mr cardonnell5 a member of parliament and secretary to the general in flanders was expelled the house for the offence of receiving yearly bribes from those who had contracted to furnish bread for the army and met with no further punishment for a practice voted to be unwarrantable and corrupt  these were all the censures of any moment which the commons under so great a weight of business thought fit to make upon the reports of their commissioners for inspecting the public accounts but having promised in the beginning of this history to examine the state of the nation with respect to its debts by what negligence or corruption they first began and in process of time made such a prodigious increase and lastly what courses have been taken under the present administration to find out funds for answering so many unprovided incumbrances as well as put a stop to new ones i shall endeavour to satisfy the reader upon this important article  by all i have yet read of the history of our own country it appears to me that the national debts secured upon parliamentary funds of interest were things unknown in england before the last revolution under the prince of orange it is true that in the grand rebellion the kings enemies borrowed money of particular persons upon what they called the public faith but this was only for short periods and the sums no more than what they could pay at once as they constantly did some of our kings have been very profuse in peace and war and are blamed in history for their oppressions of the people by severe taxes and for borrowing money which they never paid6 but national debts was a style which i doubt would hardly then be understood when the prince of orange was raised to the throne and a general war began in these parts of europe the king and his counsellors thought it would be ill policy to commence his reign with heavy taxes upon the people who had lived long in ease and plenty and might be apt to think their deliverance too dearly bought wherefore one of the first actions of the new government was to take off the tax upon chimneys as a burthen very ungrateful to the commonalty but money being wanted to support the war which even the conventionparliament that put the crown upon his head were very unwilling he should engage in the present bishop of salisbury7 is said to have found out that expedient which he had learned in holland of raising money upon the security of taxes that were only sufficient to pay a large interest the motives which prevailed on people to fall in with this project were many and plausible for supposing as the ministers industriously gave out that the war could not last above one or two campaigns at most it might be carried on with very moderate taxes and the debts accruing would in process of time be easily cleared after a peace then the bait of large interest would draw in a great number of those whose money by the dangers and difficulties of trade lay dead upon their hands and whoever were lenders to the government would by surest principle be obliged to support it besides the men of estates could not be persuaded without time and difficulty to have those taxes laid on their lands which custom hath since made so familiar and it was the business of such as were then in power to cultivate a moneyed interest because the gentry of the kingdom did not very much relish those new notions in government to which the king who had imbibed his politics in his own country was thought to give too much way neither perhaps did that prince think national incumbrances to be any evil at all since the flourishing republic where he was born is thought to owe more than ever it will be able or willing to pay and i remember when i mentioned to mons buys the many millions we owed he would advance it as a maxim that it was for the interest of the public to be in debt which perhaps may be true in a commonwealth so crazily instituted where the governors cannot have too many pledges of their subjects fidelity and where a great majority must inevitably be undone by any revolution however brought about but to prescribe the same rules to a monarchy whose wealth ariseth from the rents and improvements of lands as well as trade and manufactures is the mark of a confined and cramped understanding  footnote 5 adam cardonnell esq secretary to the duke of marlborough shared in his disgrace see the examiner no 28 wsj  footnote 6 p fitzgerald says which they have not been able or willing to pay wsj  footnote 7 dr gilbert burnet original note  i was moved to speak thus because i am very well satisfied that the pernicious counsels of borrowing money upon public funds of interest as well as some other state lessons were taken indigested from the like practices among the dutch without allowing in the least for any difference in government religion law custom extent of country or manners and dispositions of the people  but when this expedient of anticipations and mortgages was first put in practice artful men in office and credit began to consider what uses it might be applied to and soon found it was likely to prove the most fruitful seminary not only to establish a faction they intended to set up for their own support but likewise to raise vast wealth for themselves in particular who were to be the managers and directors in it it was manifest that nothing could promote these two designs so much as burthening the nation with debts and giving encouragement to lenders for as to the first it was not to be doubted that moneyed men would be always firm to the party of those who advised the borrowing upon such good security and with such exorbitant premiums and interest and every new sum that was lent took away as much power from the landed men as it added to theirs so that the deeper the kingdom was engaged it was still the better for them thus a new estate and property sprung up in the hands of mortgagees to whom every house and foot of land in england paid a rentcharge free of all taxes and defalcations and purchased at less than half value so that the gentlemen of estates were in effect but tenants to these new landlords many of whom were able in time to force the election of boroughs out of the hands of those who had been the old proprietors and inhabitants this was arrived at such a height that a very few years more of war and funds would have clearly cast the balance on the moneyed side  as to the second this project of borrowing upon funds was of mighty advantage to those who were in the management of it as well as to their friends and dependants for funds proving often deficient the government was obliged to strike tallies for making up the rest which tallies were sometimes to speak in the merchants phrase at above forty per cent discount at this price those who were in the secret bought them up and then took care to have that deficiency supplied in the next session of parliament by which they doubled their principal in a few months and for the encouragement of lenders every new project of lotteries or annuities proposed some farther advantage either as to interest or premium  in the year one thousand six hundred and ninetyseven a general mortgage was made of certain revenues and taxes already settled which amounted to near a million a year this mortgage was to continue till one thousand seven hundred and six to be a fund for the payment of about five millions one hundred thousand pounds in the first parliament of the queen the said mortgage was continued till one thousand seven hundred and ten to supply a deficiency of two millions three hundred thousand pounds and interest of above a million and in the intermediate years a great part of that fund was branched out into annuities for ninetynine years so that the late ministry raised all their money to one thousand seven hundred and ten only by continuing funds which were already granted to their hands this deceived the people in general who were satisfied to continue the payments they had been accustomed to and made the administration seem easy since the war went on without any new taxes raised except the very last year they were in power not considering what a mighty fund was exhausted and must be perpetuated although extremely injurious to trade and to the true interest of the nation  this great fund of the general mortgage was not only loaded year after year by mighty sums borrowed upon it but with the interests due upon those sums for which the treasury was forced to strike tallies payable out of that fund after all the money already borrowed upon it there being no other provision of interest for three or four years till at last the fund was so overloaded that it could neither pay principal nor interest and tallies were struck for both which occasioned their great discount  but to avoid mistakes upon a subject where i am not very well versed either in the style or matter i will transcribe an account sent me by a person8 who is thoroughly instructed in these affairs  footnote 8 sir john blunt original note he was one of the first projectors of the south sea company and died in january 1733 wsj  in the year one thousand seven hundred and seven the sum of eight hundred twentytwo thousand three hundred and eighty one pounds fifteen shillings and sixpence was raised by continuing part of the general mortgage from one thousand seven hundred and ten to one thousand seven hundred

in one thousand seven hundred and eight the same funds were continued from one thousand seven hundred and twelve to one thousand seven hundred and fourteen to raise seven hundred twentynine thousand sixtyseven pounds fifteen shillings and sixpence but no provision for interest till august the first one thousand seven hundred and twelve otherwise than as before by striking tallies for it on the same fund payable after all the rest of the money borrowed and the discount of tallies then beginning to rise great part of that money remains still unraised and there is nothing to pay interest for the money lent till august the first one thousand seven hundred and twelve but the late lord treasurer struck tallies for the full sum directed by the act to be borrowed great part of which have been delivered in payment to the navy and victualling offices and some are still in the hands of the government  in one thousand seven hundred and nine part of the same fund was continued from august the first one thousand seven hundred and fourteen to august the first one thousand seven hundred and sixteen to raise six hundred and fortyfive thousand pounds and no provision for interest till august the first one thousand seven hundred and fourteen which was about five years but by borrowing money on the same fund payable after the sums before lent so that little of that money was lent but the tallies were struck for what was unlent some of which were given out for the payment of the navy and victualling and some still remain in the hands of the government  in one thousand seven hundred and ten the sums which were before given from one thousand seven hundred and fourteen to one thousand seven hundred and sixteen were continued from thence to one thousand seven hundred and twenty to raise one million two hundred and ninetysix thousand five hundred and fiftytwo pounds nine shillings and elevenpence three farthings and no immediate provision for interest till august the first one thousand seven hundred and sixteen only after the duty of one shilling per bushel on salt should be cleared from the money it was then charged with and which was not so cleared till midsummer one thousand seven hundred and twelve last then that fund was to be applied to pay the interest till august the first one thousand seven hundred and sixteen which interest amounted to about seventyseven thousand seven hundred and ninetythree pounds per annum and the said salt fund produceth but about fiftyfive thousand pounds per annum so that no money was borrowed upon the general mortgage in one thousand seven hundred and ten except one hundred and fifty thousand pounds lent by the swiss cantons but tallies were struck for the whole sum these all remained in the late treasurers hands at the time of his removal yet the money was expended which occasioned those great demands upon the commissioners of the treasury who succeeded him and were forced to pawn those tallies to the bank or to remitters rather than sell them at twenty or twentyfive per cent discount as the price then was about two hundred thousand pounds of them they paid to clothiers of the army and others and all the rest being above ninety thousand pounds have been subscribed into the south sea company for the use of the public  when the earl of godolphin was removed from his employment he left a debt upon the navy of  millions9 all contracted under his administration10 which had no parliamentsecurity and was daily increased neither could i ever learn whether that lord had the smallest prospect of clearing this incumbrance or whether there were policy negligence or despair at the bottom of this unaccountable management but the consequences were visible and ruinous for by this means navybills grew to be forty per cent discount and upwards and almost every kind of stores bought by the navy and victualling offices cost the government double rates and sometimes more so that the public hath directly lost several millions upon this one article without any sort of necessity that i could ever hear assigned by the ablest vindicators of that party  footnote 9 of      millions in original of  millions in

charge him with cunning are but ill acquainted with his character for in the sense they take the word and as it is usually understood i know no man to whom that mean talent could be with less justice applied as the conduct of affairs while he hath been at the helm doth clearly demonstrate very contrary to the nature and principles of cunning which is always employed in serving little turns proposing little ends and supplying daily exigencies by little shifts and expedients but to rescue a prince out of the hands of insolent subjects bent upon such designs as must probably end in the ruin of the government to find out means for paying such exorbitant debts as this nation hath been involved in and reduce it to a better management to make a potent enemy offer advantageous terms of peace and deliver up the most important fortress of his kingdom as a security11 and this against all the opposition mutually raised and inflamed by parties and allies such performances can only be called cunning by those whose want of understanding or of candour puts them upon finding ill names for great qualities of the mind which themselves do neither possess nor can form any just conception of however it must be allowed that an obstinate love of secrecy in this minister seems at distance to have some resemblance of cunning for he is not only very retentive of secrets but appears to be so too which i number amongst his defects he hath been blamed by his friends for refusing to discover his intentions even in those points where the wisest man may have need of advice and assistance and some have censured him upon that account as if he were jealous of power but he hath been heard to answer that he seldom did otherwise without cause to repent  footnote 11 this is surely a piece of swifts partiality for oxford since it practically deprives bolingbroke of whatever credit was his for the peace of utrecht and that was not a little certainly more than may be given to oxford ts  however so undistinguished a caution cannot in my opinion be justified by which the owner loseth many advantages and whereof all men who deserved to be confided in may with some reason complain his love of procrastination wherein doubtless nature hath her share may probably be increased by the same means but this is an imputation laid upon many other great ministers who like men under too heavy a load let fall that which is of the least consequence and go back to fetch it when their shoulders are free for time is often gained as well as lost by delay which at worst is a fault on the securer side12 neither probably is this minister answerable for half the clamour raised against him upon that article his endeavours are wholly turned upon the general welfare of his country but perhaps with too little regard to that of particular persons which renders him less amiable than he would otherwise have been from the goodness of his humour and agreeable conversation in a private capacity and with few dependers yet some allowance may perhaps be given to this failing which is one of the greatest he hath since he cannot be more careless of other mens fortunes than he is of his own he is master of a very great and faithful memory which is of mighty use in the management of public affairs and i believe there are few examples to be produced in any age of a person who hath passed through so many employments in the state endowed with a great share both of divine and human learning  footnote 12 unfortunately procrastination too often ended for harley in very unpleasant results and it is not too much to say this failing was the indirect cause of his downfall swifts character of oxford as given in this history should be compared with that given of him in an enquiry into the behaviour of the queens last ministry vol v pp 431434 of present edition dr william king to whom swift had written in 1736 for certain dates and official extracts to be included in this history wrote to swift december 7th 1736 referring to this very matter of oxfords character as the letter applies to some other portions of this history it will be better if it be given here  london december 7th 1736  sir  i arrived here yesterday king had been on a visit to paris and i am now ready to obey your commands i hope you are come to a positive resolution concerning the history you need not hesitate about the dates or the references which are to be made to any public papers for i can supply them without the least trouble as well as i remember there is but one of those public pieces which you determined should be inserted at length i mean sir thomas hanmers representation this i have now by me if you incline to publish the two tracts as an appendix to the history you will be pleased to see if the character given of the earl of oxford in the pamphlet of 1715 agrees with the character given of the same person in the history perhaps on a review you may think proper to leave one of them quite out you have i think barely mentioned the attempt of guiscard and the quarrel between rechteren and mesnager but as these are facts which are probably now forgot or unknown it would not be amiss if they were related at large in the notes which may be done from the gazettes or any other newspapers of those times etc see sir w scotts edit vol xix pp 2021 ts  i am persuaded that foreigners as well as those at home who live too remote from the scene of business to be rightly informed will not be displeased with this account of a person who in the space of two years hath been so highly instrumental in changing the face of affairs in europe and hath deserved so well of his own prince and country13  footnote 13 see also swifts enquiry vol v pp 425476 wsj  in that perplexed condition of the public debts which i have already described this minister was brought into the treasury and exchequer and had the chief direction of affairs his first regulation was that of exchequer bills which to the great discouragement of public credit and scandal to the crown were three per cent less in value than the sums specified in them the present treasurer being then chancellor of the exchequer procured an act of parliament by which the bank of england should be obliged in consideration of fortyfive thousand pounds to accept and circulate those bills without any discount he then proceeded to stop the depredations of those who dealt in remittances of money to the army who by unheard of exactions in that kind of traffic had amassed prodigious wealth at the public cost to which the earl of godolphin had given too much way14 possibly by neglect for i think he cannot be accused of corruption  footnote 14 added in the authors own handwriting original note p fitzgerald gives the addition as either through ignorance connivance or neglect wsj  but the new treasurers chief concern was to restore the credit of the nation by finding some settlement for unprovided debts amounting in the whole to ten millions which hung on the public as a load equally heavy and disgraceful without any prospect of being removed and which former ministers never had the care or courage to inspect he resolved to go at once to the bottom of this evil and having computed and summed up the debt of the navy and victualling ordnance and transport of the army and transport debentures made out for the service of the last war of the general mortgage tallies for the year one thousand seven hundred and ten and some other deficiencies he then found out a fund of interest sufficient to answer all this which being applied to other uses could not raise present money for the war but in a very few years would clear the debt it was engaged for the intermediate accruing interest was to be paid by the treasurer of the navy and as a farther advantage to the creditors they should be erected into a company for trading to the south seas and for encouragement of fishery when all this was fully prepared and digested he made a motion in the house of commons who deferred extremely to his judgment and abilities for paying the debts of the navy and other unprovided deficiencies without entering into particulars which was immediately voted but a sudden stop was put to this affair by an unforeseen accident the chancellor of the exchequer which was then his title being stabbed with a penknife the following day at the cockpit in the midst of a dozen lords of the council by the sieur de guiscard a french papist the circumstances of which fact being not within the compass of this history i shall only observe that after two months confinement and frequent danger of his life he returned to his seat in parliament15  footnote 15 see the particular account in the examiner original note the reference is to nos 33 41 and 42 of that paper see vol ix of this edition wsj  the overtures made by this minister of paying so vast a debt under the pressures of a long war and the difficulty of finding supplies for continuing it was during the time of his illness ridiculed by his enemies as an impracticable and visionary project and when upon his return to the house he had explained his proposal the very proprietors of the debt were many of them prevailed on to oppose it although the obtaining this trade either through old spain or directly to the spanish west indies had been one principal end we aimed at by this war however the bill passed and as an immediate consequence the naval bills rose to about twenty per cent nor ever fell within ten of their discount another good effect of this work appeared by the parliamentary lotteries which have been since erected the last of that kind under the former ministry was eleven weeks in filling whereas the first under the present was filled in a very few hours although it cost the government less and the others which followed were full before the acts concerning them could pass and to prevent incumbrances of this kind from growing for the future he took care by the utmost parsimony or by suspending payments where they seemed less to press that all stores for the navy should be bought with ready money by which cent per cent hath been saved in that mighty article of our expense as will appear from an account taken at the victualling office on the 9th of august one thousand seven hundred and twelve and the payment of the interest was less a burthen upon the navy by the stores being bought at so cheap a rate  it might look invidious to enter into farther particulars upon this head but of smaller moment what i have above related may serve to shew in how ill a condition the kingdom stood with relation to its debts by the corruption as well as negligence of former management and what prudent effectual measures have since been taken to provide for old incumbrances and hinder the running into new this may be sufficient for the information of the reader perhaps already tired with a subject so little entertaining as that of accounts i shall therefore now return to relate some of the principal matters that passed in parliament during this session  upon the eighteenth of january the house of lords sent down a bill to the commons for fixing the precedence of the hanover family which probably had been forgot in the acts for settling the succession of the crown that of henry viii which gives the rank to princes of the blood carries it no farther than to nephews nieces and grandchildren of the crown by virtue of which the princess sophia is a princess of the blood as niece to king charles i of england and precedes accordingly but this privilege doth not descend to her son the elector or the electoral prince to supply which defect and pay a compliment to the presumptive heirs of the crown this bill as appeareth by the preamble was recommended by her majesty to the house of lords which the commons to shew their zeal for every thing that might be thought to concern the interest or honour of that illustrious family ordered to be read thrice passed nemine contradicente and returned to the lords without any amendment on the very day it was sent down  but the house seemed to have nothing more at heart than a strict inquiry into the state of the nation with respect to foreign alliances some discourses had been published in print about the beginning of the session boldly complaining of certain articles in the barrier treaty concluded about three years since by the lord viscount townshend between great britain and the states general and shewing in many particulars the unequal conduct of these powers in our alliance in furnishing their quotas and supplies it was asserted by the same writers that these hardships put upon england had been countenanced and encouraged by a party here at home in order to preserve their power which could be no otherwise maintained than by continuing the war as well as by her majestys general abroad upon account of his own peculiar interest and grandeur these loud accusations spreading themselves throughout the kingdom delivered in facts directly charged and thought whether true or not to be but weakly confuted had sufficiently prepared the minds of the people and by putting arguments into every bodys mouth had filled the town and country with controversies both in writing and discourse the point appeared to be of great consequence whether the war continued or not for in the former case it was necessary that the allies should be brought to a more equal regulation and that the states in particular for whom her majesty had done such great things should explain and correct those articles in the barrier treaty which were prejudicial to britain and in either case it was fit the people should have at least the satisfaction of knowing by whose counsels and for what designs they had been so hardly treated  in order to this great inquiry the barrier treaty with all other treaties and agreements entered into between her majesty and her allies during the present war for the raising and augmenting the proportions for the service thereof were by the queens directions laid before the house  several resolutions were drawn up and reported at different times upon the deficiencies of the allies in furnishing their quotas upon certain articles in the barrier treaty and upon the state of the war by all which it appeared that whatever had been charged by public discourses in print against the late ministry and the conduct of the allies was much less than the truth upon these resolutions by one of which the lord viscount townshend who negotiated and signed the barrier treaty was declared an enemy to the queen and kingdom and upon some farther directions to the committee a representation was formed and soon after the commons in a body presented it to the queen the endeavours of the adverse party not prevailing to have it recommitted  this representation supposed to be the work of sir thomas hanmers16 pen is written with much energy and spirit and will be a very useful authentic record for the assistance of those who at any time shall undertake to write the history of the present times  footnote 16 but to which the dean himself contributed a large share s swift writes in his journal under date february 21st i left them at 7 being engaged to go to sir tho hanmer who desired i would see him at that hour his business was that i would help him to draw up the representation which i consented to do vol ii p 340 wsj  i did intend for brevity sake to have given the reader only an abstract of it but upon trial found myself unequal to such a task without injuring so excellent a piece and although i think historical relations are but ill patched up with long transcripts already printed which upon that account i have hitherto avoided yet this being the sum of all debates and resolutions of the house of commons in that great affair of the war i conceived it could not well be omitted1  footnote 17 this representation was printed by s keble by order of the speaker and is also to be found in the journals of the house of commons vol xvii pp 119123 wsj  most gracious sovereign  we your majestys most dutiful and loyal subjects the commons of great britain in parliament assembled having nothing so much at heart as to enable your majesty to bring this long and expensive war to an honourable and happy conclusion have taken it into our most serious consideration how the necessary supplies to be provided by us may be best applied and the common cause may in the most effectual manner be carried on by the united force of the whole confederacy we have thought ourselves obliged in duty to your majesty and in discharge of the trust reposed in us to inquire into the true state of the war in all its parts we have examined what stipulations have been entered into between your majesty and your allies and how far such engagements have on each side been made good we have considered the different interests which the confederates have in the success of this war and the different shares they have contributed to its support we have with our utmost care and diligence endeavoured to discover the nature extent and charge of it to the end that by comparing the weight thereof with our own strength we might adapt the one to the other in such measure as neither to continue your majestys subjects under a heavier burden than in reason and justice they ought to bear nor deceive your majesty your allies and ourselves by undertaking more than the nation in its present circumstances is able to perform  your majesty has been graciously pleased upon our humble applications to order such materials to be laid before us as have furnished us with the necessary information upon the particulars we have inquired into and when we shall have laid before your majesty our observations and humble advice upon this subject we promise to ourselves this happy fruit from it that if your majestys generous and good purposes for the procuring a safe and lasting peace should through the obstinacy of the enemy or by any other means be unhappily defeated a true knowledge and understanding of the past conduct of the war will be the best foundation for a more frugal and equal management of it for the time to come  in order to take the more perfect view of what we proposed and that we might be able to set the whole before your majesty in a true light we have thought it necessary to go back to the beginning of the war and beg leave to observe the motives and reasons upon which his late majesty king william engaged first in it the treaty of the grand alliance explains those reasons to be for the supporting the pretensions of his imperial majesty then actually engaged in a war with the french king who had usurped the entire spanish monarchy for his grandson the duke of anjou and for the assisting the states general who by the loss of their barrier against france were then in the same or a more dangerous condition than if they were actually invaded as these were the just and necessary motives for undertaking this war so the ends proposed to be obtained by it were equally wise and honourable for as they are set forth in the eighth article of the same treaty they appear to have been the procuring an equitable and reasonable satisfaction to his imperial majesty and sufficient securities for the dominions provinces navigation and commerce of the king of great britain and the states general and the making effectual provision that the two kingdoms of france and spain should never be united under the same government and particularly that the french should never get into the possession of the spanish west indies or be permitted to sail thither upon the account of traffic under any pretence whatsoever and lastly the securing to the subjects of the king of great britain and the states general all the same privileges and rights of commerce throughout the whole dominions of spain as they enjoyed before the death of charles the second king of spain by virtue of any treaty agreement or custom or any other way whatsoever for the obtaining these ends the three confederated powers engaged to assist one another with their whole force according to such proportions as should be specified in a particular convention afterwards to be made for that purpose we do not find that any such convention was ever ratified but it appears that there was an agreement concluded which by common consent was understood to be binding upon each party respectively and according to which the proportions of great britain were from the beginning regulated and founded the terms of that agreement were that for the service at land his imperial majesty should furnish ninety thousand men the king of great britain forty thousand and the states general one hundred and two thousand of which there were fortytwo thousand intended to supply their garrisons and sixty thousand to act against the common enemy in the field and with regard to the operations of the war at sea they were agreed to be performed jointly by great britain and the states general the quota of ships to be furnished for that service being fiveeighths on the part of great britain and threeeighths on the part of the states general  upon this foot the war began in the year one thousand seven hundred and two at which time the whole yearly expense of it to england amounted to three millions seven hundred and six thousand four hundred ninetyfour pounds a very great charge as it was then thought by your majestys subjects after the short interval of ease they had enjoyed from the burden of the former war but yet a very moderate proportion in comparison with the load which hath since been laid upon them for it appears by estimates given in to your commons that the sums necessary to carry on the service for this present year in the same manner as it was performed the last year amount to more than six millions nine hundred and sixty thousand pounds besides interest for the public debts and the deficiencies accruing the last year which two articles require one million one hundred and fortythree thousand pounds more so that the whole demands upon your commons are arisen to more than eight millions for the present annual supply we know your majestys tender regard for the welfare of your people will make it uneasy to you to hear of so great a pressure as this upon them and as we are assured it will fully convince your majesty of the necessity of our present inquiry so we beg leave to represent to you from what causes and by what steps this immense charge appears to have grown upon us  the service at sea as it has been very large and extensive in itself so it has been carried on through the whole course of the war in a manner highly disadvantageous to your majesty and your kingdom for the necessity of affairs requiring that great fleets should be fitted out every year as well for the maintaining a superiority in the mediterranean as for opposing any force which the enemy might prepare either at dunkirk or in the ports of west france your majestys example and readiness in fitting out your proportion of ships for all parts of that service have been so far from prevailing with the states general to keep pace with you that they have been deficient every year to a great degree in proportion to what your majesty hath furnished sometimes no less than twothirds and generally more than half of their quota from hence your majesty has been obliged for the preventing disappointments in the most pressing services to supply those deficiencies by additional reinforcements of your own ships nor hath the single increase of such a charge been the only ill consequence that attended it for by this means the debt of the navy hath been enhanced so that the discounts arising upon the credit of it have affected all other parts of the service from the same cause your majestys ships of war have been forced in greater numbers to continue in remote seas and at unseasonable times of the year to the great damage and decay of the british navy this also hath been the occasion that your majesty hath been straitened in your convoys for trade your coasts have been exposed for want of a sufficient number of cruisers to guard them and you have been disabled from annoying the enemy in their most beneficial commerce with the west indies from whence they received those vast supplies of treasure without which they could not have supported the expenses of this war  that part of the war which hath been carried on in flanders was at first immediately necessary to the security of the states general and hath since brought them great acquisitions both of revenue and dominion yet even there the original proportions have been departed from and during the course of the war have been sinking by degrees on the part of holland so that in this last year we find the number in which they fell short of their threefifths to your majestys twofifths have been twenty thousand eight hundred and thirtyseven men we are not unmindful that in the year one thousand seven hundred and three a treaty was made between the two nations for a joint augmentation of twenty thousand men wherein the proportions were varied and england consented to take half upon itself but it having been annexed as an express condition to the grant of the said augmentation in parliament that the states general should prohibit all trade and commerce with france and that condition having not been performed by them the commons think it reasonable that the first rule of three to two ought to have taken place again as well in that as in other subsequent augmentations more especially when they consider that the revenues of those rich provinces which have been conquered would if they were duly applied maintain a great number of new additional forces against the common enemy notwithstanding which the states general have raised none upon that account but make use of those fresh supplies of money only to ease themselves in the charge of their first established quota  as in the progress of the war in flanders a disproportion was soon created to the prejudice of england so the very beginning of the war in portugal brought an unequal share of burden upon us for although the emperor and the states general were equally parties with your majesty in the treaty with the king of portugal yet the emperor neither furnishing his third part of the troops and subsidies stipulated for nor the dutch consenting to take an equal share of his imperial majestys defect upon themselves your majesty hath been obliged to furnish twothirds of the entire expense created by that service nor has the inequality stopped there for ever since the year one thousand seven hundred and six when the english and dutch forces marched out of portugal into castile the states general have entirely abandoned the war in portugal and left your majesty to prosecute it singly at your own charge which you have accordingly done by replacing a greater number of troops there than even at first you took upon you to provide at the same time your majestys generous endeavours for the support and defence of the king of portugal have been but ill seconded by that prince himself for notwithstanding that by his treaty he had obliged himself to furnish twelve thousand foot and three thousand horse upon his own account besides eleven thousand foot and two thousand horse more in consideration of a subsidy paid him yet according to the best information your commons can procure it appears that he hath scarce at any time furnished thirteen thousand men in the whole  in spain the war hath been yet more unequal and burdensome to your majesty than in any other branch of it for being commenced without any treaty whatsoever the allies have almost wholly declined taking any part of it upon themselves a small body of english and dutch troops were sent thither in the year one thousand seven hundred and five not as being thought sufficient to support a regular war or to make the conquest of so large a country but with a view only of assisting the spaniards to set king charles upon the throne occasioned by the great assurances which were given of their inclinations to the house of austria but this expectation failing england was insensibly drawn into an established war under all the disadvantages of the distance of the place and the feeble efforts of the other allies the account we have to lay before your majesty upon this head is that although the undertaking was entered upon at the particular and earnest request of the imperial court and for a cause of no less importance and concern to them than the reducing the spanish monarchy to the house of austria yet neither the late emperors nor his present imperial majesty have ever had any forces there on their own account till the last year and then only one regiment of foot consisting of two thousand men though the states general have contributed something more to this service yet their share also hath been inconsiderable for in the space of four years from one thousand seven hundred and five to one thousand seven hundred and eight both inclusive all the forces they have sent into that country have not exceeded twelve thousand two hundred men and from the year one thousand seven hundred and eight to this time they have not sent any forces or recruits whatsoever to your majestys care and charge the recovery of that kingdom hath been in a manner wholly left as if none else were interested or concerned in it and the forces which your majesty hath sent into spain in the space of seven years from one thousand seven hundred and five to one thousand seven hundred and eleven both inclusive have amounted to no less than fiftyseven thousand nine hundred seventythree men besides thirteen battalions and eighteen squadrons for which your majesty hath paid a subsidy to the emperor  how great the established expense of such a number of men hath been your majesty very well knows and your commons very sensibly feel but the weight will be found much greater when it is considered how many heavy articles of unusual and extraordinary charge have attended this remote and difficult service all which have been entirely defrayed by your majesty except that one of transporting the few forces which were sent by the states general and the victualling of them during their transportation only the accounts delivered to your commons shew that the charge of your majestys ships and vessels employed in the service of the war in spain and portugal reckoned after the rate of four pounds a man per month from the time they sailed from hence till they returned were lost or put upon other services hath amounted to six millions five hundred and forty thousand nine hundred and sixtysix pounds fourteen shillings the charge of transports on the part of great britain for carrying on the war in spain and portugal from the beginning of it till this time hath amounted to one million three hundred thirtysix thousand seven hundred and nineteen pounds nineteen shillings and elevenpence that of victualling land forces for the same service to five hundred eightythree thousand seven hundred and seventy pounds eight shillings and sixpence and that of contingencies and other extraordinaries for the same service to one million eight hundred and forty thousand three hundred and fiftythree pounds  we should take notice to your majesty of several sums paid upon account of contingencies and extraordinaries in flanders making together the sum of one million one hundred and seven thousand and ninetysix pounds but we are not able to make any comparison of them with what the states general have expended upon the same head having no such state of their extraordinary charge before us there remains therefore but one particular more for your majestys observation which arises from the subsidies paid to foreign princes these at the beginning of the war were borne in equal proportion by your majesty and the states general but in this instance also the balance hath been cast in prejudice of your majesty for it appears that your majesty hath since advanced more than your equal proportion three millions one hundred and fiftyfive thousand crowns18 besides extraordinaries paid in italy and not included in any of the foregoing articles which arise to five hundred thirtynine thousand five hundred and fiftythree pounds  footnote 18 in the journals of the house of commons vol xvii p 48 is an exact state of all the subsidies and extra expenses from 1702 to 1711 n  we have laid these several particulars before your majesty in the shortest manner we have been able and by an estimate grounded on the preceding facts it does appear that over and above the quotas on the part of great britain answering to those contributed by your allies more than nineteen millions have been expended by your majesty during the course of this war by way of surplusage or exceeding in balance of which none of the confederates have furnished any thing whatsoever  it is with very great concern that we find so much occasion given us to represent how ill an use hath been made of your majestys and your subjects zeal for the common cause that the interest of that cause hath not been proportionably promoted by it but others only have been eased at your majestys and your subjects costs and have been connived at in laying their part of the burden upon this kingdom although they have upon all accounts been equally and in most respects much more nearly concerned than britain in the issue of the war we are persuaded your majesty will think it pardonable in us with some resentment to complain of the little regard which some of those whom your majesty of late years intrusted have shewn to the interests of their country in giving way at least to such unreasonable impositions upon it if not in some measure contriving them the course of which impositions hath been so singular and extraordinary that the more the wealth of this nation hath been exhausted and the more your majestys arms have been attended with success the heavier hath been the burden laid upon us whilst on the other hand the more vigorous your majestys efforts have been and the greater the advantages which have redounded thence to your allies the more those allies have abated in their share of the expense  at the first entrance into this war the commons were induced to exert themselves in the extraordinary manner they did and to grant such large supplies as had been unknown to former ages in hopes thereby to prevent the mischiefs of a lingering war and to bring that in which they were necessarily engaged to a speedy conclusion but they have been very unhappy in the event whilst they have so much reason to suspect that what was intended to shorten the war hath proved the very cause of its long continuance for those to whom the profits of it have accrued have been disposed not easily to forgo them and your majesty will from thence discern the true reason why so many have delighted in a war which brought in so rich an harvest yearly from great britain  we are as far from desiring as we know your majesty will be from concluding any peace but upon safe and honourable terms and we are far from intending to excuse ourselves from raising all necessary and possible supplies for an effectual prosecution of the war till such a peace can be obtained all that your faithful commons aim at all that they wish is an equal concurrence from the other powers engaged in alliance with your majesty and a just application of what hath been already gained from the enemy towards promoting the common cause several large countries and territories have been restored to the house of austria such as the kingdom of naples the duchy of milan and other places in italy others have been conquered and added to their dominions as the two electorates of bavaria and cologne the duchy of mantua and the bishopric of liège these having been reduced in great measure by our blood and treasure may we humbly conceive with great reason be claimed to come in aid towards carrying on the war in spain and therefore we make it our earnest request to your majesty that you will give instructions to your ministers to insist with the emperor that the revenues of those several places excepting only such a portion thereof as is necessary for their defence be actually so applied and as to the other parts of the war to which your majesty hath obliged yourself by particular treaties to contribute we humbly beseech your majesty that you will be pleased to take effectual care that your allies do perform their parts stipulated by those treaties and that your majesty will for the future no otherwise furnish troops or pay subsidies than in proportion to what your allies shall actually furnish and pay when this justice is done to your majesty and to your people there is nothing which your commons will not cheerfully grant towards supporting your majesty in the cause in which you are engaged and whatever farther shall appear to be necessary for carrying on the war either at sea or land we will effectually enable your majesty to bear your reasonable share of any such expense and will spare no supplies which your subjects are able with their utmost efforts to afford  after having enquired into and considered the state of the war in which the part your majesty has borne appears to have been not only superior to that of any one ally but even equal to that of the whole confederacy your commons naturally inclined to hope that they should find care had been taken of securing some particular advantages to britain in the terms of a future peace such as might afford a prospect of making the nation amends in time for that immense treasure which has been expended and those heavy debts which have been contracted in the course of so long and burdensome a war this reasonable expectation could no way have been better answered than by some provision made for the further security and the greater improvement of the commerce of great britain but we find ourselves so very far disappointed in these hopes that in a treaty not long since concluded between your majesty and the states general under colour of a mutual guarantee given for two points of the greatest importance to both nations the succession and the barrier it appears the interest of great britain hath been not only neglected but sacrificed and that several articles in the said treaty are destructive to the trade and welfare of this kingdom and therefore highly dishonourable to your majesty  your commons observe in the first place that several towns and places are by virtue of this treaty to be put into the hands of the states general particularly nieuport dendermonde and the castle of ghent which can in no sense be looked upon as part of a barrier against france but being the keys of the netherlands towards britain must make the trade of your majestys subjects in those parts precarious and whenever the states think fit totally exclude them from it the pretended necessity of putting these places into the hands of the states general in order to secure to them a communication with their barrier must appear vain and groundless for the sovereignty of the low countries being not to remain to an enemy but to a friend and an ally that communication must be always secure and uninterrupted besides that in case of a rupture or any attack the states have full liberty allowed them to take possession of all the spanish netherlands and therefore needed no particular stipulation for the towns above mentioned  having taken notice of this concession made to the states general for seizing upon the whole ten provinces we cannot but observe to your majesty that in the manner this article is framed it is another dangerous circumstance which attends this treaty for had such a provision been confined to the case of an apparent attack from france only the avowed design of this treaty had been fulfilled and your majestys instructions to your ambassador had been pursued but this necessary restriction hath been omitted and the same liberty is granted to the states to take possession of all the netherlands whenever they shall think themselves attacked by any other neighbouring nation as when they shall be in danger from france so that if it should at any time happen which your commons are very unwilling to suppose that they should quarrel even with your majesty the riches strength and advantageous situation of these countries may be made use of against yourself without whose generous and powerful assistance they had never been conquered  to return to those ill consequences which relate to the trade of your kingdoms we beg leave to observe to your majesty that though this treaty revives and renders your majesty a party to the fourteenth and fifteenth articles of the treaty of munster19 by virtue of which the impositions upon all goods and merchandises brought into the spanish low countries by the sea are to equal those laid on goods and merchandises imported by the scheldt and the canals of sass and swyn and other mouths of the sea adjoining yet no care is taken to preserve that equality upon the exportation of those goods out of the spanish provinces into those countries and places which by virtue of this treaty are to be in the possession of the states the consequence of which must in time be and your commons are informed that in some instances it has already proved to be the case that the impositions upon goods carried into those countries and places by the subjects of the states general will be taken off while those upon the goods imported by your majestys subjects remain by which means great britain will entirely lose this most beneficial branch of trade which it has in all ages been possessed of even from the time when those countries were governed by the house of burgundy one of the most ancient as well as the most useful allies to the crown of england  footnote 19 concluded june 30th 1643 see note in vol v p 150 of present edition ts  with regard to the other dominions and territories of spain your majestys subjects have always been distinguished in their commerce with them and both by ancient treaties and an uninterrupted custom have enjoyed greater privileges and immunities of trade than either the hollanders or any other nation whatsoever and that wise and excellent treaty of the grand alliance provides effectually for the security and continuance of these valuable privileges to britain in such a manner as that each nation might be left at the end of war upon the same foot as it stood at the commencement of it but this treaty we now complain of instead of confirming your subjects rights surrenders and destroys them for although by the sixteenth and seventeenth articles of the treaty of munster made between his catholic majesty and the states general all advantages of trade are stipulated for and granted to the hollanders equal to what the english enjoyed yet the crown of england not being a party to that treaty the subjects of england have never submitted to those articles of it nor even the spaniards themselves ever observed them but this treaty revives those articles in prejudice of great britain and makes your majesty a party to them and even a guarantee to the states general for privileges against your own people  in how deliberate and extraordinary a manner your majestys ambassador consented to deprive your subjects of their ancient rights and your majesty of the power of procuring to them any new advantage most evidently appears from his own letters which by your majestys directions have been laid before your commons20 for when matters of advantage to your majesty and to your kingdom had been offered as proper to be made parts of this treaty they were refused to be admitted by the states general upon this reason and principle that nothing foreign to the guaranties of the succession and of the barrier should be mingled with them notwithstanding which the states general had no sooner received notice of a treaty of commerce concluded between your majesty and the present emperor but they departed from the rule proposed before and insisted upon the article of which your commons now complain which article your majestys ambassador allowed of although equally foreign to the succession or the barrier and although he had for that reason departed from other articles which would have been for the service of his own country  footnote 20 printed in the journals vol xvii pp 8789 n  we have forborne to trouble your majesty with general observations upon this treaty as it relates to and affects the empire and other parts of europe the mischiefs which arise from it to great britain are what only we have presumed humbly to represent to you as they are very evident and very great and as it appears that the lord viscount townshend had not any orders or authority for concluding several of those articles which are most prejudicial to your majestys subjects we have thought we could do no less than declare your said ambassador who negotiated and signed and all others who advised the ratifying of this treaty enemies to your majesty and to your kingdom  upon these faithful informations and advices from your commons we assure ourselves your majesty in your great goodness to your people will rescue them from those evils which the private counsels of illdesigning men have exposed them to and that in your great wisdom you will find some means for the explaining and amending the several articles of this treaty so as that they may consist with the interest of great britain and with real and lasting friendship between your majesty and the states general21  footnote 21 this representation was presented to her majesty march 4th 17112 and answered march 5th n  between the representation and the first debates upon the subject of it several weeks had passed during which time the parliament had other matters likewise before them that deserve to be mentioned for on the ninth of february was repealed the act for naturalizing foreign protestants which had been passed under the last ministry and as many people thought to very ill purposes by this act any foreigner who would take the oaths to the government and profess himself a protestant of whatever denomination was immediately naturalized and had all the privileges of an english born subject at the expense of a shilling22 most protestants abroad differ from us in the points of church government so that all the acquisitions by this act would increase the number of dissenters and therefore the proposal that such foreigners should be obliged to conform to the established worship was rejected but because several persons were fond of this project as a thing that would be of mighty advantage to the kingdom i shall say a few words upon it  footnote 22 see the examiner nos 26 and 45 in vol ix of this edition wsj  the maxim that people are the riches of a nation hath been crudely understood by many writers and reasoners upon that subject there are several ways by which people are brought into a country sometimes a nation is invaded and subdued and the conquerors seize the lands and make the natives their undertenants or servants colonies have been always planted where the natives were driven out or destroyed or the land uncultivated and waste in those countries where the lord of the soil is master of the labour and liberty of his tenants or of slaves bought by his money mens riches are reckoned by the number of their vassals and sometimes in governments newly instituted where there are not people to till the ground many laws have been made to encourage and allure numbers from the neighbouring countries and in all these cases the new comers have either lands allotted them or are slaves to the proprietors but to invite helpless families by thousands into a kingdom inhabited like ours without lands to give them and where the laws will not allow that they should be part of the property as servants is a wrong application of the maxim and the same thing in great as infants dropped at the doors which are only a burthen and charge to the parish the true way of multiplying mankind to public advantage in such a country as england is to invite from abroad only able handicraftsmen and artificers or such who bring over a sufficient share of property to secure them from want to enact and enforce sumptuary laws against luxury and all excesses in clothing furniture and the like to encourage matrimony and reward as the romans did those who have a certain number of children whether bringing over the palatines were a mere consequence of this law for a general naturalization or whether as many surmised it had some other meaning it appeared manifestly by the issue that the public was a loser by every individual among them and that a kingdom can no more be the richer by such an importation than a man can be fatter by a wen which is unsightly and troublesome at best and intercepts that nourishment which would otherwise diffuse itself through the whole body  about a fortnight after the commons sent up a bill for securing the freedom of parliaments by limiting the number of members in that house who should be allowed to possess employments under the crown23 bills to the same effect promoted by both parties had after making the like progress been rejected in former parliaments the court and ministry who will ever be against such a law having usually a greater influence in the house of lords and so it happened now although that influence were less i am apt to think that such a law would be too thorough a reformation in one point while we have so many corruptions in the rest and perhaps the regulations already made on that article are sufficient by which several employments incapacitate a man from being chosen a member and all of them bring it to a new election24  footnote 23 this selfdenying ordinance easily passed through the house of commons where probably men were ashamed of opposing it and in such a temper were the peers in whose house the ministry proposed to make the stand that it was very likely to have passed there also but an amendment was ingeniously thrown in to suspend the operation of the proposed act until after the queens death so that it was evaded for the present and never again revived s the bill was rejected february 29th 17112 wsj   footnote 24 p fitzgerald adds neither do i believe any man who truly understands and loves our constitution will imagine that the prerogative hath not been sufficiently humbled within twenty years past wsj  for my own part when i consider the temper of particular persons and by what maxims they have acted almost without exception in their private capacities i cannot conceive how such a bill should obtain a majority unless every man expected to be one of the fifty which i think was the limitation intended  about the same time likewise the house of commons advanced one considerable step towards securing us against farther impositions from our allies resolving that the additional forces should be continued but with a condition that the dutch should make good their proportion of threefifths to twofifths which those confederates had so long and in so great degree neglected the duke of marlboroughs deduction of two and a half per cent from the pay of the foreign troops was also applied for carrying on the war25  footnote 25 in the journals of the house of commons vol xvii pp 1518 the report of the commissioners is printed in which is included the dukes justification of his conduct see above p 85 n  lastly within this period is to be included the act passed to prevent the disturbing those of the episcopal communion in scotland26 in the exercise of their religious worship and in the use of the liturgy of the church of england27 it is known enough that the most considerable of the nobility and gentry there as well as great numbers of the people dread the tyrannical discipline of those synods and presbyteries and at the same time have the utmost contempt for the abilities and tenets of their teachers it was besides thought an inequality beyond all appearance of reason or justice that dissenters of every denomination here who are the meanest and most illiterate part amongst us should possess a toleration by law under colour of which they might upon occasion be bold enough to insult the religion established while those of the episcopal church in scotland28 groaned under a real persecution the only specious objection against this bill was that it set the religion by law in both parts of the island upon a different foot directly contrary to the union because by an act passed this very session against occasional conformity our dissenters were shut out from all employments a petition from carstares and other scotch professors against this bill was offered to the house but not accepted and a motion made by the other party to receive a clause that should restrain all persons who have any office in scotland28 from going to episcopal meetings passed in the negative it is manifest that the promoters of this clause were not moved by any regard for scotland28 which is by no means their favourite at present only they hoped that if it were made part of a law it might occasion such a choice of representatives in both houses from scotland28 as would be a considerable strength to their faction here but the proposition was in itself extremely absurd that so many lords and other persons of distinction who have great employments pensions posts in the army and other places of profit many of whom are in frequent or constant attendance at the court and utterly dislike their national way of worship should be deprived of their liberty of conscience at home not to mention those who are sent thither from hence to take care of the revenue and other affairs who would ill digest the changing of their religion for that of scotland28  with a farther view of favour towards the episcopal clergy of scotland28 three members of that country were directed to bring in a bill for restoring the patrons to their ancient rights of presenting ministers to the vacant churches there which the kirk during the height of their power had obtained for themselves29 and to conclude this subject at once the queen at the close of the session commanded mr secretary st john to acquaint the house that pursuant to their address the profits arising from the bishops estates in scotland which remained in the crown should be applied to the support of such of the episcopal clergy there as would take the oaths to her majesty30  footnote 26 p fitzgerald says north britain wsj  footnote 27 the act to prevent etc 10 ann c 10 was ordered january 21st and received the royal

1712 10 ann c 21 it did not refer to the episcopal church wsj  the church of scotland viewed the bills for restoring to the gentry the right of patronage and for tolerating the exercise of the episcopal persuasion with great jealousy the reverend mr william carstares who had been secretary to king william and was principal of the college of edinburgh was deputed to go to london at the head of a commission of the church to oppose the bills while in dependence his biographer has justly remarked that these enactments considered at the time as fatal to the interests of presbytery in scotland have upon experience proved her best security  upon the one hand the act of toleration by taking the weapon of offence out of the hands of the presbyterians removed the chief grounds of those resentments which the friends of prelacy entertained against them and in a few years almost annihilated episcopacy in scotland upon the other hand the act restoring patronages by restoring the nobility and gentlemen of property to then wonted influence in the settlement of the clergy reconciled numbers of them to the established church who had conceived the most violent prejudices against that mode of election and against the presbyterian clergy who were settled upon it it is likewise an incontestable fact that from the date of these two acts the church of scotland has enjoyed a state of tranquillity to which she was an utter stranger before life of carstares prefixed to carstaress state papers 1774 p 85 s  footnote 30 this message was reported to the house of commons june 19th 1712 wsj  nothing could more amply justify the proceedings of the queen and her ministers for two years past than that famous representation above at large recited the unbiassed wisdom of the nation after the strictest inquiry confirming those facts upon which her majestys counsels were grounded and many persons who were before inclined to believe that the allies and the late ministry had been too much loaded by the malice misrepresentations or ignorance of writers were now fully convinced of their mistake by so great an authority upon this occasion i cannot forbear doing justice to mr st john31 who had been secretary of war for several years under the former administration where he had the advantage of observing how affairs were managed both at home and abroad he was one of those who shared in the present treasurers fortune resigning his employment at the same time and upon that ministers being again taken into favour this gentleman was some time after made secretary of state there he began afresh by the opportunities of his station to look into past miscarriages and by the force of an extraordinary genius and application to public affairs joined with an invincible eloquence laid open the scene of miscarriages and corruptions through the whole course of the war in so evident a manner that the house of commons seemed principally directed in their resolutions upon this inquiry by his information and advice in a short time after the representation was published there appeared a memorial in the dutch gazette as by order of the states reflecting very much upon the said representation as well as the resolutions on which it was founded pretending to deny some of the facts and to extenuate others this memorial translated into english a common writer of news had the boldness to insert in one of his papers a complaint being made thereof to the house of commons they voted the pretended memorial to be a false scandalous malicious libel and ordered the printer to be taken into custody32  footnote 31 see his character in swifts enquiry vol v pp 430431 of this edition wsj  footnote 32 the memorial appeared in the daily courant of 7th and 8th april for which samuel buckley the writer and printer was ordered by the house of commons to be taken into custody on april 11th wsj  it was the misfortune of the ministers that while they were baited by their professed adversaries of the discontented faction acting in confederacy with emissaries of foreign powers to break the measures her majesty had taken towards a peace they met at the same time with frequent difficulties from those who agreed and engaged with them to pursue the same general end but sometimes disapproved the methods as too slack and remiss or in appearance now and then perhaps a little dubious in the first session of this parliament a considerable number of gentlemen all members of the house of commons began to meet by themselves and consult what course they ought to steer in this new world they intended to revive a new country party in parliament which might as in former times oppose the court in any proceedings they disliked the whole body was of such who profess what is commonly called highchurch principles upon which account they were irreconcilable enemies to the late ministry and all its adherents on the other side considering the temper of the new men in power that they were persons who had formerly moved between the two extremes those gentlemen who were impatient for an entire change and to see all their adversaries laid at once as low as the dust began to be apprehensive that the work would be done by halves but the juncture of affairs at that time both at home and abroad would by no means admit of the least precipitation although the queen and her first minister had been disposed to it which certainly they were not neither did the court seem at all uneasy at this league formed in appearance against it but composed of honest gentlemen who wished well to their country in which both were entirely agreed although they might differ about the means or if such a society should begin to grow resty nothing was easier than to divide them and render all their endeavours ineffectual33  footnote 33 see swifts advice to members of the october club vol v pp 207225 wsj  but in the course of that first session many of this society became gradually reconciled to the new ministry whom they found to be greater objects of the common enemys hatred than themselves and the attempt of guiscard as it gained farther time for deferring the disposal of employments so it much endeared that person to the kingdom who was so near falling a sacrifice to the safety of his country upon the last session of which i am now writing this october club as it was called renewed their usual meetings but were now very much altered from their original institution and seemed to have wholly dropped the design as of no further use they saw a point carried in the house of lords against the court that would end in the ruin of the kingdom and they observed the enemys whole artillery directly levelled at the treasurers head in short the majority of the club had so good an understanding with the great men at court that two of the latter34 to shew to the world how fair a correspondence there was between the court and country party consented to be at one of their dinners but this intercourse had an event very different from what was expected for immediately the more zealous members of that society broke off from the rest and composed a new one made up of gentlemen who seemed to expect little of the court and perhaps with a mixture of others who thought themselves disappointed or too long delayed35 many of these were observed to retain an incurable jealousy of the treasurer and to interpret all delays which they could not comprehend as a reserve of favour in this minister to the persons and principles of the abandoned party  footnote 34 mr st john and mr bromley n  footnote 35 this was called the march club but did not long subsist it seems probable that it included those tories whose principles went the length of jacobitism s  upon an occasion offered about this time some persons out of distrust to the treasurer endeavoured to obtain a point which could not have been carried without putting all into confusion a bill was brought into the house of commons appointing commissioners to examine into the value of all lands and other interests granted by the crown since the thirteenth day of february one thousand six hundred and eightyeight and upon what considerations such grants had been made the united country interest in the house was extremely set upon passing this bill they had conceived an opinion from former precedents that the court would certainly oppose all steps towards a resumption of grants and those who were apprehensive that the treasurer inclined the same way proposed the bill should be tacked to another for raising a fund by duties upon soap and paper which hath been always imputed whether justly or no as a favourite expedient of those called the tory party at the same time it was very well known that the house of lords had made a fixed and unanimous resolution against giving their concurrence to the passing such united bills so that the consequences of this project must have been to bring the ministry under difficulties to stop the necessary supplies and endanger the good correspondence between both houses notwithstanding all which the majority carried it for a tack and the committee was instructed accordingly to make the two bills into one whereby the worst that could happen would have followed if the treasurer had not convinced the warm leaders in this affair by undeniable reasons that the means they were using would certainly disappoint the end that neither himself nor any other of the queens servants were at all against this enquiry and he promised his utmost credit to help forward the bill in the house of lords he prevailed at last to have it sent up single but their lordships gave it another kind of reception those who were of the side opposite to the court withstood it to a man as in a party case among the rest some very personally concerned and others by friends and relations which they supposed a sufficient excuse to be absent or dissent even those whose grants were antecedent to this intended inspection began to be alarmed as men whose neighbours houses are on fire a shew of zeal for the late kings honour occasioned many reflections upon the date of this enquiry which was to commence with his reign and the earl of nottingham who had now flung away the mask which he had lately pulled off like one who had no other view but that of vengeance against the queen and her friends acted consistently enough with his design by voting as a lord against the bill after he had directed his son in the house of commons to vote for the tack  thus miscarried this popular bill for appointing commissioners to examine into royal grants but whether those chiefly concerned did rightly consult their own interest hath been made a question which perhaps time will resolve it was agreed that the queen by her own authority might have issued out a commission for such an enquiry and every body believed that the intention of the parliament was only to tax the grants with about three years purchase and at the same time establish the proprietors in possession of the remainder for ever so that upon the whole the grantees would have been great gainers by such an act since the titles of those lands as they stood then were hardly of half value with others either for sale or settlement besides the examples of the irish forfeitures might have taught these precarious owners that when the house of commons hath once engaged in a pursuit which they think is right although it be stopped or suspended for a while they will be sure to renew it upon every opportunity that offers and seldom fail of success for instance if the resumption should happen to be made part of a supply which can be easily done without the objection of a tack the grantees might possibly then have much harder conditions given them and i do not see how they could prevent it whether the resuming of royal grants be consistent with good policy or justice would be too long a disquisition besides the profusion of kings is not like to be a grievance for the future because there have been laws since made to provide against that evil or indeed rather because the crown has nothing left to give away but the objection made against the date of the intended enquiry was invidious and trifling for king james ii made very few grants he was a better manager and squandering was none of his faults whereas the late king who came over here a perfect stranger to our laws and to our people regardless of posterity wherein he was not likely to survive thought he could no way better strengthen a new title than by purchasing friends at the expense of every thing which was in his power to part with  the reasonableness of uniting to a money bill one of a different nature which is usually called tacking hath been likewise much debated and will admit of argument enough in ancient times when a parliament was held the commons first proposed their grievances to be redressed and then gave their aids so that it was a perfect bargain between the king and the subject this fully answered the ends of tacking aids were then demanded upon occasions which would hardly pass at present such for instance as those for making the kings son a knight marrying his eldest daughter and some others of the like sort most of the money went into the kings coffers for his private use neither was he accountable for any part of it hence arose the form of the kings thanking his subjects for their benevolence when any subsidies tenths or fifteenths were given him but the supplies now granted are of another nature and cannot be properly called a particular benefit to the crown because they are all appropriated to their several uses so that when the house of commons tack to a money bill what is foreign and hard to be digested if it be not passed they put themselves and their country in as great difficulties as the prince on the other side there have been several regulations made through the course of time in parliamentary proceedings among which it is grown a rule that a bill once rejected shall not be brought up again the same session whereby the commons seem to have lost the advantage of purchasing a redress of their grievances by granting supplies which upon some emergencies hath put them upon this expedient of tacking so that there is more to be said on each side of the case than is convenient for me to trouble the reader or myself in deducing  among the matters of importance during this session we may justly number the proceedings of the house of commons with relation to the press since her majestys message to the house of january the seventeenth concludes with a paragraph representing the great licences taken in publishing false and scandalous libels such as are a reproach to any government and recommending to them to find a remedy equal to the mischief the meaning of these words in the message seems to be confined to these weekly and daily papers and pamphlets reflecting upon the persons and the management of the ministry but the house of commons in their address which answers this message makes an addition of the blasphemies against god and religion and it is certain that nothing would be more for the honour of the legislature than some effectual law for putting a stop to this universal mischief but as the person36 who advised the queen in that part of her message had only then in his thoughts the redressing of the political and factious libels i think he ought to have taken care by his great credit in the house to have proposed some ways by which that evil might be removed the law for taxing single papers having produced a quite contrary effect as was then foreseen by many persons and hath since been found true by experience for the adverse party full of rage and leisure since their fall and unanimous in defence of their cause employ a set of writers by subscription who are well versed in all the topics of defamation and have a style and genius levelled to the generality of readers while those who would draw their pens on the side of their prince and country are discouraged by this tax which exceeds the intrinsic value both of the materials and the work a thing if i be not mistaken without example  footnote 36 mr secretary st john now lord viscount bolingbroke original note  it must be acknowledged that the bad practices of printers have been such as to deserve the severest animadversions of the public and it is to be wished the party quarrels of the pen were always managed with decency and truth but in the mean time to open the mouths of our enemies and shut our own is a turn of politics that wants a little to be explained perhaps the ministry now in possession because they are in possession may despise such trifles as this and it is not to be denied that acting as they do upon a national interest they may seem to stand in less need of such supports or may safely fling them down as no longer necessary but if the leaders of the other party had proceeded by this maxim their power would have been none at all or of very short duration and had not some active pens fallen in to improve the good dispositions of the people upon the late change and continued since to overthrow the falsehood plentifully and sometimes not unplausibly scattered by the adversaries i am very much in doubt whether those at the helm would now have reason to be pleased with their success a particular person may with more safety despise the opinion of the vulgar because it does a wise man no real harm or good but the administration a great deal and whatever side has the sole management of the pen will soon find hands enough to write down their enemies as low as they please if the people had no other idea of those whom her majesty trusts in her greatest affairs than what is conveyed by the passions of such as would compass sea and land for their destruction what could they expect but to be torn in pieces by the rage of the multitude how necessary therefore was it that the world should from time to time be undeceived by true representations of persons and facts which have kept the kingdom steady to its interest against all the attacks of a cunning and virulent faction  however the mischiefs of the press were too exorbitant to be cured by such a remedy as a tax upon the smaller papers and a bill for a much more effectual regulation of it was brought into the house of commons but so late in the session that there was no time to pass it for there hath hitherto always appeared an unwillingness to cramp overmuch the liberty of the press whether from the inconveniencies apprehended from doing too much or too little or whether the benefit proposed by each party to themselves from the service of their writers towards recovering or preserving of power be thought to outweigh the disadvantages however it came about this affair was put off from one week to another and the bill not brought into the house till the eighth of june it was committed three days and then heard of no more in this bill there was a clause inserted whether industriously with design to overthrow it that the authors name and place of abode should be set to every printed book pamphlet or paper which i believe no man who hath the least regard to learning would give his consent to for besides the objection to this clause from the practice of pious men who in publishing excellent writings for the service of religion have chosen out of an humble christian spirit to conceal their names it is certain that all persons of true genius or knowledge have an invincible modesty and suspicion of themselves upon their first sending their thoughts into the world and that those who are dull or superficial void of alltaste and judgment have dispositions directly contrary so that if this clause had made part of a law there would have been an end in all likelihood of any valuable production for the future either in wit or learning and that insufferable race of stupid people who are now every day loading the press would then reign alone in time destroy our very first principles of reason and introduce barbarity amongst us which is already kept out with so much difficulty by so few hands  having given an account of the several steps made towards a peace from the first overtures begun by france to the commencement of the second session i shall in the fourth book relate the particulars of this great negotiation from the period last mentioned to the present time and because there happened some passages in both houses occasioned by the treaty i shall take notice of them under that head there only remains to be mentioned one affair of another nature which the lords and commons took into their cognizance after a very different manner wherewith i shall close this part of my subject  the sect of quakers amongst us whose system of religion first founded upon enthusiasm hath been many years growing into a craft held it an unlawful action to take an oath to a magistrate this doctrine was taught them by the author of their sect from a literal application of the text swear not at all but being a body of people wholly turned to trade and commerce of all kinds they found themselves on many occasions deprived of the benefit of the law as well as of voting at elections by a foolish scruple which their obstinacy would not suffer them to get over to prevent this inconvenience these people had credit enough in the late reign to have an act passed that their solemn affirmation and declaration should be accepted instead of an oath in the usual form the great concern in those times was to lay all religion upon a level in order to which this maxim was advanced that no man ought to be denied the liberty of serving his country upon account of a different belief in speculative opinions under which term some people were apt to include every doctrine of christianity however this act in favour of the quakers was only temporary in order to keep them in constant dependence and expired of course after a certain term if it were not continued those people had therefore very early in the session offered a petition to the house of commons for a continuance of the act which was not suffered to be brought up upon this they applied themselves to the lords who passed a bill accordingly and sent it down to the commons where it was not so much as allowed a first reading  and indeed it is not easy to conceive upon what motives the legislature of so great a kingdom could descend so low as to be ministerial and subservient to the caprices of the most absurd heresy that ever appeared in the world and this in a point where those deluding or deluded people stand singular from all the rest of mankind who live under civil government but the designs of an aspiring party at that time were not otherwise to be compassed than by undertaking any thing that would humble and mortify the church and i am fully convinced that if a sect of sceptic philosophers who profess to doubt of every thing had been then among us and mingled their tenets with some corruptions of christianity they might have obtained the same privilege and that a law would have been enacted whereby the solemn doubt of the people called sceptics should have been accepted instead of an oath in the usual form so absurd are all maxims formed upon the inconsistent principles of faction when once they are brought to be examined by the standard of truth and reason                                    the history of the four last  years of the queen  book iv   we left the plenipotentiaries of the allies and those of the enemy preparing to assemble at utrecht on the first of january ns in order to form a congress for negotiating a general peace wherein although the dutch had made a mighty merit of their compliance with the queen yet they set all their instruments at work to inflame both houses against her majestys measures mons bothmar the hanover envoy took care to print and disperse his memorial of which i have formerly spoken hoffman the emperors resident was soliciting for a yacht and convoys to bring over prince eugene at this juncture fortified as it was given out with great proposals from the imperial court the earl of nottingham became a convert for reasons already mentioned money was distributed where occasion required and the dukes of somerset and marlborough together with the earl of godolphin had put themselves at the head of the junto and their adherents in order to attack the court  some days after the vote passed the house of lords for admitting into the address the earl of nottinghams clause against any peace without spain mons buys the dutch envoy who had been deep in all the consultations with the discontented party for carrying that point was desired to meet with the lord privy seal the earl of dartmouth and mr secretary st john in order to sign a treaty between the queen and the states to subsist after a peace there the envoy took occasion to expostulate upon the advantages stipulated for britain with france said it was his opinion that those ministers ought in respect of the friendship between both nations to acquaint him what these advantages were and that he looked upon his country to be entitled by treaty to share them equally with us that there was now another reason why we should be more disposed to comply with him upon this head for since the late resolution of the house of lords he took it for granted it would be a dangerous step in us to give spain to a prince of the house of bourbon and therefore that we should do well to induce the states by such a concession to help us out of this difficulty  mr st john made answer that there was not a man in the queens council capable of so base a thought that if buys had any thing to complain of which was injurious to holland or justly tending to hurt the good correspondence between us and the states he was confident her majesty would at all times be ready to give it up but that the ministers scorned to screen themselves at the expense of their country that the resolution buys mentioned was chiefly owing to foreign ministers intermeddling in our affairs and would perhaps have an effect the projectors did not foresee that if the peace became impracticable the house of commons would certainly put the war upon another foot and reduce the public expense within such a compass as our treaties required in the strictest sense and as our present condition would admit leaving the partisans for war to supply the rest  although the secretary believed this answer would put an end to such infamous proposals it fell out otherwise for shortly after mons buys applied himself to the treasurer promising to undertake that his masters should give up the article of spain provided they might share with us in the assiento for negroes to which the treasurers answer was short that he would rather lose his head than consent to such an offer  it is manifest by this proceeding that whatever schemes were forming here at home in this juncture by the enemies to the peace the dutch only designed to fall in with it as far as it would answer their own account and by a strain of the lower politics wherein they must be allowed to excel every country in christendom lay upon the watch for a good bargain by taking advantage of the distress they themselves had brought upon their nearest neighbour and ally  but the queen highly resented this indignity from a republic upon whom she had conferred so many obligations she could not endure that the dutch should employ their instruments to act in confederacy with a cabal of factious people who were prepared to sacrifice the safety of their prince and country to the recovery of that power they had so long possessed and abused her majesty knew very well that whatever were the mistaken or affected opinion of some people at home upon the article of spain it was a point the states had long given up who had very openly told our ministry that the war in that country was only our concern and what their republic had nothing to do with it is true the partyleaders were equally convinced that the recovery of spain was impracticable but many things may be excused in a professed adversary fallen under disgrace which are highly criminal in an ally upon whom we are that very instant conferring new favours her majesty therefore thought it high time to exert herself and at length put a stop to foreign influence upon british counsels so that after the earl of nottinghams clause against any peace without spain was carried in the house of lords directions were immediately sent to the earl of strafford at the hague to inform the dutch that it was obtained by a trick and would consequently turn to the disappointment and confusion of the contrivers and the actors he was likewise instructed to be very dry and reserved to the pensionary and dutch ministers to let them know the queen thought herself ill treated and that they would soon hear what effects those measures would have upon a mild and good temper wrought up to resentment by repeated provocations that the states might have the war continued if they pleased but that the queen would not be forced to carry it on after their manner nor would suffer them to make her peace or to settle the interests of her kingdoms  to others in holland who appeared to be more moderate the earl was directed to say that the states were upon a wrong scent that their minister here mistook every thing that we had promised that we would perform all they could reasonably ask from us in relation to their barrier and their trade and that mons buys dealt very unfairly if he had not told them as much but that britain proceeded in some respects upon a new scheme of politics would no longer struggle for impossibilities nor be amused by words that our people came more and more to their senses and that the single dispute now was whether the dutch would join with a faction against the queen or with the nation for her  the court likewise resolved to discourage prince eugene from his journey to england which he was about this time undertaking and of which i have spoken before he was told that the queen wanted no exhortations to carry on the war but the project of it should be agreed abroad upon which her majestys resolutions might soon be signified but until she saw what the emperor and allies were ready to do she would neither promise nor engage for any thing at the same time mr st john told hoffman the emperors resident here that if the prince had a mind to divert himself in london the ministers would do their part to entertain him and be sure to trouble him with no manner of business  this coldness retarded the princes journey for some days but did not prevent it although he had a second message by the queens order with this farther addition that his name had lately been made use of on many occasions to create a ferment and stir up sedition and that her majesty judged it would be neither safe for him nor convenient for her that he should come over at this time but all would not do it was enough that the queen did not absolutely forbid him and the partyconfederates both foreign and domestic thought his presence would be highly necessary for their service  towards the end of december the lord privy seal1 set out for holland he was ordered to stop at the hague and in conjunction with the earl of stafford to declare to the states in her majestys name her resolutions to conclude no peace wherein the allies in general and each confederate in particular might not find their ample security and their reasonable satisfaction that she was ready to insist upon their barrier and advantages in their trade in the manner the states themselves should desire and to concert with them such a plan of treaty as both powers might be under mutual engagements never to recede from that nothing could be of greater importance than for the ministers of great britain and holland to enter the congress under the strictest ties of confidence and entirely to concur throughout the course of these negotiations to which purpose it was her majestys pleasure that their lordships should adjust with the dutch ministers the best manner and method for opening and carrying on the conferences and declare themselves instructed to communicate freely their thoughts and measures to the plenipotentiaries of the states who they hoped had received the same instructions  footnote 1 dr robinson had already had diplomatic experience as political agent at the court of stockholm when marlborough had found him of great service ts  lastly the two lords were to signify to the pensionary and the other ministers that her majestys preparations for the next campaign were carried on with all the dispatch and vigour which the present circumstances would allow and to insist that the same might be done by the states and that both powers should join in pressing the emperor and other allies to make greater efforts than they had hitherto done without which the war must languish and the terms of peace become every day more disadvantageous  the two british plenipotentiaries went to utrecht with very large instructions and after the usual manner were to make much higher demands from france at least in behalf of the allies than they could have any hope to obtain the sum of what they had in charge besides matter of form was to concert with the ministers of the several powers engaged against france that all differences arising among them should be accommodated between themselves without suffering the french to interfere that whatever were proposed to france by a minister of the alliance should be backed by the whole confederacy that a time might be fixed for the conclusion as there had been for the commencement of the treaty spain was to be demanded out of the hands of the bourbon family as the most effectual means for preventing the union of that kingdom with france and whatever conditions the allies could agree upon for hindering that union their lordships were peremptorily to insist on  as to the interests of each ally in particular the plenipotentiaries of britain were to demand strasbourg the fort of kehl with its dependencies and the town of brisach with its territory for the emperor that france should possess alsatia according to the treaty of westphalia with the right of the prefecture only over the ten imperial cities in that country that the fortifications of the said ten cities be put into the condition they were in at the time of the said treaty except landau which was to be demanded for the emperor and empire with liberty of demolishing the fortifications that the french king should at a certain time and at his own expense demolish the fortresses of huningen new brisach and fort lewis never to be rebuilt  that the town and fortress of rhinfels should be demanded for the landgrave of hessecassel until that matter be otherwise settled  that the clause relating to religion in the fourth article of the treaty of ryswyck and contrary to that of westphalia should be annulled and the state of religion in germany restored to the tenor of the treaty of westphalia  that france should acknowledge the king of prussia and give him no disturbance in neufchatel and vallengin  that the principality of orange and other estates belonging to the late king william should be restored as law should direct  that the duke of hanover should be acknowledged elector  that the king of portugal should enjoy all the advantages stipulated between him and the allies  that the states should have for their barrier furnes fort knokke menin ypres lille tournay condé valenciennes maubeuge douay bethune aire2 st venant and bouchain with their cannon c that the french king should restore all the places belonging to spain now or during this war in his possession in the netherlands that such part of them as should be thought fit might be allowed likewise for a barrier to the states that france should grant the tariff of one thousand six hundred and sixtyfour to the states and exemption of fifty pence per tun upon dutch goods trading to that kingdom but that these articles in favour of the states should not be concluded till the barrier treaty were explained to the queens satisfaction  footnote 2 bethune avie in original a manifest misprint aire is the name of a place near bethune which has since been connected with it by a canal wsj  that the duke of savoy should be put in possession of all taken from him in this war and enjoy the places yielded to him by the emperor and other allies that france should likewise yield to him exilles fenestrelle chaumont the valley of pragelas and the land lying between piedmont and mount genu  that the article about demolishing of dunkirk should be explained  as to britain the plenipotentiaries were to insist that nieuport dendermonde ghent and all places which appear to be a barrier rather against england than france should either not be given to the dutch or at least in such a manner as not to hinder the queens subjects free passage to and from the low countries  that the seventh article of the barrier treaty which empowers the states in case of an attack to put troops at discretion in all the places of the low countries should be so explained as to be understood only of an attack from france  that britain should trade to the low countries with the same privileges as the states themselves  that the most christian king should acknowledge the succession of hanover and immediately oblige the pretender to leave france and that the said king should promise for himself and his heirs never to acknowledge any person for king or queen of england otherwise than according to the settlements now in force  that a treaty of commerce should be commenced as soon as possible between france and britain and in the mean time the necessary points relating to it be settled  that the isle of st christophers should be surrendered to the queen hudsons bay restored placentia and the whole island of newfoundland yielded to britain by the most christian king who was likewise to quit all claim to nova scotia and annapolis royal  that gibraltar and minorca should be annexed to the british crown  that the assiento should be granted to britain for thirty years with the same advantage as to france with an extent of ground on the river of plata for keeping and refreshing the negroes  that spain should grant to the subjects of britain as large privileges as to any other nation whatsoever as likewise an exemption of duties amounting to an advantage of at least fifteen per cent  that satisfaction should be demanded for what should appear to be justly due to her majesty from the emperor and the states  lastly that the plenipotentiaries should consult with those of the protestant allies the most effectual methods for restoring the protestants of france to their religious and civil liberties and for the immediate release of those who are now in the galleys  what part of these demands were to be insisted on and what were to be given up will appear by the sequel of this negotiation but there was no difficulty of moment enough to retard the peace except a method for preventing the union of france and spain under one prince and the settling the barrier for holland which last as claimed by the states could in prudence and safety be no more allowed by us than by france  the states general having appointed mons buys to be one of their plenipotentiaries at utrecht that minister left england a few days after the lord privy seal in his last conference with the lords of the council he absolutely declared that his masters had done their utmost both by sea and land that it was unreasonable to expect more that they had exceeded their proportion even beyond britain and that as to the emperor and other allies he knew no expedient left for making them act with more vigour than to pursue them with pathetical exhortations  this minister was sent over hither instructed and empowered by halves the ferment raised by the united endeavours of our party leaders among whom he was a constant fellowlabourer to the utmost of his skill had wholly confounded him and thinking to take the advantage of negotiating well for holland at the expense of britain he acted but ill for his own country and worse for the common cause however the queens ministers and he parted with the greatest civility and her majestys present was double the value of what is usual to the character he bore3  footnote 3 compare this passage with one in bolingbrokes correspondence vol ii pp 108109 he buys came over instructed and empowered by halves the ferment which had been created by the joint efforts of the faction here and of that in holland confounded him and thinking to take this advantage of negotiating well for holland at the expense of britain he has negotiated ill for both and ill for the common cause we parted in terms of the greatest civility and her majestys present to him was a thousand pounds which is double the value of what is ever given here to an envoyextraordinary ts  as the queen was determined to alter her measures in making war so she thought nothing would so much convince the states of the necessity of a peace as to have them frequently put in mind of this resolution which her ambassador strafford then at the hague was accordingly directed to do and if they should object of what ill consequence it would be for the enemy to know her majesty designed to lessen her expenses he might answer that the ministers here were sorry for it but the dutch could only blame themselves for forcing into such a necessity a princess to whose friendship they owed the preservation and grandeur of their republic and choosing to lean on a broken faction rather than place their confidence in the queen  it was her majestys earnest desire that there should be a perfect agreement at this treaty between the ministers of all the allies than which nothing could be more effectual to make france comply with their just demands above all she directed her plenipotentiaries to enter into the strictest confidence with those of holland and that after the states had consented to explain the barrier treaty to her reasonable satisfaction both powers should form between them a plan of general peace from which they would not recede and such as might secure the quiet of europe as well as the particular interests of each confederate  the dutch were accordingly pressed before the congress opened to come to some temperament upon that famous treaty because the ministers here expected it would be soon laid before the house of commons by which the resentment of the nation would probably appear against those who had been actors and advisers in it but mons buys who usually spoke for his colleagues was full of opposition began to expostulate upon the advantages britain had stipulated with france and to insist that his masters ought to share equally in them all but especially the assiento contract so that no progress was made in fixing a previous good correspondence between britain and the states which her majesty had so earnestly recommended  certain regulations having been agreed upon for avoiding of ceremony and other inconveniencies the conferences began at utrecht upon the twentyninth of january ns one thousand seven hundred and eleventwelve at ten in the morning the ministers of the allies going into the townhouse at one door and those of france at the same instant at another they all took their seats without distinction and the bishop of bristol lord privy seal first plenipotentiary of britain opened the assembly with a short speech directed to the ministers of france in words to the following effect  messieurs  we are here to meet today in the name of god to enter upon a treaty of general peace between the high allies and the king your master we bring sincere intentions and express orders from our superiors to concur on their part with whatever may advance and perfect so salutary and christian a work on the other side we hope you have the same disposition and that your orders will be so full as to be able without loss of time to answer the expectation of the high allies by explaining yourselves clearly and roundly upon the points we shall have to settle in these conferences and that you will perform this in so plain and specific a manner as every prince and state in the confederacy may find a just and reasonable satisfaction  the french began by promising to explain the overtures which mons mesnager had delivered to the queen some months before and to give in a specific project of what their master would yield provided the allies would each give a specific answer by making their several demands which method after many difficulties and affected delays in the dutch was at length agreed to  but the states who had with the utmost discontent seen her majesty at the head of this negotiation where they intended to have placed themselves began to discover their illhumour upon every occasion they raised endless difficulties about settling the barrier treaty as the queen desired and in one of the first general conferences they would not suffer the british secretary to take the minutes but nominated some dutch professor for that office which the queen refused and resented their behaviour as an useless cavil intended only to shew their want of respect the british plenipotentiaries had great reason to suspect that the dutch were at this time privately endeavouring to engage in some separate measures with france by the intervention of one molo a busy factious agent at amsterdam who had been often employed in such intrigues that this was the cause which made them so litigious and slow in all their steps in hopes to break the congress and find better terms for their trade and barrier from the french than we ever could think fit to allow them the dutch ministers did also apply themselves with industry to cultivate the imperial plenipotentiarys favour in order to secure all advantages of commerce with spain and the west indies in case those dominions could be procured for the emperor for this reason they avoided settling any general plan of peace in concert with the plenipotentiaries of britain which her majesty desired and mons buys plainly told their lordships that it was a point which neither he nor his colleagues could consent to before the states were admitted equal sharers with britain in the trade of spain  the court having notice of this untractable temper in the dutch gave direct orders to the plenipotentiaries of britain for pressing those of the states to adjust the gross in equalities of the barrier treaty since nothing was more usual or agreeable to reason than for princes who find themselves aggrieved by prejudicial contracts to expect they should be modified and explained and since it now appeared by votes in the house of commons that the sense of the nation agreed with what her majesty desired if the dutch ministers would not be brought to any moderate terms upon this demand their lordships were directed to improve and amend the particular concessions made to britain by france and form them into a treaty for the queen was determined never to allow the states any share in the assiento gibraltar and port mahon nor could think it reasonable that they should be upon an equal foot with her in the trade of spain to the conquest whereof they had contributed so little  nor was the conduct of the imperial minister at this time less perplexing than that of the states both those powers appearing fully bent either upon breaking off the negotiation or upon forcing from the queen those advantages she expected by it for her own kingdoms her majesty therefore thought fit about the beginning of march to send mr thomas harley a near relation of the treasurers to utrecht fully informed of her mind which he was directed to communicate to the plenipotentiaries of britain  mr harley stopped in his way to utrecht at the hague and there told the pensionary that nothing had happened lately in england but what was long ago foretold him as well as the other ministers of the allies that the proceedings of the house of commons particularly about the barrier treaty must chiefly be ascribed to the manner in which the queen and the nation had been treated by mons bothmar count gallas buys and other foreign ministers that if the states would yet enter into a strict union with the queen give her satisfaction in the said treaty and join in concert with her plenipotentiaries at utrecht a safe and advantageous peace might be obtained for the whole alliance otherwise her majesty must save her own country and join with such of her allies as would join with her  as to the war that the conduct of the allies and their opposition to the queen by private intrigues carried on among her own subjects as well as by open remonstrances had made the house of commons take that matter out of the hands of the ministers  lastly that in case the present treaty were broken off by the dutch refusing to comply her majesty thought it reasonable to insist that some cautionary places be put into her hands as pledges that no other negotiation should be entered into by the states general without her participation  mr harleys instructions to the queens plenipotentiaries were that they should press those of france to open themselves as far as possible in concerting such a plan of a general peace as might give reasonable satisfaction to all the confederates and such as her parliament would approve that the people of england believed france would consent to such a plan wherein if they found themselves deceived they would be as eager for prosecuting the war as ever  their lordships were to declare openly to the dutch that no extremity should make her majesty depart from insisting to have the assiento for her own subjects and to keep gibraltar and port mahon but if the states would agree with her upon these three heads she would be content to reduce the trade of spain and the west indies to the condition it was in under the late catholic king charles ii  the french were farther to be pressed that the pretender should be immediately sent out of that kingdom and that the most effectual method should be taken for preventing the union of france and spain under one prince  about this time her majestys ministers and those of the allies at utrecht delivered in the several postulata or demands of their masters to the french plenipotentiaries which having been since made public and all of them except those of britain very much varying in the course of the negotiation the reader would be but ill entertained with a transcript of them here  upon intelligence of the last dauphins death the father son and grandson all of that title4 dying within the compass of a year mons gaultier went to france with letters to the marquis de torcy to propose her majestys expedient for preventing the union of that kingdom with spain which as it was the most important article to be settled in order to secure peace for europe so it was a point that required to be speedily adjusted under the present circumstances and situation of the bourbon family there being only left a child of two years old to stand between the duke of anjou and his succeeding to the crown of france  footnote 4 these princes were the grandfather the father and the brother of louis xv who was then duke of anjou and supposed to be at the point of death n  her majesty likewise pressed france by the same dispatches to send full instructions to their plenipotentiaries empowering them to offer to the allies such a plan of peace as might give reasonable satisfaction to all her allies  the queens proposal for preventing an union between france and spain was that philip should formally renounce the kingdom of france for himself and his posterity and that this renunciation should be confirmed by the cortes or states of spain who without question would heartily concur against such an union by which their country must become a province to france in like manner the french princes of the blood were severally to renounce all title to spain  the french raised many difficulties upon several particulars of this expedient but the queen persisted to refuse any plan of peace before this weighty point were settled in the manner she proposed which was afterwards submitted to as in proper place we shall observe in the mean time the negotiation at utrecht proceeded with a very slow pace the dutch interposing all obstructions they could contrive refusing to come to any reasonable temper upon the barrier treaty or to offer a plan in concert with the queen for a general peace nothing less would satisfy them than the partaking in those advantages we had stipulated for ourselves and which did no ways interfere with their trade or security they still expected some turn in england their friends on this side had ventured to assure them that the queen could not live many months which indeed from the bad state of her majestys health was reasonable to expect the british plenipotentiaries daily discovered new endeavours of holland to treat privately with france and lastly those among the states who desired the war should continue strove to gain time until the campaign should open and by resolving to enter into action with the first opportunity render all things desperate and break up the congress  this scheme did exactly fall in with prince eugenes dispositions whom the states had chosen for their general and of whose conduct in this conjuncture the queen had too much reason to be jealous but her majesty who was resolved to do her utmost towards putting a good and speedy end to this war having placed the duke of ormonde at the head of her forces in flanders whither he was now arrived directed him to keep all the troops in british pay whether subjects or foreigners immediately under his own command and to be cautious for a while in engaging in any action of importance unless upon a very apparent advantage at the same time the queen determined to make one thorough trial of the disposition of the states by allowing them the utmost concessions that could any way suit either with her safety or honour she therefore directed her ministers at utrecht to tell the dutch that in order to shew how desirous she was to live in perfect amity with that republic she would resign up the fifteen per cent advantage upon english goods sent to the spanish dominions which the french king had offered her by a power from his grandson5 and be content to reduce that trade to the state in which it was under the late king of spain she would accept of any tolerable softening of these words in the seventh article of the barrier treaty where it is said the states shall have power in case of an apparent attack to put as many troops as they please into all the places of the netherlands without specifying an attack from the side of france as ought to have been done otherwise the queen might justly think they were preparing themselves for a rupture with britain her majesty likewise consented that the states should keep nieuport dendermonde and the castle of ghent as an addition to their barrier although she were sensible how injurious those concessions would be to the trade of her subjects and would waive the demand of ostend being delivered into her hands which she might with justice insist on in return for all this that the queen only desired the ministers of the states would enter into a close correspondence with hers and settle between them some plan of a general peace which might give reasonable content to all her allies and which her majesty would endeavour to bring france to consent to she desired the trade of her kingdoms to the netherlands and to the towns of their barrier might be upon as good a foot as it was before the war began that the dutch would not insist to have share in the assiento to which they had not the least pretensions and that they would no longer encourage the intrigues of a faction against her government her majesty assured them in plain terms that her own future measures and the conduct of her plenipotentiaries should be wholly governed by their behaviour in these points and that her offers were only conditional in case of their compliance with what she desired  footnote 5 philip v king of spain w s j  but all these proofs of the queens kindness and sincerity could not avail the dutch ministers pleaded they had no power to concert the plan of general peace with those of britain however they assured the latter that the assiento was the only difficulty which stuck with their masters whereupon at their desire a contract for that traffic was twice read to them after which they appeared very well satisfied and said they would go to the hague for further instructions thither they went and after a weeks absence returned the same answer that they had no power to settle a scheme of peace but could only discourse of it when the difficulties of the barrier treaty were over and mons buys took a journey to amsterdam on purpose to stir up that city where he was pensionary against yielding the assiento to britain but was unsuccessful in his negotiation the point being yielded up there and in most other towns in holland  it will have an odd sound in history and appear hardly credible that in several petty republics of single towns which make up the states general it should be formally debated whether the queen of great britain who preserved the commonwealth at the charge of so many millions should be suffered to enjoy after a peace the liberty granted her by spain of selling african slaves in the spanish dominions of america but there was a prevailing faction at the hague violently bent against any peace where the queen must act that part which they had intended for themselves these politicians who held constant correspondence with their old dejected friends in england were daily fed with the vain hopes of the queens death or the partys restoration they likewise endeavoured to spin out the time till prince eugenes activity had pushed on some great event which might govern or perplex the conditions of peace therefore the dutch plenipotentiaries who proceeded by the instructions of those mistaken patriots acted in every point with a spirit of litigiousness than which nothing could give greater advantage to the enemy a strict union between the allies but especially britain and holland being doubtless the only means for procuring safe and honourable terms from france  but neither was this the worst for the queen received undoubted intelligence from utrecht that the dutch were again attempting a separate correspondence with france and by letters intercepted here from vienna it was found that the imperial court whose ministers were in the utmost confidence with those of holland expressed the most furious rage against her majesty for the steps she had taken to advance a peace  this unjustifiable treatment the queen could not digest from an ally upon whom she had conferred so many signal obligations whom she had used with so much indulgence and sincerity during the whole course of the negotiation and had so often invited to go along with her in every motion towards a peace she apprehended likewise that the negotiation might be taken out of her hands if france could be secure of easier conditions in holland or might think that britain wanted power to influence the whole confederacy she resolved therefore on this occasion to exert herself with vigour steadiness and dispatch and in the beginning of may sent her commands to the earl of strafford to repair immediately to england in order to consult with her ministers what was proper to be done  the proposal above mentioned for preventing the union of france and spain met with many difficulties mons de torcy raising objections against several parts of it but the queen refused to proceed any farther with france until this weighty point were fully settled to her satisfaction after which she promised to grant a suspension of arms provided the town and citadel of dunkirk might be delivered as a pledge into her hands and proposed that ypres might be surrendered to the dutch if they would consent to come into the suspension france absolutely refused the latter and the states general having acted in perpetual contradiction to her majesty she pressed that matter no farther because she doubted they would not agree to a cessation of arms however she resolved to put a speedy end or at least intermission to her own share in the war and the french having declared themselves ready to agree to her expedients for preventing the union of the two crowns and consented to the delivery of dunkirk positive orders were sent to the duke of ormonde to avoid engaging in any battle or siege until he had further instructions but he was directed to conceal his orders and to find the best excuses he could if any pressing occasion should offer  the reasons for this unusual proceeding which made a mighty noise were of sufficient weight to justify it for pursuant to the agreement made between us and france a courier was then dispatched from fontainebleau to madrid with the offer of an alternative to philip either of resigning spain immediately to the duke of savoy upon the hopes of succeeding to france and some present advantage which not having been accepted is needless to dilate on or of adhering to spain and renouncing all future claim to france for himself and his posterity  until it could be known which part philip would accept the queen would not take possession of dunkirk nor suffer an armistice to be declared but however since the most christian king had agreed that his grandson should be forced in case of a refusal to make his choice immediately her majesty could not endure to think that perhaps some thousands of lives of her own subjects and allies might be sacrificed without necessity if an occasion should be found or sought for fighting a battle which she very well knew prince eugene would eagerly attempt and put all into confusion to gratify his own ambition the enmity of his new masters the dutch and the rage of his court  but the duke of ormonde who with every other quality that can accomplish or adorn a great man inherits all the valour and loyalty of his ancestors found it very difficult to acquit himself of his commission6 for prince eugene and all the field deputies of the states had begun already to talk either of attacking the enemy or besieging quesnoy the confederate army being now all joined by the troops they expected and accordingly about three days after the duke had received those orders from court it was proposed to his grace at a meeting with the prince and deputies that the french army should be attacked their camp having been viewed and a great opportunity offering to do it with success for the marechal de villars who had notice sent him by mons de torcy of what was passing and had signified the same by a trumpet to the duke shewed less vigilance than was usual to that general taking no precautions to secure his camp or observe the motions of the allies probably on purpose to provoke them the duke said that the earl of straffords sudden departure for england made him believe there was something of consequence now transacting which would be known in four or five days and therefore desired they would defer this or any other undertaking until he could receive fresh letters from england whereupon the prince and deputies immediately told the duke that they looked for such an answer as he had given them that they had suspected our measures for some time and their suspicions were confirmed by the express his grace had so lately received as well as by the negligence of mons villars they appeared extremely dissatisfied and the deputies told the duke that they would immediately send an account of his answer to their masters which they accordingly did and soon after by order from the states wrote him an expostulating letter in a style less respectful than became them desiring him among other things to explain himself whether he had positive orders not to fight the french and afterwards told him they were sure he had such orders otherwise he could not answer what he had done but the duke still waived the question saying he would be glad to have letters from england before he entered upon action and that he expected them daily  footnote 6 for an estimate of ormondes character see swifts enquiry into the behaviour of the queens last ministry vol v of present edition pp 428430 ormonde had done very little to deserve succeeding such a soldier as marlborough indeed his name was associated with the disgraceful expedition to cadiz in which he was in command of the english troops ts  upon this incident the ministers and generals of the allies immediately took the alarm venting their fury in violent expressions against the queen and those she employed in her councils said they were betrayed by britain and assumed the countenance of those who think they have received an injury and are disposed to return it  the duke of ormondes army consisted of eighteen thousand of her majestys subjects and about thirty thousand hired from other princes either wholly by the queen or jointly by her and the states the duke immediately informed the court of the dispositions he found among the foreign generals upon this occasion and that upon an exigency he could only depend on the british troops adhering to him those of hanover having already determined to desert to the dutch and tempted the danes to do the like and that he had reason to suppose the same of the rest  upon the news arriving at utrecht that the duke of ormonde had refused to engage in any action against the enemy the dutch ministers there went immediately to make their complaints to the lord privy seal aggravating the strangeness of this proceeding together with the consequence of it in the loss of a most favourable opportunity for ruining the french army and the discontent it must needs create in the whole body of the confederates adding how hard it was that they should be kept in the dark and have no communication of what was done in a point which so nearly concerned them they concluded that the duke must needs have acted by orders and desired his lordship to write both to court and to his grace what they had now said  the bishop answered that he knew nothing of this fact but what they had told him and therefore was not prepared with a reply to their representations only in general he could venture to say that this case appeared very like the conduct of their fielddeputies upon former occasions that if such orders were given they were certainly built upon very justifiable foundations and would soon be so explained as to convince the states and all the world that the common interest would be better provided for another way than by a battle or siege that the want of communication which they complained of could not make the states so uneasy as their declining to receive it had made the queen who had used her utmost endeavours to persuade them to concur with her in concerting every step towards a general peace and settling such a plan as both sides might approve and adhere to but to this day the states had not thought fit to accept those offers or to authorize any of their ministers to treat with her majestys plenipotentiaries upon that affair although they had been pressed to it ever since the negotiation began that his lordship to shew that he did not speak his private sense alone took this opportunity to execute the orders he had received the evening before by declaring to them that all her majestys offers for adjusting the differences between her and the states were founded upon this express condition that they should come immediately into the queens measures and act openly and sincerely with her and that from their conduct so directly contrary she now looked upon herself to be under no obligation to them  mons buys and his colleagues were stunned with this declaration made to them at a time when they pretended to think the right of complaining to be on their side and had come to the bishop upon that errand but after their surprise was abated and buyss long reasonings at an end they began to think how matters might be retrieved and were of opinion that the states should immediately dispatch a minister to england unless his lordship were empowered to treat with them which without new commands he said he was not they afterwards desired to know of the bishop what the meaning was of the last words in his declaration that her majesty looked upon herself to be under no obligation to them he told them his opinion that as the queen was bound by treaty to concert with the states the conditions of a peace so upon their declining the concert so frequently offered she was acquitted of that obligation but that he verily believed whatever measures her majesty should take she would always have a friendly regard to the interest of their commonwealth and that as their unkindness had been very unexpected and disagreeable to her majesty so their compliance would be equally pleasing  i have been the more circumstantial in relating this affair because it furnished abundance of discourse and gave rise to many wild conjectures and misrepresentations as well here as in holland especially that part which concerned the duke of ormonde7 for the angry faction in the house of commons upon the first intelligence that the duke had declined to act offensively against france in concurrence with the allies moved for an address wherein the queen should be informed of the deep concern of her commons for the dangerous consequences to the common cause which must arise from this proceeding of her general and to beseech her that speedy instructions might be given to the duke to prosecute the war with vigour in order to quiet the minds of her people c but a great majority was against this motion and a resolution drawn up and presented to the queen by the whole house of a quite contrary tenor that they had an entire confidence in her majestys most gracious promise to communicate to her parliament the terms of the peace before the same should be concluded and that they would support her majesty in obtaining an honourable and safe peace against all such persons either at home or abroad who have endeavoured or shall endeavour to obstruct the same  footnote 7 this determination on the part of england to cease hostilities at this juncture has been most severely criticized the matter formed afterwards the chief article in the impeachment of bolingbroke and an important article in the impeachment of oxford according to the report of the committee of secrecy and the earl of oxfords answer to this charge in his impeachment it seems as if st john had instructed ormonde so to act without in any way consulting the council and apparently purposely concealing the fact from his colleagues mr walter sichel however in a note on p 380 of his bolingbroke and his times clearly traces the order to the desire of the queen herself and in his text lays on the queen the blame that was visited on the heads of her ministers see also note on p 156 ts  the courier sent with the alternative to spain was now returned with an account that philip had chosen to renounce france for himself and his posterity whereof the queen having received notice her majesty upon the sixth of june in a long speech to both houses of parliament laid before them the terms of a general peace stipulated between her and france this speech being the plan whereby both france and the allies have been obliged to proceed in the subsequent course of the treaty i shall desire the readers leave to insert it at length although i believe it hath been already in most hands7  footnote 7 this speech was printed by john baskett 1712 wsj  my lords and gentlemen  the making peace and war is the undoubted prerogative of the crown yet such is the just confidence i place in you that at the opening of this session i acquainted you that a negotiation for a general peace was begun and afterwards by messages i promised to communicate to you the terms of peace before the same should be concluded  in pursuance of that promise i now come to let you know upon what terms a general peace may be made  i need not mention the difficulties which arise from the very nature of this affair and it is but too apparent that these difficulties have been increased by other obstructions artfully contrived to hinder this great and good work  nothing however has moved me from steadily pursuing in the first place the true interests of my own kingdoms and i have not omitted any thing which might procure to all our allies what is due to them by treaties and what is necessary for their security  the assuring of the protestant succession as by law established in the house of hanover to these kingdoms being what i have nearest at heart particular care is taken not only to have that acknowledged in the strongest terms but to have an additional security by the removal of that person out of the dominions of france who has pretended to disturb this settlement  the apprehension that spain and the west indies might be united to france was the chief inducement to begin this war and the effectual preventing of such an union was the principle i laid down at the commencement of this treaty former examples and the late negotiations sufficiently shew how difficult it is to find means to accomplish this work i would not content myself with such as are speculative or depend on treaties only i insisted on what was solid and to have at hand the power of executing what should be agreed  i can therefore now tell you that france at last is brought to offer that the duke of anjou shall for himself and his descendants renounce for ever all claim to the crown of france and that this important article may be exposed to no hazard the performance is to accompany the promise  at the same time the succession to the crown of france is to be declared after the death of the present dauphin and his sons to be in the duke of berry and his sons in the duke of orleans and his sons and so on to the rest of the house of bourbon  as to spain and the indies the succession to those dominions after the duke of anjou and his children is to descend to such prince as shall be agreed upon at the treaty for ever excluding the rest of the house of bourbon  for confirming the renunciations and settlements before mentioned it is further offered that they should be ratified in the most strong and solemn manner both in france and spain and that those kingdoms as well as all the other powers engaged in the present war shall be guarantees to the same  the nature of this proposal is such that it executes itself the interest of spain is to support it and in france the persons to whom that succession is to belong will be ready and powerful enough to vindicate their own right  france and spain are now more effectually divided than ever and thus by the blessing of god will a real balance of power be fixed in europe and remain liable to as few accidents as human affairs can be exempted from  a treaty of commerce between these kingdoms and france has been entered upon but the excessive duties laid on some goods and the prohibitions of others make it impossible to finish this work so soon as were to be desired care is however taken to establish a method of settling this matter and in the mean time provision is made that the same privileges and advantages as shall be granted to any other nation by france shall be granted in like manner to us  the division of the island of st christopher between us and the french having been the cause of great inconveniency and damage to my subjects i have demanded to have an absolute cession made to me of that whole island and france agrees to this demand  our interest is so deeply concerned in the trade of north america that i have used my utmost endeavours to adjust that article in the most beneficial manner france consents to restore to us the whole bay and straits of hudson to deliver up the island of newfoundland with placentia and to make an absolute cession of annapolis with the rest of nova scotia or acadie  the safety of our home trade will be better provided for by the demolition of dunkirk  our mediterranean trade and the british interest and influence in those parts will be secured by the possession of gibraltar and port mahon with the whole island of minorca which are offered to remain in my hands  the trade to spain and to the west indies may in general be settled as it was in the time of the late king of spain charles the second and a particular provision be made that all advantages rights or privileges which have been granted or which may hereafter be granted by spain to any other nation shall be in like manner granted to the subjects of great britain  but the part which we have borne in the prosecution of this war entitling us to some distinction in the terms of peace i have insisted and obtained that the assiento or contract for furnishing the spanish west indies with negroes shall be made with us for the term of thirty years in the same manner as it has been enjoyed by the french for ten years past  i have not taken upon me to determine the interests of our confederates these must be adjusted in the congress at utrecht where my best endeavours shall be employed as they have hitherto constantly been to procure to every one of them all just and reasonable satisfaction in the mean time i think it proper to acquaint you that france offers to make the rhine the barrier of the empire to yield brissac the fort of kehl and landau and to raze all the fortresses both on the other side of the rhine and in that river  as to the protestant interest in germany there will be on the part of france no objection to the resettling thereof on the foot of the treaty of westphalia  the spanish low countries may go to his imperial majesty the kingdoms of naples and sardinia the duchy of milan and the places belonging to spain on the coast of tuscany may likewise be yielded by the treaty of peace to the emperor  as to the kingdom of sicily though there remains no dispute concerning the cession of it by the duke of anjou yet the disposition thereof is not yet determined  the interests of the states general with respect to commerce are agreed to as they have been demanded by their own ministers with the exception only of some very few species of merchandise and the entire barrier as demanded by the states in one thousand seven hundred and nine from france except two or three places at most  as to these exceptions several expedients are proposed and i make no doubt but this barrier may be so settled as to render that republic perfectly secure against any enterprise on the part of france which is the foundation of all my engagements upon this head with the states  the demands of portugal depending on the disposition of spain and that article having been long in dispute it has not been yet possible to make any considerable progress therein but my plenipotentiaries will now have an opportunity to assist that king in his pretensions  those of the king of prussia are such as i hope will admit of little difficulty on the part of france and my utmost endeavours shall not be wanting to procure all i am able to so good an ally  the difference between the barrier demanded for the duke of savoy in one thousand seven hundred and nine and the offers now made by france is very inconsiderable but that prince having so signally distinguished himself in the service of the common cause i am endeavouring to procure for him still farther advantages  france has consented that the elector palatine shall continue his present rank among the electors and remain in possession of the upper palatinate  the electoral dignity is likewise acknowledged in the house of hanover according to the article inserted at that princes desire in my demands  and as to the rest of the allies i make no doubt of being able to secure their several interests                                       my lords and gentlemen  i have now communicated to you not only the terms of peace which may by the future treaty be obtained for my own subjects but likewise the proposals of france for satisfying our allies  the former are such as i have reason to expect to make my people some amends for that great and unequal burden which they have lain under through the whole course of this war and i am willing to hope that none of our confederates and especially those to whom so great accessions of dominion and power are to accrue by this peace will envy britain her share in the glory and advantage of it  the latter are not yet so perfectly adjusted as a little more time might have rendered them but the season of the year making it necessary to put an end to this session i resolved no longer to defer communicating these matters to you  i can make no doubt but you are all fully persuaded that nothing will be neglected on my part in the progress of this negotiation to bring the peace to an happy and speedy issue and i depend on your entire confidence in me and your cheerful concurrence with me  the discontented party in the house of commons finding the torrent against them not to be stemmed suspended their opposition by which means an address was voted nemine contradicente to acknowledge her majestys condescension to express their satisfaction in what she had already done and to desire she would please to proceed with the present negotiations for obtaining a speedy peace  during these transactions at home the duke of ormonde8 was in a very uneasy situation at the army employed in practising those arts which perhaps are fitter for a subtle negotiator than a great commander9 but as he had always proved his obedience where courage or conduct could be of use so the duty he professed to his prince made him submit to continue in a state of inactivity at the head of his troops however contrary to his nature if it were for her majestys service he had sent early notice to the ministers that he could not depend upon the foreign forces in the queens pay and he now found some attempts were already begun to seduce them  footnote 8 james butler duke of ormonde succeeded his grandfather in that title in july 1688 was lord lieutenant of ireland in 1703 and again in 1710 he succeeded the duke of marlborough as captain general and had the first regiment of guards bishop burnet says he had the same allowances that had been lately voted criminal in the duke of marlborough history vol ii p 602 n  footnote 9 bolingbroke had written a letter to ormonde dated may 10th 1712 in which he informed the commanderinchief that it was the queens positive command to your grace that you avoid engaging in any siege or hazarding a battle till you have farther orders from her majesty how to do this with dignity was not an easy matter the continuation of this letter from bolingbroke suggested the spirit though it left to ormonde the details of his procedure in so delicate a situation i am at the same time directed to let your grace know that the queen would have you disguise the receipt of this order and her majesty thinks that you cannot want pretences for conducting yourself so as to answer her ends without owning that which might at present have an ill effect if it was publicly known bolingbroke correspondence ii 320 this is what swift means by being employed in practicing those arts which perhaps are fitter for a subtle negotiator than a great commander ts  while the courier was expected from madrid the duke had orders to inform the maréchal de villars of the true state of this affair and that his grace would have decisive orders in three or four days in the mean time he desired the marechal would not oblige him to come to any action either to defend himself or to join with prince eugenes army which he must necessarily do if the prince were attacked  when the courier was arrived with the account that philip had chosen to accept of spain her majesty had proposed to france a suspension of arms for two months to be prolonged to three or four between the armies now in flanders upon the following conditions  that during the suspension endeavours should be used for concluding a general peace or at least the article for preventing the union of france and spain should be punctually executed by philips renouncing france for himself and his posterity and the princes of bourbon in like manner renouncing spain and that the town citadel and forts of dunkirk should be immediately delivered into the queens hands her majesty at the same time endeavoured to get cambray for the dutch provided they would come into the suspension but this was absolutely rejected by france which that court would never have ventured to do if those allies could have been prevailed on to have acted with sincerity and openness in concert with her majesty as her plenipotentiaries had always desired however the queen promised that if the states would yield to a suspension of arms they should have some valuable pledge put into their possession  but now fresh intelligence daily arrived both from utrecht and the army of attempts to make the troops in her majestys pay desert her service and a design even of seizing the british forces was whispered about and with reason suspected  when the queens speech was published in holland the lord privy seal told the dutch ministers at utrecht that what her majesty had laid before her parliament could not according to the rules of treaty be looked on as the utmost of what france would yield in the course of a negotiation but only the utmost of what that crown would propose in order to form the plan of a peace that these conditions would certainly have been better if the states had thought fit to have gone hand in hand with her majesty as she had so frequently exhorted them to do that nothing but the want of harmony among the allies had spirited the french to stand out so long that the queen would do them all the good offices in her power if they thought fit to comply and did not doubt of getting them reasonable satisfaction both in relation to their barrier and their trade but this reasoning made no impression the dutch ministers said the queens speech had deprived them of the fruits of the war they were in pain lest lille and tournay might be two of the towns to be excepted out of their barrier the rest of the allies grew angry by the example of the dutch the populace in holland began to be inflamed they publicly talked that britain had betrayed them sermons were preached in several towns of their provinces whether by direction or connivance filled with the highest instances of disrespect to her britannic majesty whom they charged as a papist and an enemy to their country the lord privy seal himself believed something extraordinary was in agitation and that his own person was in danger from the fury of the people  it is certain that the states appeared but a few days before very much disposed to comply with the measures the queen had taken and would have consented to a general armistice if count zinzendorf one of the plenipotentiaries for the emperor had not by direct orders from his court employed himself in sowing jealousies between britain and the states and at the same time made prodigious offers to the latter as well as to the ministers of prussia the palatinate and hanover for continuing the war that those three electors who contributed nothing except bodies of men in return of pay and subsidies should readily accept the proposals of the emperor is easy to be accounted for what appears hardly credible is that a grave republic usually cautious enough in making their bargains should venture to reject the thoughts of a peace upon the promises of the house of austria the little validity whereof they had so long experienced and especially when they counted upon losing the support of britain their most powerful ally but the false hopes given them by their friends in england of some new change in their favour or an imagination of bringing france to better terms by the appearance of resolution added to the weakness or corruption of some who administered their affairs were the true causes which first created and afterwards inflamed this untractable temper among them  the dutch ministers were wholly disconcerted and surprised when the lord privy seal told them that a suspension of arms in the netherlands would be necessary and that the duke of ormonde intended very soon to declare it after he had taken possession of dunkirk but his lordship endeavoured to convince them that this incident ought rather to be a motive for hastening the states into a compliance with her majesty he likewise communicated to the ministers of the allies the offers made by france as delivered in the speech from the throne which her majesty thought to be satisfactory and hoped their masters would concur with her in bringing the peace to a speedy conclusion wherein each in particular might be assured of her best offices for advancing their just pretensions  in the mean time the duke of ormonde was directed to send a body of troops to take possession of dunkirk as soon as he should have notice from the maréchal de villars that the commandant of the town had received orders from his court to deliver it but the duke foresaw many difficulties in the executing of this commission he could trust such an enterprise to no forces except those of her majestys own subjects he considered the temper of the states in this conjuncture and was loth to divide a small body of men upon whose faithfulness alone he could depend he thought it not prudent to expose them to march through the enemys country with whom there was yet neither peace nor truce and he had sufficient reasons to apprehend that the dutch would either not permit such a detachment to pass through their towns as themselves had more than hinted to him or would seize them as they passed besides the duke had very fairly signified to maréchal de villars that he expected to be deserted by all the foreign troops in her majestys pay as soon as the armistice should be declared at which the maréchal appearing extremely disappointed said the king his master reckoned that all the troops under his graces command should yield to the cessation and wondered how it should come to pass that those who might be paid for lying still would rather choose after a ten years war to enter into the service of new masters under whom they must fight on for nothing in short the opinion of mons villars was that this difficulty cancelled the promise of surrendering dunkirk which therefore he opposed as much as possible in the letters he writ to his court  upon the duke of ormondes representing those difficulties the queen altered her measures and ordered forces to be sent from england to take possession of dunkirk the duke was likewise commanded to tell the foreign generals in her majestys service how highly she would resent their desertion after which their masters must give up all thoughts of any arrears either of pay or subsidy the lord privy seal spoke the same language at utrecht to the several ministers of the allies as mr secretary st john did to those who resided here adding that the proceeding of the foreign troops would be looked upon as a declaration for or against her majesty and that in case they desert her service she would look on herself as justified before god and man to continue her negotiation at utrecht or any other place whether the allies concur or not and particularly the dutch were assured that if their masters seduced the forces hired by the queen they must take the whole pay arrears and subsidies on themselves10  footnote 10 compare this language of bishop robinson with the letter bolingbroke had previously written to thomas harley letter of may 17 1712 on the report which my lord strafford who arrived here the day before yesterday has made by word of mouth as well as upon the contents of the latter dispatches from utrecht her majesty is fully determined to let all negotiations sleep in holland since they have neither sense nor gratitude nor spirit enough to make a suitable return to the offers lately sent by the queen and communicated by the plenipotentiaries her majesty will look on herself as under no obligation towards them but proceed to make the peace either with or without them  when the statesgeneral addressed a complaint to the queen of the manner in which england was deserting them bolingbroke had their letter formally condemned by a resolution of the house of commons he was determined to bring this peace about and the dutch might kick and flounce like wild beasts caught in a toil yet the cords are too strong for them to break report from the committee of secrecy ts  the earl of strafford preparing about this time to return to utrecht with instructions proper to the present situation of affairs went first to the army and there informed the duke of ormonde of her majestys intentions he also acquainted the states deputies with the queens uneasiness lest by the measures they were taking they should drive her to extremities which she desired so much to avoid he farther represented to them in the plainest terms the provocations her majesty had received and the grounds and reasons for her present conduct he likewise declared to the commanders in chief of the foreign troops in the queens pay and in the joint pay of britain and the states with how much surprise her majesty had heard that there was the least doubt of their obeying the orders of the duke of ormonde which if they refused her majesty would esteem it not only as an indignity and affront but as a declaration against her and in such a case they must look on themselves as no farther entitled either to any arrear or future pay or subsidies  six regiments under the command of mr hill11 were now preparing to embark in order to take possession of dunkirk and the duke of ormonde upon the first intelligence sent him that the french were ready to deliver the town was to declare he could act no longer against france the queen gave notice immediately of her proceedings to the states she let them plainly know that their perpetual caballing with her factious subjects against her authority had forced her into such measures as otherwise she would not have engaged in however her majesty was willing yet to forget all that had passed and to unite with them in the strictest ties of amity which she hoped they would now do since they could not but be convinced by the late dutiful addresses of both houses how far their high mightinesses had been deluded and drawn in as instruments to serve the turn and gratify the passions of a disaffected party that their opposition and want of concert with her majestys ministers which she had so often invited them to had encouraged france to except towns out of their barrier which otherwise might have been yielded that however she had not precluded them or any other ally from demanding more and even her own terms were but conditional upon supposition of a general peace to ensue that her majesty resolved to act upon the plan laid down in her speech and she repeated the promise of her best offices to promote the interest of the states if they would deal sincerely with her  footnote 11 john hill brother to mrs masham it is not difficult to guess at the reason for this appointment here was a chance for jack hill to achieve some glory and wipe away the disgrace of the illstarred quebec expedition as there was also no danger attached to the enterprise all the more likely that he would succeed hill sailed with admiral sir john leake and took peaceable possession of the town and forts for this he was appointed governor of dunkirk and while there he sent swift a gold snuffbox as a present the finest that ever you saw as swift wrote to stella see also vol v p 80 of this edition ts  some days before the duke of ormonde had notice that orders were given for the surrender of dunkirk prince eugene of savoy sent for the generals of the allies and asked them severally whether in case the armies separated they would march with him or stay with the duke all of them except two who commanded but small bodies agreed to join with the prince who thereupon about three days after sent the duke word that he intended to march the following day as it was supposed to besiege landrecies the duke returned an answer that he was surprised at the princes message there having been not the least previous concert with him nor any mention in the message which way or upon what design the march was intended therefore that the duke could not resolve to march with him much less could the prince expect assistance from the queens army in any design undertaken after this manner the duke told this beforehand that he the prince might take his measures accordingly and not attribute to her majestys general any misfortune that might happen  on the sixteenth of july ns the several generals of the allies joined prince eugenes army and began their march after taking leave of the duke and the earl of strafford whose expostulations could not prevail on them to stay although the latter assured them that the queen had made neither peace nor truce with france and that her forces would now be left exposed to the enemy  the next day after this famous desertion the duke of ormonde received a letter from mons de villars with an account that the town and citadel of dunkirk should be delivered to mr hill whereupon a cessation of arms was declared by sound of trumpet at the head of the british army which now consisted only of about eighteen thousand men all of her majestys subjects except the holsteiners and count walliss dragoons12 with this small body of men the general began his march and pursuant to orders from court retired towards the sea in the manner he thought most convenient for the queens service when he came as far as flines he was told by some of his officers that the commandants of bouchain douay lille and tournay had refused them passage through those towns or even liberty of entrance and said it was by order of their masters13 the duke immediately recollected that when the deputies first heard of his resolution to withdraw his troops they told him they hoped he did not intend to march through any of their towns this made him conclude that the orders must be general and that his army would certainly meet with the same treatment which his officers had done he had likewise before the armies separated received information of some designs that concerned the safety or at least the freedom of his own person and which he much more valued that of those few british troops entrusted to his care no general was ever more truly or deservedly beloved by his soldiers who to a man were prepared to sacrifice their lives in his service and whose resentments were raised to the utmost by the ingratitude as they termed it of their deserters  footnote 12 barner who commanded the troops of holstein being two battalions and eight squadrons and walef or waless who commanded the dragoons of liège both followed ormonde s  footnote 13 at bouchain the british officers were told at the gates that the commandant had positive orders to let no englishman into the town and at douay where the english had large stores and magazines the same thing happened with considerable aggravation indeed it was with difficulty and precaution that the commandant of the latter town would permit the body of an english colonel to be interred there the same difficulties occurred at tournay oudenarde and lille and the duke of ormonde having sent an officer express to england on the 17th he was stopped and interrupted at haspre misguided at courtray and refused admission at bruges see the conduct of his grace the duke of ormonde in the campagne of 1712 1715 pp 4650 s  upon these provocations he laid aside all thoughts of returning to dunkirk and began to consider how he might perform in so difficult a conjuncture something important to the queen and at the same time find a secure retreat for his forces he formed his plan without communicating it to any person whatsoever and the disposition of the army being to march towards warneton in the way to dunkirk he gave sudden orders to lieutenantgeneral cadogan to change his route according to the military phrase and move towards orchies a town leading directly to ghent  when prince eugene and the states deputies received news of the dukes motions they were alarmed to the utmost degree and sent count nassau of woudenbourg to the generals camp near orchies to excuse what had been done and to assure his grace that those commandants who had refused passage to his officers had acted wholly without orders count hompesch one of the dutch generals came likewise to the duke with the same story but all this made little impression on the general who held on his march and on the twentythird of july ns entered ghent where he was received with great submission by the inhabitants and took possession of the town as he likewise did of bruges a few days after  the duke of ormonde thought that considering the present disposition of the states towards britain it might be necessary for the queen to have some pledge from that republic in her hands as well as from france by which means her majesty would be empowered to act the part that best became her of being mediator at least and that while ghent was in the queens hands no provisions could pass the scheldt or the lys without her permission by which he had it in his power to starve their army the possession of these towns might likewise teach the dutch and imperialists to preserve a degree of decency and civility to her majesty which both of them were upon some occasions too apt to forget and besides there was already in the town of ghent a battalion of british troops and a detachment of five hundred men in the citadel together with a great quantity of ammunition stores for the service of the war which would certainly have been seized or embezzled so that no service could be more seasonable or useful in the present juncture than this which the queen highly approved and left the duke a discretionary power to act as he thought fit on any future emergency  i have a little interrupted the order of time in relating the duke of ormondes proceedings who after having placed a garrison at bruges and sent a supply of men and ammunition to dunkirk retired to ghent where he continued some months till he had leave to return to england  upon the arrival of colonel disney14 at court with an account that mr hill had taken possession of dunkirk an universal joy spread over the kingdom this event being looked on as the certain forerunner of a peace besides the french faith was in so ill a reputation among us that many persons otherwise sanguine enough could never bring themselves to believe that the town would be delivered till certain intelligence came that it was actually in our hands neither were the ministers themselves altogether at ease or free from suspicion whatever countenance they made for they knew very well that the french king had many plausible reasons to elude his promise if he found cause to repent it one condition of surrendering dunkirk being a general armistice of all the troops in the british pay which her majesty was not able to perform and upon this failure the maréchal de villars as we have before related endeavoured to dissuade his court from accepting the conditions and in the very interval while those difficulties were adjusting the maréchal duxelles one of the french plenipotentiaries at utrecht whose inclinations as well as those of his colleague mons mesnager led him to favour the states more than britain assured the lord privy seal that the dutch were then pressing to enter into separate measures with his master and his lordship in a visit to the abbé de polignac observing a person to withdraw as he entered the abbés chamber was told by this minister that the person he saw was one molo of amsterdam mentioned before a famous agent for the states with france who had been entertaining him the abbé upon the same subject but that he had refused to treat with molo without the privity of england  footnote 14 colonel disney or desnée called duke disney was one of the members of the brothers club a boon companion of bolingbroke and as swift says not an old man but an old rake from various sources we gather that he was a high liver and not very nice in his ways of high living in spite however of his undoubted profligacy he must have been a man of good nature and a kindly heart since he received affectionate record from gay pope and swift mr walter sichel quotes from an unfinished sketch of a larger poem by lady mary wortley montagu in which disneys worst characteristics are held up to ridicule bolingbroke and his times pp 288290 swift often refers to him in his journal ts  mr harley whom we mentioned above to have been sent early in the spring to utrecht continued longer in holland than was at first expected but having received her majestys farther instructions was about this time arrived at hanover it was the misfortune of his electoral highness to be very ill served by mons bothmar his envoy here who assisted at all the factious meetings of the discontented party and deceived his master by a false representation of the kingdom drawn from the opinion of those to whom he confined his conversation there was likewise at the electors court a little frenchman without any merit or consequence called robethon15 who by the assistance and encouragement of the last ministry had insinuated himself into some degree of that princes favour which he used in giving his master the worst impressions he was able of those whom the queen employed in her service insinuating that the present ministers were not in the interest of his highnesss family that their views were towards the pretender that they were making an unsecure and dishonourable peace that the weight of the nation was against them and that it was impossible for them to preserve much longer their credit or power  footnote 15 one of the electors privy councillors see note vol v p 468 as little a fellow as robethon is wrote bolingbroke to thomas harley i have reason to believe that most of the ill impressions which have been given at that court have chiefly come from him and as i know him to be mercenary i doubt not but he has found his account in this his management bol correspondence vol ii p 385 ts  the earl rivers had in the foregoing year been sent to hanover in order to undeceive the elector and remove whatever prejudices might be infused into his highness against her majestys proceedings but it should seem that he had no very great success in his negotiation for soon after his return to england mons bothmars memorial appeared in the manner i have already related which discovered the sentiments of his electoral highness if they were truly represented in that memorial to differ not a little from those of the queen mr harley was therefore directed to take the first opportunity of speaking to the elector in private to assure him that although her majesty had thought herself justly provoked by the conduct of his minister yet such was her affection for his highness and concern for the interests of his family that instead of showing the least mark of resentment she had chosen to send him mr harley fully instructed to open her designs and shew his highness the real interest of britain in the present conjuncture mr harley was to give the elector a true account of what had passed in england during the first part of this session of parliament to expose to his highness the weakness of those with whom his minister had consulted and under whose directions he had acted to convince him how much lower that faction must become when a peace should be concluded and when the natural strength of the kingdom disencumbered from the burthen of the war should be at liberty to exert itself to shew him how his interest in the succession was sacrificed to that of a party that his highness had been hitherto a friend to both sides but that the measures taken by his ministers had tended only to set him at the head of one in opposition to the other to explain to the elector how fully the safety of europe was provided for by the plan of peace in her majestys speech and how little reason those would appear to have who complained the loudest of this plan if it were compared either with our engagements to them when we began the war or with their performances in the course of it  upon this occasion mr harley was to observe to the elector that it should rather be wondered at how the queen had brought france to offer so much than yet to offer no more because as soon as ever it appeared that her majesty would be at the head of this treaty and that the interests of britain were to be provided for such endeavours were used to break off the negotiation as are hardly to be paralleled and the disunion thereby created among the allies had given more opportunities to the enemy of being slow in their concessions than any other measures might possibly have done that this want of concert among the allies could not in any sort be imputed to the queen who had all along invited them to it with the greatest earnestness as the surest means to bring france to reason that she had always in a particular manner pressed the states general to come into the strictest union with her and opened to them her intentions with the greatest freedom but finding that instead of concurring with her majesty they were daily carrying on intrigues to break off the negotiation and thereby deprive her of the advantages she might justly expect from the ensuing peace having no other way left she was forced to act with france as she did by herself that however the queen had not taken upon herself to determine the interests of the allies who were at liberty of insisting on farther pretensions wherein her majesty would not be wanting to support them as far as she was able and improve the concessions already made by france in which case a good understanding and harmony among the confederates would yet be of the greatest use for making the enemy more tractable and easy  i have been more particular in reciting the substance of mr harleys instructions because it will serve as a recapitulation of what i have already said upon this subject and seems to set her majestys intentions and proceedings at this time in the clearest light  after the cessation of arms declared by the duke of ormonde upon the delivery of dunkirk the british plenipotentiaries very earnestly pressed those of holland to come into a general armistice for if the whole confederacy acted in conjunction this would certainly be the best means for bringing the common enemy to reasonable terms of peace but the states deluded by the boundless promises of count zinzendorf and the undertaking talent of prince eugene who dreaded the conclusion of the war as the period of his glory would not hear of a cessation the loss of eighteen thousand britons was not a diminution of weight in the balance of such an ally as the emperor and such a general as the prince besides they looked upon themselves to be still superior to france in the field and although their computation was certainly right in point of number yet in my opinion the conclusion drawn from it was grounded upon a great mistake i have been assured by several persons of our own country and some foreigners of the first rank both for skill and station in arms that in most victories obtained in the present war the british troops were ever employed in the post of danger and honour and usually began the attack being allowed to be naturally more fearless than the people of any other country by which they were not only an example of courage to the rest but must be acknowledged without partiality to have governed the fortune of the day since it is known enough how small a part of an army is generally engaged in any battle it may likewise be added that nothing is of greater moment in war than opinion the french by their frequent losses which they chiefly attributed to the courage of our men believed that a british general at the head of british troops was not to be overcome and the maréchal de villars was quickly sensible of the advantage he had got for in a very few days after the desertion of the allies happened the earl of albemarles disgrace at denain by a feint of the maréchals and a manifest failure somewhere or other both of courage and conduct on the side of the confederates the blame of which was equally shared between prince eugene and the earl although it is certain the duke of ormonde gave the latter timely warning of his danger observing he was neither intrenched as he ought nor provided with bridges sufficient for the situation he was in and at such a distance from the main army16  footnote 16 it is alleged by the continuator of rapin that the surprise and defeat of the confederated troops under the earl of albemarle at denain was in a great measure owing to the duke of ormonde having in spite of all remonstrance reclaimed and carried off certain pontoons which had been lent to the allies for prince eugene having received intelligence of the design against albemarle marched to his succour but the bridge having broken under the quantity of the baggage which had been transported across the scheldt he could only remain the spectator of their misfortune s  the marquis de torcy had likewise the same sentiments of what mighty consequence those few british battalions were to the confederate army since he advised his master to deliver up dunkirk although the queen could not perform the condition understood which was a cessation of arms of all the foreign forces in her pay  it must be owned that mons de torcy made great merit of this confidence that his master placed in the queen and observing her majestys displeasure against the dutch on account of their late proceedings endeavoured to inflame it with aggravations enough insinuating that since the states had acted so ungratefully the queen should let her forces join with those of france in order to compel the confederates to a peace but although this overture were very tenderly hinted from the french court her majesty heard it with the utmost abhorrence and ordered her secretary mr st john created about this time viscount bolingbroke17 to tell mons de torcy that no provocations whatever should tempt her to distress her allies but she would endeavour to bring them to reason by fair means or leave them to their own conduct that if the former should be found impracticable she would then make her own peace and content herself with doing the office of a mediator between both parties but if the states should at any time come to a better mind and suffer their ministers to act in conjunction with hers she would assert their just interests to the utmost and make no farther progress in any treaty with france until those allies received all reasonable satisfaction both as to their barrier and their trade the british plenipotentiaries were directed to give the same assurances to the dutch ministers at utrecht and withal to let them know that the queen was determined by their late conduct to make peace either with or without them but would much rather choose the former  footnote 17 bolingbroke had understood that he would not lose rank on his promotion from which he concluded that the earldom of bolingbroke extinct in his family would be revived in his favour his indignation however was very keen when he was created only a viscount he wrote to strafford at utrecht that his promotion had been a mortification to him in the house of commons he said i may say that i was at the head of business  there was therefore nothing to flatter my ambition in removing me from thence but giving me the title which had been many years in my family and which reverted to the crown about a year ago by the death of the last of the elder house  i own to you that i felt more indignation than ever in my life i had done letter to the earl of strafford july 23 1712 ts  there was however one advantage which her majesty resolved to make by this defection of her foreigners she had been led by the mistaken politics of some years past to involve herself in several guaranties with the princes of the north which were in some sort contradictory to one another but this conduct of theirs wholly annulled all such engagements and left her at liberty to interpose in the affairs of those parts of europe in such a manner as would best serve the interests of her own kingdoms as well as that of the protestant religion and settle a due balance of power in the north  the grand article for preventing the union of france and spain was to be executed during a cessation of arms but many difficulties arising about that and some other points of great importance to the common cause which could not easily be adjusted either between the french and british plenipotentiaries at utrecht or by correspondence between mons de torcy and the ministry here the queen took the resolution of sending the lord viscount bolingbroke immediately to france fully instructed in all her intentions and authorized to negotiate every thing necessary for settling the treaty of peace in such a course as might bring it to a happy and speedy conclusion he was empowered to agree to a general suspension of arms by sea and land between great britain france and spain to continue for four months or until the conclusion of the peace provided france and spain would previously give positive assurances to make good the terms demanded by her majesty for the duke of savoy and would likewise adjust and determine the forms of the several renunciations to be made by both those crowns in order to prevent their being ever united the lord bolingbroke was likewise authorized to settle some differences relating to the elector of bavaria for whose interests france was as much concerned as her majesty was for those of the duke of savoy to explain all doubtful articles which particularly related to the advantages of britain to know the real ultimatum as it is termed of france upon the general plan of peace and lastly to cut off all hopes from that court of ever bringing the queen to force her allies to a disadvantageous peace her majesty resolving to impose no scheme at all upon them or to debar them from the liberty of endeavouring to obtain the best conditions they could  the lord bolingbroke went to france in the beginning of august18 was received at court with particular marks of distinction and respect and in a very few days by his usual address and ability performed every part of his commission extremely to the queens content and his own honour he returned to england before the end of the month but mr prior who went along with him was left behind to adjust whatever differences might remain or arise between the two crowns19  footnote 18 lord bolingbroke and prior set out for france last saturday my lords business is to hasten the peace before the dutch are too much mauled and hinder france from carrying the jest of beating them too far journal to stella august 7th 1712 see vol ii p 381 of present edition the result of bolingbrokes visit was the signing on august 19th of an agreement for the suspension of arms for four months torcys reception of bolingbroke was so managed that the bon vivant peer had as pleasant a time as he could well have wished how much influence that had on bolingbroke we can only speculate but it is certain that he would have made a separate peace with france after his return had oxford been willing see torcys mémoires vol ii p 202 bolingbroke avoit conseillé à la reine sa maîtresse de préférer une paix particulière à la suspension darmes et dassurer au plus tôt à ses sujets la jouissance de toutes les conditions dont le roi étoit convenu en faveur de langleterre ts  footnote 19 there is a long letter from lord bolingbroke to mr prior on the subject of this negotiation printed in scotts edition of swift vol xv pp 524529 wsj  in the mean time the general conferences at utrecht which for several weeks had been let fall since the delivery of dunkirk were now resumed but the dutch still declaring against a suspension of arms and refusing to accept the queens speech as a plan to negotiate upon there was no progress made for some time in the great work of the peace whereupon the british plenipotentiaries told those of the states that if the queens endeavours could not procure more than the contents of her speech or if the french should ever fall short of what was there offered the dutch could blame none but themselves who by their conduct had rendered things difficult that would otherwise have been easy however her majesty thought it prudent to keep the states still in hopes of her good offices to prevent them from taking the desperate course of leaving themselves wholly at the mercy of france which was an expedient they formerly practised and which a party among them was now inclined to advise  whilst the congress at utrecht remained in this inactive state the queen proceeded to perfect that important article for preventing the union of france and spain it was proposed and accepted that philip should renounce france for himself and his posterity and that the most christian king and all the princes of his blood should in the like manner renounce spain  it must be confessed that this project of renunciation lay under a great disrepute by the former practices of this very king lewis xiv pursuant to an absurd notion among many in that kingdom of a divine right annexed to proximity of blood not to be controlled by any human law  but it is plain the french themselves had recourse to this method after all their infractions of it since the pyrenean treaty for the first dauphin in whom the original claim was vested renounced for himself and his eldest son which opened the way to philip duke of anjou who would however hardly have succeeded if it had not been for the will made in his favour by the last king charles ii  it is indeed hard to reflect with any patience upon the unaccountable stupidity of the princes of europe for some centuries past who left a probability to france of succeeding in a few ages to all their dominions whilst at the same time no alliance with that kingdom could be of advantage to any prince by reason of the salique law should not common prudence have taught every sovereign in christendom to enact a salique law with respect to france for want of which it is almost a miracle that the bourbon family hath not possessed the universal monarchy by right of inheritance when the french assert a proximity of blood gives a divine right as some of their ministers who ought to be more wise or honest have lately advanced in this very case to the title of spain do they not by allowing a french succession make their own kings usurpers or if the salique law be divine is it not of universal obligation and consequently of force to exclude france from inheriting by daughters or lastly if that law be of human institution may it not be enacted in any state with whatever extent or limitation the legislature shall think fit for the notion of an unchangeable human law is an absurdity in government to be believed only by ignorance and supported by power from hence it follows that the children of the late queen of france although she had renounced were as legally excluded from succeeding to spain as if the salique law had been fundamental in that kingdom since that exclusion was established by every power in spain which could possibly give a sanction to any law there and therefore the duke of anjous title is wholly founded upon the bequest of his predecessor which hath great authority in that monarchy as it formerly had in ours upon the confirmation of the cortes and the general consent of the people  it is certain the faith of princes is so frequently subservient to their ambition that renunciations have little validity otherwise than from the powers and parties whose interest it is to support them but this renunciation which the queen hath exacted from the french king and his grandson i take to be armed with all the essential circumstances that can fortify such an act for as it is necessary for the security of every prince in europe that those two great kingdoms should never be united so the chief among them will readily consent to be guarantees for preventing such a misfortune  besides this proposal according to her majestys expression in her speech is of such a nature that it executes itself because the spaniards who dread such an union for every reason that can have weight among men took care that their king should not only renounce in the most solemn manner but likewise that the act should be framed in the strongest terms themselves could invent or we could furnish them with as to france upon supposal of the young dauphins dying in a few years that kingdom will not be in a condition to engage in a long war against a powerful alliance fortified with the addition of the spaniards and the party of the duke of berry or whoever else shall be next claimer and the longer the present dauphin lives the weaker must philips interest be in france because the princes who are to succeed by this renunciation will have most power and credit in the kingdom  the mischiefs occasioned by the want of a good understanding between the allies especially britain and holland were raised every day the french taking the advantage and raising difficulties not only upon the general plan of peace but likewise upon the explanation of several articles in the projected treaty between them and her majesty they insisted to have lille as the equivalent for dunkirk and demanded tournay maubeuge and condé for the two or three towns mentioned in the queens speech which the british plenipotentiaries were so far from allowing that they refused to confer with those of france upon that foot although at the same time the former had fresh apprehensions that the dutch in a fit of despair would accept whatever terms the enemy pleased to offer and by precipitating their own peace prevent her majesty from obtaining any advantages both for her allies and herself  it is most certain that the repeated losses suffered by the states in little more than two months after they had withdrawn themselves from the queens assistance did wholly disconcert their counsels20 and their prudence as it is usual began to forsake them with their good fortune they were so weak as to be still deluded by their friends in england who continued to give them hopes of some mighty and immediate resource from hence for when the duke of ormonde had been about a month in ghent he received a letter from the maréchal de villars to inform him that the dutch generals taken at denain had told the maréchal publicly of a sudden revolution expected in britain that particularly the earl of albemarle and mons hompesch discoursed very freely of it and that nothing was more commonly talked of in holland it was then likewise confidently reported in ghent that the queen was dead and we all remember what rumour flew about here at the very same time as if her majestys health were in a bad condition  footnote 20 the dutch had been defeated at douay and the allies had suffered reverses by the reduction of quesnoy and bouchain ts  whether such vain hopes as these gave spirit to the dutch whether their frequent misfortunes made them angry and sullen whether they still expected to overreach us by some private stipulations with france through the mediation of the elector of bavaria as that prince afterwards gave out or whatever else was the cause they utterly refused a cessation of arms and made not the least return to all the advances and invitations made by her majesty until the close of the campaign  it was then the states first began to view their affairs in another light to consider how little the vast promises of count zinzendorf were to be relied on to be convinced that france was not disposed to break with her majesty only to gratify their ill humour or unreasonable demands to discover that their factious correspondents on this side the water had shamefully misled them that some of their own principal towns grew heartily weary of the war and backward in their loans and lastly that prince eugene their new general whether his genius or fortune had left him was not for their turn they therefore directed their ministers at utrecht to signify to the lord privy seal and the earl of strafford that the states were disposed to comply with her majesty and to desire her good offices with france particularly that tournay and condé might be left to them as part of their barrier without which they could not be safe that the elector of bavaria might not be suffered to retain any town in the netherlands which would be as bad for holland as if those places were in the hands of france therefore the states proposed that luxembourg namur charleroy and nieuport might be delivered to the emperor lastly that the french might not insist on excepting the four species of goods out of the tariff of one thousand six hundred and sixtyfour that if her majesty could prevail with france to satisfy their masters on these articles they would be ready to submit in all the rest  when the queen received an account of this good disposition in the states general immediately orders were sent to mr prior to inform the ministers of the french court that her majesty had now some hopes of the dutch complying with her measures and therefore she resolved as she had always declared whenever those allies came to themselves not to make the peace without their reasonable satisfaction the difficulty that most pressed was about the disposal of tournay and condé the dutch insisted strongly to have both and the french were extremely unwilling to part with either  the queen judged the former would suffice for completing the barrier of the states mr prior was therefore directed to press the marquis de torcy effectually on this head and to terminate all that ministers objections by assuring him of her majestys resolutions to appear openly on the side of the dutch if this demand were refused it was thought convenient to act in this resolute manner with france whose late success against holland had taught the ministers of the most christian king to resume their old imperious manner of treating with that republic to which they were farther encouraged by the ill understanding between her majesty and the allies  this appeared from the result of an idle quarrel that happened about the end of august21 at utrecht between a french and a dutch plenipotentiary mons mesnager and count rechteren22 wherein the court of france demanded such abject submissions and with so much haughtiness as plainly shewed they were pleased with any occasion of mortifying the dutch  footnote 21 july s  footnote 22 see note on p 95 ts  besides the politics of the french ran at this time very opposite to those of britain they thought the ministers here durst not meet the parliament without a peace and that therefore her majesty would either force the states to comply with france by delivering up tournay which was the principal point in dispute or would finish her own peace with france and spain leaving a fixed time for holland to refuse or accept the terms imposed on them but the queen who thought the demand of tournay by the states to be very necessary and just was determined to insist upon it and to declare openly against france rather than suffer her ally to want a place so useful for their barrier and mr prior was ordered to signify this resolution of her majesty to mons de torcy in case that minister could not be otherwise prevailed on  the british plenipotentiaries did likewise at the same time express to those of holland her majestys great satisfaction that the states were at last disposed to act in confidence with her that she wished this resolution had been sooner taken since nobody had gained by the delay but the french king that however her majesty did not question the procuring a safe and honourable peace by united counsels reasonable demands and prudent measures that she would assist them in getting whatever was necessary to their barrier and in settling to their satisfaction the exceptions made by france out of the tariff of one thousand six hundred and sixtyfour that no other difficulties remained of moment to retard the peace since the queen had obtained sicily for the duke of savoy and in the settlement of the low countries would adhere to what she delivered from the throne that as to the empire her majesty heartily wished their barrier as good as could be desired but that we were not now in circumstances to expect every thing exactly according to the scheme of holland france had already offered a great part and the queen did not think the remainder worth the continuance of the war  her majesty conceived the peace in so much forwardness that she thought fit about this time to nominate the duke of hamilton and the lord lexington for ambassadors in france and spain to receive the renunciations in both courts and adjust matters of commerce  the duke23 was preparing for his journey when he was challenged to a duel24 by the lord mohun25 a person of infamous character he killed his adversary upon the spot though he himself received a wound and weakened by the loss of blood as he was leaning in the arms of his second was most barbarously stabbed in the breast by lieutenantgeneral macartney26 who was second to lord mohun he died a few minutes after in the field and the murderer made his escape i thought so surprising an event might deserve barely to be related although it be something foreign to my subject  footnote 23 james duke of hamilton was a gentleman of the bedchamber to king charles ii he succeeded his father in the title april 18th 1694 and was sent the same year envoy extraordinary to france  he was killed november 15th 1712 s  footnote 24 swifts account of the duel is exactly agreeable to the depositions of colonel hamilton before a committee of the council s  footnote 25 charles lord mohun was the last offspring of a very noble and ancient family of which william de mohun who accompanied the norman conqueror was the first founder in england s  footnote 26 general macartney was tried at the kings bench bar for the murder june 13th 1716 and the jury found him guilty of manslaughter s  the earl of strafford who had come to england in may last27 in order to give her majesty an account of the disposition of affairs in holland was now returning with her last instructions to let the dutch minister know that some points would probably meet with difficulties not to be overcome which once might have been easily obtained to shew what evil consequences had already flowed from their delay and irresolution and to entreat them to fix on some proposition reasonable in itself as well as possible to be effected that the queen would insist upon the cession of tournay by france provided the states would concur in finishing the peace without starting new objections or insisting upon farther points that the french demands in favour of the elector of bavaria appeared to be such as the queen was of opinion the states ought to agree to which were to leave the elector in possession of luxembourg namur and charleroy subject to the terms of their barrier until he should be restored to his electorate and to give him the kingdom of sardinia to efface the stain of his degradation in the electoral college that the earl had brought over a project of a new treaty of succession and barrier which her majesty insisted the states should sign before the conclusion of the peace the former treaty having been disadvantageous to her subjects containing in it the seeds of future dissensions and condemned by the sense of the nation lastly that her majesty notwithstanding all provocations had for the sake of the dutch and in hopes of their recovery from those false notions which had so long misled them hitherto kept the negotiations open that the offers now made them were her last and this the last time she would apply to them that they must either agree or expect the queen would proceed immediately to conclude her treaty with france and spain in conjunction with such of her allies as would think fit to adhere to her  footnote 27 come to england in  last in original edition the word may was supplied in the edition of 1775 wsj  as to savoy that the queen expected the states would concur with her in making good the advantages stipulated for that duke and in prevailing with the emperor to consent to an absolute neutrality in italy until the peace should be concluded  the governing party in holland however in appearance disposed to finish affected new delays and raised many difficulties about the four species of goods which the french had excepted out of the tariff count zinzendorf the emperors plenipotentiary did all that was possible to keep up this humour in the dutch in hopes to put them under a necessity of preparing for the next campaign and some time after went so far in this pursuit that he summoned the several ministers of the empire and told them he had letters from his master with orders to signify to them that his imperial majesty resolved to begin the campaign early with all his forces united against france of which he desired they would send notice to all their courts that the several princes might be ready to furnish their contingents and recruits at the same time zinzendorf endeavoured to borrow two millions of florins upon the security of some imperial cities but could not succeed either amongst the jews or at amsterdam  when the earl of strafford arrived at utrecht the lord privy seal and he communicated to the dutch ministers the new treaty for a succession and barrier as the queen had ordered it to be prepared here in england differing from the former in several points of the greatest moment obvious to any who will be at the pains to compare them this was strenuously opposed for several weeks by the plenipotentiaries of the states but the province of utrecht where the congress was held immediately sent orders to their representatives at the hague to declare their province thankful to the queen that they agreed the peace should be made on the terms proposed by france and consented to the new projected treaty of barrier and succession and about the close of the year one thousand seven hundred and twelve four of the seven provinces had delivered their opinions for putting an end to the war  this unusual precipitation in the states so different from the whole tenor of their former conduct was very much suspected by the british plenipotentiaries their lordships had received intelligence that the dutch ministers held frequent conferences with those of france and had offered to settle their interests with that crown without the concurrence of britain count zinzendorf and his colleagues appeared likewise all on the sudden to have the same dispositions and to be in great haste to settle their several differences with the states the reasons for this proceeding were visible enough many difficulties were yet undetermined in the treaty of commerce between her majesty and france for the adjusting of which and some other points the queen had lately dispatched the duke of shrewsbury to that court some of these were of hard digestion with which the most christian king would not be under a necessity of complying when he had no farther occasion for us and might upon that account afford better terms to the other two powers besides the emperor and the states could very well spare her majesty the honour of being arbitrator of a general peace and the latter hoped by this means to avoid the new treaty of barrier and succession which we were now forcing on them  to prevent the consequences of this evil there fortunately fell out an incident which the two lords at utrecht knew well how to make use of the quarrel between mons mesnager and count rechteren formerly mentioned had not yet been made up the french and dutch differing in some circumstances about the satisfaction to be given by the count for the affront he had offered the british plenipotentiaries kept this dispute on foot for several days and in the mean time pressed the dutch to finish the new treaty of barrier and succession between her majesty and them which about the middle of january was concluded fully to the queens satisfaction  but while these debates and differences continued at the congress the queen resolved to put a speedy end to her part in the war she therefore sent orders to the lord privy seal and the earl of stafford to prepare every thing necessary for signing her own treaty with france this she hoped might be done against the meeting of her parliament now prorogued to the third of february in which time those among the allies who were really inclined towards a peace might settle their several interests by the assistance and support of her majestys plenipotentiaries and as for the rest who would either refuse to comply or endeavour to protract the negotiation the heads of their respective demands which france had yielded by her majestys intervention and agreeable to the plan laid down in her speech should be mentioned in the treaty and a time limited for the several powers concerned to receive or reject them  the pretender was not yet gone out of france upon some difficulties alleged by the french about procuring him a safe conduct to barleduc in the duke of lorraines dominions where it was then proposed he should reside the queen altogether bent upon quieting the minds of her subjects declared she would not sign the peace till that person were removed although several wise men believed he could be no where less dangerous to britain than in the place where he was  the argument which most prevailed on the states to sign the new treaty of barrier and succession with britain was her majestys promise to procure tournay for them from france after which no more differences remained between us and that republic and consequently they had no farther temptations to any separate transactions with the french who thereupon began to renew their litigious and haughty manner of treating with the dutch the satisfaction they extorted for the affront given by count rechteren to mons mesnager although somewhat softened by the british ministers at utrecht was yet so rigorous that her majesty could not forbear signifying her resentment of it to the most christian king mons mesnager who seemed to have more the genius of a merchant than a minister began in his conferences with the plenipotentiaries of the states to raise new disputes upon points which both we and they had reckoned upon as wholly settled the abbé de polignac a most accomplished person of great generosity and universal understanding was gone to france to receive the cardinals cap and the maréchal duxelles was wholly guided by his colleague mons mesnager who kept up those brangles that for a time obstructed the peace some of which were against all justice and others of small importance both of very little advantage to his country and less to the reputation of his master or himself this low talent in business which the cardinal de polignac used in contempt to call a spirit of negotiating made it impossible for the two lords plenipotentiaries with all their abilities and experience to bring mesnager to reason in several points both with us and the states his concessions were few and constrained serving only to render him more tenacious of what he refused in several of the towns which the states were to keep he insisted that france should retain the chatellanies or extent of country depending on them particularly that of tournay a demand the more unjustifiable because he knew his master had not only proceeded directly contrary but had erected a court in his kingdom where his own judges extended the territories about those towns he had taken as far as he pleased to direct them mons mesnager showed equal obstinacy in what his master expected for the elector of bavaria and in refusing the tariff of one thousand six hundred and sixtyfour so that the queens plenipotentiaries represented these difficulties as what might be of dangerous consequence both to the peace in general and to the states in particular if they were not speedily prevented  upon these considerations her majesty thought it her shortest and safest course to apply directly to france where she had then so able a minister as the duke of shrewsbury28  footnote 28 shrewsbury had been appointed the duke of hamiltons successor ts  the marquis de torcy secretary to the most christian king was the minister with whom the duke was to treat as having been the first who moved his master to apply to the queen for a peace in opposition to a violent faction in that kingdom who were as eagerly bent to continue the war as any other could be either here or in holland  it would be very unlike a historian to refuse this great minister the praise he so justly deserveth of having treated through the whole course of so great a negotiation with the utmost candour and integrity never once failing in any promise he made and tempering a firm zeal to his masters interest with a ready compliance to what was reasonable and just mr prior whom i have formerly mentioned resided likewise now at paris with the character of minister plenipotentiary and was very acceptable to that court upon the score of his wit and humour29  footnote 29 p fitzgerald adds as well as useful to her majesty by his knowledge and dexterity in the management of affairs wsj  the duke of shrewsbury was directed to press the french court upon the points yet unsettled in the treaty of commerce between both crowns to make them drop their unreasonable demands for the elector of bavaria to let them know that the queen was resolved not to forsake her allies who were now ready to come in that she thought the best way of hastening the general peace was to determine her own particular one with france until which time she could not conveniently suffer her parliament to meet  the states were by this time so fully convinced of the queens sincerity and affection to their republic and how much they had been deceived by the insinuations of the factious party in england that they wrote a very humble letter to her majesty to desire her assistance towards settling those points they had in dispute with france and professing themselves ready to acquiesce in whatever explanation her majesty would please to make of the plan proposed in her speech to the parliament  but the queen had already prevented their desires and in the beginning of february one thousand seven hundred and twelvethirteen directed the duke of shrewsbury to inform the french court that since she had prevailed on her allies the dutch to drop the demand of condé and the other of the four species of goods which the french had excepted out of the tariff of one thousand six hundred and sixtyfour she would not sign without them that she approved of the dutch insisting to have the chatellanies restored with the towns and was resolved to stand or fall with them until they were satisfied in this point  her majesty had some apprehensions that the french created these difficulties on purpose to spin out the treaty until the campaign should begin they thought it absolutely necessary that our parliament should meet in a few weeks which could not well be ventured until the queen were able to tell both houses that her own peace was signed that this would not only facilitate what remained in difference between britain and france but leave the dutch entirely at the mercy of the latter  the queen weary of these refined mistakes in the french politics and fully resolved to be trifled with no longer sent her determinate orders to the duke of shrewsbury to let france know that her majesty had hitherto prorogued her parliament in hopes of accommodating the difficulties in her own treaties of peace and commerce with that crown as well as settling the interests of her several allies or at least that the differences in the former being removed the most christian king would have made such offers for the latter as might justify her majesty in signing her own peace whether the confederates intended to sign theirs or no but several points being yet unfinished between both crowns and others between france and the rest of the allies especially the states to which the plenipotentiaries of that court at utrecht had not thought fit to give satisfaction the queen was now come to a final determination both with relation to her own kingdoms and to the whole alliance that the campaign approaching she would not willingly be surprised in case the war was to go on that she had transmitted to the duke of shrewsbury her last resolutions and never would be prevailed on to reduce her own demands or those of her allies any lower than the scheme now sent over as an explanation of the plan laid down in her speech that her majesty had sent orders to her plenipotentiaries at utrecht to assume the character of ambassadors and sign the peace immediately with the ministers of the most christian king as soon as the duke of shrewsbury should have sent them notice that the french had complied that the queen had therefore farther prorogued her parliament to the third of march in hopes to assure them by that time of her peace being agreed on for if the two houses should meet while any uncertainty remained supplies must be asked as for a war  the duke of shrewsbury30 executed this important commission with that speed and success which could only be expected from an able minister the french king immediately yielded to the whole scheme her majesty proposed whereupon directions were sent to the lord privy seal and the earl of strafford to sign a peace between great britain and france without delay  footnote 30 swift writes to abp king october 20th 1713 that the duke of shrewsbury is the finest gentleman we have and of an excellent understanding and capacity for business scotts edition xvi 71 see also swifts remarks in the examiner no 27 vol ix of this edition p 171 and note in vol v p 377 wsj  upon the second day of march the two british plenipotentiaries met those of the allies in the townhouse at utrecht where the lord privy seal addressed himself to them in a short speech that the negotiation had now continued fourteen months with great slowness which had proved very injurious to the interests of the allies that the queen had stayed thus long and stopped the finishing of her own peace rather than leave her allies in any uncertainty that she hoped they would now be all prepared to put an end to this great work and therefore had commanded her plenipotentiaries to tell those of the allies that she found it necessary to conclude her own treaty immediately and it was her opinion that the confederates ought to finish theirs at the same time to which they were now accordingly invited by her majestys orders and lastly his lordship declared in the queens name that whoever could not be ready on the day prefixed should have a convenient time allowed them to come in  although the orders sent by the queen to her plenipotentiaries were very precise yet their lordships did not precipitate the performance of them they were directed to appoint as short a day for the signing as they conveniently could but however the particular day was left to their discretion they hoped to bring over the dutch and most of the other allies to conclude at the same time with the queen which as it would certainly be more popular to their country so they conceived it would be more safe for themselves besides upon looking over their commission a scruple sprang in their minds that they could not sign a particular peace with france their powers as they apprehended authorizing them only to sign a general one their lordships therefore sent to england to desire new powers31 and in the mean time employed themselves with great industry between the ministers of france and those of the several allies to find some expedient for smoothing the way to an agreement among them  footnote 31 lord bolingbroke who says he has not sagacity enough to find the objections that the plenipotentiaries had made to their first full powers for their satisfaction sends them a new commission and repeats to them positive orders to sign and conclude with france these difficulties of the plenipotentiaries made my lord treasurer who never failed to exert himself when he found it absolutely necessary think it high time to interpose his authority and as his lordship never yet appeared in vain all further obstructions at utrecht were after this soon removed report from the committee of secrecy 1715 pp 103 104 n  the earl of strafford went for a few days to the hague to inform the states of her majestys express commands to his colleague and himself for signing the peace as soon as possible and to desire they would be ready at the same time which the pensionary promised and that their plenipotentiaries should be empowered accordingly to the great contentment of mons buys who was now so much altered either in reality or appearance that he complained to the earl of mons heinsiuss slowness and charged all the delays and mismanagements of a twelvemonth past to that ministers account  while the earl of strafford stayed at the hague he discovered that an emissary of the duke of marlboroughs had been there some days before sent by his grace to dissuade the dutch from signing at the same time with the ministers of the queen which in england would at least have the appearance of a separate peace and oblige their british friends who knew how to turn so short a delay to very good account as well as gratify the emperor on whom it was alleged they ought to rely much more than on her majesty one of the states likewise told the earl that the same person employed by the duke was then in conference with the magistrates of rotterdam which town had declared for the continuance of the war to assure them if they would hold off a little they should see an unexpected turn in the british parliament that the duke of marlborough had a list of the discontented members in both houses who were ready to turn against the court and to crown all that his grace had certain intelligence of the queen being in so ill a state of health as made it impossible for her to live above six weeks so restless and indefatigable is avarice and ambition when inflamed by a desire of revenge  but representations which had been so often tried were now offered too late most of the allies except the emperor were willing to put an end to the war upon her majestys plan and the further delay of three weeks must be chiefly imputed to that litigious manner of treating peculiar to the french whose plenipotentiaries at utrecht insisted with obstinacy upon many points which at paris mons de torcy had given up  the emperor expected to keep all he already possessed in italy that port longue32 on the tuscan coast should be delivered to him by france and lastly that he should not be obliged to renounce spain but the queen as well as france thought that his imperial majesty ought to sit down contented with his partage of naples and milan and to restore those territories in italy which he had taken from the rightful proprietors and by the possession of which he was grown dangerous to the italian princes by reviving antiquated claims upon them  footnote 32 portolongone in the island of elba opposite the tuscan coast wsj  this prince had likewise objected to her majestys expedient of suffering the elector of bavaria to retain luxembourg under certain conditions by way of security until his electorate were restored but the queen supposing that these affected delays were intended only with a view of continuing the war resolved to defer the peace no longer on the emperors account  in the middle of march one thousand seven hundred and twelvethirteen a courier arrived at utrecht from france with the plan of a general peace as it had been agreed between the duke of shrewsbury and mons de torcy wherein every particular relating to the interests and pretensions of the several allies was brought so near to what each of them would accept that the british plenipotentiaries  hoped the peace would be general in ten or twelve days the portuguese and dutch were already prepared and others were daily coming in by means of their lordships good offices who found mons mesnager and his colleague very stubborn to the last another courier was dispatched to france upon some disputes about inserting the titles of her majesty and the most christian king and to bring a general plan for the interests of those allies who should not be ready against the time prefixed the french renunciations were now arrived at utrecht and it was agreed that those as well as that of the king of spain should be inserted at length in every treaty by which means the whole confederacy would become guaranties of them  the courier last sent to france returned to utrecht on the twentyseventh of march with the concessions of that court upon every necessary point so that all things being ready for putting a period to this great and difficult work the lord privy seal and the earl of strafford gave notice to the ministers of the several allies that their lordships had appointed tuesday the thirtyfirst instant wherein to sign a treaty of peace and a treaty of commerce between the queen of great britain their mistress and the most christian king and hoped the said allies would be prepared at the same time to follow their example accordingly their lordships employed the three intervening days in smoothing the few difficulties that remained between the french ministers and those of the several confederate powers  the important day being now come the lord bishop of bristol and the earl of strafford having assumed the character of ambassadors extraordinary33 gave a memorial in behalf of the french protestants to the maréchal duxelles and his colleague who were to transmit it to their court and these delivered to the british ambassadors a declaration in writing that the pretender was actually gone out of france  footnote 33 to avoid the parade of ceremony they had hitherto been considered only as plenipotentiaries n  the conditions of peace to be allowed the emperor and the empire as adjusted between britain and france were now likewise delivered to the count zinzendorf these and some other previous matters of smaller consequence being finished the treaties of peace and commerce between her majesty of britain and the most christian king were signed at the lord privy seals house between two and three of the clock in the afternoon the ministers of the duke of savoy signed about an hour after then the assembly adjourned to the earl of staffords where they all went to dinner and about nine at night the peace was signed by the ministers of portugal by those of prussia at eleven and when it was near midnight by the states  thus after all the opposition raised by a strong party in france and by a virulent faction in britain after all the artifices of those who presided at the hague and for their private interest endeavoured in conjunction with their friends in england to prolong the war after the restless endeavours of the imperial court to render the treaty ineffectual the firm steady conduct of the queen the wisdom and courage of her ministry and the abilities of those whom she employed in her negotiations abroad prevailed to have a peace signed in one day by every power concerned except that of the emperor and the empire for his imperial majesty liked his situation too well to think of a peace while the drudgery and expenses of the war lay upon other shoulders and the advantages were to redound only to himself  during this whole negotiation the king of spain who was not acknowledged by any of the confederates had consequently no minister at utrecht but the differences between her majesty and that prince were easily settled by the lord lexington at madrid and the marquis of monteleon here so that upon the duke dossunas arrival at the congress some days after the peace he was ready to conclude a treaty between the queen and his master neither is it probable that the dutch or any other ally except the emperor will encounter any difficulties of moment to retard their several treaties with his catholic majesty  the treaties of peace and commerce between britain and france were ratified here on the seventh of april on the twentyeighth the ratifications were exchanged and on the fifth of may the peace was proclaimed in the usual manner but with louder acclamations and more extraordinary rejoicings of the people than had ever been remembered on the like occasion34  footnote 34  the treaty was brought to england by george st john bolingbrokes young brother who arrived with it in london on good friday 3rd april 1713 ts   it need hardly be observed that this history is left incomplete by the author s sir walter scotts note hardly agrees with swifts own statement to stella writing under date may 16th 1713 he says i have just finished my treatise and must be ten days correcting it it is evident that swift did not intend to write a history of the four last years of queen annes reign a better title for this work would be the title originally given it namely history of the peace of utrecht in the letter already quoted from erasmus lewis swifts account of the negotiations for the peace are thus remarked upon that part of it which relates to the negotiations of peace whether at london or at utrecht they admire exceedingly and declare they never yet saw that or any other transaction drawn up with so much perspicuity or in a style so entertaining and instructive to the reader in every respect ts                                    an abstract  of the  history of england  from the invasion of it by julius caesar  to the reign of henry the second   note  the abstract of the history of england here reprinted calls for little or no comment it is but a dry relation of events with no touch in the recital of any of those qualities which characterize swifts writings the facts were evidently obtained from the old chroniclers what object swift had in writing this abstract is not known if the dedication to the count de gyllenborg truly states his intention it must be confessed that the foreigners and gentlemen of our own country had not much upon which to congratulate themselves why swift should have chosen the count de gyllenborg to whom to address the dedication must also remain a matter for conjecture the count had been sent out of the british isles for instigating a conspiracy for a jacobite insurrection in great britain swift wrote his dedication three years after the counts expulsion knowing that the counts master charles xii of sweden had been a party to the plot he yet writes in a most amiable tone of friendliness towards both with a parenthetical sneer at his present britannic majesty undoubtedly this dedication might easily and fairly be taken as strong presumptive evidence of a leaning on swifts part towards the pretender it will however be more truly interpreted if it be considered as an expression of contempt for the king of england and the ministry in power  the text of the present reprint is that given by deane swift from his edition of his kinsmans works issued in 1765 and 1768 4to edit vols viii and xiii deane swift thought that the narratives of rufus henry i and stephen would appear to be such a model of english history as will make all men of taste and especially foreigners regret that he pursued his plan no further  ts   to the count de gyllenborg1  footnote 1 charles count gyllenborg 16791746 was swedish ambassador at london 171016 he then joined in a jacobite plot was arrested in january 17167 and expelled the kingdom in august 1717 he afterwards filled high offices in his own country wsj  dublin in ireland nov 2 1719  sir  it is now about sixteen years since i first entertained the design of writing a history of england from the beginning of william rufus to the end of queen elizabeth such a history i mean as appears to be most wanted by foreigners and gentlemen of our own country not a voluminous work nor properly an abridgement but an exact relation of the most important affairs and events without any regard to the rest my intention was to inscribe it to the king2 your late master for whose great virtues i had ever the highest veneration as i shall continue to bear to his memory i confess it is with some disdain that i observe great authors descending to write any dedications at all and for my own part when i looked round on all the princes of europe i could think of none who might deserve that distinction from me besides the king your master for i say nothing of his present britannic majesty to whose person and character i am an utter stranger and like to continue so neither can i be suspected of flattery on this point since it was some years after that i had the honour of an invitation to his court before you were employed as his minister in england which i heartily repent that i did not accept whereby as you can be my witness i might have avoided some years uneasiness and vexation during the last four years of our late excellent queen as well as a long melancholy prospect since in a most obscure disagreeable country and among a most profligate and abandoned people  footnote 2 charles xii king of sweden who was killed in 1718 d s  i was diverted from pursuing this history partly by the extreme difficulty but chiefly by the indignation i conceived at the proceedings of a faction which then prevailed and the papers lay neglected in my cabinet until you saw me in england when you know how far i was engaged in thoughts and business of another kind upon her majestys lamented death i returned to my station in this kingdom since which time there is not a northern curate among you who hath lived more obscure than myself or a greater stranger to the commonest transactions of the world it is but very lately that i found the following papers which i had almost forgotten i publish them now for two reasons first for an encouragement to those who have more youth3 and leisure and good temper than i towards pursuing the work as far as it was intended by me or as much further as they please the second reason is to have an opportunity of declaring the profound respect i have for the memory of your royal master and the sincere regard and friendship i bear to yourself for i must bring to your mind how proud i was to distinguish you among all the foreign ministers with whom i had the honour to be acquainted i am a witness of the zeal you shewed not only for the honour and interest of your master but for the advantage of the protestant religion in germany and how knowingly and feelingly you often spoke to me upon that subject we all loved you as possessed of every quality that could adorn an english gentleman and esteemed you as a faithful subject to your prince and an able negotiator neither shall any reverse of fortune have power to lessen you either in my friendship or esteem and i must take leave to assure you further that my affection towards persons hath not been at all diminished by the frown of power upon them those whom you and i once thought great and good men continue still so in my eyes and my heart only with a        caetera desiderantur  footnote 3 the author was then in his fiftysecond year ds     an abstract of the history   of england   from the invasion of it by julius caesar   to william the conqueror     britons   heathens  the most ancient account we have of britain is that the island was full of inhabitants divided into several petty kingdoms as most nations of the world appear to have been at first the bodies of the britons were painted with a skycoloured blue either as an ornament or else for terror to their enemies in their religion they were heathens as all the world was before christ except the jews    druids  their priests were called druids these lived in hollow trees and committed not their mysteries to writing but delivered them down by tradition whereby they were in time wholly lost  the britons had wives in common so many to a particular tribe or society and the children were in common to that society  about fifty years before christ julius caesar the first roman emperor having conquered gaul or france invaded britain rather to increase his glory than conquests for having overcome the natives in one or two battles he returned    claudius   nero  the next invasion of britain by the romans then masters of most of the known world was in the reign of the emperor claudius but it was not wholly subdued till that of nero it was governed by lieutenants or deputies sent from rome as ireland is now by deputies from england and continued thus under the romans for about 460 years till that empire being invaded by the goths and vandals the romans were forced not only to recall their own armies but also to draw from hence the bravest of the britons for their assistance against those barbarians    picts   picts wall  the roman conquests in this island reached no further northward than to that part of scotland where stirling and glasgow are seated the region beyond was held not worth the conquering it was inhabited by a barbarous people called caledonians and picts who being a rough fierce nation daily infested the british borders therefore the emperor severus built a wall from stirling to glasgow to prevent the invasions of the picts it is commonly called the picts wall    ad 455 saxons  these picts and caledonians or scots encouraged by the departure of the romans do now cruelly infest and invade the britons by sea and land the britons choose vortigern for their king who was forced to invite the saxons a fierce northern people to assist him against those barbarians the saxons came over and beat the picts in several battles but at last pick quarrels with the britons themselves and after a long war drive them into the mountains of wales and cornwall and establish themselves in seven kingdoms in britain by them now called england these seven kingdoms are usually styled the saxon heptarchy    ad 460 arthur  about this time lived king arthur if the whole story be not a fable who was so famous for beating the saxons in several battles    ad 600 austin  the britons received christianity very early and as is reported from some of the disciples themselves so that when the romans left britain the britons were generally christians but the saxons were heathens till pope gregory the great sent over hither austin the monk by whom ethelbert king of the southsaxons and his subjects were converted to christianity and the whole island soon followed the example    ad 819 egbert  footnote 4 the edition of 1765 gives the date as 819 but according to dr stubbs egbert

language in britain was british now called welsh or latin but with the saxons english came in although extremely different from what it is now the present names of towns shires c were given by them and the whole kingdom was called england from the angles who were a branch of the saxons    danes  as soon as the saxons were settled the danes began to trouble and invade them as they the saxons had before done the britons  these danes came out of germany denmark and norway a rough warlike people little different from the saxons to whom they were nigh neighbours    edgar  after many invasions

edgar atheling and usurped the crown for himself  edward while he was in normandy met so good reception that it was said he made a promise to that duke that in case he recovered his kingdom and died without issue he would leave it to him edward dying william duke of normandy sends to harold to claim the crown but harold now in possession resolves to keep it upon which duke william having prepared a mighty fleet and army invades england lands at hastings and sets fire to his fleet to cut off all hope from his men of returning to harold he sent his messenger demanding the kingdom and his subjection but harold returned him this answer that unless he departed his land he would make him sensible of his just displeasure so harold advanced his forces into sussex within seven miles of his enemy the norman duke to save the effusion of blood sent these offers to harold either wholly to resign the kingdom to him or to try the quarrel with him in single combat to this harold did not agree    ad 1066  then the battle joined the normans had gotten the worst if it had not been for a stratagem they invented which got them the day in this engagement harold was killed and william duke of normandy became king of england under the name of william the conqueror   the reign of william the second  surnamed rufus  at the time of the conquerors death his eldest son robert upon some discontent with his father being absent in france5 william the second son made use of this juncture and without attending his fathers funeral hastened to england where pursuant to the will of the deceased prince6 the nobility although more inclined to favour robert were prevailed with to admit him king partly by his promises to abate the rigour of the late reign and restore the laws and liberties which had been then abolished but chiefly by the credit and solicitations of lanfranc for that prelate had formerly a share in his education and always a great affection for his person at winchester he took possession of his fathers treasure7 in obedience to whose command as well as to ingratiate himself with the people he distributed it among churches and religious houses and applied it to the redeeming of prisoners and other acts of popularity  footnote 5  he was then at abbeville in picardy ds  footnote 6  william the conqueror left normandy to his son robert but said of england so it pleased god he should be glad that william his obedient and best beloved son should enjoy it after his death d s  footnote 7  which was sixty thousand pounds in silver besides gold jewels and platebrompton ds  in the mean time robert returned to normandy took possession of that duchy with great applause and content of his people and spited at the indignity done him by his father and the usurpation of his brother in consequence thereof prepared a great fleet and army to invade england nor did there want an occasion to promote his interest if the slowness the softness and credulity of his nature could have suffered him to make a right improvement of it  odo bishop of bayeux8 of whom frequent mention is made in the preceding reign9 a prelate of incurable ambition either on account of his age or character being restored to his liberty and possessions in england grew into envy and discontent upon seeing lanfranc preferred before him by the new king in his favour and ministry he therefore formed a conspiracy with several nobles of norman birth to depose the king and sent an invitation to robert to hasten over mean time the conspirators in order to distract the kings forces seized on several parts of england at once bristol norwich leicester worcester shrewsbury bath and durham were secured by several noblemen odo himself seized rochester reduced the coasts of kent and sent messages to robert to make all possible speed  footnote 8 odo was half brother to william the conqueror ds  footnote 9 sir w temple wrote an introduction to the history of england as it only extended to the death of william the conqueror it is probable that it is what is here referred to it will be found in vol ii of sir w temples works edited by swift wsj  the king alarmed at these many and sudden defections thought it his best course to begin his defence by securing the good will of the people he redressed many grievances eased them of certain oppressive taxes and tributes gave liberty to hunt in his forest with other marks of indulgence which however forced from him by the necessity of the time he had the skill or fortune so to order as they neither lost their good grace nor effect for immediately after he raised great forces both by land and sea marched into kent where the chief body of his enemies was in arms recovered tunbridge and pevensey in the latter of which odo himself was taken prisoner and forced to accompany the king to rochester this city refusing to surrender at the kings summons odo undertook to prevail with the obstinacy of the inhabitants but being admitted into the town was there detained either by a real or seeming force however the king provoked at their stubbornness and fraud soon compelled them to yield retook his prisoner and forcing him for ever to abjure england sent him into normandy  by these actions performed with such great celerity and success the preparations of duke robert were wholly disappointed himself by the necessity of his affairs compelled to a treaty with his brother upon the terms of a small pension and a mutual promise of succeeding to each others dominions on failure of issue forced to resign his pretensions and return with a shattered fleet to normandy  about this time died archbishop lanfranc by whose death the king loosed from that awe and constraint he was under soon began to discover those irregularities of his nature which till then he had suppressed and disguised falling into those acts of oppression and extortion that have made his name and memory infamous he kept the see of canterbury four years vacant and converted the revenues to his own use together with those of several other bishoprics and abbeys and disposed all church preferments to the highest bidder nor were his exactions less upon the laity from whom he continually extorted exorbitant fines for pretended transgression of certain penal laws and entertained informers to observe mens actions and bring him intelligence  it is here worth observation that these corrupt proceedings of the prince have in the opinion of several learned men given rise to two customs which are a long time grown to have the force of laws for first the successors of this king continuing the custom of seizing on the accruing rents in the vacancy of sees and abbeys it grew in process of time to be exacted as a right or acknowledgment to the king as founder whence the revenues of vacant bishoprics belong at this day to the crown the second custom had an original not unlike several persons to avoid the persecutions of the kings informers and other instruments of oppression withdrew themselves and their effects to foreign countries upon which the king issued a proclamation forbidding all men to leave the kingdom without his licence from whence in the judgment of the same authors the writ ne exeat regno had its beginning  by these and the like arbitrary methods having amassed great treasures and finding all things quiet at home he raised a powerful army to invade his brother in normandy but upon what ground or pretext the writers of that age are not very exact whether it were from a principle frequent among unjust princes that old oppressions are best justified by new or whether having a talent for sudden enterprises and justly apprehending the resentments of duke robert he thought it the wiser course to prevent injuries than to revenge them in this expedition he took several cities and castles from his brother and would have proceeded further if robert had not desired and obtained the assistance of philip king of france who came with an army to his relief king william not thinking it safe or prudent to proceed further against his enemy supported by so great an ally yet loth to lose the fruits of his time and valour fell upon a known and old expedient which no prince ever practised oftener or with greater success and that was to buy off the french king with a sum of money this had its effect for that prince not able to oppose such powerful arms immediately withdrew himself and his forces leaving the two brothers to concert the measures of a peace  this was treated and agreed with great advantages on the side of king william for he kept all the towns he had taken obliged his brother to banish edgar atheling out of normandy and for a further security brought over with him to england the duke himself to attend him in his expedition against malcolm king of scotland who during his absence had invaded the borders the king having raised great forces both by sea and land went in person to repel the inroads of the scots but the enterprise was without success for the greatest part of his fleet was destroyed by a tempest and his army very much diminished by sickness and famine which forced him to a peace of little honour by which upon the condition of homage from that prince the king of england agreed to deliver him up those twelve towns or manors in england which malcolm had held under william the conqueror together with a pension of twelve thousand marks  at this time were sown the seeds of another quarrel between him and duke robert who soliciting the king to perform some covenants of the last peace and meeting with a repulse withdrew in great discontent to normandy  king william in his return from scotland fell dangerously sick at gloucester where moved by the seasonable exhortations of his clergy or rather by the fears of dying he began to discover great marks of repentance with many promises of amendment and retribution particularly for his injuries to the church to give credit to which good resolutions he immediately filled several vacant sees giving that of canterbury to anselm a foreigner of great fame for piety and learning but as it is the disposition of men who derive their vices from their complexions that their passions usually beat strong and weak with their pulses so it fared with this prince who upon recovery of his health soon forgot the vows he had made in his sickness relapsing with greater violence into the same irregularities of injustice and oppression whereof anselm the new archbishop felt the first effects this prelate soon after his promotion offered the king a sum of money by way of present but took care it should be so small that none might interpret it to be a consideration of his late preferment the king rejected it with scorn and as he used but little ceremony in such matters insisted in plain terms for more anselm would not comply and the king enraged sought all occasions to make him uneasy until at length the poor archbishop tired out with perpetual usurpations or at least what was then understood to be such upon his jurisdiction privileges and possessions desired the king licence for a journey to rome and upon a refusal went without it as soon as he was withdrawn the king seized on all his revenues converting them to his own use and the archbishop continued an exile until the succeeding reign  the particulars of this quarrel between the king and archbishop are not in my opinion considerable enough to deserve a place in this brief collection being of little use to posterity and of less entertainment neither should i have mentioned it at all but for the occasion it gives me of making a general observation which may afford some light into the nature and disposition of those ages not only this kings father and himself but the princes for several successions of the fairest character have been severely taxed for violating the rights of the clergy and perhaps not altogether without reason it is true this character hath made the lighter impression as proceeding altogether from the party injured the cotemporary writers being generally churchmen and it must be confessed that the usurpations of the church and court of rome were in those ages risen to such heights as to be altogether inconsistent either with the legislature or administration of any independent state the inferior clergy both secular and regular insisting upon such immunities as wholly exempted them from the civil power and the bishops removing all controversies with the crown by appeal to rome for they reduced the matter to this short issue that god was to be obeyed rather than men and consequently the bishop of rome who is christs representative rather than an earthly prince neither doth it seem improbable that all christendom would have been in utter vassalage both temporal and spiritual to the roman see if the reformation had not put a stop to those exorbitancies and in a good measure opened the eyes even of those princes and states who still adhere to the doctrines and discipline of that church  while the king continued at gloucester malcolm king of scotland came to his court with intentions to settle and confirm the late peace between them it happened that a controversy arose about some circumstances relating to the homage which malcolm was to pay in the managing whereof king william discovered so much haughtiness and disdain both in words and gestures that the scottish prince provoked by such unworthy treatment returned home with indignation but soon came back at the head of a powerful army and entering northumberland with fire and sword laid all waste before him but as all enterprises have in the progress of them a tincture of those passions by which they were spirited at first so this invasion begun upon private revenge which is a blind ungovernable passion was carried on with equal precipitation and proved to be ruinous in the event for robert mowbray earl of northumberland to prevent the destruction of his own country where he had great possessions gathering what forces he could suddenly raise and without waiting any directions from the king marched against the scots who were then set down before alnwick castle there by an ambush malcolm and his eldest son edward were slain and the army discouraged by the loss of their princes entirely defeated this disaster was followed in a few days by the death of queen margaret who not able to survive her misfortunes died for grief neither did the miseries of that kingdom end till after two usurpations the surviving son of malcolm who had fled to england for refuge was restored to his crown by the assistance of king william  about this time the hidden sparks of animosity between the two brothers buried but not extinguished in the last peace began to flame out into new dissensions duke robert had often sent his complaints to the king for breach of articles but without redress which provoked him to expostulate in a rougher manner till at length he charged the king in plain terms with injustice and perjury but no men are found to endure reproaches with less temper than those who most deserve them the king at the same time filled with indignation and stung with guilt invaded normandy a second time resolving to reduce his brother to such terms as might stop all further complaints he had already taken several strong holds by force either of arms or of money and intending entirely to subdue the duchy gave orders to have twenty thousand men immediately raised in england and sent over to him the duke to defend himself against these formidable preparations had recourse again to his old ally the king of france who very readily advanced with an army to his assistance as an action wherein he could every way find his own accounts for beside the appearance of glory and justice by protecting the injured he fought indeed his own battle by preserving his neighbouring state in the hands of a peaceful prince from so powerful and restless an enemy as the king of england and was largely paid for his trouble into the bargain for king william either loth to engage in a long and dangerous war or hastened back by intelligence of some troubles from wales sent offers to his army just ready to embark for normandy that upon payment of ten shillings a man they might have leave to return to their own homes10 this bargain was generally accepted the money was paid to the king of france who immediately withdrew his troops and king william now master of the conditions forced his brother to a peace upon much harder terms than before  footnote 10 see reference to this incident in the examiner no 21 vol ix of this edition p 123  wsj  in this passage there are some circumstances which may appear odd and unaccountable to those who will not give due allowance for the difference of times and manners that an absent prince engaged in an unjust war with his own brother and illbeloved at home should have so much power and credit as by his commission to raise twenty thousand men on a sudden only as a recruit to the army he had already with him that he should have a fleet prepared ready and large enough to transport so great a number that upon the very point of embarking he should send them so disgraceful an offer and that so great a number of common soldiers should be able and willing to pay such a sum of money equal to at least twelve time as much in our times and that after being thus deluded and spoiled at once they should peaceably disband and retire to their several homes but all this will be less difficult to comprehend when we reflect on the method of raising and supporting armies very different from ours which was then in use and so continued for many ages after all men who had lands in capite were bound to attend the king in his wars with a proportioned number of soldiers who were their tenants on easy rents in consideration of military service this was but the work of a few days and the troops consisted of such men as were able to maintain their own charges either at home or abroad neither was there any reason to apprehend that soldiers would ever become instruments for introducing slavery who held so great a share in the property  the king upon his return from normandy made an unsuccessful expedition against the welsh who upon the advantages of his absence had according to their usual custom made cruel inroads upon the adjoining counties of chester shrewsbury and hereford upon the kings approach they fled into their fastnesses among the mountains where he pursued them for some time with great rage and vexation as well as the loss of great numbers of his men to no purpose from hence he was recalled by a more formidable enemy nearer home for robert earl of northumberland overrating his late services against the scots as much perhaps and as unjustly as they were undervalued by the king refused to come to his court which in those days was looked on as the first usual mark of discontent in a nobleman and was often charged by princes as a formal accusation the earl having disobeyed the kings summons and concerted matters with other accomplices broke out into open rebellion with intentions to depose king william and set up stephen earl of albemarle son of a sister to william the conqueror but all was prevented by the celerity of this active prince who knowing that insurrections are best quelled in their beginnings marched with incredible speed and surprised the rebels at newcastle took the castles of tynemouth and bamburgh where the obstinacy of the defendants provoked him contrary to his nature to commit cruelties upon their persons by cutting off their hands and ears and other the like inhumanities the earl himself was taken prisoner as he endeavoured to make his escape but suffered no other punishment than to be confined for the rest of his life11  footnote 11 which was thirty years ds  about this time began the holy war for recovering of palestine which having not been the enterprise of any one prince or state but that wherein most in christendom had a share it cannot with justice be silently passed over in the history of any nation  pope urban the second in a council at clermont made a pathetic exhortation shewing with what danger and indignity to christendom the turks and saracens had for some ages not only overrun all asia and africa where christianity had long flourished but had also made encroachments into europe where they had entirely subdued spain and some other parts that jerusalem the holy city where our saviour did so many miracles and where his sepulchre still remained to the scandal of the christian name lay groaning under the tyranny of infidels that the swords which christian princes had drawn against each other ought to be turned against the common enemy of their name and religion that this should be reckoned an ample satisfaction for all their past sins that those who died in this expedition should immediately go to heaven and the survivors would be blessed with the sight of our lords sepulchre  moved by these arguments and the influence of the person who delivered them several nobles and prelates immediately took upon them the cross and the council dissolving in this high fit of zeal the clergy upon their return home prevailed so far in their several countries that in most parts of europe some great prince or lord became a votary for the holy land as hugh the great brother to the king of france godfrey duke of lorraine reimond count of toulouse robert duke of normandy and many others neither ought it to be forgotten that most of these noble and generous princes wanting money to maintain the forces they had raised pawned their dominions to those very prelates who had first engaged them in this enterprise doubtless a notable mark of the force of oratory in the churchmen of those ages who were able to inspire that devotion into others whereof they seemed so little sensible themselves  but a great share in the honour of promoting this religious war is attributed to the zeal and industry of a certain french priest commonly called peter the hermit who being at jerusalem upon pilgrimage some time before and entering often into private treaty with the patriarch of that city came back fully instructed in all the measures necessary for such a war to these was joined the artifice of certain dreams and visions that might pass for divine admonition all which added to the piety of his exhortations gave him such credit with the pope and several princes of christendom that he became in his own person the leader of a great army against the infidels and was very instrumental for engaging many others in the same design  what a spirit was thus raised in christendom among all sorts of men cannot better be conceived than from the vast numbers of these warlike pilgrims who at the siege of nice are said to have consisted of 600000 foot and 100000 horse and the success at first was answerable to the greatness of their numbers the valour of their leaders and the universal opinion of such a cause for besides several famous victories in the field not to mention the towns of less importance they took nice antioch and at last jerusalem where duke godfrey was chosen king without competition but zeal with a mixture of enthusiasm as i take this to have been is a composition only fit for sudden enterprises like a great ferment in the blood giving double courage and strength for the time until it sink and settle by nature into its old channel for in a few years the piety of these adventurers began to slacken and give way to faction and envy the natural corruptions of all confederacies however to this spirit of devotion there succeeded a spirit of honour which long continued the vein and humour of the times and the holy land became either a school wherein young princes went to learn the art of war or a scene wherein they affected to shew their valour and gain reputation when they were weary of peace at home  the christians held possession of jerusalem above eighty years12 and continued their expeditions to the holy land almost as many more with various events and after they were entirely driven out of asia the popes have almost in every age endeavoured in vain to promote new crusades neither does this spirit seem quite extinct among us even to this day the usual projects of sanguine men for uniting christendom against the turk being without doubt a traditional way of talk derived to us from the same fountain  footnote 12  they held it eightyeight years from july 1099 to october 1187 ds  robert in order to furnish himself out for this war pawned his duchy to the king for 10000 marks of gold13 which sum was levied with so many circumstances of rigour and exaction towards the church and laity as very much increased the discontents of both against the prince  footnote 13  equal to £1400000 as money passes now ds    1099  i shall record one act of this kings which being chiefly personal may pass rather for a part of his character than a point of history  as he was hunting one day in the new forest a messenger express from normandy brought him intelligence that hélie count de la flèche had laid close siege to mans and expected to carry the town in a few days the king leaving his chase commanded some about him to point whereabout mans lay and so rode straight on without reflection until he came to the coast his attendants advised him to wait until he had made preparations of men and money to which he only returned they that love me will follow me he entered the ship in a violent storm which the mariners beholding with astonishment at length in great humility gave him warning of the danger but the king commanded them instantly to put off to sea and not be afraid for he had never in his life heard of any king that was drowned in a few days he drove the enemy from before the city and took the count himself prisoner who raging at his defeat and captivity exclaimed14 that this blow was from fortune but valour could make reprisals as he should shew if ever he regained his liberty this being told the king he sent for the count let him understand that he had heard of his menaces then gave him a fine horse bid him begone immediately and defied him to do his worst  footnote 14 there is so much pleasantry and humour as well as spirit and heroism in this story as we have it recorded by william de malmesbury who represents the menace as thrown out in the kings presence that i shall make no apology for setting down his words at length auctor turbarum helias capitur cui ante se adducto rex ludibundus habeo te magister inquit at ille cujus alta nobilitas nesciret in tanto etiam periculo sapere fortuitu inquit me cepisti sed si possem evadere novi quid facerem tum willelmus prae furore ferè extra se positus et obuncans heliam tuinquit nebulo tu quid faceres discede abi fuge concede tibi ut facias quicquid poteris et per vultum de luca nihil si me viceris pro hâc veniâ tecum paciscar ie by the face of st luke if thou shouldst have the fortune to conquer me i scorn to compound with thee for my release ds  it would have been an injury to this princes memory to let pass an action by which he acquired more honour than from any other in his life and by which it appeared that he was not without some seeds of magnanimity had they been better cultivated or not overrun by the number or prevalency of his vices  i have met with nothing else in this kings reign that deserved to be remembered for as to an unsuccessful expedition or two against wales either by himself or his generals they were very inconsiderable both in action and event nor attended with any circumstances that might render a relation of them of any use to posterity either for instruction or example  his death was violent and unexpected the effect of casualty although this perhaps is the only misfortune of life to which the person of a prince is generally less subject than that of other men being at his beloved exercise of hunting in the new forest in hampshire a large stag crossed the way before him the king hot on his game cried out in haste to walter tyrrel a knight of his attendants to shoot tyrrel immediately let fly his arrow which glancing against a tree struck the king through the heart who fell dead to the ground without speaking a word upon the surprise of this accident all his attendants and tyrrel15 among the rest fled different ways until the fright being a little over some of them returned and causing the body to be laid in a colliers cart for want of other conveniency conveyed it in a very unbecoming contemptuous manner to winchester where it was buried the next day without solemnity and which is worse without grief  footnote 15 yet eadmer saith that tyrrel told him he had not been in the forest that day ds  i shall conclude the history of this princes reign with a description and character of his body and mind impartially from the collections i have made which method i shall observe likewise in all the succeeding reigns  he was in stature somewhat below the usual size and bigbellied but he was well and strongly knit his hair was yellow or sandy his face red which got him the name of rufus his forehead flat his eyes were spotted and appeared of different colours he was apt to stutter in speaking especially when he was angry he was vigorous and active and very hardy to endure fatigues which he owed to a good constitution of health and the frequent exercise of hunting in his dress he affected gaiety and expense which having been first introduced by this prince into his court and kingdom grew in succeeding reigns an intolerable grievance he also first brought in among us the luxury and profusion of great tables there was in him as in all other men a mixture of virtues and vices and that in a pretty equal degree only the misfortune was that the latter although not more numerous were yet much more prevalent than the former for being entirely a man of pleasure this made him sacrifice all his good qualities and gave him too many occasions of producing his ill ones he had one very singular virtue for a prince which was that of being true to his word and promise he was of undoubted personal valour whereof the writers in those ages produce several instances nor did he want skill and conduct in the process of war but his peculiar excellency was that of great dispatch which however usually decried and allowed to be only a happy temerity does often answer all the ends of secrecy and counsel in a great commander by surprising and daunting an enemy when he least expects it as may appear by the greatest actions and events upon the records of every nation  he was a man of sound natural sense as well as of wit and humour upon occasion there were several tenets in the romish church he could not digest particularly that of the saints intercession and living in an age overrun with superstition he went so far into the other extreme as to be censured for an atheist the day before his death a monk relating a terrible dream which seemed to forebode him some misfortune the king being told the matter turned it into a jest said the man was a monk and dreamt like a monk for lucre sake and therefore commanded fitzhamon to give him an hundred shillings that he might not complain he had dreamt to no purpose  his vices appear to have been rather derived from the temper of his body than any original depravity of his mind for being of a sanguine complexion wholly bent upon his pleasures and prodigal in his nature he became engaged in great expenses to supply these the people were perpetually oppressed with illegal taxes and exactions but that sort of avarice which arises from prodigality and vice as it is always needy so it is much more ravenous and violent than the other which put the king and his evil instruments among whom ralph bishop of durham is of special infamy upon those pernicious methods of gratifying his extravagances by all manner of oppression whereof some are already mentioned and others are too foul to relate  he is generally taxed by writers for discovering a contempt of religion in his common discourse and behaviour which i take to have risen from the same fountain being a point of art and a known expedient for men who cannot quit their immoralities at least to banish all reflections that may disturb them in the enjoyment which must be done either by not thinking of religion at all or if it will obtrude by putting it out of countenance  yet there is one instance that might shew him to have some sense of religion as well as justice when two monks were outvying each other in canting16 the price of an abbey he observed a third at some distance who said never a word the king demanded why he would not offer the monk said he was poor and besides would give nothing if he were ever so rich the king replied then you are the fittest person to have it and immediately gave it him but this is perhaps with reason enough assigned more to caprice than conscience for he was under the power of every humour and passion that possessed him for the present which made him obstinate in his resolves and unsteady in the prosecution  footnote 16 an irish phrase for selling or buying by auction it is somewhat remarkable that so severe a critic should have used such a word in historical composition s  he had one vice or folly that seemed rooted in his mind and of all others most unbefitting a prince this was a proud disdainful manner both in his words and gesture and having already lost the love of his subjects by his avarice and oppression this finished the work by bringing him into contempt and hatred among his servants so that few among the worst of princes have had the luck to be so ill beloved or so little lamented  he never married having an invincible abhorrence for the state although not for the sex  he died in the thirteenth year of his reign the fortythird of his age and of christ 1100 august 2  his works of piety were few but in buildings he was very expensive exceeding any king of england before or since among which westminster hall windsor castle the tower of london and the whole city of carlisle remain lasting monuments of his magnificence    the reign of henry the first  this prince was the youngest son of william the conqueror and bred to more learning than was usual in that age or to his rank which got him the surname of beauclerk the reputation whereof together with his being born in england and born son of a king although of little weight in themselves did very much strengthen his pretensions with the people besides he had the same advantage of his brother roberts absence which had proved before so successful to rufus whose treasures he likewise seized on immediately at his death after the same manner and for the same end as rufus did those of his father the conqueror robert had been now five years absent in the holy war where he acquitted himself with great glory and although he was now in apulia upon his return homeward yet the nobles pretending not to know what was become of him and others giving out that he had been elected king of jerusalem henry laid hold of the occasion and calling together an assembly of the clergy nobles and people of the realm at london upon his promises to restore king edwards laws and redress the grievances which had been introduced by his father and brother they consented to elect him king immediately after his coronation he proceeded upon reforming the abuses of the late reign he banished dissolute persons from the court who had long infested it under the protection and example of rufus he restored the people to the use of lights in the night which the conqueror had forbidden after a certain hour by the ringing of a bell then he published his charter and ordered a copy thereof to be taken for every county in england this charter was in substance the freedom of mother church from former oppressions leave to the heirs of nobles to succeed in the possession of their lands without being obliged to redeem them only paying to the king a moderate relief abolition of fines for licence of marriage to their heiresses a promise of not refusing such licence unless the match proposed be with the kings enemy17 c the next of kin to be guardians of the lands of orphans punishments for coiners of false money a confirmation of st edwards laws and a general amnesty  footnote 17 ie with a traitor or malcontent ds  about the same time he performed two acts of justice which by gratifying the revenge and the love of the people gained very much upon their affections to his person the first was to imprison ralph bishop of durham18 who having been raised by the late king from a mean and sordid birth to be his prime confidant and minister became the chief instrument as well as contriver of all his oppressions the second was in recalling and restoring archbishop anselm who having been forced by the continual persecutions of the same prince to leave england had lived ever since in banishment and deprived of all his revenues  footnote 18 le neve says that ralph flambard bishop of durham was imprisoned in the tower september 1100 but escaped in february of the following year and fled to normandy fasti iii 2823 wsj  the king had not been many months on his throne when the news came that duke robert returned from the holy land was received by his subjects with great marks of joy and honour and in universal reputation for his valour and success against the infidels soon after which ralph bishop of durham either by the negligence or corruption of his keepers escaped out of prison and fled over to the duke whom he stirred up to renew and solicit his pretensions to the crown of england by writing to several nobles who either through old friendship or new discontent or an opinion of his title gave him promises of their assistance as soon as he should land in england but the duke having returned exceeding poor from the holy land was not yet in a condition for such an undertaking and therefore thought fit to defer it to a more seasonable opportunity  as the king had hitherto with great industry sought all occasions to gratify his people so he continued to do in the choice of a wife this was matilda daughter of malcolm the late king of scots a lady of great piety and virtue who by the power or persuasion of her friends was prevailed with to leave her cloister for a crown after she had as some writers report already taken the veil her mother was sister to edgar atheling the last heirmale of the saxon race of whom frequent mention hath been made in the two preceding reigns and thus the saxon line to the great contentment of the english nation was again restored  duke robert having now with much difficulty and oppression of his subjects raised great forces and gotten ready a fleet to convey them resolved once more to assert his title to the crown of england to which end he had for some time held a secret correspondence with several nobles and lately received fresh invitations the king on the other side who had received timely intelligence of his brothers preparations gave orders to his admirals to watch the seaports and endeavour to hinder the enemys landing but the commanders of several ships whether robert had won them by his bribes or his promises instead of offering resistance became his guides and brought his fleet safe into portsmouth where he landed his men and from thence marched to winchester his army hourly increasing by great numbers of people who had either an affection for his person an opinion of his title or a hatred to the king in the mean time henry advanced with his forces to be near the duke and observe his motions but like a wise general forbore offering battle to an invader until he might do it with manifest advantage besides he knew very well that his brother was a person whose policy was much inferior to his valour and therefore to be sooner overcome in a treaty than a fight to this end the nobles on both sides began to have frequent interviews to make overtures and at last concert the terms of a peace but wholly to the advantage of the king robert renouncing his pretensions in consideration of a small pension and of succeeding to the crown on default of male issue in his brother  the defection of nobles and other people to the duke was so great that men generally thought if it had come to a battle the king would have lost both the victory and his crown but robert upon his return to normandy after this dishonourable peace grew out of all reputation with the world as well as into perfect hatred and contempt among his own subjects which in a short time was the cause of his ruin  the king having thus by his prudence got rid of a dangerous and troublesome rival and soon after by his valour quelled the insurrections of the earls of shrewsbury and mortaigne whom he forced to fly into normandy found himself in full peace at home and abroad and therefore thought he might venture a contention with the church about the right of investing bishops upon which subject many other princes at that time had controversy with their clergy but after long struggling in vain were all forced to yield at last to the decree of a synod in rome and to the pertinacy of the bishops in the several countries the form of investing a bishop was by delivery of a ring and a pastoral staff which at rome was declared unlawful to be performed by any lay hand whatsoever but the princes of christendom pleaded immemorial custom to authorize them and king henry having given the investiture to certain bishops commanded anselm to consecrate them this the archbishop refused with great firmness pursuant to what he understood to be his duty and to several immediate commands of the pope both sides adhering to their own sentiments the matter was carried to rome where anselm went in person by the kings desire who at the same time sent ambassadors thither to assert and defend his cause but the pope still insisting anselm was forbidden to return to england the king seized on all his revenues and would not restore him until upon other concessions of the pope henry was content to yield up his pretensions to the investiture but however kept the right of electing still in his own hands  whatever might have been the method of electing bishops in the more primitive ages it seems plain to me that in these times and somewhat before although the election was made per clerum et populum yet the king always nominated at first or approved afterwards and generally both as may be seen by the style in which their elections ran as well as by the persons chosen who were usually churchmen of the court or in some employment near the king but whether this were a gradual encroachment of the regal upon the spiritual power i had rather leave others to dispute    1104   1105  about this time duke robert came to england upon a visit to the king where he was received with much kindness and hospitality but at the same time the queen had private directions to manage his easy temper and work him to a consent of remitting his pension this was compassed without much difficulty but upon the dukes return to normandy he was severely reproved for his weakness by ralph bishop of durham and the two earls of mortaigne and shrewsbury these three having fled from england for rebellion and other treasons lived exiles in normandy and bearing an inveterate hatred to the king resolved to stir up the duke to a resentment of the injury and fraud of his brother robert who was various in his nature and always under the power of the present persuader easily yielded to their incitements reproached the king in bitter terms by letters and messages that he had cozened and circumvented him demanding satisfaction and withal threatening revenge at the same time by the advice of the three nobles already mentioned he began to arm himself as formidably as he could with design to seize upon the kings possessions in normandy but as this resolution was rashly taken up so it was as faintly pursued and ended in his destruction neither hath any prince reason to expect better fortune that engages in a war against a powerful neighbour upon the counsel or instigation of exiles who having no further view than to serve their private interest or gratify their revenge are sure to succeed in one or tother if they can embark princes in their quarrel whom they fail not to incite by the falsest representations of their own strength and the weakness of their enemy for as the king was now settled in his throne too firm to be shaken so robert had wholly lost all credit and friendship in england was sunk in reputation at home and by his unlimited profuseness reduced so low that having pawned most of his dominions he had offered rouen his capital city in sale to the inhabitants all this was very well known to the king who resolving to make his advantage thereof pretended to be highly provoked at the disgraceful speeches and menaces of his brother which he made the formal occasion of a quarrel therefore he first sent over some forces to ravage his country and understanding that the duke was coldly supported by his own subjects many of whom came over to the kings army he soon followed in person with more took several towns and placing garrisons therein came back to england designing with the first pretext or opportunity to return with a more potent army and wholly subdue the duchy to his obedience  robert now grown sensible of his weakness became wholly dispirited and following his brother into england in a most dejected manner begged for peace but the king now fully determined upon his ruin turned away in disdain muttering at the same time some threatening words this indignity roused up once more the sinking courage of the duke who with bitter words detesting the pride and insolence of henry withdrew in a rage and hasting back to normandy made what preparations he could for his own defence the king observing his nobles very ready to engage with him in this expedition and being assured that those in normandy would upon his approach revolt from the duke soon followed with a mighty army and the flower of his kingdom upon his arrival he was attended according to his expectation by several norman lords and with this formidable force sat down before tinchebray the duke accompanied by the two exiled earls advanced with what strength he had in hopes to draw the enemy from the siege of so important a place although at the hazard of a battle both armies being drawn out in battalia that of the kings trusting to their numbers began to charge with great fury but without any order    1106  the duke with forces far inferior received the enemy with much firmness and finding they had spent their first heat advanced very regularly against their main body before they could recover themselves from the confusion they were in he attacked them with so much courage that he broke their whole body and they began to fly on every side the king believing all was lost did what he could by threats and gentle words to stop the flight of his men but found it impossible then he commanded two bodies of horse which were placed on either wing to join and wheeling about to attack the enemy in rear the duke who thought himself so near a victory was forced to stop his pursuit and ordering his men to face about began the fight anew mean time the scattered parts of the main body which had so lately fled began to rally and pour in upon the normans behind by which duke roberts army was almost encompassed yet they kept their ground awhile and made several charges until at length perfectly overborne by numbers they were utterly defeated there duke robert doing all the parts of a great captain was taken prisoner together with the earl of mortaigne and almost his whole army for being hemmed in on all sides few of them could make their escape thus in the space of forty years normandy subdued england and england normandy which are events perhaps hardly to be paralleled in any other ages or parts of the world    1107  the king having stayed a while to settle the state of normandy returned with his brother into england whom he sent prisoner to cardiff castle with orders that he should be favourably used which for some time were duly observed until being accused of attempting to make his escape whether it were real or feigned he had his eyes put out with a burning basin by the kings express commands in which miserable condition he lived for sixandtwenty years  it is believed the king would hardly have engaged in this unnatural and invidious war with so little pretence or provocation if the pope had not openly approved and sanctified his cause exhorting him to it as a meritorious action which seems to have been but an ill return from the vicar of christ to a prince who had performed so many brave exploits for the service of the church to the hazard of his person and ruin of his fortune but the very bigoted monks who have left us their accounts of those times do generally agree in heavily taxing the roman court for bribery and corruption and the king had promised to remit his right of investing bishops which he performed immediately after his reduction of normandy and was a matter of much more service to the pope than all the achievements of duke robert in the holy land whose merits as well as pretensions were now antiquated and out of date    1109  about this time the emperor henry v sent to desire maud the kings daughter in marriage who was then a child about eight years old that prince had lately been embroiled in a quarrel with the see of rome which began upon the same subject of investing bishops but was carried to great extremities for invading italy with a mighty army he took the pope prisoner forced him to yield to whatever terms he thought fit to impose and to take an oath of fidelity to him between his hands however as soon as henry had withdrawn his forces the pope assembling a council revoked all his concessions as extorted by compulsion and raised great troubles in germany against the emperor who in order to secure himself sought this alliance with the king  about this time likewise died archbishop anselm a prelate of great piety and learning whose zeal for the see of rome as well as for his own rights and privileges should in justice be imputed to the errors of the time and not of the man after his death the king following the steps of his brother held the see vacant five years contenting himself with an excuse which looked like a jest that he only waited until he could find another so good a man as anselm  in the fourteenth year of this kings reign the welsh after their usual manner invaded the marches with great fury and destruction but the king hoping to put a final end to those perpetual troubles and vexations given to his kingdom by that unquiet people went in person against them with a powerful army and to prevent their usual stratagem of retreating to their woods and mountains and other fastnesses he ordered the woods to be cut down beset all their places of security and hunting them like wild beasts made so terrible a slaughter that at length observing them to fling down their arms and beg for quarter he commanded his soldiers to forbear then receiving their submissions and placing garrisons where he thought necessary he returned in great triumph and satisfaction to london    1114  the princess maud being now marriageable was delivered to the emperors ambassador and for a portion to the young lady a tax was imposed of three shillings upon every hide of land in england which grew afterwards into a custom19 and was in succeeding times confirmed by acts of parliament under the name of reasonable aid for marrying the kings daughter although levied after a different manner  footnote 19 this was the first occasion of the feudal tax called scutage being levied in england wsj  as the institution of parliaments in england is agreed by several writers to be owing to this king so the date of the first hath been assigned by some to the fifteenth year of his reign which however is not to be affirmed with any certainty for great councils were convoked not only in the two preceding reigns but for time immemorial by the saxon princes who first introduced them into this island from the same original with the other gothic forms of government in most parts of europe these councils or assemblies were composed according to the pleasure of the prince who convened them generally of nobles and bishops sometimes were added some considerable commoners but they seldom met except in the beginning of a reign or in times of war until this king came to the crown who being a wise and popular prince called these great assemblies upon most important affairs of his reign and ever followed their advice which if it proved successful the honour and advantage redounded to him and if otherwise he was free from the blame thus when he chose a wife for himself and a husband for his daughter when he designed his expedition against robert and even for the election of an archbishop to the see of canterbury he proceeded wholly by the advice of such general assemblies summoned for the purpose but the style of these conventions as delivered by several authors is very various sometimes it is comites barones et cleri20 his marriage was agreed on consilio majorum natu et magnatum terrae one author21 calls it concilium principum sacerdotum et reliqui populi and for the election of an archbishop the saxon chronicle says that he commanded by letters all bishops abbots and thanes to meet him at gloucester ad procerum conventum lastly some affirm these assemblies to have been an imitation of the three estates in normandy i am very sensible how much time and pains have been employed by several learned men to search out the original of parliaments in england wherein i doubt they have little satisfied others or themselves i know likewise that to engage in the same enquiry would neither suit my abilities nor my subject it may be sufficient for my purpose if i be able to give some little light into this matter for the curiosity of those who are less informed  footnote 20 brompton ds  footnote 21 polydore virgil ds  the institution of a state or commonwealth out of a mixture of the three forms of government received in the schools however it be derided as a solecism and absurdity by some late writers on politics hath been very ancient in the world and is celebrated by the gravest authors of antiquity for although the supreme power cannot properly be said to be divided yet it may be so placed in three several hands as each to be a check upon the other or formed into a balance which is held by him that has the executive power with the nobility and people in counterpoise in each scale thus the kingdom of media is represented by xenophon before the reign of cyrus so polybius tells us the best government is a mixture of the three forms regno optimatium et populi imperio the same was that of sparta in its primitive institution by lycurgus made up of reges seniores et populus the like may be asserted of rome carthage and other states and the germans of old fell upon the same model from whence the goths their neighbours with the rest of those northern people did perhaps borrow it but an assembly of the three estates is not properly of gothic institution for these fierce people when upon the decline of the roman empire they first invaded europe and settled so many kingdoms in italy spain and other parts were all heathens and when a body of them had fixed themselves in a tract of land left desolate by the flight or destruction of the natives their military government by time and peace became civil the general was king his great officers were his nobles and ministers of state and the common soldiers the body of the people but these were freemen and had smaller portions of land assigned them the remaining natives were all slaves the nobles were a standing council and upon affairs of great importance the freemen were likewise called by their representatives to give their advice by which it appears that the gothic frame of government consisted at first but of two states or assemblies under the administration of a single person but after the conversion of these princes and their people to the christian faith the church became endowed with great possessions as well by the bounty of kings as the arts and industry of the clergy winning upon the devotion of their new converts and power by the common maxim always accompanying property the ecclesiastics began soon to grow considerable to form themselves into a body and to call assemblies or synods by their own authority or sometimes by the command of their princes who in an ignorant age had a mighty veneration for their learning as well as piety by such degrees the church arrived at length by very justifiable steps to have her share in the commonwealth and became a third estate in most kingdoms of europe but these assemblies as we have already observed were seldom called in england before the reign of this prince nor even then were always composed after the same manner neither does it appear from the writers who lived nearest to that age that the people had any representative at all beside the barons and other nobles who did not sit in those assemblies by virtue of their birth or creation but of the lands or baronies they held so that the present constitution of the english parliament hath by many degrees and alterations been modelled to the frame it is now in which alterations i shall observe in the succeeding reigns as exactly as i can discover them by a diligent search into the histories of the several ages without engaging in the controverted points of law about this matter which would rather perplex the reader than inform him    1116  but to return louis the gross king of france a valiant and active prince in the flower of his age succeeding to that crown that robert was deprived of normandy grew jealous of the neighbourhood and power of king henry and begun early to entertain designs either of subduing that duchy to himself or at least of making a considerable party against the king in favour of william son of robert whom for that end he had taken into his protection pursuant to these intentions he soon found an occasion for a quarrel expostulating with henry that he had broken his promise by not doing homage for the duchy of normandy as well as by neglecting to raze the castle of gisors22 which was built on the french side of the river epte the common boundary between both dominions  footnote 22 father daniel says that for some years past it had been agreed that gisors should be sequestered in the hands of a lord called pagan or payen who was to receive into it neither english or norman nor french troops and in case it should fall into the hands of either of the two kings it was stipulated that the walls should be razed within the space of forty days hist of france i 369 wsj   but an incident soon offered which gave king henry a pretext for retaliating almost in the same manner for it happened that upon some offence taken against his nephew theobald count of blois by the french king louis in great rage sent an army to invade and ravage the earls territories theobald defended himself for a while with much valour but at length in danger to be overpowered requested aid of his uncle the king of england who supported him so effectually with men and money that he was able not only to defend his own country but very much to infest and annoy his enemy thus a war was kindled between the two kings louis now openly asserted the title of william the son of robert and entering into an alliance with the earls of flanders and anjou began to concert measures for driving king henry out of normandy  the king having timely intelligence of his enemys designs began with great vigour and dispatch to prepare himself for war he raised with much difficulty and discontent of his people the greatest tax that had ever been known in england and passing over into normandy with a mighty army joined his nephew theobald the king of france who had entertained hopes that he should overrun the duchy before his enemy could arrive advanced with great security towards the frontiers of normandy but observing an enemy of equal number and force already prepared to engage him he suddenly stopped his march the two armies faced one another for some hours neither side offering battle the rest of the day was spent in light skirmishes begun by the french and repeated for some days following with various success but the remainder of the year passed without any considerable action    1119  at length the violence of the two princes brought it to a battle for louis to give a reputation to his arms advanced towards the frontiers of normandy and after a short siege took gué nicaise23 there the king met him and the fight began which continued with great obstinacy on both sides for nine hours the french army was divided into two bodies and the english into three by which means that part where the king fought in person being attacked by a superior number began to give way and william crispin a norman baron singling out the king of england whose subject he had been but banished for treason struck him twice in the head with so much violence that the blood gushed out of his mouth the king inflamed with rage and indignation dealt such furious blows that he struck down several of his enemies and crispin among the rest who was taken prisoner at his horses feet the soldiers encouraged by the valour of their prince rallied and fell on with fresh vigour and the victory seemed doubtful when william the son of king henry to whom his father had entrusted the third body of his army which had not yet engaged fell on with this fresh reserve upon the enemy who was already very much harassed with the toil of the day this quickly decided the matter for the french though valiantly fighting were overcome with the slaughter of several thousand men their king quitted the field and withdrew to andely but the king of england recovering gué nicaise returned triumphant to rouen  footnote 23 at that time reckoned an important fortress on the river epte ds  this important victory was followed by the defection of the earl of anjou to king henry and the earl of flanders fell in the battle by which the king of france was at once deprived of two powerful allies however by the intercession of the former a peace was soon after made between both crowns william the kings son did homage to louis for the dukedom of normandy and the other william following the fortunes of his father was left to his pretensions and complaints  it is here observable that from this time until wales was subdued to the english crown the eldest sons of england were called dukes of normandy as they are now princes of wales    1120  the king having stayed some time in normandy for the settlement of his duchy after the calamities and confusions of a war returned to england to the very great satisfaction of his people and himself he had enlarged his dominions by the conquest of normandy he had subdued all his competitors and forced even the king of france their great protector after a glorious victory to his own conditions of a peace he was upon very good terms with the pope who had a great esteem and friendship for his person and made him larger concessions than was usual from that see and in those ages at home he was respected by the clergy reverenced by the nobles and beloved by the people in his family he was blessed with a son of much hopes just growing to years of manhood and his daughter was an empress so that he seemed to possess as great a share of happiness as human life is capable to admit but the felicity of man depends upon a conjunction of many circumstances which are all subject to various accidents and every single accident is able to dissolve the whole contexture which truth was never verified more than in this prince who by one domestic misfortune not to be prevented or foreseen found all the pleasure and content he proposed to himself by his prudence his industry and his valour wholly disappointed and destroyed for william the young prince having embarked at barfleur some time after his father the mariners being all drunk suffered the ship to run upon a rock where it was dashed to pieces the prince made a shift to get into the boat and was making to the shore until forced back by the cries of his sister whom he received into the boat so many others crowded in at the same time that it was immediately overturned there perished beside the prince a natural son and daughter of the kings his niece and many other persons of quality together with all their attendants and servants to the number of a hundred and forty beside fifty mariners but one person escaping  although the king survived this cruel misfortune many years yet he could never recover his former humour but grew melancholy and morose however in order to provide better for the peace and settlement of the kingdom after his death about five months after the loss of his son his former queen having died three years before he married adeliza a beautiful young lady of the family of lorraine24 in hopes of issue by her but never had any  footnote 24 she was daughter of godfrey duke of louvain or the lower lorraine ds    1124  the death of the prince gave occasion to some new troubles in normandy for the earls of meulant and evreux hugh de montfort and other associates began to raise insurrections there which were thought to be privately fomented by the french king out of enmity to king henry and in favour of william the son of robert to whom the earl of anjou had lately given his daughter in marriage but william of tankerville the kings lieutenant in normandy surprising the enemys forces by an ambush entirely routed them took both the earls prisoners and sent one of them meulant to his master but the count devreux made his escape    1126  king henry having now lost hope of issue by his new queen brought with him on his return to england his daughter maud who by the emperors death had been lately left a widow and childless and in a parliament or general assembly which he had summoned at windsor he caused the crown to be settled on her and her children and made all his nobles take a solemn oath to defend her title this was performed by none with so much forwardness as stephen earl of boulogne who was observed to shew a more than ordinary zeal in the matter this young lord was the kings nephew being second son of the earl of blois by adela the conquerors daughter he was in high favour with the king his uncle who had married him to the daughter and heiress of the earl of boulogne given him great possessions in england and made him indeed too powerful for a subject  the king having thus fixed the succession of the crown in his daughter by an act of settlement and an oath of fealty looked about to provide her with a second husband and at length determined his choice in geoffrey plantagenet earl of anjou the son of fulk lately deceased  this prince whose dominions confined on france and normandy was usually courted for an ally by both kings in their several quarrels but having little faith or honour he never scrupled to change sides as often as he saw or conceived it for his advantage after the great victory over the french he closed in with king henry and gave his daughter to the young prince william yet at the same time by the private encouragement of louis he prevailed on the king of england to be easy in the conditions of a peace upon the unfortunate loss of the prince and the troubles in normandy thereupon he fell again from the king gave his other daughter to william the son of robert and struck up with france to take that prince again into protection but dying soon after and leaving his son geoffrey to succeed in that earldom the king was of opinion he could not anywhere bestow his daughter with more advantage both for the security and enlargement of his dominions than by giving her to this earl by which marriage anjou would become an acquisition to normandy and this be a more equal match to so formidable a neighbour as france in a short time the marriage was concluded and this earl geoffrey had the honour to introduce into the royal family of england the surname of plantagenet borne by so many succeeding kings which began with henry ii who was the eldest son of this marriage  but the king of france was in great discontent at this match he easily foresaw the dismal consequences to himself and his successors from such an increase of dominion united to the crown of england he knew what impressions might be made in future times to the shaking of his throne by an aspiring and warlike king if they should happen in a weak reign or upon any great discontents in that kingdom which conjectures being highly reasonable and since often verified by events he cast about to find some way of driving the king of england entirely out of france but having neither pretext nor stomach in the midst of a peace to begin an open and formal quarrel there fell out an accident which gave him plausible occasion of pursuing his design  charles the good earl of flanders having been lately murdered by some of his subjects upon private revenge the king of france went in person to take revenge of the assassins which he performed with great justice and honour but the late earl leaving no heir of his body and several competitors appearing to dispute the succession louis rejected some others who seemed to have a fairer title and adjudged it to william the son of robert the better to secure him to his interests upon any design he might engage in against the king of england not content with this he assisted the earl in person subdued his rivals and left him in peaceable possession of his new dominion  king henry on the other side was very apprehensive of his nephews greatness well knowing to what end it was directed however he seemed not to regard it contenting himself to give the earl employment at home by privately nourishing the discontents of his new subjects and abetting underhand another pretender for william had so entirely lost the hearts of his people by his intolerable avarice and exactions that the principal towns in flanders revolted from him and invited thierri earl of alsace to be their governor but the king of france generously resolved to appear once more in his defence and took his third expedition into flanders for that purpose he had marched as far as artois when he was suddenly recalled to defend his own dominions from the fury of a powerful and provoked invader for henry king of england moved with indignation to see the french king in the midst of a peace so frequently and openly supporting his most dangerous enemy thought it the best way to divert louis from kindling a fire against him abroad by forcing him to extinguish one at home he therefore entered into the bowels of france ravaging and laying waste all before him and quickly grew so formidable that the french king to purchase a peace was forced to promise never more to assist or favour the earl of flanders however as it fell out this article proved to be wholly needless for the young earl soon after gave battle to thierri and put his whole army to the rout but pursuing his victory he received a wound in his wrist which by the unskilfulness of a surgeon cost him his life24  footnote 24 the lance passed through or under the ball of his thumb into his wrist the wound gangrening he died within five days ds  this one slight inconsiderable accident did in all probability put a stop to very great events for if that young prince had survived his victory it is hardly to be doubted but through the justness of his cause the reputation of his valour and the assistance of the king of france he would in a little time have recovered normandy and perhaps his fathers liberty which were the two designs he had in agitation nor could he well have missed the crown of england after the kings death who was now in his decline when he had so fair a title and no competitors in view but a woman and an infant    1129  upon the kings return from normandy a great council of the clergy was held at london for the punishing of priests who lived in concubinage which was the great grievance of the church in those ages and had been condemned by several canons this assembly thinking to take a more effectual course against that abomination as it was called decreed severe penalties upon those who should be guilty of breaking it entreating the king to see the law put in execution which he very readily undertook but performed otherwise than was expected eluding the force of the law by an evasion to his own advantage for exacting fines of the delinquent priests he suffered them to keep their concubines without further disturbance a very unaccountable step in so wise a body for their own concernments as the clergy of those times is looked upon to have been and although perhaps the fact be not worth recording it may serve as a lesson to all assemblies never to trust the execution of a law in the hands of those who will find it more to their interests to see it broken than observed    1132  the empress maud was now happily delivered of a son who was afterwards king of england by the name of henry the second and the king calling a parliament had the oath of fealty repeated by the nobles and clergy to her and her issue which in the compass of three years they all broke or forgot    1134  i think it may deserve a place in this history to mention the last scene of duke roberts life who either through the poorness or greatness of spirit having outlived the loss of his honour his dominions his liberty his eyesight and his only son was at last forced to sink under the load of eighty years and must be allowed for the greatest example either of insensibility or contempt of earthly things that ever appeared in a sovereign or private person he was a prince hardly equalled by any in his time for valour conduct and courtesy but his ruin began from the easiness of his nature which whoever knew how to manage were sure to be refused nothing they could ask by such profusion he was reduced to those unhappy expedients of remitting his rights for a pension of pawning his towns and multiplying taxes which brought him into hatred and contempt with his subjects neither do i think any virtue so little commendable in a sovereign as that of liberality where it exceeds what his ordinary revenues can supply where it passes those bounds his subjects must all be oppressed to shew his bounty to a few flatterers or he must sell his towns or basely renounce his rights by becoming pensioner to some powerful prince in the neighbourhood all which we have lived to see performed by a late monarch in our own time and country    1135  since the reduction of normandy to the kings obedience he found it necessary for his affairs to spend in that duchy some part of his time almost every year and a little before the death of robert he made his last voyage there it was observable in this prince that having some years past very narrowly escaped shipwreck in his passage from normandy into england the sense of his danger had made very deep impressions on his mind which he discovered by a great reformation in his life by redressing several grievances and doing many acts of piety and to shew the steadiness of his resolutions he kept them to the last making a progress through most parts of normandy treating his subjects in all places with great familiarity and kindness granting their petitions easing their taxes and in a word giving all possible marks of a religious wise and gracious prince  returning to st denys le ferment from his progress a little indisposed he there fell into a fever upon a surfeit of lamprey which in a few days ended his life his body was conveyed to england and buried at reading in the abbeychurch himself had founded  it is hard to affirm anything peculiar of this princes character those authors who have attempted it mentioning very little but what was common to him with thousands of other men neither have they recorded any of those personal circumstances or passages which only can discover such qualities of the mind as most distinguish one man from another these defects may perhaps appear in the stories of many succeeding kings which makes me hope i shall not be altogether blamed for sometimes disappointing the reader in a point wherein i could wish to be the most exact  as to his person he is described to be of middle stature his body strong set and fleshy his hair black his eyes large his countenance amiable and very pleasant especially when he was merry he was temperate in meat and drink and a hater of effeminacy a vice or folly much complained of in his time especially that circumstance of long artificial hair which he forbade upon severe penalties his three principal virtues were prudence valour and eloquence these were counterbalanced by three great vices avarice cruelty and lust of which the first is proved by the frequency of his taxes the second by his treatment of duke robert and the last was notorious but the proof of his virtues doth not depend on single instances manifesting themselves through the whole course of a long reign which was hardly attended by any misfortune that prudence justice or valour could prevent he came to the crown at a ripe age when he had passed thirty years having learned in his private life to struggle with hardships whereof he had his share from the capriciousness and injustice of both his brothers and by observing their failures he had learned to avoid them in himself being steady and uniform in his whole conduct which were qualities they both seemed chiefly to want this likewise made him so very tenacious as he was observed to be in his love and hatred he was a strict observer of justice which he seems never to have violated but in that particular case which political casuists are pleased to dispense with where the dispute is about a crown in that he25        footnote 25 here the sentence breaks off short and is left unfinished ds  consider him as a private man he was perhaps the most accomplished person of his age having a facetious wit cultivated by learning and advanced with a great share of natural eloquence which was his peculiar talent and it was no doubt the sense he had of this last perfection in himself that put him so often upon calling together the great councils of the nation where natural oratory is of most figure as well as use   the reign of stephen  the veneration which people are supposed naturally to pay to a right line and a lawful title in their kings must be upheld by a long uninterrupted succession otherwise it quickly loses opinion upon which the strength of it although not the justice is entirely founded and where breaches have been already made in the lineal descent there is little security in a good title though confirmed by promises and oaths where the lawful heir is absent and a popular aspiring pretender near at hand this i think may pass for a maxim if any consequences drawn from history can pretend to be called so having been verified successively three times in this kingdom i mean by the two preceding kings and by the prince whose reign we are now writing neither can this observation be justly controlled by any instances brought of future princes who being absent at their predecessors death have peaceably succeeded the circumstances being very different in every case either by the weakness or justice of pretenders or else by the long establishment of lineal succession    1135  stephen earl of boulogne whose descent hath been already shewn in the foregoing reign was the second of three brothers whereof the eldest was theobald earl of blois a sovereign prince and henry the youngest was bishop of winchester and the popes legate in england at the time of king henrys death his daughter the empress was with her husband the earl of anjou a grave and cautious prince altogether unqualified for sudden enterprises but earl stephen who had attended the king in his last expedition made so great dispatch for england26 that the council had not time to meet and make any declaration about a successor when the lords were assembled the legate had already by his credit and influence among them brought over a great party to his brothers interests and the earl himself knowing with what success the like methods were used by his two last predecessors was very liberal of his promises to amend the laws support the church and redress grievances for all which the bishop undertook to be guarantee and thus was stephen elected by those very persons who had so lately and in so solemn a manner more than once sworn fealty to another  footnote 26 stephen was at boulogne when he received the news of henrys death ds  the motives whereby the nobility was swayed to proceed after this manner were obvious enough there had been a perpetual struggle between them and their former kings in the defence of their liberties for the security whereof they thought a king elected without other title would be readier to enter into any obligations and being held in constant dependence would be less tempted to break them therefore as at his coronation they obtained full security by his taking new and additional oaths in favour of their liberties their oath of fealty to him was but conditional to be of force no longer than he should be true to those stipulations  but other reasons were contrived and given out to satisfy the people they were told it was an indignity for so noble a nation to be governed by a woman that the late king had promised to marry his daughter within the realm and by consent of parliament neither of which was observed and lastly hugh bigod steward to king henry took a voluntary oath before the archbishop of canterbury that his master in his last sickness had upon some displeasure disinherited his daughter  he received the crown with one great advantage that could best enable him to preserve it this was the possession of his uncles treasures amounting to one hundred thousand pounds and reckoned as a prodigious sum in those days by the help of which without ever raising one tax upon the people he defended an unjust title against the lawful heir during a perpetual contest of almost twenty years  in order to defend himself against any sudden invasion which he had cause enough to expect he gave all men licence to build castles upon their lands which proved a very mistaken piece of politics although grounded upon some appearance of reason the king supposed that no invader would venture to advance into the heart of his country without reducing every castle in his way which must be a work of much time and difficulty nor would be able to afford men to block them up and secure his retreat which way of arguing may be good enough to a prince of an undisputed title and entirely in the hearts of his subjects but numerous castles are ill defenders of an usurpation being the common retreat of malcontents where they can fly with security and discover their affections as they please by which means the enemy although beaten in the field may still preserve his footing in the bowels of a country may wait supplies from abroad and prolong a war for many years nor while he is master of any castles can he ever be at mercy by any sudden misfortune but may be always in a condition of demanding terms for himself these and many other effects of so pernicious a counsel the king found through the whole course of his reign which was entirely spent in sieges revolts surprises and surrenders with very few battles but no decisive action a period of much misery and confusion which affords little that is memorable for events or useful for the instruction of posterity    1136  the first considerable enemy that appeared against him was david king of scots who having taken the oath of fealty to maud and her issue being further engaged by the ties of blood and stirred up through the persuasions of several english nobles began to take up arms in her cause and invading the northern parts took carlisle and newcastle but upon the kings speedy approach with his forces a peace was presently made and the towns restored however the scottish prince would by no means renounce his fidelity to the empress by paying homage to stephen so that an expedient was found to have it performed by his eldest son in consideration of which the king gave or rather restored to him the earldom of huntingdon  upon his return to london from this expedition he happened to fall sick of a lethargy and it was confidently given out that he was dead this report was with great industry and artifice dispersed by his enemies which quickly discovered the ill inclination of several lords who although they never believed the thing yet made use of it for an occasion or pretext to fortify their castles which they refused to surrender to the king himself but stephen was resolved as he said to convince them that he was alive and well for coming against them before he was expected he recovered exeter norwich27 and other fortified places although not without much difficulty  footnote 27 hugh bigod had seized norwich castle ds  it is obvious enough to wonder how a prince of so much valour and other excellent endowments elected by the church and state after a compliance with all conditions they could impose on him and in an age when so little regard was had to the lineal descent lastly confirmed by the pope himself should be soon deserted and opposed by those very persons who had been the most instrumental to promote him but beside his defective title and the undistinguished liberty of building castles there were three circumstances which very much contributed to those perpetual revolts of the nobles against him first that upon his coming to the crown he was very liberal in distributing lands and honours to several young gentlemen of noble birth who came to make their court whereby he hoped to get the reputation of a generous prince and to strengthen his party against the empress but by this encouragement the number of pretenders quickly grew too fast upon him and when he had granted all he was able he was forced to dismiss the rest with promises and excuses who either out of envy or discontent or else to mend their fortunes never failed to become his enemies upon the first occasion that offered secondly when he had reduced several castles and towns which had given the first example of disaffection from him he hardly inflicted the least punishment on the authors which unseasonable mercy that in another prince and another age would have been called greatness of spirit passed in him for pusillanimity and fear and is reckoned by the writers of those times to have been the cause of many succeeding revolts the third circumstance was of a different kind for observing how little good effect he had found by his liberality and indulgence he would needs try the other extreme which was not his talent he began to infringe the articles of his charter to recall or disown the promises he had made and to repulse petitioners with rough treatment which was the more unacceptable by being new and unexpected    1137  mean time the earl of anjou who was not in a condition to assert his wifes title to england hearing stephen was employed at home entered normandy with small force and found it no difficult matter to seize several towns the normans in the present distraction of affairs not well knowing what prince to obey at last sent an invitation to theobald earl of blois king stephens eldest brother to accept their dukedom upon the condition of protecting them from the present insults of the earl of anjou but before this matter could come to an issue stephen who upon reduction of the towns already mentioned had found a short interval of quiet from his english subjects arrived with unexpected speed into normandy where geoffrey of anjou soon fled before him and the whole duchy came over to his obedience for the further settlement whereof he made peace with the king of france constituted his son eustace duke of normandy and made him swear fealty to that prince and do him homage his brother theobald who began to expostulate upon this disappointment he pacified with a pension of two thousand marks28 and even the earl of anjou himself who in right of his wife made demands of stephen for the kingdom of england finding he was no equal match at present was persuaded to become his pensioner for five thousand more29  footnote 28 the mark of normandy is to be understood here such a pension in that age was equivalent to one of £31000 sterling in the present ds  footnote 29 five thousand marks of silver coin was in this reign of the same value as the sum of £77500 modern currency is now here again the norman mark seems to be used ds  stephen upon his return to england met with an account of new troubles from the north for the king of scots under pretence of observing his oath of fealty to the empress infested the borders and frequently making cruel inroads plundered and laid waste all before him    1138  in order to revenge this base and perfidious treatment the king in his march northward sat down before bedford and took it after a siege of twenty days this town was part of the earldom of huntingdon given by stephen in the late peace to the eldest son of the scottish king for which the young prince did homage to him and it was upon that account defended by a garrison of scots upon intelligence of this surrender king david overcome with fury entered northumberland where letting loose the rage of his soldiers he permitted and encouraged them to commit all manner of inhumanities which they performed in so execrable a manner as would scarce be credible if it were not attested by almost the universal consent of writers they ripped up women with child drew out the infants and tossed them upon the points of their lances they murdered priests before the altars then cutting the heads from off the crucifixes in their stead put on the heads of those they had murdered with many other instances of monstrous barbarity too foul to relate but cruelty being usually attended with cowardice this perfidious prince upon the approach of king stephen fled into places of security the king of england finding no enemy on whom to employ his revenge marched forward into the country destroying with fire and sword all the southern parts and would in all probability have made terrible impressions into the heart of scotland if he had not been suddenly recalled by a more dangerous fire at home which had been kindled in his absence and was now broken out into a flame  robert earl of gloucester natural son of the late king came into england some time after the advancement of stephen to the crown and yielding to the necessity of the time took the oath of fealty upon the same condition used by the other nobles to be of force so long as the king should keep his faith with him and preserve his dignity inviolate but being in his heart wholly devoted to the interests of the empress his sister and moved by the persuasions of several religious men he had with great secrecy and application so far practised upon the levity or discontents of several lords as to gain them to his party for the king had of late very much alienated the nobles against him first by seizing several of their persons and dispossessing them of their lands and secondly by taking into his favour william dypres a flemish commander of noble birth but banished by his prince this man with many of his followers the king employed chiefly both in his councils and his armies and made him earl of kent to the great envy and displeasure of his english subjects the earl of gloucester therefore and his accomplices having prepared all things necessary for an insurrection it was agreed among them that while the king was engaged against the scots each of them should secure what towns and castles they could and openly declare for the empress accordingly earl robert suddenly fortified himself in bristol the rest followed his example hereford shrewsbury ludlow dover30 and many other places were seized by several lords and the defection grew so formidable that the king to his great grief was forced to leave his scottish expedition unfinished and return with all possible speed to suppress the rebellion begun by his subjects having first left the care of the north to thurstan archbishop of york with orders carefully to observe the motions of the scots  footnote 30 robert earl of gloucester had been entrusted by stephen with the custody of dover castle but robert lying now under heavy suspicion the king sent matilda his queen to besiege it in which she was successful ds  whilst the king was employed in the south in reducing his discontented lords and their castles to his obedience david presuming upon the distance between them reentered england with more numerous forces and greater designs than before for without losing more time than what was necessary to pillage and destroy the country as he marched he resolved to besiege york which if he could force to surrender would serve as a convenient frontier against the english to this end advancing near the city and having pitched his tents he sat down before it with his whole army in the mean time archbishop thurstan having already summoned the nobles and gentry of the shire and parts adjacent had by powerful persuasions incited them to defend their country against a treacherous bloody and restless enemy so that before the king of scotland could make any progress in the siege the whole power of the north was united against him under the earl of albemarle and several other nobles archbishop thurstan happening to fall sick could not go in person to the army but sent the bishop of durham in his stead by whose encouragements the english although in number far inferior advanced boldly towards the enemy and offered them battle which was as readily accepted by the scots who sending out a party of horse to secure the rising ground were immediately attacked by the english and after a sharp dispute entirely defeated in the heat of the battle the king of scots and his son henry earl of huntingdon gave many proofs of great personal valour the young prince fell with such fierceness upon a body of the english that he utterly broke and dispersed them and was pursuing his victory when a certain man bearing aloft the head of an enemy he had cut off cried out it was the head of the scottish king which being heard and believed on both sides the english who had lately fled rallied again assaulting their enemies with new vigour the scots on the other side discouraged by the supposed death of their prince began to turn their backs the king and his son used all endeavours to stop their flight and made several brave stands against the enemy but the greatest part of their army being fled and themselves almost encompassed they were forced to give way to fortune and with much difficulty made their escape  the loss on the english side was inconsiderable but of scots by general consent of writers ten thousand were slain and thus ended the war of the standard as it was usually called by the authors of that age because the english upon a certain engine raised the mast of a ship on the top whereof in a silver box they put the consecrated wafer and fastened the standards of st peter and other saints this gave them courage by remembering they were to fight in the presence of god and served likewise for a mark where to reassemble when they should happen to be dispersed by any accident or misfortune    1139  mean time the king was equally successful against his rebellious lords at home having taken most of their castles and strongholds and the earl of gloucester himself no longer able to make any resistance withdrew into normandy to concert new measures with the empress his sister thus the king had leisure and opportunity for another expedition into scotland to pursue and improve his victory where he met with no opposition however he was at length persuaded with much difficulty to accept his own conditions of a peace and david delivered up to him his eldest son henry as hostage for performance of articles between them  the king in his return homeward laid siege to ludlow castle which had not been reduced with the rest here prince henry of scotland boiling with youth and valour and exposing his person upon all occasions was lifted from his horse by an iron grapple let down from the wall and would have been hoisted up into the castle if the king had not immediately flown to his assistance and brought him off with his own hands by main force from the enemy whom he soon compelled to surrender the castle    1140  stephen having thus subdued his inveterate enemies the scots and reduced his rebellious nobles began to entertain hopes of enjoying a little ease but he was destined to the possession of a crown with perpetual disturbance for he was hardly returned from his northern expedition when he received intelligence that the empress accompanied by her brother the earl of gloucester was preparing to come for england in order to dispute her title to the kingdom the king who knew by experience what a powerful party she already had to espouse her interests very reasonably concluded the defection from him would be much greater when she appeared in person to countenance and reward it he therefore began again to repent of the licence he had granted for building castles which were now like to prove so many places of security for his enemies and fortifications against himself for he knew not whom to trust vehemently suspecting his nobles ever since their last revolt he therefore cast about for some artifice to get into his hands as many of their castles as he could in the strength and magnificence of which kind of structures the bishops had far outdone the rest and were upon that as well as other accounts very much maligned and envied by the temporal lords who were extreme jealous of the churchs increasing power and glad upon all occasions to see the prelates humbled the king therefore having formed his project resolved to make trial where it would be least invidious and where he could foresee least danger in the consequences at a parliament or assembly of nobles at oxford it was contrived to raise a quarrel between the servants of some bishops and those of alan count of dinan in bretagne upon a contention of rooms in their inns stephen took hold of this advantage sent for the bishops taxed them with breaking his peace and demanded the keys of their castles adding threats of imprisonment if they dared to disobey those whom the king chiefly suspected or rather who had built the most and strongest castles were roger bishop of salisbury with his nephew and natural son the bishops of ely and lincoln whom the king by many circumstances of rigour compelled to surrender going himself in person to seize the devizes then esteemed the noblest structure of europe and built by the forementioned bishop roger whose treasure to the value of forty thousand marks31 there likewise deposited fell at the same time into the kings hand which in a few days broke the bishops heart already worn with age and infirmity  footnote 31 this prelates treasure is doubtless computed by the smaller or saxon mark the use of which still prevailed in england and even thus computed it amounts to a vast sum equal to about £116350 of modern money ds  it may perhaps not be thought a digression to say something of the fortunes of this prelate who from the lowest beginnings came to be without dispute the greatest churchman of any subject in his age it happened that the late king henry in the reign of his brother being at a village in normandy wanted a priest to say mass before him and his train when this man who was a poor curate thereabouts offered his service and performed it with so much dexterity and speed that the soldiers who attended the prince recommended him to their master upon that account as a very proper chaplain for military men but it seems he had other talents for having gotten into the princes service he soon discovered great application and address much order and economy in the management of his masters fortunes which were wholly left to his care after henrys advancement to the crown this chaplain grew chief in his favour and confidence was made bishop of salisbury chancellor of england employed in all his most weighty affairs and usually left vicegerent of the realm while the king was absent in normandy he was among the first that swore fealty to maud and her issue and among the first that revolted from her to stephen offering such reasons in council for setting her aside as by the credit and opinion of his wisdom were very prevalent but the king in a few years forgot all obligations and the bishop fell a sacrifice in his old age to those treasures he had been so long heaping up for its support a just reward for his ingratitude towards the prince that raised him to be ruined by the ingratitude of another whom he had been so very instrumental to raise  but henry bishop of winchester the popes legate not able to endure this violation of the church called a council of all the prelates to meet at winchester where the king being summoned appeared by his advocate who pleaded his cause with much learning and the archbishop of rouen coming to the council declared his opinion that although the canons did allow the bishops to possess castles yet in dangerous times they ought to deliver them up to the king this opinion stephen followed very steadily not yielding a tittle although the legate his brother used all means both rough and gentle to work upon him  the council of bishops broke up without other effect than that of leaving in their minds an implacable hatred to the king in a very opportune juncture for the interests of maud who about this time landed at portsmouth with her brother robert earl of gloucester the whole force she brought over for this expedition consisted but of one hundred and forty knights32 for she trusted altogether in her cause and her friends with this slender attendance she went to arundel and was there received into the castle by the widow of the late king while earl robert accompanied only by twenty men marched boldly to his own city of gloucester in order to raise forces for the empress where the townsmen turned out the kings garrison as soon as they heard of his approach  footnote 32 in these times none served on horseback but gentlemen or knights in right of their fiefs or their representatives called menatarms and each of these was attended by at least two servants or retainers mounted and armed ds  king stephen was not surprised at the news of the empresss arrival being a thing he had always counted upon and was long preparing himself against he was glad to hear how ill she was provided and resolved to use the opportunity of her brothers absence for hasting down to arundel with a sufficient strength he laid siege to the castle in hopes by securing her person to put a speedy end to the war  but there wanted not some very near about the king who favouring the party of maud had credit enough to prevail with him not to venture time and reputation against an impregnable fortress but rather by withdrawing his forces permit her to retire to some less fortified place where she might more easily fall into his hands this advice the king took against his own opinion the empress fled out of arundel by night and after frequent shifting her stages through several towns which had already declared in her favour fixed herself at last at lincoln where having all things provided necessary for her defence she resolved to continue and expect either a general revolt of the english to her side or the decision of war between the king and her brother  but stephen who had pursued the empress from place to place hearing she had shut herself up in lincoln resolved to give her no rest and to help on his design it fell out that the citizens in hatred to the earl of chester who commanded there for the empress sent a private invitation to the king with promise to deliver the town and their governor into his hands the king came accordingly and possessed himself of the town but maud and the earl made their escape a few days before however many great persons of mauds party remained prisoners to the king and among the rest the earl of chesters wife who was daughter to the earl of gloucester these two earls resolving to attempt the relief of their friends marched with all their forces near lincoln where they found the enemy drawn up and ready to receive them  the next morning after battle offered by the lords and accepted by the king both sides made ready to engage the king having disposed his cavalry on each wing placed himself at the head of his foot in whom he reposed most confidence the army of the lords was divided in three bodies those whom king stephen had banished were placed in the middle the earl of chester led the van and the earl of gloucester commanded the rear the battle was fought at first with equal advantage and great obstinacy on both sides at length the right wing of the kings horse pressed by the earl of chester galloped away not without suspicion of treachery the left followed the example the king beheld their flight and encouraging those about him fell with undaunted valour upon the enemy and being for some time bravely seconded by his foot did great execution at length overpowered by numbers his men began to disperse and stephen was left almost alone with his sword in his hand wherewith he opposed his person against a whole victorious army nor durst any be so hardy to approach him the sword breaking a citizen of lincoln put into his hands a danish battleaxe33 with which he struck to the ground the earl of chester34 who presumed to come within his reach but this weapon likewise flying in pieces with the force of those furious blows he dealt on all sides a bold knight of the empresss party named william de keynes laid hold on his helmet and immediately cried out to his fellows i have got the king then the rest ran in and he was taken prisoner35  footnote 33 sim dunelmensis ds  footnote 34 the earl of chester lived nevertheless to fight other battles and died twelve years afterwards by poison ds  footnote 35 gervase ds  the king being thus secured was presented to the empress then at gloucester and by her orders conveyed to bristol where he continued in strict custody nine months although with honourable treatment for some time until either upon endeavouring to make his escape or in malice to the londoners who had a great affection for their king he was by express command from the empress laid in irons and used with other circumstances of severity  this victory was followed by a general defection of almost the whole kingdom and the earl of anjou husband to the empress upon the fame of the kings defeat and imprisonment reduced without any difficulty the whole duchy of normandy to his obedience  the legate himself although brother to king stephen received her at winchester with great solemnity accepted her oath for governing with justice redressing grievances and supporting the rights of the church and took the old conditional one of fealty to her then in an assembly of bishops and clergy convoked for the purpose he displayed the miscarriages of his brother and declared his approbation of the empress to be queen to which they unanimously agreed to complete all he prevailed by his credit with the londoners who stood out the last of any to acknowledge and receive her into the city where she arrived at length in great pomp and with general satisfaction  but it was the misfortune of this princess to possess many weaknesses that are charged to the sex and very few of its commendable qualities she was now in peaceable possession of the whole kingdom except the county of kent where william dypres pretended to keep up a small party for the king when by her pride wilfulness indiscretion and a disobliging behaviour she soon turned the hearts of all men against her and in a short time lost the fruits of that victory and success which had been so hardly gained by the prudence and valour of her excellent brother the first occasion she took to discover the perverseness of her nature was in the treatment of maud the wife of king stephen a lady of great virtue and courage above her sex who coming to the empress an humble suitor in behalf of her husband offered as a price of his liberty that he should resign all pretensions to the crown and pass the rest of his life in exile or in a convent but this request was rejected with scorn and reproaches and the queen finding all entreaties to no purpose writ to her son eustace to let him understand the ill success of her negotiation that no relief was to be otherwise hoped for than by arms and therefore advised him to raise immediately what forces he could for the relief of his father  her next miscarriage was towards the londoners who presented her a petition for redressing certain rigorous laws of her father and restoring those of edward the confessor the empress put them off for a time with excuses but at last discovered some displeasure at their importunity the citizens who had with much difficulty been persuaded to receive her against their inclinations which stood wholly for the king were moved with indignation at her unreasonable refusal of their just demands and entered into a conspiracy to seize her person but she had timely notice of their design and leaving the city by night in disguise fled to oxford  a third false step the empress made36 was in refusing her new powerful friend the legate a favour he desired in behalf of eustace the kings son to grant him the lands and honours held by his father before he came to the crown she had made large promises to this prelate that she would be directed in all things by his advice and to be refused upon his first application a small favour for his own nephew stung him to the quick however he governed his resentments a while but began at the same time to resume his affection for his brother these thoughts were cultivated with great address by queen maud who prevailed at last so far upon the legate that private measures were agreed between them for restoring stephen to his liberty and crown the bishop took leave of the empress upon some plausible pretence and retired to winchester where he gave directions for supplying with men and provisions several strong castles he had built in his diocese while the queen with her son eustace prevailed with the londoners and men of kent to rise in great numbers for the king and a powerful army was quickly on foot under the command of william dypres earl of kent  footnote 36 william of malmesbury ds  in the mean time the empress began to be sensible of the errors she had committed and in hope either to retrieve the friendship of the legate or take him prisoner marched with her army to winchester where being received and lodged in the castle she sent immediately for the legate spoke much in excuse of what was past and used all endeavours to regain him to her interests bishop henry on the other side amused her with dubious answers and kept her in suspense for some days but sent privately at the same time to the kings army desiring them to advance with all possible speed which was executed with so much diligence that the empress and her brother had only time with their troops to march a back way out of the town they were pursued by the enemy so close in the rear that the empress had hardly time by counterfeiting herself dead to make her escape in which posture she was carried as a corpse to gloucester but the earl her brother while he made what opposition he could with design to stop her pursuers was himself taken prisoner with great slaughter of his men after the battle the earl was in his turn presented to queen maud and by her command sent to rochester to be treated in the same manner with the king  thus the heads of both parties were each in the power of his enemy and fortune seemed to have dealt with great equality between them two factions divided the whole kingdom and as it usually happens private animosities were inflamed by the quarrel of the public which introduced a miserable face of things throughout the land whereof the writers of our english story give melancholy descriptions not to be repeated in this history since the usual effects of civil war are obvious to conceive and tiresome as well as useless to relate however as the quarrel between the king and empress was grounded upon a cause that in its own nature little concerned the interests of the people this was thought a convenient juncture for transacting a peace to which there appeared an universal disposition several expedients were proposed but earl robert would consent upon no other terms than the deposing of stephen and immediate delivery of the crown to his sister these debates lasted for some months until the two prisoners weary of their long constraint by mutual consent were exchanged for each other and all thoughts of agreement laid aside  the king upon recovery of his freedom hastened to london to get supplies of men and money for renewing the war he there found that his brother of winchester had in a council of bishops and abbots renounced all obedience to the empress and persuaded the assembly to follow his example the legate in excuse for this proceeding loaded her with infamy produced several instances wherein she had broken the oath she took when he received her as queen and upon which his obedience was grounded said he had received information that she had a design upon his life37  footnote 37 william of malmesbury ds  it must be confessed that oaths of fealty in this princes reign were feeble ties for binding the subject to any reasonable degree of obedience and the warmest advocates for liberty cannot but allow from those examples here produced that it is very possible for people to run upon great extremes in this matter that a monarch may be too much limited and a subject too little whereof the consequences have been fully as pernicious for the time as the worst that can be apprehended from arbitrary power in all its heights although not perhaps so lasting or so hard to be remedied since all the miseries of this kingdom during the period we are treating of were manifestly owing to that continual violation of such oaths of allegiance as appear to have been contrived on purpose by ambitious men to be broken at pleasure without the least apprehension of perjury and in the mean time keep the prince in a continual slavish dependence  the earl of gloucester soon after his release went over into normandy where he found the earl of anjou employed in completing the conquest of that duchy there he delivered him the sons of several english noblemen to be kept as hostages for their fathers fidelity to the empress and used many arguments for persuading him to come over in person with an army to her assistance but geoffrey excused himself by the importance of other affairs and the danger of exposing the dominions he had newly acquired to rebellions in his absence however he lent the earl of gloucester a supply of four hundred men and sent along with him his eldest son henry to comfort his mother and be shewn to the people  during the short absence of the earl of gloucester the empress was closely besieged in oxford by the king and provisions beginning to fail she was in cruel apprehensions of falling into his hands this gave her occasion to put in practice the only talent wherein she seemed to excel which was that of contriving some little shift or expedient to secure her person upon any sudden emergency a long season of frost had made the thames passable upon the ice and much snow lay on the ground maud with some few attendants clad all in white to avoid being discovered from the kings camp crossed the river at midnight on foot and travelling all night got safe to wallingford castle where her brother and young son henry newly returned from france arrived soon after to her great satisfaction but oxford immediately upon the news of her flight surrendered to the king  however this disgrace was fully compensated soon after by another of the same kind which happened to king stephen for whilst he and his brother of winchester were fortifying a nunnery at wilton to bridle his enemies at salisbury who very much harassed those parts by their frequent excursions the earl of gloucester who watched all opportunities came unaware with a strong body of men and set fire on the nunnery while the king himself was in it stephen upon the sudden surprise of the thing wholly lost or forgot his usual courage and fled shamefully away leaving his soldiers to be cut in pieces by the earl  during the rest of the war although it lasted nine years longer there is little memorable recorded by any writer whether the parties being pretty equal and both sufficiently tired with so long a contention wanted vigour and spirit to make a thorough conquest and only endeavoured to keep what they had or whether the multitude of strong castles whose number daily increased made it very difficult to end a war between two contending powers almost in balance let the cause be what it will the whole time passed in mutual sieges surprises revolts surrenders of fortified places without any decisive action or other event of importance to be related by which at length the very genius of the people became wholly bent upon a life of spoil robbery and plunder many of the nobles although pretending to hold their castles for the king or the empress lived like petty independent princes in a perpetual state of war against their neighbours the fields lay uncultivated all the arts of civil life were banished no veneration left for sacred persons or things in short no law truth or religion among men but a scene of universal misery attended with all the consequences of an embroiled and distracted state  about the eleventh year of the kings reign young henry now growing towards a man was sent for to france by a message from his father who was desirous to see him but left a considerable party in england to adhere to his interests and in a short time after as some write38 the empress herself grown weary of contending any longer in a cause where she had met with nothing but misfortunes of her own procuring left the kingdom likewise and retired to her husband nor was this the only good fortune that befell stephen for before the year ended the main prop and pillar of his enemies was taken away by death this was robert earl of gloucester than whom there have been few private persons known in the world that deserve a fairer place and character in the registers of time for his inviolable faith disinterested friendship indefatigable zeal and firm constancy to the cause he espoused and unparalleled generosity in the conduct thereof he adhered to his sister in all her fortunes to the ruin of his own he placed a crown on her head and when she had lost it by her folly and perverseness refused the greatest offers from a victorious enemy who had him in his power and chose to continue a prisoner rather than recover his liberty by any hazard to her pretensions he bore up her sinking title in spite of her own frequent miscarriages and at last died in her cause by a fever contracted with perpetual toils for her service an example fit to be shewn the world although few perhaps are like to follow it but however a small tribute of praise justly due to extraordinary virtue may prove no ill expedient to encourage imitation  footnote 38 gervase ds  but the death of this lord together with the absence of the empress and her son in france added very little to the quiet or security of the king for the earl of gloucester suspecting the fidelity of the lords had with great sagacity delivered their sons to the earl of anjou to be kept as pledges for their fathers fidelity as we have before related by which means a powerful party was still kept up against stephen too strong to be suddenly broken besides he had by an unusual strain of his conduct lately lost much goodwill as well as reputation in committing an act of violence and fraud on the person of the earl of chester a principal adherent of the empress this nobleman of great power and possessions had newly reconciled himself to stephen and came to his court at northampton where against all laws of hospitality as well as common faith and justice he was committed to prison and forced to buy his liberty with the surrender of lincoln and all his other places into the kings hands    1149    1150  affairs continued in this turbulent posture about two years the nobles neither trusting the king nor each other the number of castles still increased which every man who had any possessions was forced to build or else become a prey to his powerful neighbours this was thought a convenient juncture by the empress and her friends for sending young prince henry to try his fortune in england where he landed at the head of a considerable number of horse and foot although he was then but sixteen years old immediately after his arrival he went to carlisle where he met his cousin david king of scots by whom he was made knight after the usual custom of young princes and noblemen in that age the king of england who had soon intelligence of henrys landing and motions marched down to secure york against which he expected the first attempt of his enemy was designed but whatever the cause might be wherein the writers of those ages are either silent or unsatisfactory both armies remained at that secure distance for three months after which henry returned back to normandy leaving the kingdom in the state of confusion he found it at his coming  the fortunes of this young prince henry fitzempress now began to advance by great and sudden steps whereof it will be no digression to inform the reader as well upon the connection they have with the affairs at home about this time as because they concern the immediate successor to the crown    1151  prince henrys voyage to france was soon followed by the death of his father geoffrey earl of anjou whereby the son became possessed of that earldom together with the duchy of normandy but in a short time after he very much enlarged his dominions by a marriage in which he consulted his reputation less than his advantage for louis the young king of france was lately divorced from his wife eleanor who as the french writers relate bore a great contempt and hatred to her husband and had long desired such a separation other authors give her not so fair a character but whatever might be the real cause the pretext was consanguinity in the fourth degree39 henry was content to accept this lady with all her faults and in her right became duke of aquitaine and earl of poitou very considerable provinces added to his other dominions  footnote 39 louis vii after living fourteen years with his queen obtained a dissolution of the marriage on the plea of relationship within the prohibited degrees see bouchet annalles dacquitaine wsj  but the two kings of france and england began to apprehend much danger from the sudden greatness of a young ambitious prince and their interests were jointly concerned to check his growth duke henry was now ready to sail for england in a condition to assert his title upon more equal terms when the king of france in conjunction with eustace king stephens son and geoffrey the dukes own brother suddenly entered into his dominions with a mighty army took the castle of neufmarché by storm and laid siege to that of angers the duke by this incident was forced to lay aside his thoughts of england and marching boldly towards the enemy resolved to relieve the besieged but finding they had already taken the castle he thought it best to make a diversion by carrying the war into the enemys country where he left all to the mercy of his soldiers surprised and burnt several castles and made great devastations wherever he came this proceeding answered the end for which it was designed the king of france thought he had already done enough for his honour and began to grow weary of a ruinous war which was likely to be protracted the conditions of a peace by the intervention of some religious men were soon agreed the duke after some time spent in settling his affairs and preparing all things necessary for his intended expedition set sail for england where he landed40 the same year in the depth of winter with a hundred and forty knights and three thousand foot  footnote 40 the place where he landed is not mentioned by our historians it was probably in the west of england as the first garrisoned town he attacked was malmesbury ds  some time before henry landed the king had conceived a project to disappoint his designs by confirming the crown upon himself and his own posterity41 he sent for the archbishop of canterbury with several other prelates and proposed that his son eustace should be crowned king with all the usual solemnity but the bishops absolutely refused to perform the office by express orders from the pope who was an enemy to stephen partly upon account of his unjust or declining cause but chiefly for his strict alliance with the king of france who was then engaged in a quarrel against that see upon a very tender point relating to the revenues of vacant churches the king and his son were both enraged at the bishops refusal and kept them prisoners in the chamber where they assembled with many threats to force them to a compliance and some other circumstances of rigour but all to no purpose so that he was at length forced to desist but the archbishop to avoid further vexation fled the realm  footnote 41 gervase hen huntingdon ds  this contrivance of crowning the son during the life and reign of the father which appears so absurd in speculation was actually performed in the succeeding reign and seems to have been taken up by those two princes of french birth and extraction in imitation of the like practice in their native country42 where it was usual for kings grown old and infirm or swayed by paternal indulgence to receive their eldest son into a share of the administration with the title of king a custom borrowed no doubt from the later emperors of rome who adopted their caesars after the like manner  footnote 42 mezeray ds    1153  the king was employed in his usual exercise of besieging castles when the news was brought of henrys arrival he left the work he was about and marched directly against the duke who was then sat down before malmesbury but stephen forced him to raise the siege and immediately offered him battle the duke although his army was much increased by continual revolts thought it best to gain time being still in number far inferior to the king and therefore kept himself strongly entrenched there is some difference among writers about the particulars of this war however it is generally agreed that in a short time after the two armies met and were prepared for battle when the nobles on both sides either dreading the consequences or weary of a tedious war prevailed with the king and duke to agree to a truce for some days in order to a peace which was violently opposed by eustace the kings son a youth of great spirit and courage because he knew very well it could not be built but upon the ruin of his interests and therefore finding he could not prevail he left the army in a rage and attended by some followers endeavoured to satiate his fury by destroying the country in his march but in a few days as he sat at dinner in a castle of his own he fell suddenly dead either through grief madness or poison  the truce was now expired and the duke began to renew the war with fresh vigour but the king was wholly dispirited upon this fatal accident and now first began to entertain real thoughts of a peace he had lost a son whom he dearly loved and with him he likewise lost the alliance of the french king to whose sister the young prince was married he had indeed another son left but little esteemed by the nobles and people nor as it appears much regarded by his father he was now in the decline of his age decayed in his health forsaken by his friends who since the death of eustace fell daily from him and having no further care at heart for his posterity he thought it high time to seek repose for his person the nobles soon observed this disposition in their king which was so agreeable to their own therefore by general consent theobald archbishop of canterbury was appointed mediator between both princes all matters were soon agreed an assembly of lords was convened at winchester where the king received the duke with great marks of courtesy and kindness there the peace was confirmed by the kings charter wherein are expressed the terms of agreement but i shall relate only the principal  the king by this charter acknowledged henry for lawful successor to the crown in which capacity all the nobles paid him homage and henry himself with his party paid homage to stephen there is likewise a reservation for william the kings son of all the honours possessed by his father before he came to the crown the king likewise acknowledges the obedience of his subjects to be no longer due to him than he shall observe the conditions of this charter and for the performance of these articles the archbishops and bishops were appointed guarantees there were some other articles agreed on which are not mentioned in the charter as a general pardon a restitution to the right owners of those lands and possessions which had been usurped in the time of the troubles that all castles built during the war should be razed to the ground which are said to have been above eleven hundred that the rights of the church should be preserved with other matters of less moment  thus by the prudence of archbishop theobald the moderation of the two princes engaged and the universal inclination of the people a happy period was put to this tedious and troublesome war men began to have the prospect of a long peace nor was it easy to foresee what could possibly arise to disturb it when discovery was made by accident of a most horrible piece of treachery which if it had met with success would have once more set the whole nation in a flame the duke after the peace attended the king to london to be shewn to the people as the undoubted successor to the crown and having made a progress together through some other parts of the kingdom they came to canterbury where henry received private notice of a design upon his life it hath been already observed that the king employed in his wars a body of flemings to the great discontent of his own subjects with whom they were very ungracious these foreigners were much discontented at the peace whereby they were likely to become useless and burthensome to the present king and hateful to the successor to prevent which the commanders among them began to practise upon the levity and ambition of william the kings son they urged the indignity he had received in being deprived of his birthright offered to support his title by their valour as they had done that of his father and as an earnest of their intentions to remove the chief impediment by dispatching his rival out of the world the young prince was easily wrought upon to be at the head of this conspiracy time and place were fixed when upon the day appointed william broke his leg by a fall from his horse and the conspirators wanting their leader immediately dispersed this disappointment and delay as it usually happens among conspirators were soon followed by a discovery of the whole plot whereof the duke with great discretion made no other use than to consult his own safety therefore without any shew of suspicion or displeasure he took leave of the king and returned to normandy    1154  stephen lived not above a year to share the happiness of this peace with his people in which time he made a progress through most parts of the kingdom where he gained universal love and veneration by a most affable and courteous behaviour to all men a few months after his return he went to dover to have an interview with the earl of flanders43 where after a short sickness he died of the iliac passion together with his old distemper the hemorrhoids upon the twentyfifth day of october in the fortyninth year of his age and the nineteenth of his reign  footnote 43 the earl of flanders was a potent sovereign on the continent and had landed at dover in order to meet and confer with the king ds  he was a prince of wonderful endowments both in body and mind in his person tall and graceful of great strength as well as vigour he had a large portion of most virtues that can be useful in a king towards the happiness of his subjects or himself courtesy and valour liberality and clemency in an eminent degree especially the last which he carried to an extreme though very pardonable yet hardly consisting with prudence or his own safety if we except his usurpation of the crown he must be allowed a prince of great justice which most writers affirm to have been always unblemished except in that single instance for as to his treatment of the bishops and the earl of chester it seems very excusable by the necessity of the time and it was the general opinion if he had not used that proceeding with the latter it would have cost him his crown perhaps his injustice to the empress might likewise admit a little extenuation four kings successively had sat on the throne without any regard to lineal descent a period beyond the memory of most men then alive whereby the people had lost much of that devotion they were used to bear towards an established succession besides the government of a woman was then a thing unknown and for that reason disliked by all who professed to hate innovations  but the wisdom of this prince was by no means equal to the rest of his virtues he came to the crown upon as fair a title as his predecessor being elected by the general consent of the nobles through the credit of his brother and his own personal merit he had no disturbance for some time which he might easily have employed in settling the kingdom and acquiring the love of his people he had treasure enough to raise and pay armies without burthening the subject his competitor was a woman whose sex was the least of her infirmities and with whom he had already compounded for his quiet by a considerable pension yet with all these advantages he seldom was master of above half the kingdom at once and that by the force of perpetual struggling and with frequent danger of losing the whole the principal difficulties he had to encounter appear to have been manifest consequences of several most imprudent steps in his conduct whereof many instances have been produced in the history of his reign such as the unlimited permission of building castles his raising the siege of a weak place where the empress was shut up and must in a few days have fallen into his hands his employing the flemings in his wars and favouring them above his own subjects and lastly that abortive project of crowning his son which procured him at once the hatred and contempt of the clergy by discovering an inclination to violence and injustice that he durst not pursue whereas it was nothing else but an effect of that hasty and sudden disposition usually ascribed to those of his country and in a peculiar manner charged to this prince for authors give it as a part of his character to be hot and violent in the beginning of an enterprise but to slacken and grow cold in the prosecution  he had a just sense of religion and was frequent in attending the service of the church yet reported to be no great friend of the clergy which however is a general imputation upon all the kings of this realm in that and some succeeding reigns and by no means personal to this prince who deserved it as little as any  i do not find any alterations during this reign in the meetings of general assemblies further than that the commons do not seem to have been represented in any of them for which i can assign no other reason than the will of the king or the disturbance of the time44 i observed the word parliament is used promiscuously among authors for a general assembly of nobles and for a council of bishops or synod of the clergy which renders this matter too perplexed to ascertain anything about it  footnote 44 the rise and history of parliaments had not been cleared up when the doctor writ in the beginning of this current century it is certain that the commons had as yet never been represented ds  as for affairs of the church that deserve particular mention i have not met with any unless it should be worth relating that henry bishop of winchester the popes legate who held frequent synods during this reign was the first introducer of appeals to rome in this kingdom for which he is blamed by all the monkish historians who give us the account   the reign of henry the second  a fragment    1154  the spirit of war and contention which had for a long time possessed the nation became so effectually laid during the last year of king stephens reign that no alteration or disturbance ensued upon his death although the new king45 after he had received intelligence of it was detained six weeks46 by contrary winds besides the opinion of this princes power and virtues had already begotten so great an awe and reverence for him among the people that upon his arrival he found the whole kingdom in a profound peace he landed at hostreham47 about the beginning of december was received at winchester by a great number of the nobility who came there to attend and swear fealty to him and three weeks after was crowned at westminster about the twentythird year of his age  footnote 45 henry was at that time besieging a castle on the frontiers of normandy ds  footnote 46 five weeks at the most a month saith brompton ds  footnote 47 at hostreham saith gervase this place is not easy to be found however it must be on the sussex or hampshire coast because the king went directly from the place of his landing to winchester carte says he landed december 8th near hurst castle in the new forest ds  for the further settling of the kingdom after the long distractions in the preceding reign he seized on all the castles which remained undestroyed since the last peace between him and king stephen whereof some he demolished and trusted others to the government of persons in whom he could confide  but that which most contributed to the quiet of the realm and the general satisfaction of his subjects was a proclamation published commanding all foreigners to leave england enforced with a most effectual clause whereby a day was fixed after which it should be capital for any of them to appear among these was william dypres earl of kent whose possessions the king seized into his own hands  these foreigners generally called flemings by the writers of the english story were a sort of vagabond soldiers of fortune who in those ages under several denominations infested other parts of europe as well as england they were a mixed people natives of arragon navarre biscay brabant and other parts of spain and flanders they were ready to be hired to whatever prince thought fit to employ them but always upon condition to have full liberty of plunder and spoil nor was it an easy matter to get rid of them when there was no further need of their service in england they were always hated by the people and by this prince in particular whose continual enemies they had been  after the expulsion of these foreigners and the forcing a few refractory lords to a surrender of their castles king henry like a wise prince began to consider that a time of settled peace was the fittest juncture to recover the rights of the crown which had been lost by the war he therefore resumed by his royal authority all crown lands that had been alienated by his predecessor alleging that they were unalienable in themselves and besides that the grants were void as coming from an usurper whether such proceedings are agreeable with justice i shall not examine but certainly a prince cannot better consult his own safety than by disabling those whom he renders discontent which is effectually done no other way but by depriving them of their possessions    1156  while the king was thus employed at home intelligence came that his brother geoffrey was endeavouring by force to possess himself of the earldom of anjou to which he had fair pretensions for their father considering what vast dominions would fall to his eldest son bequeathed that earldom to the second in his last sickness and commanded his nobles then about him to take an oath that they would not suffer his body to be buried until henry who was then absent should swear to observe his will the duke of normandy when he came to assist at his fathers obsequies and found that without his compliance he must draw upon himself the scandal of keeping a father unburied took the oath that was exacted for observance of his will though very much against his own but after he was in possession of england whether it were that his ambition enlarged with his dominions or that from the beginning he had never intended to observe what he had sworn he prevailed with pope adrian of english birth to dispense with his oath and in the second year of his reign went over into normandy drove his brother entirely out of anjou and forced him to accept a pension for his maintenance but the young prince through the resentment of this unnatural dealing in a short time died of grief  nor was his treatment more favourable to the king of scots whom upon a slight pretence he took occasion to dispossess of carlisle newcastle and other places granted by the empress to that princes father for his services and assistance in her quarrel against stephen  having thus recovered whatever he had any title to demand he began to look out for new acquisitions ireland was in that age a country little known in the world the legates sent sometimes thither from the court of rome for urging the payment of annats or directing other church affairs represented the inhabitants as a savage people overrun with barbarism and superstition for indeed no nation of europe where the christian religion received so early and universal admittance was ever so late or slow in feeling its effects upon their manners and civility48 instead of refining their manners by their faith they had suffered their faith to be corrupted by their manners true religion being almost defaced both in doctrine and discipline after a long course of time among a people wholly sunk in ignorance and barbarity there seem to have been two reasons why the inhabitants of that island continued so long uncultivated first their subjection or vassalage to so many petty kings whereof a great number is mentioned by authors besides those four or five usually assigned to the several provinces these princes were engaged in perpetual quarrels in doing or revenging injuries of violence or lust or treachery or injustice which kept them all in a continual state of war and indeed there is hardly any country how renowned soever in ancient or modern story which may not be traced from the like original neither can a nation come out from this state of confusion until it is either reduced under one head at home or by force or conquest becomes subject to a foreign administration  footnote 48 the irish had been very learned in former ages but had declined for several centuries before the reign of henry ii vide bede ds  the other reason why civility made such late entrances into that island may be imputed to its natural situation lying more out of the road of commerce or conquest than any other part of the known world all the intercourse the inhabitants had was only with the western coasts of wales and scotland from whence at least in those ages they were not like to learn very much politeness    1155  the king about the second year of his reign sent ambassadors to pope adrian with injunctions to desire his licence for reducing the savage people of ireland from their brutish way of living and subjecting them to the crown of england the king proceeded thus in order to set up a title to the island wherein the pope himself pretended to be lord of the see for in his letter which is an answer and grant to the kings requests he insists upon it that all islands upon their admitting the christian faith become subject to the see of rome and the irish themselves avowed the same thing to some of the first conquerors in that forementioned letter the pope highly praises the kings generous design49 and recommends to him the civilizing the natives the protection of the church and the payment of peterpence the ill success of all past endeavours to procure from a people so miserable and irreligious this revenue to the holy see was a main inducement with the pope to be easy and liberal in his grant for the king professed a design of securing its regular payment however this expedition was not undertaken until some years after when there happened an incident to set it forward as we shall relate in its place  footnote 49

note  john macky the author of the characters was for many years in the employ of the english government as an agent for obtaining information as to the movements of the french he published in 1696 a view of the court of st germains from the year 1690 to 1695 the information embodied in this work he obtained from personal observation while in paris about 1709 however he aroused the governments suspicions and was imprisoned he was kept confined until the accession of george i on his release he attempted to establish a packetservice between england and ireland to dublin but the venture failed he died at rotterdam in 1726 the characters was first published in 1733 with the title  memoirs of the secret services of john macky esq during the reigns of king william queen anne and king george i including also the true secret history of the rise promotions etc of the english and scots nobility officers civil military naval and other persons of distinction from the revolution in their respective characters at large drawn up by mr macky pursuant to the direction of her royal highness the princess sophia published from his original manuscript as attested by his son spring macky esq london 1733 the work was prepared for the press by a mr davis an officer in the customs  it has been questioned whether swift did really make the remarks attributed to him by his various editors but there can be little doubt about their authenticity thomas birch seems to have transcribed the remarks in 1753 if we are to believe a note in a copy of mackys book in the british museum which says the ms notes on the characters in this book were written by dr swift and transcribed by tho birch aug 15 1753 isaac reeds copy is also in the british museum but his notes were transcribed from another copy in the possession of j putland and putlands copy reed notes was formerly in the possession of philip carteret webb esq now 1770 of thomas astle esq j ritsons copy which is at the south kensington museum had the remarks transcribed to it from reeds copy but ritson notes that reed copied the remarks from j putlands transcript of the deans own original ritson however does not say how he knew that putland had the deans own original in notes and queries 3 ii 430 the rev j jebb rector of peterstow states he had in 1862 a copy of the characters with transcript of swifts remarks by bishop jebb mr edward solly has an interesting paper on this matter in the bibliographer for march 1883 he suggests that mr putland may have written them down himself from remarks made by swift the crypt for december 1829 published swifts remarks from a copy in the possession of mr pickering the bookseller  a careful collation of all the available copies has been made for this edition and the text of mackys work has been read with the first edition where neither reed nor birch give no remarks they have been omitted from this reprint the crypt and nichols in his quarto edition vol xiv often differ

note  the text of this edition of swifts notes on clarendon has been founded on the careful transcript made by mr percy fitzgerald this transcript is now in the victoria and albert museum south kensington mr fitzgerald refers to dr rowans collation but i have been unable to find the original of this rowans additions however were noted by mr fitzgerald and they have been included here mr fitzgerald says scotts notes subject to the corrections just given by himself are correct and would serve as the base of the new edition the additions i have given and the few given by dr rowan which are given here a little further on will have to be inserted in their proper places and will make the whole complete this has been done and the present reprint is a very careful following out of this suggestion  after the following pages were in type however i have had the opportunity through the kindness of dr bernard the dean of st patricks cathedral of examining the original copy in the marsh library at dublin assisted by the rev newport jd white the librarian of the marsh library i have been able to correct several of mr percy fitzgeralds transcripts and to add some remarks omitted both by him and scott  mr white in an article in hermathena no xxvii 1901 suggests that the successive perusals by swift account for the fact that some of the notes are in ink though most are in pencil while in one or two cases swift seems to have retraced in ink a remark originally in pencil although swift finished his fourth reading of the history in 1741 it is undoubted that he had already annotated the volumes at a much earlier date the copy of the history now in the marsh library was presented to it by archbishop king though the exact date of this presentation can only be guessed in the register of benefactions writes mr white in hermathena the first list which was evidently written at one time and by one hand contains the names of all books presented by king two of these were published as late as 1723 the next entry is dated april 12th 1726 it is probable therefore that these volumes came into their present abode between 1723 and 1726 as dean of st patricks swift was one of the governors of the library and in that capacity attended many of the annual visitations between 1718 and 1736 it is natural to suppose that he was a constant reader it follows therefore that swift borrowed the volumes from the library for his reperusal and perhaps retraced his annotations at that time and added new ones  it is worth while to reprint a sentence from scotts note on these remarks of swifts if only to continue a record of retort against swifts intemperance of feeling against the scottish nation the ludicrous virulence of his execrations against the scottish nation go a great way to remove the effect of his censure and a native of scotland may be justified in retaining them were it but for that reason  ts     remarks on clarendons   history of the   rebellion  vol i

the library of the late  marquess of lansdowne   note  the standard edition of burnets interesting history is that by dr routh first issued in 1823 and revised in a second edition in 1833 mr osmund airy is at present engaged on a new edition for the clarendon press but so far only two volumes have been published it was in dr rouths edition that almost all of swifts notes first appeared in the preface to the issue of 1823 the learned editor informs us that swifts notes were taken from his own copy of the history which had come into the possession of the first marquis of lansdowne a note in the edition of 1833 corrects a statement made in the previous edition that swifts copy had been burnt it was not swifts own copy but a copy containing a transcript of swifts notes that was burnt  in the preparation of the present text every available reference has been searched sir walter scotts reprint of swifts notes was sadly inadequate not only did he misquote the references to burnets work but he could not have consulted the lansdowne copy since fully a third of the notes were altogether ignored by him it is believed that the text here given contains every note accurately placed to its proper account in burnets history the references are to the edition in folio issued in 17241734  in the twentyseventh volume of the european magazine and in the two following volumes a fair proportion of swifts notes were first published these were reprinted by dr burnet in 1808 in his essay on the earlier part of the life of swift both these authorities have been consulted dr rouths modesty forbade him including six of the notes because they were not written with the requisite decorum these have been included here mr osmund airy has thought it unadvisable to encumber the pages with simple terms of abuse but an editor of swifts works cannot permit himself this licence his duty is to include everything  the text of the short remarks is taken from vol viii part 1 of the quarto edition of swifts works edited by deane swift and published in 1765  ts     short remarks on   bishop burnets history   this author is in most particulars the worst qualified for an historian that ever i met with his style is rough full of improprieties in expressions often scotch and often such as are used by the meanest people1 he discovers a great scarcity of words and phrases by repeating the same several hundred times for want of capacity to vary them his observations are mean and trite and very often false his secret history is generally made up of coffeehouse scandals or at best from reports at the third fourth or fifth hand the account of the pretenders birth would only become an old woman in a chimneycorner his vanity runs intolerably through the whole book affecting to have been of consequence at nineteen years old and while he was a little scotch parson of forty pounds a year he was a gentleman born and in the time of his youth and vigour drew in an old maiden daughter of a scotch earl to marry him2 his characters are miserably wrought in many things mistaken and all of them detracting3 except of those who were friends to the presbyterians that early love of liberty he boasts of is absolutely false for the first book that i believe he ever published is an entire treatise in favour of passive obedience and absolute power so that his reflections on the clergy for asserting and then changing those principles come very improperly from him he is the most partial of all writers that ever pretended so much to impartiality and yet i who knew him well am convinced that he is as impartial as he could possibly find in his heart i am sure more than i ever expected from him particularly in his accounts of the papist and fanatic plots this work may be more properly called a history of scotland during the authors time with some digressions relating to england rather than deserve the title he gives it for i believe two thirds of it relate only to that beggarly nation and their insignificant brangles and factions what he succeeds best in is in giving extracts of arguments and debates in council or parliament nothing recommends his book but the recency of the facts he mentions most of them being still in memory especially the story of the revolution which however is not so well told as might be expected from one who affects to have had so considerable a share in it after all he was a man of generosity and good nature and very communicative but in his ten last years was absolutely partymad and fancied he saw popery under every bush he hath told me many passages not mentioned in this history and many that are but with several circumstances suppressed or altered he never gives a good character without one essential point that the person was tender to dissenters and thought many things in the church ought to be amended  footnote 1 his own opinion says my predecessor mr nichols was very different as appears by the original ms of his history wherein the following lines are legible though among those which were ordered not to be printed and if i have arrived at any faculty of writing clearly and correctly i owe that entirely to them tillotson and lloyd for as they joined with wilkins in that noble though despised attempt of an universal character and a philosophical language they took great pains to observe all the common errors of language in general and of ours in particular and in the drawing the tables for that work which was lloyds province he looked further into a natural purity and simplicity of style than any man i ever knew into all which he led me and so helped me to any measure of exactness of writing which may be thought to belong to me the above was originally designed to have followed the words i know from them vol i p 191 1 7 fol ed near the end of ad 1661 s  footnote 2 lady margaret kennedy daughter to the earl of cassilis s  footnote 3 a note in swifts works vol ix pt ii 1775 says after detracting add many of which were stricken through with his own hand but left legible in the ms which he ordered in his last will his executor to print faithfully as he left it without adding suppressing or altering it in any particular in the second volume judge burnet the bishops son and executor promises that the original manuscript of both volumes shall be deposited in the cotton library but this promise does not appear to have been fulfilled at least it certainly was not in 1736 when two letters were printed addressed to thomas burnet esq in p 8 of the second letter the

after relating a long conversation with bentinck afterwards earl of portland addsnext morning i came to him and desired my congé i would oppose nothing in which the prince seemed to be concerned as long as i was his servant and therefore i desired to be disengaged that i might be free to oppose this proposition to offer him the crown with all the strength and credit i had he answered me that i might desire that when i saw a step made but till then he wished me to stay where i wasswift is all this true  p 819 burnet i heard no more of this in which the marquess of halifax was single among the peers for i did not find there was any one of them of his mind unless it was the lord colepeper who was a vicious and corrupt man but made a figure in the debates that were now in the house of lords and died about the end of themswift yet was not the same thing done in effect while the king had the sole administration  p 819 burnet the princess continued all the while in holland being shut in there during the east winds by the freezing of the rivers and by contrary winds after the thaw came so that she came not to england till all the debates were overswift why was she not sent for till the matter was agreed this clearly shews the princes original design was to be king against what he professed in his declaration  p 820 burnet the prince of orange said he came over being invited to save the nation he had now brought together a free and true representative of the kingdom he left it therefore to them to do what they thought best for the good of the kingdom and when things were once settled he should be well satisfied to go back to holland againswift did he tell truth  ibid burnet he thought it necessary to tell them that he would not be the regent so if they continued in that design they must look out for some other person to be put in that postswift was not this a plain confession of what he came for  p 821 burnet in the end he said that he could not resolve to accept of a dignity so as to hold it only the life of another yet he thought that the issue of princess anne should be preferred in the succession to any issue that he might have by any other wife than the princessswift a great concession truly  p 822 burnet the poor bishop of durham lord crewe who had absconded for some time  was now prevailed on to come and by voting the new settlement to merit at least a pardon for all that he had done which all things considered was thought very indecent in him yet not unbecoming the rest of his life and characterswift this is too hard though almost true  ibid burnet then the power of the crown to grant a nonobstante to some statutes was objectedswift yet the words continue in patents  p 824 burnet a notion was started which  was laid thus the prince had a just cause of making war on the king in that most of them agreed in a just war in which an appeal is made to god success is considered as the decision of heaven so the princes success against king james gave him the right of conquest over him and by it all his rights were transferred to the princeswift the author wrote a paper to prove this and it was burnt by the hangman and is a very foolish scheme8  footnote 8 a pastoral letter writ by  gilbert lord bishop of sarum to the clergy of his diocess dated may 15th 1689 was condemned by the house of commons on jan 23rd 16923 and ordered to be burnt by the hand of the common hangman ts   book vii  p 525 second volume burnet speaking of the act for the general naturalization of protestants and the opposition made against it by the high church addsthis was carried in the house of commons with a great majority but all those who appeared for this large and comprehensive way were reproached for their coldness and indifference in the concerns of the church and in that i had a large shareswift dog  p 526 burnet the faction here in england found out proper instruments to set the same humour on foot in ireland during the earl of rochesters government and as was said by his directions so the clergy were making the same bold claim there that had raised such disputes among usswift dog dog dog  p 580 burnet speaking of the interruption in the negotiations for a peace consequent on the earl of jerseys death addsone prior who had been jerseys secretary upon his death was employed to prosecute that which the other did not live to finish prior had been taken a boy out of a tavern by the earl of dorset who accidentally found him reading horace and he being very generous gave him an education in literatureswift malice  p 581 burnet many mercenary pens were set on work to justify our proceedings and to defame our allies more particularly the dutch this was done with much art but with no regard to truth in a pamphlet entitled the conduct of the allies and of the late ministryswift it was all true  ibid burnet the jacobites did with the greater joy entertain this prospect of peace because the dauphin had in a visit to st germains congratulated that court upon it which made them conclude that it was to have a happy effect with relation to the pretenders affairsswift the queen hated and despised the pretender to my knowledge  p 583 burnet in a conference i had with the queen on the subject of peaceshe hoped bishops would not be against peace i said a good peace was what we prayed daily for but  any treaty by which spain and the west indies were left to king philip must in a little while deliver up all europe into the hands of france and if any such peace should be made she was betrayed and we were all ruined in less than three years time she would be murdered and the fires would be again raised in smithfieldswift a false prophet in every particular  p 589 burnet the queen having sent a message to the lords to adjourn it was debatedthat the queen could not send a message to any one house to adjourn when the like message was not sent to both houses the pleasure of the prince in convening dissolving proroguing or ordering the adjournment of parliaments was always directed to both houses but never to any one house without the same intimation was made at the same time to the otherswift modern nonsense  p 591 burnet the house of commons after the recess entered on the observations of the commissioners for taking the public accounts and began with sir robert walpole whom they resolved to put out of the way of disturbing them in the houseswift he began early and has been thriving twentyseven years to january 1739  p 609 burnet a new set of addresses ran about some of these addresses mentioned the protestant succession and the house of hanover with zeal others did it more coldly and some made no mention at all of it and it was universally believed that no addresses were so acceptable to the ministers as those of the last sortswift foolish and factious  p 610 burnet the duke of ormonde had given the states such assurances of his going along with them through the whole campaign that he was let into the secrets of all their counsels which by that confidence were all known to the french and if the auxiliary german troops had not been prepared to disobey his orders it was believed he in conjunction with the french army would have forced the states to come into the new measuresswift vile scot dare to touch ormondes honour and so falsely  p 612 burnet the duke of hamilton and lord mohun were engaged in litigation andupon a very high provocation the lord mohun sent him the duke a challenge which he tried to decline but both being hurried by those false points of honour they fatally went out to hyde park in the middle of november and fought with so violent an animosity that neglecting the rules of art they seemed to run on one another as if they tried who should kill first in which they were both so unhappily successful that the lord mohun was killed outright and duke hamilton died in a few minutes after9swift wrongly told  footnote 9 a footnote to the 1833 edition of burnet says that the duke in the belief of some was killed by general macartney the lord mohuns second see also chesterfields letter quoted in introduction and swifts own version in the four last years p 178 ts  p 614 burnet says of the earl of godolphinafter having been thirty years in the treasury and during nine of those lord treasurer as he was never once suspected of corruption or of suffering his servants to grow rich under him so in all that time his estate was not increased by him to the value of £4000 swift a great lie   the conclusion  p 669 burnet speaking

political periodical written in the form of essays it continued for fifty five numbers from friday december 23rd 1715 to friday june 29th 1716 its purpose was to reconcile the english nation to the hanoverian succession these papers notes scott while they exhibit the exquisite humour and solid sense peculiar to the author show also even amid the strength of party that philanthropy and gentleness of nature which were equally his distinguishing attributes none of these qualities would have conciliated his great opponent swift had the field of combat yet remained open to him but as he withdrew from it in sullen indignation he seems to have thrown out the following flashes of satire as brief examples of what he would have done had the hour of answer been yet current  scott obtained these notes from a transcription of the original in swifts own hand in a copy of the free holder which belonged to dr bernard bishop of limerick the present text is a reprint of scotts but the text of the

lay in the way to his successionswift what difficulties were those or what methods did he take to surmount them  addison it is observed by sir william temple that the english are particularly fond of a king who is valiant upon which account his majesty has a title to all the esteem that can be paid the most warlike prince though at the same time for the good of his subjects he studies to decline all occasions of military gloryswift this seems to be a discovery  addison i might here take notice of his majestys more private virtues but have rather chosen to remind my countrymen of the public
