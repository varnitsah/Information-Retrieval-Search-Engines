the crossing     book i the borderland     chapter i the blue wall  i was born under the blue ridge and under that side which is blue in the evening light in a wild land of game and forest and rushing waters there on the borders of a creek that runs into the yadkin river in a cabin that was chinked with red mud i came into the world a subject of king george the third in that part of his realm known as the province of north carolina  the cabin reeked of cornpone and bacon and the odor of pelts it had two shakedowns on one of which i slept under a bearskin a rough stone chimney was reared outside and the fireplace was as long as my father was tall there was a crane in it and a bake kettle and over it great buckhorns held my fathers rifle when it was not in use on other horns hung jerked bears meat and venison hams and gourds for drinking cups and bags of seed and my fathers best hunting shirt also in a neglected corner several articles of womans attire from pegs these once belonged to my mother among them was a gown of silk of a fine faded pattern over which i was wont to speculate the women at the crossroads twelve miles away were dressed in coarse butternut wool and huge sunbonnets but when i questioned my father on these matters he would give me no answers  my father washow shall i say what he was to this day i can only surmise many things of him he was a scotchman born and i know now that he had a slight scotch accent at the time of which i write my early childhood he was a frontiersman and hunter i can see him now with his hunting shirt and leggings and moccasins his powder horn engraved with wondrous scenes his bullet pouch and tomahawk and hunting knife he was a tall lean man with a strange sad face and he talked little save when he drank too many horns as they were called in that country these lapses of my fathers were a perpetual source of wonder to meand i must say of delight they occurred only when a passing traveller who hit his fancy chanced that way or what was almost as rare a neighbor many a winter night i have lain awake under the skins listening to a flow of language that held me spellbound though i understood scarce a word of it         virtuous and vicious every man must be         few in the extreme but all in a degree  the chance neighbor or traveller was no less struck with wonder and many the time have i heard the query at the crossroads and elsewhere whar alec trimble got his larnin  the truth is my father was an object of suspicion to the frontiersmen even as a child i knew this and resented it he had brought me up in solitude and i was old for my age learned in some things far beyond my years and ignorant of others i should have known i loved the man passionately in the long winter evenings when the howl of wolves and painters rose as the wind lulled he taught me to read from the bible and the pilgrims progress i can see his long slim fingers on the page they seemed but ill fitted for the life he led  the love of rhythmic language was somehow born into me and manys the time i have held watch in the cabin day and night while my father was away on his hunts spelling out the verses that have since become part of my life  as i grew older i went with him into the mountains often on his back and spent the nights in open camp with my little moccasins drying at the blaze so i learned to skin a bear and fleece off the fat for oil with my hunting knife and cure a deerskin and follow a trail at seven i even shot the long rifle with a rest i learned to endure cold and hunger and fatigue and to walk in silence over the mountains my father never saying a word for days at a spell and often when he opened his mouth it would be to recite a verse of popes in a way that moved me strangely for a poem is not a poem unless it be well spoken  in the hot days of summer over against the dark forest the bright green of our little patch of indian corn rippled in the wind and towards night i would often sit watching the deep blue of the mountain wall and dream of the mysteries of the land that lay beyond and by chance one evening as i sat thus my father reading in the twilight a man stood before us so silently had he come up the path leading from the brook that we had not heard him presently my father looked up from his book but did not rise as for me i had been staring for some time in astonishment for he was a betterlooking man than i had ever seen he wore a deerskin hunting shirt dyed black but in place of a coonskin cap with the tail hanging down a hat his long rifle rested on the ground and he held a roan horse by the bridle  howdy neighbor said he  i recall a fear that my father would not fancy him in such cases he would give a stranger food and leave him to himself my fathers whims were past understanding but he got up  good evening said he  the visitor looked a little surprised as i had seen many do at my fathers accent  neighbor said he kin you keep me over night  come in said my father  we sat down to our supper of corn and beans and venison of all of which our guest ate sparingly he too was a silent man and scarcely a word was spoken during the meal several times he looked at me with such a kindly expression in his blue eyes a trace of a smile around his broad mouth that i wished he might stay with us always but once when my father said something about indians the eyes grew hard as flint it was then i remarked with a boys wonder that despite his dark hair he had yellow eyebrows  after supper the two men sat on the log step while i set about the task of skinning the deer my father had shot that day presently i felt a heavy hand on my shoulder  whats your name lad he said  i told him davy  davy ill larn ye a trick worth a little time said he whipping out a knife in a trice the red carcass hung between the forked stakes while i stood with my mouth open he turned to me and laughed gently  some day youll cross the mountains and skin twenty of an evening he said yell make a woodsman sure youve got the eye and the hand  this little piece of praise from him made me hot all over  game rare said he to my father  none sae good now said my father  i reckon not my cabins on beaver creek some forty mile above and games going there too  settlements said my father but presently after a few whiffs of his pipe he added i hear fine things of this land across the mountains that the indians call the dark and bluidy ground  and well named said the stranger  but a brave country said my father and all tramped down with game i hear that daniel boone and others have gone into it and come back with marvellous tales they tell me boone was there alone three months hes saething of a man dye ken him  the ruddy face of the stranger grew ruddier still  my names boone he said  what cried my father it wouldnt be daniel  youve guessed it i reckon  my father rose without a word went into the cabin and immediately reappeared with a flask and a couple of gourds one of which he handed to our visitor  tell me aboot it said he  that was the fairy tale of my childhood far into the night i lay on the dewy grass listening to mr boones talk it did not at first flow in a steady stream for he was not a garrulous man but my fathers questions presently fired his enthusiasm i recall but little of it being so small a lad but i crept closer and closer until i could touch this superior being who had been beyond the wall marco polo was no greater wonder to the venetians than boone to me  he spoke of leaving wife and children and setting out for the unknown with other woodsmen he told how crossing over our blue western wall into a valley beyond they found a warriors path through a gap across another range and so down into the fairest of promised lands and as he talked he lost himself in the tale of it and the very quality of his voice changed he told of a land of wooded hill and pleasant vale of clear water running over limestone down to the great river beyond the ohioa land of glades the fields of which were pied with flowers of wondrous beauty where roamed the buffalo in countless thousands where elk and deer abounded and turkeys and feathered game and bear in the tall brakes of cane and simply he told how when the others had left him he stayed for three months roaming the hills alone with nature herself  but did you no meet the indians asked my father  i seed one fishing on a log once said our visitor laughing but he fell into the water i reckon he was drowned  my father nodded comprehendinglyeven admiringly  and again said he  wal said mr boone we fell in with a war party of shawnees going back to their lands north of the great river the critters took away all we had it was hard he added reflectively i had staked my fortune on the venter and wed got enough skins to make us rich but neighbor there is land enough for you and me as black and rich as canaan  the lord is my shepherd said my father lapsing into verse the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he leadeth me into green pastures and beside still waters  for a time they were silent each wrapped in his own thought while the crickets chirped and the frogs sang from the distant forest came the mournful hoot of an owl  and you are going back asked my father presently  aye that i am there are many families on the yadkin below going too and you neighbor you might come with us davy is the boy that would thrive in that country  my father did not answer it was late indeed when we lay down to rest and the night i spent between waking and dreaming of the wonderland beyond the mountains hoping against hope that my father would go the sun was just flooding the slopes when our guest arose to leave and my father bade him godspeed with a heartiness that was rare to him but to my bitter regret neither spoke of my fathers going being a man of understanding mr boone knew it were little use to press he patted me on the head  youre a wise lad davy said he i hope we shall meet again  he mounted his roan and rode away down the slope waving his hand to us and it was with a heavy heart that i went to feed our white mare whinnying for food in the leanto    chapter ii wars and rumors of wars  and so our life went on the same but yet not the same for i had the land of promise to dream of and as i went about my tasks i conjured up in my mind pictures of its beauty you will forgive a backwoods boyselfcentred for lack of wider interest and with a little imagination bear hunting with my father and an occasional trip on the white mare twelve miles to the crossroads for salt and other necessaries were the only diversions to break the routine of my days but at the crossroads too they were talking of kaintuckee for so the land was called the dark and bloody ground  the next year came a war on the frontier waged by lord dunmore governor of virginia of this likewise i heard at the crossroads though few from our part seemed to have gone to it and i heard there for rumors spread over mountains that men blazing in the new land were in danger and that my hero boone was gone out to save them but in the autumn came tidings of a great battle far to the north and of the indians suing for peace  the next year came more tidings of a sort i did not understand i remember once bringing back from the crossroads a crumpled newspaper which my father read again and again and then folded up and put in his pocket he said nothing to me of these things but the next time i went to the crossroads the woman asked me  is your pa for the congress  whats that said i  i reckon he aint said the woman tartly i recall her dimly a slattern creature in a loose gown and bare feet wife of the storekeeper and wagoner with a swarm of urchins about her they were all very natural to me thus and i remember a battle with one of these urchins in the briers an affair which did not add to the love of their family for ours there was no money in that country and the store took our pelts in exchange for what we needed from civilization once a month would i load these pelts on the white mare and make the journey by the path down the creek at times i met other settlers there some of them not long from ireland with the brogue still in their mouths and again i saw the wagoner with his great canvascovered wagon standing at the door ready to start for the town sixty miles away twas he brought the news of this latest war  one day i was surprised to see the wagoner riding up the path to our cabin crying out for my father for he was a violent man and a violent scene followed they remained for a long time within the house and when they came out the wagoners face was red with rage my father too was angry but no more talkative than usual  ye say yell not help the congress shouted the wagoner  ill not said my father  yell live to rue this day alec trimble cried the man ye may think yere too fine for the likes of us but theres them in the settlement that knows about ye  with that he flung himself on his horse and rode away but the next time i went to the crossroads the woman drove me away with curses and called me an aristocrat wearily i tramped back the dozen miles up the creek beside the mare carrying my pelts with me stumbling on the stones and scratched by the dry briers for it was autumn the woods all red and yellow against the green of the pines i sat down beside the old beaver dam to gather courage to tell my father but he only smiled bitterly when he heard it nor would he tell me what the word aristocrat meant  that winter we spent without bacon and our salt gave out at christmas it was at this season if i remember rightly that we had another visitor he arrived about nightfall one gray day his horse jaded and cut and he was dressed all in wool with a great coat wrapped about him and high boots this made me stare at him when my father drew back the bolt of the door he too stared and fell back a step  come in said he  dye ken me alec said the man  he was a tall spare man like my father a scotchman but his hair was in a cue  come in duncan said my father quietly davy run out for wood  loath as i was to go i obeyed as i came back dragging a log behind me i heard them in argument and in their talk there was much about the congress and a woman named flora macdonald and a british fleet sailing southward  well have two thousand highlanders and more to meet the fleet and yell sit at hame in this hovel yeve made yeresel and he glanced about disdainfully and no help the king he brought his fist down on the pine boards  ye did no help the king greatly at culloden duncan said my father dryly  our visitor did not answer at once  the yankee rebels ll no help the house of stuart said he presently and hanovers coom to stay are ye too a rebel alec ritchie  i remember wondering why he said ritchie  ill no take a hand in this fight answered my father  and that was the end of it the man left with scant ceremony i guiding him down the creek to the main trail he did not open his mouth until i parted with him  puir davy said he and rode away in the night for the moon shone through the clouds  i remember these things i suppose because i had nothing else to think about and the names stuck in my memory intensified by later events until i began to write a diary  and now i come to my travels as the spring drew on i had had a feeling that we could not live thus forever with no market for our pelts and one day my father said to me abruptly  davy well be travelling  where i asked  yell ken soon enough said he well go at crack o day  we went away in the wild dawn leaving the cabin desolate we loaded the white mare with the pelts and my father wore a woollen suit like that of our scotch visitor which i had never seen before he had clubbed his hair but strangest of all he carried in a small parcel the silk gown that had been my mothers we had scant other baggage  we crossed the yadkin at a ford and climbing the hills to the south of it we went down over stony traces down and down through rain and sun stopping at rude cabins or taverns until we came into the valley of another river this i know now was the catawba my memories of that ride are as misty as the spring weather in the mountains but presently the country began to open up into broad fields some of these abandoned to pines and at last splashing through the stiff red clay that was up to the mares fetlocks we came to a place called charlotte town what a day that was for me and how i gaped at the houses there finer than any i had ever dreamed of that was my first sight of a town and how i listened openmouthed to the gentlemen at the tavern one i recall had a fighting head with a lock awry and a negro servant to wait on him and was the principal spokesman he too was talking of war the cherokees had risen on the western border he was telling of the massacre of a settlement in no mild language  sirs he cried the british have stirred the redskins to this will you sit here while women and children are scalped and those devils he called them worse names stuart and cameron go unpunished  my father got up from the corner where he sat and stood beside the man  i ken alec cameron said he  the man looked at him with amazement  ay said he i shouldnt think youd own it damn him he cried if we catch him well skin him alive  i ken cameron my father repeated and ill gang with you to skin him alive  the man seized his hand and wrung it  but first i must be in charlestown said my father  the next morning we sold our pelts and though the mare was tired we pushed southward i behind the saddle i had much to think about wondering what was to become of me while my father went to skin cameron i had not the least doubt that he would do it the world is a storybook to a lad of nine and the thought of charlestown filled me with a delight unspeakable perchance he would leave me in charlestown  at nightfall we came into a settlement called the waxhaws and there being no tavern there and the mare being very jaded and the roads heavy we cast about for a place to sleep the sunlight slanting over the pine forest glistened on the pools in the wet fields and it so chanced that splashing across these swinging a milkpail over his head shouting at the top of his voice was a redheaded lad of my own age my father hailed him and he came running towards us still shouting and vaulted the rails he stood before us eying me with a most mischievous look in his blue eyes and dabbling in the red mud with his toes i remember i thought him a queerlooking boy he was lanky and he had a very long face under his tousled hair  my father asked him where he could spend the night  wal said the boy i reckon uncle crawford might take you in and again he mightnt  he ran ahead still swinging the pail and we following came at length to a comfortablelooking farmhouse as we stopped at the doorway a stout motherly woman filled it she held her knitting in her hand  you andy she cried have you fetched the milk  andy tried to look repentant  i declare ill tan you said the lady git out this instant what rascality have you been in  i fetched home visitors ma said andy  visitors cried the lady what ll your uncle crawford say and she looked at us smiling but with no great hostility  pardon me madam said my father if we seem to intrude but my mare is tired and we have nowhere to stay  uncle crawford did take us in he was a man of substance in that countrya north of ireland man by birth if i remember right  i went to bed with the redheaded boy whose name was andy jackson i remember that his mother came into our little room under the eaves and made andy say his prayers and me after him but when she was gone out andy stumped his toe getting into bed in the dark and swore with a brilliancy and vehemence that astonished me  it was some hours before we went to sleep he plying me with questions about my life which seemed to interest him greatly and i returning in kind  my pas dead said andy he came from a part of ireland where they are all weavers were kinder poor relations here aunt crawfords sick and ma keeps house but uncle crawfords good an lets me go to charlotte town with him sometimes  i recall that he also boasted some about his big brothers who were away just then  andy was up betimes in the morning to see us start but we didnt start because mr crawford insisted that the white mare should have a half days rest andy being hustled off unwillingly to the old field school made me go with him he was a very headstrong boy  i was very anxious to see a school this one was only a log house in a poor piny place with a rabble of boys and girls romping at the door but when they saw us they stopped andy jumped into the air let out a warwhoop and flung himself into the midst scattering them right and left and knocking one boy over and over im billy buck he cried im a hull regiment o rangers let th cherokees mind me  way for sandy andy cried the boys whered you get the new boy sandy  his names davy said andy and his pas goin to fight the cherokees he kin lick tarnation outn any o you  meanwhile i held back never having been thrown with so many of my own kind  hes shot painters and bars said andy an skinned em kin you lick him smally i reckon not  now i had not come to the school for fighting so i held back fortunately for me smally held back also but he tried skilful tactics  he kin throw you sandy  andy faced me in an instant  kin you said he  there was nothing to do but try and in a few seconds we were rolling on the ground to the huge delight of smally and the others andy shouting all the while and swearing we rolled and rolled and rolled in the mud until we both lost our breath and even andy stopped swearing for want of it after a while the boys were silent and the thing became grim earnest at length by some accident rather than my own strength both his shoulders touched the ground i released him but he was on his feet in an instant and at me again like a wildcat  andy wont stay throwed shouted a boy and before i knew it he had my shoulders down in a puddle then i went for him and affairs were growing more serious than a wrestle when smally fancying himself safe and no doubt having a grudge shouted out  tell him he slobbers davy  andy did slobber but that was the end of me and the beginning of smally andy left me instantly not without an intimation that he would come back and proceeded to cover smally with red clay and blood however in the midst of this turmoil the schoolmaster arrived haled both into the schoolhouse held court and flogged andrew with considerable gusto he pronounced these words afterwards with great solemnity  andrew jackson if i catch ye fightin once more ill be afther givin ye lave to lave the school  i parted from andy at noon with real regret he was the first boy with whom i had ever had any intimacy and i admired him chiefly i fear for his fluent use of profanity and his fighting qualities he was a merry lad with a wondrous quick temper but a good heart and he seemed sorry to say goodby he filled my pockets with june applesunripe by the wayand told me to remember him when i got till charlestown  i remembered him much longer than that and usually with a shock of surprise    chapter iii charlestown  down and down we went crossing great rivers by ford and ferry until the hills flattened themselves and the country became a long stretch of level broken by the forests only and i saw many things i had not thought were on the earth once in a while i caught glimpses of great red houses with stately pillars among the trees they put me in mind of the palaces in bunyan their windows all golden in the morning sun and as we jogged ahead i pondered on the delights within them i saw gangs of negroes plodding to work along the road an overseer riding behind them with his gun on his back and there were whole cotton fields in these domains blazing in primrose flowera new plant here so my father said he was willing to talk on such subjects but on others and especially our errand to charlestown he would say nothing and i knew better than to press him  one day as we were crossing a dike between rice swamps spread with delicate green i saw the white tops of wagons flashing in the sun at the far end of it we caught up with them the wagoners cracking their whips and swearing at the straining horses and lo in front of the wagons was an armyat least my boyish mind magnified it to such men clad in homespun perspiring and spattered with mud were straggling along the road by fours laughing and joking together the officers rode and many of these had blue coats and buff waistcoatssome the worse for wear my father was pushing the white mare into the ditch to ride by when one hailed him  hullo my man said he are you a friend to congress  im off to charlestown to leave the lad said my father and then to fight the cherokees  good said the other and then where are you from  upper yadkin answered my father and you  the officer who was a young man looked surprised but then he laughed pleasantly  were north carolina troops going to join lee in charlestown said he the british are sending a fleet and regiments against it  oh aye said my father and would have passed on but he was made to go before the colonel who plied him with many questions then he gave us a paper and dismissed us  we pursued our journey through the heat that shimmered up from the road pausing now and again in the shade of a wayside tree at times i thought i could bear the sun no longer but towards four oclock of that day a great bank of yellow cloud rolled up darkening the earth save for a queer saffron light that stained everything and made our very faces yellow and then a wind burst out of the east with a high mournful note as from a great flute afar filling the air with leaves and branches of trees but it bore too a savor that was new to mea salt savor deep and fresh that i drew down into my lungs and i knew that we were near the ocean then came the rain in great billows as though the ocean itself were upon us  the next day we crossed a ferry on the ashley river and rode down the sand of charlestown neck and my most vivid remembrance is of the great trunks towering half a hundred feet in the air with a tassel of leaves at the top which my father said were palmettos something lay heavy on his mind for i had grown to know his moods by a sort of silent understanding and when the roofs and spires of the town shone over the foliage in the afternoon sun i felt him give a great sigh that was like a sob  and how shall i describe the splendor of that city the sandy streets and the gardens of flower and shade heavy with the plant odors and the great houses with their galleries and porticos set in the midst of the gardens that i remember staring at wistfully but before long we came to a barricade fixed across the street and then to another and presently in an open space near a large building was a company of soldiers at drill  it did not strike me as strange then that my father asked his way of no man but went to a little ordinary in a humbler part of the town after a modest meal in a corner of the public room we went out for a stroll then from the wharves i saw the bay dotted with islands their white sand sparkling in the evening light and fringed with strange trees and beyond of a deepening blue the ocean and nearergreatest of all delights to meriding on the swell was a fleet of ships my father gazed at them long and silently his palm over his eyes  menowar from the old country lad he said after a while theyre a brave sight  and why are they here i asked  theyve come to fight said he and take the town again for the king  it was twilight when we turned to go and then i saw that many of the warehouses along the wharves were heaps of ruins my father said this was that the town might be the better defended  we bent our way towards one of the sandy streets where the great houses were and to my surprise we turned in at a gate and up a path leading to the high steps of one of these under the high portico the door was open but the house within was dark my father paused and the hand he held to mine trembled then he stepped across the threshold and raising the big polished knocker that hung on the panel let it drop the sound reverberated through the house and then stillness and then from within a shuffling sound and an old negro came to the door for an instant he stood staring through the dusk and broke into a cry  marse alec he said  is your master at home said my father  without another word he led us through a deep hall and out into a gallery above the trees of a back garden where a gentleman sat smoking a long pipe the old negro stopped in front of him  marse john said he his voice shaking heahs marse alec done come back  the gentleman got to his feet with a start his pipe fell to the floor and the ashes scattered on the boards and lay glowing there  alec he cried peering into my fathers face alec youre not dead  john said my father can we talk here  good god said the gentleman youre just the same to think of itto think of it breed a light in the drawingroom  there was no word spoken while the negro was gone and the time seemed very long but at length he returned a silver candlestick in each hand  careful cried the gentleman petulantly youll drop them  he led the way into the house and through the hall to a massive door of mahogany with a silver doorknob the grandeur of the place awed me and well it might boylike i was absorbed in this our little mountain cabin would almost have gone into this one room the candles threw their flickering rays upward until they danced on the high ceiling marvel of marvels in the oval left clear by the heavy rounded cornice was a picture  the negro set down the candles on the marble top of a table but the air of the room was heavy and close and the gentleman went to a window and flung it open it came down instantly with a crash so that the panes rattled again  curse these rebels he shouted theyve taken our window weights to make bullets  calling to the negro to pry open the window with a walkingstick he threw himself into a big upholstered chair twas then i remarked the splendor of his clothes which were silk and he wore a waistcoat all sewed with flowers with a boys intuition i began to dislike him intensely  damn the rebels he began theyve driven his lordship away i hope his majesty will hang every mothers son of em all pleasure of life is gone and theyve folly enough to think they can resist the fleet and the worst of it is cried he the worst of it is im forced to smirk to them and give good gold to their government seeing that my father did not answer he asked have you joined the highlanders you were always for fighting  im to be at cherokee ford on the twentieth said my father were to scalp the redskins and cameron though tis not known  cameron shrieked the gentleman but thats the other side man against his majesty  one side or tother said my father tis all one against alec cameron  the gentleman looked at my father with something like terror in his eyes  youll never forgive cameron he said  ill no forgive anybody who does me a wrong said my father  and where have you been all these years alec he asked presently since you went off with  ive been in the mountains leading a pure life said my father and well speak of nothing if you please thats gone by  and what will you have me do said the gentleman helplessly  little enough said my father keep the lad till i come again hes quiet hell no trouble you greatly davy this is mr temple youre to stay with him till i come again  come here lad said the gentleman and he peered into my face youll not resemble your mother  hell resemble no one said my father shortly  goodby davy keep this till i come again and he gave me the parcel made of my mothers gown then he lifted me in his strong arms and kissed me and strode out of the house we listened in silence as he went down the steps and until his footsteps died away on the path then the gentleman rose and pulled a cord hastily the negro came in  put the lad to bed breed said he  whah suh  oh anywhere said the master he turned to me  ill be better able to talk to you in the morning david said he  i followed the old servant up the great stairs gulping down a sob that would rise and clutching my mothers gown tight under my arm had my father left me alone in our cabin for a fortnight i should not have minded but here in this strange house amid such strange surroundings i was heartbroken the old negro was very kind he led me into a little bedroom and placing the candle on a polished dresser he regarded me with sympathy  so youre miss lizbeths boy said he an she dade an marse alec rough an hard es though he

night before he pointed across the dense foliage of the garden to a strip of water gleaming in the morning sun beyond  see dat boat said the negro sometime de marse he tek ar ride in dat boat at night sometime gentlemen comes heah in a powful hurry to git away outn de harbor whah de english is at  by that time i was dressed and marvellously uncomfortable in master nicks clothes but as i was going out of the door breed hailed me  marse daveit was the first time i had been called thatmarse dave you aint gwineter tell  tell what i asked  boutn de boat and marsa agwine away nights  no said i indignantly  i knowed you wahnt said breed you don look as if youd tell anything  we found the master pacing the lower gallery at first he barely glanced at me and nodded after a while he stopped and began to put to me many questions about my life when and how i had lived and to some of my answers he exclaimed good god that was all he was a handsome man with hands like a womans well set off by the lace at his sleeves he had finecut features and the white linen he wore was most becoming  david said he at length and i noted that he lowered his voice david you seem a discreet lad pay attention to what i tell you and mark if you disobey me you will be well whipped you have this house and garden to play in but you are by no means to go out at the front of the house and whatever you may see or hear you are to tell no one do you understand  yes sir i said  for the rest said he breed will give you food and look out for your welfare  and so he dismissed me they were lonely days after that for a boy used to activity and only the damp garden paths and lawns to run on the creek at the back of the garden was stagnant and marshy when the water fell and overhung by leafy boughs on each side of the garden was a high brick wall and though i was often tempted to climb it i felt that disobedience was disloyalty to my father then there was the great house dark and lonely in its magnificence over which i roamed until i knew every corner of it  i was most interested of all in the pictures of men and women in quaint oldtime costumes and i used during the great heat of the day to sit in the drawingroom and study these and wonder who they were and when they lived another amusement i had was to climb into the deep windows and peer through the blinds across the front garden into the street sometimes men stopped and talked loudly there and again a rattle of drums would send me running to see the soldiers i recall that i had a poor enough notion of what the fighting was all about and no wonder but i remember chiefly my insatiable longing to escape from this prison as the great house soon became for me and i yearned with a yearning i cannot express for our cabin in the hills and the old life there  i caught glimpses of the master on occasions only and then i avoided him for i knew he had no wish to see me sometimes he would be seated in the gallery tapping his foot on the floor and sometimes pacing the garden walks with his hands opening and shutting and one night i awoke with a start and lay for a while listening until i heard something like a splash and the scraping of the bottomboards of a boat irresistibly i jumped out of bed and running to the gallery rail i saw two dark figures moving among the leaves below the next morning i came suddenly on a strange gentleman in the gallery he wore a flowered dressinggown like the one i had seen on the master and he had a jolly round face i stopped and stared  who the devil are you said he but not unkindly  my name is david trimble said i and i come from the mountains  he laughed  mr david trimblefromthemountains who the devil am i  i dont know sir and i started to go away not wishing to disturb him  avast he cried stand fast see that you remember that  im not here of my free will sir but because my father wishes it and ill betray nothing  then he stared at me  how old did you say you were he demanded  i didnt say said i  and you are of scotch descent said he  i didnt say so sir  youre a rum one said he laughing again and he disappeared into the house  that day when breed brought me my dinner on my gallery he did not speak of a visitor you may be sure i did not mention the circumstance but breed always told me the outside news  deys gittin ready fo a big fight marse dave said he mister moultrie in the fot in de bay an marse genl lee tryin for to boss him deys rebels an marse admiral parker an de kings regments fixin fo to tek de fot an den charleston dey say mister moultrie aint got no mo chance dan a treed possum  why breed i asked i had heard my father talk of englands power and might and mister moultrie seemed to me a very brave man in his little fort  why exclaimed the old negro you aint neber read no histry books i knows some of de gentlemen wid mister moultrie dey aint no soldiers some is fine gentlemen to be suah but its jist foolishness to fight dat fleet an army marse genl lee hisself he done sesso i heerd him  and hes on mister moultries side i asked  sholy said breed hes de rebel genl  then hes a knave and a coward i cried with a boys indignation where did you hear him say that i demanded incredulous of some of breeds talk  right heah in dis house he answered and quickly clapped his hand to his mouth and showed the whites of his eyes you aint agwineter tell dat marse dave  of course not said i and then i wish i could see mister moultrie in his fort and the fleet  why honey so you kin said breed  the goodnatured negro dropped his work and led the way upstairs i following expectant to the attic a rickety ladder rose to a kind of tower cupola i suppose it would be called whence the bay spread out before me like a picture the white islands edged with the whiter lacing of the waves there indeed was the fleet but far away like toy ships on the water and the bit of a fort perched on the sandy edge of an island i spent most of that day there watching anxiously for some movement but none came  that night i was again awakened and running into the gallery i heard quick footsteps in the garden then there was a lanterns flash a smothered oath and all was dark again but in the flash i had seen distinctly three figures one was breed and he held the lantern another was the master and the third a stout one muffled in a cloak i made no doubt was my jolly friend i lay long awake with a boys curiosity until presently the dawn broke and i arose and dressed and began to wander about the house no breed was sweeping the gallery nor was there any sign of the master the house was as still as a tomb and the echoes of my footsteps rolled through the halls and chambers at last prompted by curiosity and fear i sought the kitchen where i had often sat with breed as he cooked the masters dinner this was at the bottom and end of the house the great fire there was cold and the pots and pans hung neatly on their hooks untouched that day i was running through the wet garden glad to be out in the light when a sound stopped me  it was a dull roar from the direction of the bay almost instantly came another and another and then several broke together and i knew that the battle had begun forgetting for the moment my loneliness i ran into the house and up the stairs two at a time and up the ladder into the cupola where i flung open the casement and leaned out  there was the battle indeeda sight so vivid to me after all these years that i can call it again before me when i will the toy menowar with sails set ranging in front of the fort they looked at my distance to be pressed against it white puffs like cotton balls would dart one after another from a ships side melt into a cloud float over her spars and hide her from my view and then presently the roar would reach me and answering puffs along the line of the fort and i could see the mortar shells go up and up leaving a scorched trail behind curve in a great circle and fall upon the little garrison mister moultrie became a real person to me then a vivid picture in my boyish minda hero beyond all other heroes  as the sun got up in the heavens and the wind fell the cupola became a bakeoven but i scarcely felt the heat my whole soul was out in the bay pent up with the men in the fort how long could they hold out why were they not all killed by the shot that fell like hail among them yet puff after puff sprang from their guns and the sound of it was like a storm coming nearer in the heat but at noon it seemed to me as though some of the ships were sailing it was true slowly they drew away from the others and presently i thought they had stopped again surely two of them were stuck together then three were fast on a shoal boats like black bugs in the water came and went between them and the others after a long time the two that were together got apart and away but the third stayed there immovable helpless  throughout the afternoon the fight kept on the little black boats coming and going i saw a mast totter and fall on one of the ships i saw the flag shot away from the fort and reappear again but now the puffs came from her walls slowly and more slowly so that my heart sank with the setting sun and presently it grew too dark to see aught save the red flashes slowly reluctantly the noise died down until at last a great silence reigned broken only now and again by voices in the streets below me it was not until then that i realized that i had been all day without foodthat i was alone in the dark of a great house  i had never known fear in the woods at night but now i trembled as i felt my way down the ladder and groped and stumbled through the black attic for the stairs every noise i made seemed louder an hundred fold than the battle had been and when i barked my shins the pain was sharper than a knife below on the big stairway the echo of my footsteps sounded again from the empty rooms so that i was taken with a panic and fled downward sliding and falling until i reached the hall frantically as i tried i could not unfasten the bolts on the front door and so running into the drawingroom i pried open the window and sat me down in the embrasure to think and to try to quiet the thumpings of my heart  by degrees i succeeded the still air of the night and the heavy damp odors of the foliage helped me and i tried to think what was right for me to do i had promised the master not to leave the place and that promise seemed in pledge to my father surely the master would come backor breed they would not leave me here alone without food much longer although i was young i was brought up to responsibility and i inherited a conscience that has since given me much trouble  from these thoughts trying enough for a starved lad i fell to thinking of my father on the frontier fighting the cherokees and so i dozed away to dream of him i remember that he was skinning cameroni had often pictured itand cameron yelling when i was awakened with a shock by a great noise  i listened with my heart in my throat the noise seemed to come from the halla prodigious pounding presently it stopped and a mans voice cried out  ho there within  my first impulse was to answer but fear kept me still  batter down the door some one shouted  there was a sound of shuffling in the portico and the same voice  now then all together lads  then came a straining and splitting of wood and with a crash the door gave way a lanterns rays shot through the hall  the house is as dark as a tomb said a voice  and as empty i reckon said another john temple and his spy have got away  well have a search answered the first voice  they stood for a moment in the drawingroom door peering and then they entered there were five of them two looked to be gentlemen and three were of rougher appearance they carried lanterns  that windows open said one of the gentlemen they must have been here today hello whats this he started back in surprise  i slid down from the windowseat and stood facing them not knowing what else to do they too seemed equally confounded  it must be temples son said one at last i had thought the family at temple bow whats your name my lad  david trimble sir said i  and what are you doing here he asked more sternly  i was left in mr temples care by my father  oho he cried and where is your father  hes gone to fight the cherokees i answered soberly to skin a man named cameron  at that they were silent for an instant and then the two broke into a laugh  egad lowndes said the gentleman here is a fine mystery do you think the boy is lying  the other gentleman scratched his forehead  ill have you know i dont lie sir i said ready to cry  no said the other gentleman a backwoodsman named trimble went to rutledge with credentials from north carolina and has gone off to cherokee ford to join mccall  bless my soul exclaimed the first gentleman he came up and laid his hand on my shoulder and said  where is mr temple  that i dont know sir  when did he go away  i did not answer at once  that i cant tell you sir  was there any one with him  that i cant tell you sir  the devil you cant he cried taking his hand away and why not  i shook my head sorely beset  come mathews cried the gentleman called lowndes  well search first and attend to the lad after  and so they began going through the house prying into every cupboard and sweeping under every bed they even climbed to the attic and noting the open casement in the cupola mr lowndes said  some one has been here today  it was i sir i said i have been here all day  and what doing pray he demanded  watching the battle and oh sir i cried can you tell me whether mister moultrie beat the british  he did so cried mr lowndes he did and soundly  he stared at me i must have looked my pleasure  why david says he you are a patriot too  i am a rebel sir i cried hotly  both gentlemen laughed again and the men with them  the lad is a character said mr lowndes  we made our way down into the garden which they searched last at the creeks side the boat was gone and there were footsteps in the mud  the bird has flown lowndes said mr mathews  and good riddance for the committee answered that gentleman heartily he got to the fleet in fine season to get a round shot in the middle david said he solemnly remember it never pays to try to be two things at once  ill warrant he stayed below water said mr mathews  but what shall we do with the lad  ill take him to my house for the night said mr lowndes and in the morning well talk to him i reckon he should be sent to temple bow he is connected in some way with the temples  god help him if he goes there said mr mathews under his breath but i heard him  they locked up the house and left one of the men to guard it while i went with mr lowndes to his residence i remember that people were gathered in the streets as we passed making merry and that they greeted mr lowndes with respect and good cheer his house too was set in a garden and quite as fine as mr temples it was ablaze with candles and i caught glimpses of fine gentlemen and ladies in the rooms but he hurried me through the hall and into a little chamber at the rear where a writingdesk was set he turned and faced me  you must be tired david he said  i nodded  and hungry boys are always hungry  yes sir  you had no dinner  no sir i answered off my guard  mercy he said it is a long time since breakfast  i had no breakfast sir  good god he said and pulled the velvet handle of a cord a negro came  is the supper for the guests ready  yes marsa  then bring as much as you can carry here said the gentleman and ask mrs lowndes if i may speak with her  mrs lowndes came first and such a fine lady she was that she frightened me this being my first experience with ladies but when mr lowndes told her my story she ran to me impulsively and put her arms about me  poor lad she said what a shame  i think that the tears came then but it was small wonder there were tears in her eyes too  such a supper as i had i shall never forget and she sat beside me for long neglecting her guests and talking of my life suddenly she turned to her husband calling him by name  he is alec ritchies son she said and alec has gone against cameron  mr lowndes did not answer but nodded  and must he go to temple bow  my dear said mr lowndes i fear it is our duty to send him there    chapter iv temple bow  in the morning i started for temple bow on horseback behind one of mr lowndes negroes good mrs lowndes had kissed me at parting and tucked into my pocket a parcel of sweetmeats there had been a few grave gentlemen to see me and to their questions i had replied what i could but tell them of mr temple i would not save that he himself had told me nothing and mr lowndes had presently put an end to their talk  the lad knows nothing gentlemen he had said which was true  david said he when he bade me farewell i see that your father has brought you up to fear god remember that all you see in this life is not to be imitated  and so i went off behind his negro he was a merry lad and despite the great heat of the journey and my misgivings about temple bow he made me laugh i was sad at crossing the ferry over the ashley through thinking of my father but i reflected that it could not be long now ere i saw him again in the middle of the day we stopped at a tavern and at length in the abundant shade of evening we came to a pair of great ornamental gates set between brick pillars capped with white balls and turned into a drive and presently winding through the trees we were in sight of a long brick mansion trimmed with white and a velvet lawn before it all flecked with shadows in front of the portico was a saddled horse craning his long neck at two panting hounds stretched on the ground a negro boy in blue clutched the bridle on the horseblock a gentleman in white reclined he wore shiny boots and he held his hat in his hand and he was gazing up at a lady who stood on the steps above him  the lady i remember as welllord forbid that i should forget her and her laugh as i heard it that evening is ringing now in my ears and yet it was not a laugh musical it was yet there seemed no pleasure in it rather irony and a great weariness of the amusements of this world and a note too from a vanity never ruffled it stopped abruptly as the negro pulled up his horse before her and she stared at us haughtily  whats this she said  pardon mistis said the negro ise got a letter from marse lowndes  mr lowndes should instruct his niggers she said there is a servants drive the man was turning his horse when she cried hold lets have it  he dismounted and gave her the letter and i jumped to the ground watching her as she broke the seal taking her in as a boy will from the flowing skirt and tightlaced stays of her salmon silk to her high and powdered hair she must have been about thirty her face was beautiful but had no particle of expression in it and was dotted here and there with little black patches of plaster while she was reading a sober gentleman in black silkbreeches and severe coat came out of the house and stood beside her  heigho parson said the gentleman on the horseblock without moving are you to preach against loo or lansquenet tomorrow  would it make any difference to you mr riddle  before he could answer there came a great clatter behind them and a boy of my own age appeared with a leap he landed sprawling on the indolent gentlemans shoulders nearly upsetting him  you young rascal exclaimed the gentleman pitching him on the drive almost at my feet then he fell back again to a position where he could look up at the lady  harry riddle cried the boy ill ride steeplechases and beat you some day  hush nick cried the lady petulantly ill have no nerves left me she turned to the letter again holding it very near to her eyes and made a wry face of impatience then she held the sheet out to mr riddle  a pretty piece of news she said languidly read it harry  the gentleman seized her hand instead the lady glanced at the clergyman whose back was turned and shook her head  how tiresome you are she said  whats happened asked mr riddle letting go as the parson looked around  oh theyve had a battle said the lady and moultrie and his rebels have beat off the kings fleet  the devil they have exclaimed mr riddle while the parson started forwards anything more  yes a little she hesitated that husband of mine has fled charlestown they think he went to the fleet and she shot a meaning look at mr riddle who in turn flushed red i was watching them  what cried the clergyman john temple has run away  why not said mr riddle one cant live between wind and water long and charlestownsuncomfortable in summer  at that the clergyman cast one look at themsuch a look as i shall never forgetand went into the house  mamma said the boy where has father gone has he run away  yes dont bother me nick  i dont believe it cried nick his high voice shaking idid disown him  at that mr riddle burst into a hearty laugh  come nick said he it isnt so bad as that your fathers for his majesty like the rest of us hes merely gone over to fight for him and he looked at the lady and laughed again but i liked the boy  as for the lady she curled her lip mr riddle dont be foolish she said if we are to play send your horse to the stables suddenly her eye lighted on me one more brat she sighed nick take him to the nursery or the stable and both of you keep out of my sight  nick strode up to me  dont mind her shes always saying keep out of my sight his voice trembled he took me by the sleeve and began pulling me around the house and into a little summer bower that stood there for he had a masterful manner  whats your name he demanded  david trimble i said  have you seen my father in town  the intense earnestness of the question surprised an answer out of me  yes  where he demanded  in his house my father left me with your father  tell me about it  i related as much as i dared leaving out mr temples double dealing which in truth i did not understand but the boy was relentless  why said he my father was a friend of mr lowndes and mr mathews i have seen them here drinking with him and in town and he ran away  i do not know where he went said i which was the truth  he said nothing but hid his face in his arms over the rail of the bower at length he looked up at me fiercely  if you ever tell this i will kill you he cried do you hear  that made me angry  yes i hear i said but i am not afraid of you  he was at me in an instant knocking me to the floor so that the breath went out of me and was pounding me vigorously ere i recovered from the shock and astonishment of it and began to defend myself he was taller than i and wiry but not so rugged yet there was a look about him that was far beyond his strength a look that meant never say die curiously even as i fought desperately i compared him with that other lad i had known andy jackson and this one though not so powerful frightened me the more in his relentlessness  perhaps we should have been fighting still had not some one pulled us apart and when my vision cleared i saw nick struggling and kicking held tightly in the hands of the clergyman and it was all that gentleman could do to hold him i am sure it was quite five minutes before he forced the lad exhausted on to the seat and then there was a defiance about his nostrils that showed he was undefeated the clergyman still holding him with one hand took out his handkerchief with the other and wiped his brow  i expected a scolding and a sermon to my amazement the clergyman said quietly  now what was the trouble david  ill not be the one to tell it sir i said and trembled at my temerity  the parson looked at me queerly  then you are in the right of it he said it is as i thought ill not expect nicholas to tell me  i will tell you sir said nicholas he was in the house with my father whenwhen he ran away and i said that if he ever spoke of it to any one i would kill him  for a while the clergyman was silent gazing with a strange tenderness at the lad whose face was averted  and you david he said presently  ii never mean to tell sir but i was not to be frightened  quite right my lad said the clergyman so kindly that it sent a strange thrill through me nicholas looked up quickly  you wont tell he said  no i said  you can let me go now mr mason said he mr mason did and he came over and sat beside me but said nothing more  after a while mr mason cleared his throat  nicholas said he when you grow older you will understand these matters better your father went away to join the side he believes in the side we all believe inthe kings side  did he ever pretend to like the other side asked nick quickly  when you grow older you will know his motives answered the clergyman gently until then you must trust him  you never pretended cried nick  thank god i never was forced to do so said the clergyman fervently  it is wonderful that the conditions of our existence may wholly change without a seeming strangeness after many years only vivid snatches of what i saw and heard and did at temple bow come back to me i understood but little the meaning of the seigniorial life there my chief wonder now is that its golden surface was not more troubled by the winds then brewing it was a new life to me one that i had not dreamed of  after that first falling out nick and i became inseparable far slower than he in my likes and dislikes he soon became a passion with me even as a boy he did everything with a grace unsurpassed the dash and daring of his pranks took ones breath his generosity to those he loved was prodigal nor did he ever miss a chance to score those under his displeasure at times he was reckless beyond words to describe and again he would fall sober for a day he could be cruel and tender in the same hour abandoned and freezing in his dignity he had an old negro mammy whose worship for him and his possessions was idolatry i can hear her now calling and calling marse nick honey yo suppers done got cole as she searched patiently among the magnolias and suddenly there would be a shout and mammys turban go flying from her woolly head or mammy herself would be dragged down from behind and sat upon  we had our supper nick and i at twilight in the childrens dining room a little white room unevenly panelled the silver candlesticks and yellow flames fantastically reflected in the mirrors between the deep windows and the moths and junebugs tilting at the lights we sat at a little mahogany table eating porridge and cream from round blue bowls with mammy to wait on us sometimes there floated in upon us the hum of revelry from the great drawingroom where madame had her company often the good mr mason would come in to us he cared little for the parties and talk to us of our days doings nick had his lessons from the clergyman in the winter time  mr mason took occasion once to question me on what i knew some of my answers in especial those relating to my knowledge of the bible surprised him others made him sad  david said he you are an earnest lad with a head to learn and you will when your father comes i shall talk with him he pausedi knew him said he i knew him ere you were born a just man and upright but with a great sorrow we must never be hasty in our judgments but you will never be hasty david he added smiling at me you are a good companion for nicholas  nicholas and i slept in the same bedroom at a corner of the long house and far removed from his mother she would not be disturbed by the noise he made in the mornings i remember that he had cut in the solid shutters of that room folded into the embrasures nicholas temple his mark and a long flat sword the first night in that room we slept but little near the whole of it being occupied with tales of my adventures and of my life in the mountains over and over again i must tell him of the painters and wildcats of deer and bear and wolf nor was he ever satisfied and at length i came to speak of that land where i had often lived in fancythe land beyond the mountains of which daniel boone had told of its forest and glade its countless herds of elk and buffalo its saltlicks and indians until we fell asleep from sheer exhaustion  i will go there he cried in the morning as he hurried into his clothes i will go to that land as sure as my name is nick temple and you shall go with me david  perchance i shall go before you i answered though i had small hopes of persuading my father  he would often make his exit by the window climbing down into the garden by the protruding bricks at the corner of the house or sometimes go shouting down the long halls and through the gallery to the great stairway a smothered oath from behind the closed bedroom doors proclaiming that he had waked a guest and many days we spent in the wood playing at hunting gamea poor enough amusement for me and one that nick soon tired of they were thick wet woods unlike our woods of the mountains and more than once we had excitement enough with the snakes that lay there  i believe that in a weeks time nick was as conversant with my life as i myself for he made me tell of it again and again and of kentucky and always as he listened his eyes would glow and his breast heave with excitement  do you think your father will take you there david when he comes for you  i hoped so but was doubtful  ill run away with you he declared there is no one here who cares for me save mr mason and mammy  and i believe he meant it he saw but little of his mother and nearly always something unpleasant was coupled with his views sometimes we ran across her in the garden paths walking with a gallantoftenest mr riddle it was a beautiful garden with hedgebordered walks and flowers wondrously massed in color a high brick wall surrounding it frequently mrs temple and mr riddle would play at cards there of an afternoon and when that musical unbelieving laugh of hers came floating over the wall nick would say  mamma is winning  once we heard high words between the two and running into the garden found the cards scattered on the grass and the couple gone  of all nicks escapadesand he was continually in and out of themi recall only a few of the more serious as i have said he was a wild lad sobered by none of the things which had gone to make my life and what he took into his head to do he generally didor if balked flew into such a rage as to make one believe he could not live life was always war with him or some semblance of a struggle of his many wild doings i recall well the time whenfired by my tales of huntinghe went out to attack the young bull in the paddock with a bow and arrow it made small difference to the bull that the arrow was too blunt to enter his hide with a bellow that frightened the idle negroes at the slave quarters he started for master nick i who had been taught by my father never to run any unnecessary risk had taken the precaution to provide as large a stone as i could comfortably throw and took station on the fence as the furious animal came charging with his head lowered i struck him by a good fortune between the eyes and nicholas got over we were standing on the far side watching him pawing the broken bow when in the crowd of frightened negroes we discovered the parson beside us  david said he patting me with a shaking hand i perceive that you have a cool head our young friend here has a hot one dr johnson may not care for scotch blood and yet i think a wee bit of it is not to be despised  i wondered whether dr johnson was staying in the house too  how many slaves there were at temple bow i know not but we used to see them coming home at night in droves the overseers riding beside them with whips and guns one day a huge congo chief not long from africa nearly killed an overseer and escaped to the swamp as the day fell we heard the baying of the bloodhounds hot upon his trail more ominous still a sound like a rising wind came from the direction of the quarters into our little diningroom burst mrs temple herself slamming the door behind her mr mason who was sitting with us rose to calm her  the rebels she cried the rebels have taught them this with their accursed notions of liberty and equality we shall all be murdered by the blacks because of the rebels oh hellfire is too good for them have the house barred and a watch set tonight what shall we do  i pray you compose yourself madame said the clergyman we can send for the militia  the militia she shrieked the rebel militia they would murder us as soon as the niggers  they are respectable men answered mr mason and were at fanning hall today patrolling  i would rather be killed by whites than blacks said the lady but who is to go for the militia  i will ride for them said mr mason it was a dark lowering night and spitting rain  and leave me defenceless she cried you do not stir sir  it is a pity said mr masonhe was goaded to it i supposetis a pity mr riddle did not come tonight  she shot at him a withering look for even in her fear she would brook no liberties nick spoke up  i will go said he i can get through the woods to fanning hall  and i will go with him i said  let the brats go she said and cut short mr masons expostulations she drew nick to her and kissed him he wriggled away and without more ado we climbed out of the diningroom windows into the night running across the lawn we left the lights of the great house twinkling behind us in the rain we had to pass the long line of cabins at the quarters three overseers with lanterns stood guard there the cabins were dark the wretches within silent and cowed thence we felt with our feet for the path across the fields stumbled over a sty and took our way through the black woods i was at home here and nick was not to be frightened at intervals the mournful bay of a bloodhound came to us from a distance  suppose we should meet the congo chief said nick suddenly  the idea had occurred to me  she neednt have been so frightened said he in scornful remembrance of his mothers actions  we pressed on nick knew the path as only a boy can half an hour passed it grew brighter the rain ceased and a new moon shot out between the leaves i seized his arm  whats that i whispered  a deer  but i cradled in woodcraft had heard plainly a man creeping through the underbrush beside us fear of the congo chief and pity for the wretch tore at my heart suddenly there loomed in front of us on the path a great naked man we stood with useless limbs staring at him  then from the trees over our heads came a chittering and a chattering such as i had never heard the big man before us dropped to the earth his head bowed muttering as for me my fright increased the chattering stopped and nick stepped forward and laid his hand on the negros bare shoulder  we neednt be afraid of him now davy he said i learned that trick from a portuguese overseer we had last year  you did it i exclaimed my astonishment overcoming my fear  its the way the monkeys chatter in the canaries he said manuel had a tame one and i heard it talk once before i tried it on the chief and he fell down he thinks im a god  it must have been a weird scene to see the great negro following two boys in the moonlight indeed he came after us like a dog at length we were in sight of the lights of fanning hall the militia was there we were challenged by the guard and caused sufficient amazement when we appeared in the hall before the master who was a bachelor of fifty  sblood nick temple he cried what are you doing here with that big congo for a dog the sight of him frightens me  the negro indeed was a sight to frighten one the black mud of the swamps was caked on him and his flesh was torn by brambles  he ran away said nick and i am taking him home  youyou are taking him home sputtered mr fanning  do you want to see him act said nick and without waiting for a reply he filled the hall with a dozen monkeys mr fanning leaped back into a doorway but the chief prostrated himself on the floor now do you believe i can take him home said nick  swounds said mr fanning when he had his breath you beat the devil nicholas temple the next time you come to call i pray you leave your travelling show at home  mamma sent me for the militia said nick  she did said mr fanning looking grim an insurrection is a bad thing but there was no danger for two lads in the woods i suppose  theres no danger anyway said nick the niggers are all scared to death  mr fanning burst out into a loud laugh stopped suddenly sat down and took nick on his knee it was an incongruous scene mr fanning almost cried  bless your soul he said but you are a lad would to god i had you instead of  he paused abruptly  i must go home said nick she will be worried  she will be worried cried mr fanning in a burst of anger then he said you shall have the militia you shall have the militia he rang a bell and sent his steward for the captain a gawky country farmer who gave a gasp when he came upon the scene in the hall  and mind said nick to the captain you are to keep your men away from him or he will kill one of them  the captain grinned at him curiously  i reckon i wont have to tell them to keep away said he  mr fanning started us off for the walk with pockets filled with sweetmeats which we nibbled on the way back we made a queer procession nick and i striding ahead to show the path followed by the now servile chief and after him the captain and his twenty men in single file it was midnight when we saw the lights of temple bow through the trees one of the tired overseers met us near the kitchen when he perceived the congo his face lighted up with rage and he instinctively reached for his whip but the chief stood before him immovable with arms folded and a look on his face that meant danger  he will kill you emory said nick he will kill you if you touch him  emory dropped his hand limply  he will go to work in the morning said nick but mind you not a lash  very good master nick said the man but whos to get him in his cabin  i will said nick he beckoned to the congo who followed him over to quarters and went in at his door without a protest  the next morning mrs temple looked out of her window and saw the militiamen on the lawn  pooh she said are those butternuts the soldiers that nick went to fetch    chapter v crams hell  after that my admiration for nick temple increased greatly whether excited by his courage and presence of mind or his ability to imitate men and women and creatures i know not one of our amusements i recall was to go to the congos cabin to see him fall on his face until mr mason put a stop to it the clergyman let us know that we were encouraging idolatry and he himself took the chief in hand  another incident comes to me from those bygone days the fear of negro insurrections at the neighboring plantations being temporarily lulled the gentry began to pluck up courage for their usual amusements there were to be races at some place a distance away and nick was determined to go had he not determined that i should go all would have been well the evening before he came upon his mother in the garden strange to say she was in a gracious mood and alone  come and kiss me nick she said now what do you want  i want to go to the races he said  you have your pony you can follow the coach  david is to ride the pony said nick generously may i go in the coach  no she said there is no room for you  nicholas flared up harry riddle is going in the coach i dont see why you cant take me sometimes you like him better than me  the lady flushed very red  how dare you nick she cried angrily what has mr mason been putting into your head  nothing said nick quite as angrily any one can see that you like harry and i will ride in the coach  youll not said his mother  i had heard nothing of this the next morning he led out his pony from the stables for me to ride and insisted and supposing he was to go in the coach i put foot in the stirrup the little beast would scarce stand still for me to mount  youll not need the whip with her said nick and led her around by the side of the house in view of the portico and stood there at her bridle presently with a great noise and clatter of hoofs the coach rounded the drive the powdered negro coachman pulling up the four horses with much ceremony at the door it was a wondrous great vehicle the bright colors of its body flashing in the morning light i had examined it more than once and with awe in the coachhouse it had glass windows and a lion on a blue shield on the door and within it was all salmon silk save the painted design on the ceiling great leather straps held up this house on wheels to take the jolts of the road and behind it was a platform that morning two young negroes with flowing blue coats stood on it they leaped to the ground when the coach stopped and stood each side of the door waiting for my lady to enter  she came down the steps laughing with mr riddle who was in his riding clothes for he was to race that day he handed her in and got in after her the coachman cracked his whip the coach creaked off down the drive i in the trees one side waiting for them to pass and wondering what nick was to do he had let go my bridle folded his whip in his hand and with a shout of come on davy he ran for the coach which was going slowly caught hold of the footmans platform and pulled himself up  what possessed the footman i know not perchance fear of his mistress was greater than fear of his young master but he took the lad by the shouldersgently to be sureand pushed him into the road where he fell and rolled over i guessed what would happen picking himself up nick was at the man like a hurricane seizing him swiftly by the leg the negro fell upon the platform clutching wildly where he lay in a sheer fright shrieking for mercy his cries rivalled by those of the lady within the coachman frantically pulled his horses to a stand the other footman jumped off and mr harry riddle came flying out of the coach door to behold nicholas beating the negro with his ridingwhip  you young devil cried mr riddle angrily striding forward what are you doing  keep off harry said nicholas i am teaching this nigger that he is not to lay hands on his betters with that he gave the boy one more cut and turned from him contemptuously  what is it harry came in a shrill voice from within the coach  its nicks pranks said mr riddle grinning in spite of his anger hes ruined one of your footmen you little scoundrel cried mr riddle advancing again youve frightened your mother nearly to a swoon  serves her right said nick  what cried mr riddle come down from there instantly  nick raised his whip it was not that that stopped mr riddle but a sign about the lads nostrils  harry riddle said the boy if it werent for you id be riding in this coach today with my mother i dont want to ride with her but i will go to the races if you try to take me down ill do my best to kill you and he lifted the loaded end of the whip  mrs temples beautiful face had by this time been thrust out of the door  for the love of heaven harry let him come in with us were late enough as it is  mr riddle turned on his heel he tried to glare at nick but he broke into a laugh instead  come down satan says he god help the woman you love and the man you fight  and so nicholas jumped down and into the coach the footman picked himself up more scared than injured and the vehicle took its lumbering way for the racecourse i following  i have seen many courses since but none to equal that in the gorgeous dress of those who watched there had been many many more in former years so i heard people say this was the only sign that a war was in progressthe scanty number of gentry presentfor all save the indifferent were gone to charlestown or elsewhere i recall it dimly as a blaze of color passing merrymaking jesting feastinga rare contrast i thought to the sight i had beheld in charlestown bay but a while before yet so runs the worldstrife at one mans home and peace and contentment at his neighbors sorrow here and rejoicing not a league away  master nicholas played one prank that evening that was near to costing dear my lady temple made up a party for temple bow at the course two other coaches to come and some gentlemen riding as nick and i were running through the paddock we came suddenly upon mr harry riddle and a stout swarthy gentleman standing together the stout gentleman was counting out big gold pieces in his hand and giving them to mr riddle  lucky dog said the stout gentleman youll ride back with her and youve won all ive got and he dug mr riddle in the ribs  youll have it again when we play tonight darnley answered mr riddle crossly and as for the seat in the coach you are welcome to it that firebrand of a lad is on the front seat  dn the lad said the stout gentleman ill take it and you can ride my horse hellhell carry you i reckon his voice had a way of cracking into a mellow laugh  at that mr riddle went off in a towering bad humor and afterwards i heard him cursing the stout gentlemans black groom as he mounted his great horse and then he cursed the horse as it reared and plunged while the stout gentleman stood at the coach door cackling at his discomfiture the gentleman did ride home with mrs temple nick going into another coach i afterwards discovered that the gentleman had bribed him with a guinea and mr riddle more than once came near running down my pony on his big charger and he swore at me roundly too  that night there was a gay supper party in the big dining room at temple bow nick and i looked on from the gallery window it was a pretty sight the long mahogany board reflecting the yellow flames of the candles and spread with bright silver and shining dishes loaded with dainties the gentlemen and ladies in brilliant dress the hurrying servantsall were of a new and strange world to me and presently after the ladies were gone the gentlemen tossed off their wine and roared over their jokes and followed into the drawingroom this i noticed that only mr harry riddle sat silent and morose and that he had drunk more than the others  come davy said nick to me lets go and watch them again  but how i asked for the drawingroom windows were up some distance from the ground and there was no gallery on that side  ill show you said he running into the garden after searching awhile in the dark he found a ladder the gardener had left against a tree after much straining we carried the ladder to the house and set it up under one of the windows of the drawingroom then we both clambered cautiously to the top and looked in  the company were at cards silent save for a low remark now and again the little tables were ranged along by the windows and it chanced that mr harry riddle sat so close to us that we could touch him on his right sat mr darnley the stout gentleman and in the other seats two ladies between mr riddle and mr darnley was a pile of silver and gold pieces there was not room for two of us in comfort at the top of the ladder so i gave place to nick and sat on a lower rung presently i saw him raise himself reach in and duck quickly  feel that he whispered to me chuckling and holding out his hand  it was full of money  but thats stealing nick i said frightened  of course ill give it back he whispered indignantly  instantly there came loud words and the scraping of chairs within the room and a womans scream i heard mr riddles voice say thickly amid the silence that followed  mr darnley youre a dd thief sir  you shall answer for this when you are sober sir said mr darnley  then there came more scraping of chairs all the company talking excitedly at once nick and i scrambled to the ground and we did the very worst thing we could possibly have donewe took the ladder away  there was little sleep for me that night i had first of all besought nick to go up into the drawingroom and give the money back but some strange obstinacy in him resisted  twill serve harry well for what he did today said he  my next thought was to find mr mason but he was gone up the river to visit a sick parishioner i had seen enough of the world to know that gentlemen fought for less than what had occurred in the drawingroom that evening and though i had neither love nor admiration for mr riddle and though the stout gentleman was no friend of mine i cared not to see either of them killed for a prank but nick would not listen to me and went to sleep in the midst of my urgings  davy said he pinching me do you know what you are  no said i  youre a granny he said and that was the last word i could get out of him but i lay awake a long time thinking breed had whiled away for me one hot morning in charlestown with an account of the gentry and their doings many of which he related in an awed whisper that i could not understand they were wild doings indeed to me but strangest of all seemed the duels conducted with a decorum and ceremony as rigorous as the law  did you ever see a duel breed i had asked  yessah said breed dramatically rolling the whites of his eyes  where  whah down on de riveh bank at temple bow in de ealy monin dey mos commonly fights at de dawn  breed had also told me where he was in hiding at the time and that was what troubled me try as i would i could not remember it had sounded like clam shell that i recalled and how breed had looked out at the swordplay through the cracks of the closed shutters agonized between fear of ghosts within and the drama without at the first faint light that came into our window i awakened nick  listen i said do you know a place called clam shell  he turned over but i punched him persistently until he sat up  what the deuce ails you davy he asked rubbing his eyes have you nightmare  do you know a place called clam shell down on the river bank nick  why he replied you must be thinking of crams hell  whats that i asked  its a house that used to belong to cram who was an overseer the niggers hated him and he was killed in bed by a big black nigger chief from africa the niggers wont go near the place they say its haunted  get up said i were going there now  nick sprang out of bed and began to get into his clothes  is it a game he asked  yes he was always ready for a game  we climbed out of the window and made our way in the mist through the long wet grass nick leading he took a path through a dark forest swamp over logs that spanned the stagnant waters and at length just as the mist was growing pearly in the light we came out at a tumbledown house that stood in an open glade by the rivers bank  whats to do now said nick  we must get into the house i answered but i confess i didnt care for the looks of it  nick stared at me  very good davy he said ill follow where you go  it was a saturday morning why i recall this i do not know it has no special significance  i tried the door with a groan and a shriek it gave way disclosing the blackness inside we started back involuntarily i looked at nick and nick at me he was very pale and so must i have been but such was the respect we each held for the others courage that neither dared flinch and so i walked in although it seemed as if my shirt was made of needle points and my hair stood on end the crackings of the old floor were to me like the shots in charlestown bay our hearts beating wildly we made our way into a farther room it was like walking into the beyond  is there a window here i asked nick my voice sounding like a shout  yes ahead of us  groping for it i suddenly received a shock that set me reeling human nature could stand no more we both turned tail and ran out of the house as fast as we could and stood in the wet grass panting then shame came  lets open the window first i suggested so we walked around the house and pried the solid shutter from its fastenings then gathering our courage we went in again at the door in the dim light let into the farther room we saw a fourposter bed old and cheap with ragged curtains it was this that i had struck in my groping  the chief killed cram there said nick in an awed voice in that bed what do you want to do here davy  wait i said though i had as little mind to wait as ever in my life stand here by the window  we waited there the mist rose the sun peeped over the bank of dense green forest and spread rainbow colors on the still waters of the river now and again a fish broke or a great bird swooped down and slit the surface a faroff snatch of melody came to our earsthe slaves were going to work nothing more and little by little grave misgivings gnawed at my soul of the wisdom of coming to this place doubtless there were many other spots  davy said nick at last im sorry i took that money what are we here for  hush i whispered do you hear anything  i did and distinctly for i had been brought up in the forest  i hear voices he said presently coming this way  they were very clear to me by then emerging from the forest path were five gentlemen the leader more plainly dressed than the others carried a leather case behind him was the stout figure of mr darnley his face solemn and last of all came mr harry riddle very pale but cutting the tops of the long grass with a switch nick seized my arm  they are going to fight said he  yes i replied and we are here to stop them now  no not now he said holding me still well have some more fun out of this yet  fun i echoed  yes he said excitedly leave it to me i shant let them fight  and that instant we changed generals david giving place to nicholas  mr riddle retired with one gentleman to a side of the little patch of grass and mr darnley and a friend to another the fifth gentleman took a position halfway between the two and opening the leather case laid it down on the grass where its contents glistened  thats dr ball whispered nick and his voice shook with excitement  mr riddle stripped off his coat and waistcoat and ruffles and his swordbelt and mr darnley did the same both gentlemen drew their swords and advanced to the middle of the lawn and stood opposite one another with flowing linen shirts open at the throat and bared heads they were indeed a contrast mr riddle tall and white with closed lips glared at his opponent mr darnley cut a merrier figurerotund and flushed with fat calves and short arms though his countenance was sober enough all at once the two were circling their swords in the air and then nick had flung open the shutter and leaped through the window and was running and shouting towards the astonished gentlemen all of whom wheeled to face him he jingled as he ran  what in the devils name now cried mr riddle angrily heres this imp again  nicholas stopped in front of him and thrusting his hand in his breeches pocket fished out a handful of gold and silver which he held out to the confounded mr riddle  harry said he heres something of yours i found last night  you found echoed mr riddle in a strange voice amidst a dead silence you found where  on the table beside you  and where the deuce were you mr riddle demanded  in the window behind you said nick calmly  this piece of information to mr riddles plain discomfiture was greeted with a roar of laughter mr darnley himself laughing loudest nor were these gentlemen satisfied with that they crowded around mr riddle and slapped him on the back mr darnley joining in with the rest and presently mr riddle flung away his sword and laughed too giving his hand to mr darnley  at length mr darnley turned to nick who had stood all this while behind them unmoved  my friend said he seriously such is your regard for human life you will probably one daybe a pirate or an outlaw this time weve had a laugh the next time somebody will be weeping i wish i were your father  i wish you were said nick  this took mr darnleys breath he glanced at the other gentlemen who returned his look significantly he laid his hand kindly on the lads head  nick said he i wish to god i were your father  after that they all went home very merry to breakfast nick and i coming after them nick was silent until we reached the house  davy said he then how old are you  ten i answered how old did you believe me  eighty said he  the next day being sunday we all gathered in the little church to hear mr mason preach nick and i sat in the high box pew of the family with mrs temple who paid not the least attention to the sermon as for me the rhythm of it held me in fascination mr mason had written it out and that afternoon read over this part of it to nick the quotation i recall having since read it many times and the gist of it was in this wise  and he said unto him what thou wilt have thou wilt have despite the sin of it blessed are the stolid and thrice cursed he who hath imaginationfor that imagination shall devour him and in thy life a sin shall be presented unto thee with a great longing god who is in heaven gird thee for that struggle my son for it will surely come that it may be said of you behold i have refined thee but not with silver i have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction seven days shalt thou wrestle with thy soul seven nights shall evil haunt thee and how thou shalt come forth from that struggle no man may know    chapter vi man proposes but god disposes  a week passed and another sunday camea sunday so still and hot and moist that steam seemed to rise from the heavy treesan idle day for master and servant alike a hush was in the air and a presage of we knew not what it weighed upon my spirits and even nicks and we wandered restlessly under the trees seeking for distraction  about two oclock a black line came on the horizon and slowly crept higher until it broke into giant fantastic shapes mutterings arose but the sun shone hot as ever  were to have a hurricane said nick i wish we might have it and be done with it  at five the sun went under i remember that madame was lolling listless in the garden daintily arrayed in fine linen trying to talk to mr mason when a sound startled us it was the sound of swift hoof beats on the soft drive  mrs temple got up an unusual thing perchance she was expecting a message from some of the gentlemen or else she may well have been tired of mr mason nick and i were before her and running through the house arrived at the portico in time to see a negro ride up on a horse covered with lather  it was the same negro who had fetched me hither from mr lowndes and when i saw him my heart stood still lest he had brought news of my father  whats to do boy cried nicholas to him  the boy held in his hand a letter with a great red seal  fo mistis temple he said and looking at me queerly he took off his cap as he jumped from the horse mistress temple herself having arrived he handed her the letter she took it and broke the seal carelessly  oh she said its only from mr lowndes i wonder what he wishes now  every moment of her reading was for me an agony and she read slowly the last words she spoke aloud  if you do not wish the lad send him to me as kate is very fond of him so kate is very fond of him she repeated and handing the letter to mr mason she added tell him parson  the words burned into my soul and seared it and to this day i tremble with anger as i think of them the scene comes before me the sky the darkened portico and nicholas running after his mother crying oh mamma how could you how could you  mr mason bent over me in compassion and smoothed my hair  david said he in a thick voice you are a brave boy david you will need all your courage now my son may god keep your nature sweet  he led me gently into the arbor and told me how under captain baskin the detachment had been ambushed by the cherokees and how my father with ensign calhoun and another had been killed fighting bravely the rest of the company had cut their way through and reached the settlements after terrible hardships  i was left an orphan  i shall not dwell here on the bitterness of those moments we have all known sorrows in our livesgreat sorrows the clergyman was a wise man and did not strive to comfort me with words but he sat there under the leaves with his arm about me until a blinding bolt split the blackness of the sky and the thunder rent our ears and a caribbean storm broke over temple bow with all the fury of the tropics then he led me through the drenching rain into the house nor heeded the wet himself on his sunday coat  a great anger stayed me in my sorrow i would no longer tarry under mrs temples roof though the world without were a sea or a desert the one resolution to escape rose stronger and stronger within me and i determined neither to eat nor sleep until i had got away the thought of leaving nick was heavy indeed and when he ran to me in the dark hall and threw his arms around me it needed all my strength to keep from crying aloud  davy he said passionately davy you mustnt mind what she says she never means anything she saysshe never cares for anything save her pleasure you and i will stay here until we are old enough to run away to kentucky davy answer me davy  i could not try as i would there were no words that would come with honesty but i pulled him down on the mahogany settle near the door which led into the back gallery and there we sat huddled together in silence while the storm raged furiously outside and the draughts banged the great doors of the house in the lightning flashes i saw nicks face and it haunted me afterwards through many years of wandering on it was written a sorrow for me greater than my own sorrow for god had given to this lad every human passion and compassion  the storm rolled away with the night and mammy came through the hall with a candle  whah is you marse nick whah is you honey you suppahs ready  and so we went into our little dining room but i would not eat the good old negress brushed her eyes with her apron as she pressed a cake upon me she had made herself for she had grown fond of me and presently we went away silently to bed  it was a long long time before nicks breathing told me that he was asleep he held me tightly clutched to him and i know that he feared i would leave him the thought of going broke my heart but i never once wavered in my resolve and i lay staring into the darkness pondering what to do i thought of good mr lowndes and his wife and i decided to go to charlestown some of my boyish motives come back to me now i should be near nick and even at that agehaving lived a life of selfreliancei thought of gaining an education and of rising to a place of trust yes i would go to mr lowndes and ask him to let me work for him and so earn my education  with a heavy spirit i crept out of bed slowly disengaging nicks arm lest he should wake he turned over and sighed in his sleep carefully i dressed myself and after i was dressed i could not refrain from slipping to the bedside to bend over him once againfor he was the only one in my life with whom i had found true companionship then i climbed carefully out of the window and so down the corner of the house to the ground  it was starlight and a waning moon hung in the sky i made my way through the drive between the black shadows of the forest and came at length to the big gates at the entrance locked for the night a strange thought of their futility struck me as i climbed the rail fence beside them and pushed on into the main road the mud sucking under my shoes as i went as i try now to cast my memory back i can recall no fear only a vast sense of loneliness and the very song of it seemed to be sung in never ending refrain by the insects of the night i had been alone in the mountains before i have crossed great strips of wilderness since but always there was love to go back to then i was leaving the only being in the world that remained to me  i must have walked two hours or more before i came to the mire of a crossroad and there i stood in a quandary of doubt as to which side led to charlestown  as i lingered a light began to tremble in the heavens a cock crew in the distance i sat down on a fallen log to rest but presently as the light grew i heard shouts which drew nearer and deeper and brought me to my feet in an uncertainty of expectation next came the rattling of chains the scramble of hoofs in the mire and here was a wagon with a big canvas cover beside the straining horses was a great burly man with a red beard cracking his long whip and calling to the horses in a strange tongue he stopped still beside his panting animals when he saw me his high boots sunk in the mud  gut morning poy he said wiping his red face with his sleeve what you do here  i am going to charlestown i answered  ach he cried dot is pad mein poy he run avay you are ein gut poy i know i vill pay ein gut price to help me vit mein wagonja  where are you going i demanded with a sudden wavering  up countrypack country you know der proad riveryes  no i did not but a longing came upon me for the old backwoods life with its freedom and selfreliance and a hatred for this steaming country of heat and violent storms and artificiality and pomp and i had a desire even at that age to make my own way in the world  what will you give me i asked  at that he put his finger to his nose  thruppence py the day  i shook my head he looked at me queerly  how old you petwelve yes  now i had no notion of telling him so i said is this the charlestown road  fourpence he cried dot is riches  i will go for sixpence i answered  mein gott he cried sixpence dot is robbery but seeing me obdurate he added i vill give it because ein poy i must have vat is your nametavid you are ein sharp poy tavid  and so i went with him  in writing a biography the relative value of days and years should hold there are days which count in space for years and years for days i spent the time on the whole happily with this dutchman whose name was hans koppel he talked merrily save when he spoke of the war against england and then contemptuously for he was a bitter english partisan and in contrast to this he would dwell for hours on a king he called friedrich der grosse and a war he waged that was a war and how this mighty king had fought a mighty queen at rossbach and leuthen in his own countrybattles that were battles  and you were there hans i asked him once  ja he said but i did not stay  you ran away  ja hans would answer laughing run avay i love peace tavid dot is vy i come here and now bitterly and now ve haf var again once  i would say nothing but i must have looked my disapproval for he went on to explain that in saxegotha where he was born men were made to fight whether they would or no and they were stolen from their wives at night by soldiers of the great king or lured away by fair promises  travelling with incredible slowness in due time we came to a county called orangeburg where all were dutchmen like hans and very few spoke english and they all thought like hans and loved peace and hated the congress on sundays as we lay over at the taverns these would be filled with a rollicking crowd of fiddlers and dancers quaintly dressed the women bringing their children and babies at such times hans would be drunk and i would have to feed the tired horses and mount watch over the cargo i had many adventures but none worth the telling here and at length we came to hanss farm in a prettily rolling country on the broad river hanss wife spoke no english at all nor did the brood of children running about the house i had small fancy for staying in such a place and so hans paid me two crowns for my three weeks service i think with real regret for labor was scarce in those parts and though i was young i knew how to work and i could at least have guided his plough in the furrow and cared for his cattle  it was the first money i had earned in my life and a prouder day than many i have had since  for the convenience of travellers passing that way hans kept a tavernif it could have been dignified by such a name it was in truth merely a log house with shakedowns and stood across the rude road from his log farmhouse and he gave me leave to sleep there and to work for my board until i cared to leave it so chanced that on the second day after my arrival a packtrain came along guided by a nettlesome old man and a strong blackhaired lass of sixteen or thereabouts the old man whose name was ripley wore a nutbrown hunting shirt trimmed with red cotton and he had no sooner slipped the packs from his horses than he began to rail at hans who stood looking on  you damned dutchmen be all tories and worse he cried you stay here and till your farms while our boys are off in the hill towns fighting cherokees i wish the devils had every one of your fat sculps polly ann water the nags  hans replied to this sally with great vigor lapsing into dutch polly ann led the scrawny ponies to the trough but her eyes snapped with merriment as she listened she was a wonderfully comely lass despite her loose cotton gown and pokebonnet and the shoepacks on her feet she had blue eyes the whitest strongest of teeth and the rosiest of faces  granpa hates a dutchman wussn pizen she said to me so do i weve all been burned out and sculped up riverand they never give us so much as a man or a measure of corn  i helped her feed the animals and tether them and loose their bells for the night and carry the packs under cover  all the boys is gone to join rutherford and lam the indians she continued so granpa and i had to go to the settlements there wahnt any one else whats your name she demanded suddenly  i told her  she sat down on a log at the corner of the house and pulled me down beside her  and whar be you from  i told her it was impossible to look into her face and not tell her she listened eagerly now with compassion and now showing her white teeth in amusement and when i had done much to my discomfiture she seized me in her strong arms and kissed me  poor davy she cried you aint got a home you shall come home with us  catching me by the hand she ran like a deer across the road to where her grandfather was still quarrelling violently with hans and pulled him backward by the skirts of his hunting shirt i looked for another and mightier explosion from the old backwoodsman but to my astonishment he seemed to forget hanss existence and turned and smiled on her benevolently  polly ann said he what be you about now  granpa said she heres davy trimble whos a good boy and his pa is just killed by the cherokees along with baskin and he wants work and a home and hes comin along with us  all right david answered mr ripley mildly ef polly ann says so you kin come whar was you raised  i told him on the upper yadkin  you dont tell me said he did ye ever know danl boone  i did indeed sir i answered my face lighting up can you tell me where he is now  hes gone to kaintuckee them new settlements fer good and ef i wasnt eighty years old id go thar too  i reckon ill go thar when im married said polly ann and blushed redder than ever drawing me to her she said ill take you too davy  when you marry that wuthless tom mcchesney said her grandfather testily  hes not wuthless said polly hotly hes the best man in rutherfords army hell git more sculps then any of emyou see  tavy is ein gut poy hans put in for he had recovered his composure i wish much he stay mit me  as for me polly ann never consulted me on the subjectnor had she need to i would have followed her to kingdom come and at the thought of reaching the mountains my heart leaped with joy we all slept in the one fleainfested windowless room of the tavern that night and before dawn i was up and untethered the horses and polly ann and i together lifted the two bushels of alum salt on one of the beasts and the ploughshare on the other by daylight we had left hans and his farm forever  i can see the lass now as she strode along the trace by the flowing river through sunlight and shadow straight and supple and strong sometimes she sang like a bird and the forest rang sometimes she would make fun of her grandfather or of me and again she would be silent for an hour at a time staring ahead and then i knew she was thinking of that tom mcchesney she would wake from those reveries with a laugh and give me a push to send me rolling down a bank  whats the matter davy you look as solemn as a woodowl what a little wiseacre you be  once i retorted you were thinking of that tom mcchesney  ay that she was ill warrant snapped her grandfather  polly ann replied with a merry peal of laughter you are both jealous of tomboth of you but davy when you see him youll love him as much as i do  ill not i said sturdily  hes a man to look upon  hes a riproarer old man ripley put in yere daft about him  that i am said polly flushing and subsiding but hell not know it  as we rose into the more rugged country we passed more than one charred cabin that told its silent story of indian massacre only on the scattered hill farms women and boys and old men were working in the fields all save the scalawags having gone to join rutherford there were plenty of these around the taverns to make eyes at polly ann and open love to her had she allowed them but she treated them in return to such scathing tirades that they were glad to desistall but one he must have been an escaped redemptioner for he wore jauntily a swanskin threecornered hat and stained breeches of a fine cloth he was a bold vain fellow  my beauty says he as we sat at supper silver and wedgwood better become you than pewter and a trencher  and i reckon a rope would sit better on your neck than a ruff retorted polly ann while the company shouted with laughter but he was not the kind to become discomfited  id give a guinea to see you in silk but i vow your hair looks better as it is  not so yours said she like lightning twould look better to me hanging on the belt of one of them red devils  in the morning when he would have lifted the pack of alum salt polly ann gave him a push that sent him sprawling but she did it in such good nature withal that the fellow mistook her he scrambled to his feet flung his arm about her waist and kissed her whereupon i hit him with a sapling and he staggered and let her go  you imp of hell he cried rubbing the bump he made a vicious dash at me that boded no good but i slipped behind the hominy block and polly ann who was like a panther on her feet dashed at him and gave him a buffet in the cheek that sent him reeling again  after that we were more devoted friends than ever  we travelled slowly day by day until i saw the mountains lift blue against the western sky and the sight of them was like home once more i loved them and though i thought with sadness of my father i was on the whole happier with polly ann than i had been in the lonely cabin on the yadkin her spirits flagged a little as she drew near home but old mr ripleys rose  theres burrs he would say and oharas and williamsons marking the cabins set amongst the stumpdotted cornfields and thar sweeping his hand at a blackened heap of logs lying on the stones thars whar nell tyler and her baby was sculped  poor nell said polly ann the tears coming into her eyes as she turned away  and jim tyler was killed gittin to the fort he cant say i didnt warn him  i reckon hell never say nuthin now said polly ann  it was in truth a dismal sightthe shapeless timbers the corn planted with such care choked with weeds and the poor utensils of the little family scattered and broken before the doorsill these same indians had killed my father and there surged up in my breast that hatred of the painted race felt by every backwoods boy in my time  towards the end of the day the trace led into a beautiful green valley and in the middle of it was a stream shining in the afternoon sun then polly ann fell entirely silent and presently as the shadows grew purple we came to a cabin set under some spreading trees on a knoll where a woman sat spinning at the door three children playing at her feet she stared at us so earnestly that i looked at polly ann and saw her redden and pale the children were the first to come shouting at us and then the woman dropped her wool and ran down the slope straight into polly anns arms mr ripley halted the horses with a grunt  the two women drew off and looked into each others faces then polly ann dropped her eyes  have ye she said and stopped  no polly ann not one word sence tom and his pa went what do folks say in the settlements  polly ann turned up her nose  they dont know nuthin in the settlements she replied  i wrote to tom and told him you was gone said the older woman i knowed hed wanter hear  and she looked meaningly at polly ann who said nothing the children had been pulling at the girls skirts and suddenly she made a dash at them they scattered screaming with delight and she after them  howdy mr ripley said the woman smiling a little  howdy mis mcchesney said the old man shortly  so this was the mother of tom of whom i had heard so much she was in truth a motherlylooking person her fleshy face creased with strong character  who hev ye brought with ye she asked glancing at me  a lad polly ann took a shine to in the settlements said the old man polly ann polly ann he cried sharply well hev to be gittin home and then as though an afterthought which it really was not he added how be ye for salt mis mcchesney  soso said she  wal i reckon a little might come handy said he and to the girl who stood panting beside him polly give mis mcchesney some salt  polly ann did and generouslythe salt they had carried with so much labor threescore and ten miles from the settlements then we took our departure the girl turning for one last look at toms mother and at the cabin where he had dwelt we were all silent the rest of the way climbing the slender trail through the forest over the gap into the next valley for i was jealous of tom i am not ashamed to own it now  in the smoky haze that rises just before night lets her curtain fall we descended the farther slope and came to mr ripleys cabin    chapter vii in sight of the blue wall once more  polly ann lived alone with her grandfather her father and mother having been killed by indians some years before there was that bond between us had we needed one her father had built the cabin a large one with a loft and a ladder climbing to it and a sleeping room and a kitchen the cabin stood on a terrace that nature had levelled looking across a swift and shallow stream towards the mountains there was the truck patch with its yellow squashes and melons and cabbages and beans where polly ann and i worked through the hot mornings and the corn patch with the great stumps of the primeval trees standing in it all around us the silent forest threw its encircling arms spreading up the slopes higher and higher to crown the crests with the little pines and hemlocks and balsam fir  there had been no meat save bacon since the mcchesneys had left for of late game had become scarce and old mr ripley was too feeble to go on the long hunts so one day when polly ann was gone across the ridge i took down the long rifle from the buckhorns over the hearth and the hunting knife and powderhorn and pouch beside it and trudged up the slope to a game trail i discovered all day i waited until the forest light grew gray when a buck came and stood over the water raising his head and stamping from time to time i took aim in the notch of a sapling brought him down cleaned and skinned and dragged him into the water and triumphantly hauled one of his hams down the trail polly ann gave a cry of joy when she saw me  davy she exclaimed little davy i reckoned you was gone away from us granpa here is davy back and he has shot a deer  you dont say replied mr ripley surveying me and my booty with a grim smile  how could you granpa said polly ann reproachfully  wal said mr ripley the gun was gone an davy i reckon he aint sich a little rascal after all  polly ann and i went up the next day and brought the rest of the buck merrily homeward after that i became the hunter of the family but oftener than not i returned tired and emptyhanded and ravenously hungry indeed our chief game was rattlesnakes which we killed by the dozens in the corn and truck patches  as polly ann and i went about our daily chores we would talk of tom mcchesney often she would sit idle at the handmill a light in her eyes that i would have given kingdoms for one ever memorable morning early in the crisp autumn a grizzled man strode up the trail and polly ann dropped the ear of corn she was husking and stood still her bosom heaving it was mr mcchesney toms fatheralone  no polly ann he cried there aint nuthin happened weve laid out the hill towns but the virginna men wanted a guide and tom volunteered and so he aint come back with rutherfords boys  polly ann seized him by the shoulders and looked him in the face  be you tellin the truth warner mcchesney she said in a hard voice  as god hears me said warner mcchesney solemnly he sent ye this  he drew from the bosom of his hunting shirt a soiled piece of birch bark scrawled over with rude writing polly seized it and flew into the house  the hickories turned a flaunting yellow the oaks a copperred the leaves crackled on the catawba vines and still tom mcchesney did not come the cherokees were homeless and houseless and subduedtheir hill towns burned their corn destroyed their squaws and children wanderers one by one the men of the grape vine settlement returned to save what they might of their crops and plough for the next yearburrs oharas williamsons and winns yes tom had gone to guide the virginia boys all had tales to tell of his prowess and how he had saved rutherfords men from ambush at the risk of his life to all of which polly ann listened with conscious pride and replied with sallies  i reckon i dont care if he never comes back she would cry if he likes the virginny boys more than me there be others here i fancy more than him  whereupon the informant if he were not bound in matrimony would begin to make eyes at polly ann or if he were bolder and went at the wooing in the more demonstrative fashion of the backwoodspolly ann had a way of hitting him behind the ear with most surprising effect  one windy morning when the leaves were kiting over the valley we were getting ready for pounding hominy when a figure appeared on the trail steadying the hood of her sunbonnet with her hand the girl gazed long and earnestly and a lump came into my throat at the thought that the comer might be tom mcchesney polly ann sat down at the block again in disgust  its only chauncey dike she said  whos chauncey dike i asked  he reckons hes a buck was all that polly ann vouchsafed  chauncey drew near with a strut he had very long black hair a new coonskin cap with a long tassel and a new bluefringed hunting shirt what first caught my eye was a couple of withered indian scalps that hung by their long locks from his girdle chauncey dike was certainly handsome  wal polly ann are ye tired of hanging out fer tom he cried when a dozen paces away  i wouldnt be if you was the only one left ter choose polly ann retorted  chauncey dike stopped in his tracks and hawhawed with laughter but i could see that he was not very much pleased  wal said he i low ye wont see tom very soon hes gone to kaintuckee  has he said polly ann with brave indifference  he met a gal on the traila blazin fine gal said chauncey dike she was goin to kaintuckee and tomhe lowed hed go long  polly ann laughed and fingered the withered pieces of skin at chaunceys girdle  did tom give you them sculps she asked innocently  chauncey drew up stiffly  who tom mcchesney i reckon he aint got none to give this heres from a big brave at noewee whar the virginny boys was surprised and he held up the one with the longest tuft hed liked to tomahawked me outn the briers but i throwed him fust  shucks said polly ann pounding the corn i reckon you found him dead  but that night as we sat before the fading red of the backlog the old man dozing in his chair polly ann put her hand on mine  davy she said softly do you reckon hes gone to kaintuckee  how could i tell  the days passed the wind grew colder and one subdued dawn we awoke to find that the pines had fantastic white arms and the stream ran black between white banks all that day and for many days after the snow added silently to the thickness of its blanket and winter was upon us it was a long winter and a rare one polly ann sat by the little window of the cabin spinning the flax into linseywoolsey and she made a hunting shirt for her grandfather and another little one for me which she fitted with careful fingers but as she spun her wheel made the only musicfor polly ann sang no more once i came on her as she was thrusting the tattered piece of birch bark into her gown but she never spoke to me more of tom mcchesney when from time to time the snow melted on the hillsides i sometimes surprised a deer there and shot him with the heavy rifle and so the months wore on till spring  the buds reddened and popped and the briers grew pink and white through the lengthening days we toiled in the truck patch but always as i bent to my work polly anns face saddened meit had once been so bright and it should have been so at this season old mr ripley grew querulous and savage and hard to please in the evening when my work was done i often lay on the banks of the stream staring at the high ridge its ragged edges the setting sun burned a molten gold and the thought grew on me that i might make my way over the mountains into that land beyond and find tom for polly ann i even climbed the watershed to the east as far as the ohara farm to sound that big irishman about the trail for he had once gone to kentucky to come back with his scalp and little besides ohara with his brogue gave me such a terrifying notion of the horrors of the wilderness trail that i threw up all thought of following it alone and so i resolved to wait until i heard of some settlers going over it but none went from the grape vine settlement that spring  war was awaging in kentucky the great indian nations were making a frantic effort to drive from their hunting grounds the little bands of settlers there and these were in sore straits  so i waited and gave polly ann no hint of my intention  sometimes she herself would slip away across the notch to see mrs mcchesney and the children she never took me with her on these journeys but nearly always when she came back at nightfall her eyes would be red and i knew the two women had been weeping together there came a certain hot sunday in july when she went on this errand and grandpa ripley having gone to spend the day at old man winns i was left alone i remember i sat on the squared log of the doorstep wondering whether if i were to make my way to salisbury i could fall in with a party going across the mountains into kentucky and wondering likewise what polly ann would do without me i was cleaning the long riflea labor i lovedwhen suddenly i looked up startled to see a man standing in front of me how he got there i know not i stared at him he was a young man very spare and very burned with bright red hair and blue eyes that had a kind of laughter in them and yet were sober his buckskin hunting shirt was old and stained and frayed by the briers and his leggins and moccasins were wet from fording the stream he leaned his chin on the muzzle of his gun  folks live here sonny said he  i nodded  whar be they  out said i  comin back he asked  tonight said i and began to rub the lock  be they good folks said he  yes i answered  wal said he making a move to pass me i reckon ill slip in and take what ive a mind to and move on  now i liked the mans looks very much but i did not know what he would do so i got in his way and clutched the gun it was loaded but not primed and i emptied a little powder from the flask in the pan at that he grinned  youre a good boy sonny he said do you reckon you could hit me if you shot  yes i said but i knew i could scarcely hold the gun out straight without a rest  and do you reckon i could hit you fust he asked at that i laughed and he laughed  whats your name  i told him  who do you love best in all the world said he  it was a queer question but i told him polly ann ripley  oh said he after a pause and whats she like  shes beautiful i said shes been very kind to me she took me home with her from the settlements when i had no place to go shes good  and a sharp tongue i reckon said he  when people need it i answered  oh said he and presently shes very merry ill warrant  she used to be but thats gone by i said  gone by said he his voice falling is she sick  no said i shes not sick shes sad  sad said he it was then i noticed that he had a cut across his temple red and barely healed do you reckon your polly ann would give me a little mite to eat  this time i jumped up ran into the house and got down some cornpone and a leg of turkey for that was the rule of the border he took them in great bites but slowly and he picked the bones clean  i had breakfast yesterday morning said he about forty mile from here  and nothing since said i in astonishment  fresh air and water and exercise said he and sat down on the grass he was silent for a long while and so was i for a notion had struck me though i hardly dared to give it voice  are you going away i asked at last  he laughed  why said he  if you were going to kaintuckee i began and faltered for he stared at me very hard  kaintuckee he said theres a country but its full of blood and injun varmints now would you leave polly ann and go to kaintuckee  are you going i said  i reckon i am he said as soon as i kin  will you take me i asked breathless ii wont be in your way and i can walkandshoot game  at that he bent back his head and laughed which made me redden with anger then he turned and looked at me more soberly  youre a queer little piece said he why do you want to go thar  i want to find tom mcchesney for polly ann i said  he turned away his face  a goodfornothing scamp said he  i have long thought so i said  he laughed again it was a laugh that made me want to join him had i not been irritated  and hes a scamp you say and why  else he would be coming back to polly ann  mayhap he couldnt said the stranger  chauncey dike said he went off with another girl into kaintuckee  and what did polly ann say to that the stranger demanded  she asked chauncey if tom mcchesney gave him the scalps he had on his belt  at that he laughed in good earnest and slapped his breechclouts repeatedly all at once he stopped and stared up the ridge  is that polly ann said he  i looked and far up the trail was a speck  i reckon it is i answered and wondered at his eyesight she travels over to see tom mcchesneys ma once in a while  he looked at me queerly  i reckon ill go here and sit down davy said he sos not to be in the way and he walked around the corner of the house  polly ann sauntered down the trail slowly as was her wont after such an occasion and the man behind the house twice whispered with extreme caution how near is she before she came up the path  have you been lonesome davy she said  no said i ive had a visitor  its not chauncey dike again she said he doesnt dare show his face here  no it wasnt chauncey this man would like to have seen you polly ann he here i braced myselfhe knew tom mcchesney he called him a goodfornothing scamp  he diddid he said polly ann very low i reckon it was good for him i wasnt here  i grinned  what are you laughing at you little monkey said polly ann crossly pon my soul sometimes i reckon you are a witch  polly ann i said did i ever do anything but good to you  she made a dive at me and before i could escape caught me in her strong young arms and hugged me  youre the best friend i have little davy she cried  i reckon thats so said the stranger who had risen and was standing at the corner  polly ann looked at him like a frightened doe and as she stared uncertain whether to stay or fly the color surged into her cheeks and mounted to her fair forehead  tom she faltered  ive come back polly ann said he but his voice was not so clear as a while ago  then polly ann surprised me  what made you come back said she as though she didnt care a minkskin whereat mr mcchesney shifted his feet  i reckon it was to fetch you polly ann  i like that cried she hes come to fetch me davy that was the first time in months her laugh had sounded natural i heerd you fetched one gal acrost the mountains and now you want to fetch another  polly ann says he there was a time when you knew a truthful man from a liar  that times past retorted she i reckon all men are liars what are ye tomfoolin about here for tom mcchesney when yere mas breakin her heart i wonder ye come back at all  polly ann says he very serious i aint a boaster but when i think what i come through to git here i wonder that i come back at all the folks shut up at harrods said it was sure death ter cross the mountains now ive walked two hundred miles and fed seven times and my sculps as near hangin on a red sticks belt as i ever want it to be  tom mcchesney said polly ann with her hands on her hips and her sunbonnet tilted thats the longest speech you ever made in your life  i declare i lost my temper with polly ann then nor did i blame tom mcchesney for turning on his heel and walking away but he had gone no distance at all before polly ann with three springs was at his shoulder  tom she said very gently  he hesitated stopped thumped the stock of his gun on the ground and wheeled he looked at her doubtingly and her eyes fell to the ground  tom mcchesney said she youre a born fool with wimmen  thank god for that said he his eyes devouring her  ay said she and then you want me to go to kaintuckee with you  thats what i come for he stammered his assurance all run away again  ill go she answered so gently that her words were all but blown away by the summer wind he laid his rifle against a stump at the edge of the cornfield but she bounded clear of him then she stood panting her eyes sparkling  ill go she said raising her finger ill go for one thing  whats that he demanded  that youll take davy along with us  this time tom had her struggling like a wild thing in his arms and kissing her black hair madly as for me i might have been in the next settlement for all they cared and then polly ann as red as a holly berry broke away from him and ran to me caught me up and hid her face in my shoulder tom mcchesney stood looking at us grinning and that day i ceased to hate him  theres no devil ef i dont take him polly ann said he why he was agoin to kaintuckee ter find me for you  what said she raising her head  thats what he told me afore he knew who i was he wanted to know ef id fetch him thar  little davy cried polly ann  the last i saw of them that day they were going off up the trace towards his mothers polly ann keeping ahead of him and just out of his reach and i was very very happy for tom mcchesney had come back at last and polly ann was herself once more  as long as i live i shall never forget polly anns wedding  she was all for delay and such a bunch of coquetry as i have never seen she raised one objection after another but tom was a firm man and his late experiences in the wilderness had made him impatient of trifling he had promised the kentucky settlers fighting for their lives in their blockhouses that he would come back again and a resolute man who was a good shot was sorely missed in the country in those days  it was not the thousand dangers and hardships of the journey across the wilderness trail that frightened polly ann not she nor would she listen to tom when he implored her to let him return alone to come back for her when the redskins had got over the first furies of their hatred as for me the thought of going with them into that promised land was like wine wondering what the place was like i could not sleep of nights  aint you afeerd to go davy said tom to me  you promised polly ann to take me said i indignantly  davy said he you aint over handsome twouldnt improve yere looks to be bald they hev a way of takin yere har better stay behind with granpa ripley till i kin fetch ye both  tom said polly ann you kin just go back alone if you dont take davy  so one of the winn boys agreed to come over to stay with old mr ripley until quieter times  the preparations for the wedding went on apace that week i had not thought that the grape vine settlement held so many people and they came from other settlements too for news spread quickly in that country despite the distances tom mcchesney was plainly a favorite with the men who had marched with rutherford all the week they came loaded with offerings turkeys and venison and pork and bear meatgreatest delicacy of alluntil the cool spring was filled for the feast from thirty miles down the broad a gaunt baptist preacher on a fat white pony arrived the night before he had been sent for to tie the knot  polly anns weddingday dawned bright and fair and long before the sun glistened on the corn tassels we were up and clearing out the big room the fiddlers came firsta merry lot and then the guests from afar began to arrive some of them had travelled half the night the bridegrooms friends were assembling at the mcchesney place at last when the sun was over the stream rose such indian warwhoops and shots from the ridge trail as made me think the redskins were upon us the shouts and hurrahs grew louder and louder the quickening thud of horses hoofs was heard in the woods and there burst into sight of the assembly by the truck patch two wild figures on crazed horses charging down the path towards the house we scattered to right and left on they came leaping logs and brush and ditches until one of them pulled up yelling madly at the very door the foamflecked sides of his horse moving with quick heaves  it was chauncey dike and he had won the race for the bottle of black bettychauncey dike his long black hair shining with bears oil amid the cheers of the brides friends he leaped from his saddle mounted a stump and flapping his arms crowed in victory before he had done the vanguard of the grooms friends were upon us pellmell all in the finest of backwoods regalianew hunting shirts trimmed with bits of color and all armed to the teethscalping knife tomahawk and all nor had chauncey dike forgotten the scalp of the brave who leaped at him out of the briers at neowee  polly ann was radiant in a white linen gown woven and sewed by her own hands it was not such a gown as mrs temple nicks mother would have worn and yet she was to me an hundred times more beautiful than that lady in all her silks peeping out from under it were the little bluebeaded moccasins which tom himself had brought across the mountains in the bosom of his hunting shirt polly ann was radiant and yet at times so rapturously shy that when the preacher announced himself ready to tie the knot she ran into the house and hid in the cupboardfor polly ann was a child of nature thence coloring like a wild rose she was dragged by a boisterous bevy of girls in linseywoolsey to the spreading maple of the forest that stood on the high bank over the stream the assembly fell solemn and not a sound was heard save the breathing of nature in the heyday of her time and though i was happy the sobs rose in my throat there stood polly ann as white now as the bleached linen she wore and tom mcchesney tall and spare and broad as strong a figure of a man as ever i laid eyes on god had truly made that couple for wedlock in his leafy temple  the deeptoned words of the preacher in prayer broke the stillness they were made man and wife and then began a day of merriment of unrestraint such as the backwoods alone knows the feast was spread out in the long grass under the treessides of venison bear meat cornpone fresh baked by mrs mcchesney and polly ann herself and all the vegetables in the patch there was no stint either of maple beer and rum and black betty and toasts to the bride and groom amidst gusts of laughter that they might populate kaintuckee and polly ann would have it that i should sit by her side under the maple  the fiddlers played and there were foot races and shooting matches ay and wrestling matches in the severe manner of the backwoods between the young bucks more than one of which might have ended seriously were it not for the high humor of the crowd tom mcchesney himself was in most of them a hot favorite by a trick he had learned in the indian country he threw chauncey dike no mean adversary so hard that the backwoods dandy lay for a moment in sleep contrary to the custom of many tom was not in the habit of crowing on such occasions nor did he even smile as he helped chauncey to his feet but polly ann knew and i knew that he was thinking of what chauncey had said to her  so the long summer afternoon wore away into twilight and the sun fell behind the blue ridges we were to cross pine knots were lighted in the big room the fiddlers set to again and then came jigs and three and four handed reels that made the puncheons rattlechickenflutter and cutthebuckleand polly ann was the leader now the young men flinging the girls from fireplace to window in the reels and back again and when panting and perspiring the lass was too tired to stand longer she dropped into the hospitable lap of the nearest buck who was perched on the bench along the wall awaiting his chance for so it went in the backwoods in those days and long after and no harm in it that ever i could see  well suddenly as if by concert the music stopped and a shout of laughter rang under the beams as polly ann flew out of the door with the girls after her as swift of foot as she they dragged her a struggling captive to the bridechamber which made the other end of the house and when they emerged blushing and giggling and subdued the fun began with tom mcchesney he gave the young men a pretty fight indeed and long before they had him conquered the elder guests had made their escape through door and window  all night the reels and jigs went on and the feasting and drinking too in the fine rain that came at dawn to hide the crests the company rode wearily homeward through the notches    chapter viii the nollichucky trace           some to endure and many to quail          some to conquer and many to fail          toiling over the wilderness trail  as long as i live i shall never forget the morning we started on our journey across the blue wall before the sun chased away the filmy veil of mist from the brooks in the valley the mcchesneys father mother and children were gathered to see us depart and as they helped us to tighten the packsaddles tom himself had made from chosen treeforks they did not cease lamenting that we were going to certain death our scrawny horses splashed across the stream and we turned to see a gaunt and lonely figure standing apart against the sun stern and sorrowful we waved our hands and set our faces towards kaintuckee  tom walked ahead rifle on shoulder then polly ann and lastly i drove the two shaggy ponies the instruments of husbandry we had been able to gather awry on their packsa scythe a spade and a hoe i triumphantly carried the axe  it was not long before we were in the wilderness shut in by mountain crags and presently polly ann forgot her sorrows in the perils of the trace choked by briers and grapevines blocked by sliding stones and earth it rose and rose through the heat and burden of the day until it lost itself in the open heights as the sun was wearing down to the western ridges the mischievous sorrel mare turned her pack on a sapling and one of the precious bags burst in an instant we were on our knees gathering the golden meal in our hands polly ann baked journeycakes on a hot stone from what we saved under the shiny ivy leaves and scarce had i spancelled the horses ere tom returned with a fat turkey he had shot  was there ever sech a wedding journey said polly ann as we sat about the fire for the mountain air was chill and tom and davy as grave as parsons yed guess one of you was rutherford himself and the other mr boone  no wonder he was grave i little realized then the task he had set himself to pilot a woman and a lad into a country haunted by frenzied savages when single men feared to go this season but now he smiled and patted polly anns brown hand  its one of yer own choosing lass said he  of my own choosing cried she come davy well go back to grandpa  tom grinned  i reckon the redskins wont bother us till we git by the nollichucky and watauga settlements he said  the redskins said polly ann indignant i reckon if one of em did git me hed kiss me once in a while  whereupon tom looking more sheepish still tried to kiss her and failed ignominiously for she vanished into the dark woods  if a redskin got you here said tom when she had slipped back hed fetch you to nickajack cave  whats that she demanded  where all the red and white and yellow scalawags over the mountains is gathered he answered and he told of a deep gorge between towering mountains where a great river cried angrily of a black cave out of which a black stream ran where a man could paddle a dugout for miles into the rock the river was the tennessee and the place the resort of the chickamauga bandits pirates of the mountains outcasts of all nations and dragging canoe was their chief  it was on the whole a merry journey the first part of it if a rough one often polly ann would draw me to her and whisper well hold out davy hell never now when the truth was that the big fellow was going at half his pace on our account he told us there was no fear of redskins here yet when the scream of a painter or the hoot of an owl stirred me from my exhausted slumber i caught sight of him with his back to a tree staring into the forest his rifle at his side the day was dawning  turn abouts fair i expostulated  yell need yere sleep davy said he or yell never grow any bigger  i thought kaintuckee was to the west i said and youre making north for i had observed him day after day we had left the trails sometimes he climbed tree and again he sent me to the upper branches whence i surveyed a sea of treetops waving in the wind and looked onward to where a green velvet hollow lay nestling on the western side of a saddlebacked ridge  north said tom to polly ann laughing the little devil will beat me at woodcraft soon ay north davy im hunting for the nollichucky trace that leads to the watauga settlement  it was wonderful to me how he chose his way through the mountains once in a while we caught sight of a yellow blaze in a tree made by himself scarce a month gone when he came southward alone to fetch polly ann again the tired roan shied back from the bleached bones of a traveller picked clean by wolves at sundown when we loosed our exhausted horses to graze on the wet grass by the streams tom would go off to look for a deer or turkey and often not come back to us until long after darkness had fallen  davyll take care of you polly ann he would say as he left us  and she would smile at him bravely and say i reckon i kin look out for davy awhile yet  but when he was gone and the crooning stillness set in broken only by the many sounds of the night we would sit huddled together by the fire it was dread for him she felt not for herself and in both our minds rose red images of hideous foes skulking behind his brave form as he trod the forest floor polly ann was not the woman to whimper  and yet i have but dim recollections of this journey it was no hardship to a lad brought up in woodcraft fear of the indians like a dog shivering with the cold was a deadened pain on the border  strangely enough it was i who chanced upon the nollichucky trace which follows the meanderings of that river northward through the great smoky mountains it was made long ago by the southern indians as they threaded their way to the hunting lands of kaintuckee and shared now by indian traders the path was redolent with odors and bright with mountain shrubs and flowersthe pink laurel bush the shining rhododendron and the grape and plum and wild crab the clear notes of the mountain birds were in our ears by day and the music of the water falling over the ledges mingled with that of the leaves rustling in the wind lulled us to sleep at night high above us as we descended the gap from naked crag to timbercovered ridge was spanned by the eagles flight and virgin valleys where future generations were to be born spread out and narrowed againvalleys with a deep carpet of cane and grass where the deer and elk and bear fed unmolested  it was perchance the next evening that my eyes fell upon a sight which is one of the wonders of my boyish memories the trail slipped to the edge of a precipice and at our feet the valley widened planted amidst giant trees on a shining green lawn that ran down to the racing nollichucky was the strangest house it has ever been my lot to seeof no shape of huge size and built of logs one wing hitched to another by dog alleys as we called them and from its wide stone chimneys the pearly smoke rose upward in the still air through the poplar branches beyond it a setting sun gilded the cornfields and horses and cattle dotted the pastures we stood for a while staring at this oasis in the wilderness and to my boyish fancy it was a fitting introduction to a delectable land  glory be to heaven exclaimed polly ann  its nollichucky jacks house said tom  and who may he be said she  who may he be cried tom captain john sevier king of the border and i reckon the best man to sweep out redskins in the watauga settlements  do you know him said she  i was chose as one of his scouts when we fired the cherokee hill towns last summer said tom with pride thar was blood and thunder for ye we went down the great warpath which lies below us and when we was through there wasnt a cornshuck or a wigwam or a war post left we didnt harm the squaws nor the children but there warnt no prisoners took when nollichucky jack strikes i reckon its more like a thunderbolt nor anything else  do you think hes at home tom i asked fearful that i should not see this celebrated person  well soon larn said he as we descended i heerd he was agoin to punish them chickamauga robbers by nickajack  just then we heard a prodigious barking and a dozen hounds came charging down the path at our horses legs the roan shying into the truck patch a mans voice deep clear compelling was heard calling  vi flora ripper   i saw him coming from the porch of the house a tall slim figure in a hunting shirtthat fitted to perfectionand cavalry boots his face his carriage his quick movement and stride filled my notion of a hero and my instinct told me he was a gentleman born  why bless my soul its tom mcchesney he cried ten paces away while tom grinned with pleasure at the recognition but what have you here  a wife said tom standing on one foot  captain sevier fixed his dark blue eyes on polly ann with approbation and he bowed to her very gracefully  where are you going maam may i ask he said  to kaintuckee said polly ann  to kaintuckee cried captain sevier turning to tom egad then youve no right to a wifeand to such a wife and he glanced again at polly ann why mcchesney you never struck me as a rash man have you lost your senses to take a woman into kentucky this year  so the forts be still in trouble said tom  trouble cried mr sevier with a quick fling of his whip at an unruly hound harrodstown boonesboro logans fort at st asaphsthey dont dare stick their noses outside the stockades the indians have swarmed into kentucky like red ants i tell you ten days ago when i was in the holston settlements major ben logan came in his fort had been shut up since may they were out of powder and lead and somebody had to come how did he come as the wolf lopes nay as the crow flies over crag and ford cumberland clinch and all forty miles a day for five days and never saw a tracefor the war parties were watching the wilderness road and he swung again towards polly ann youll not go to kaintuckee maam youll stay here with us until the redskins are beaten off there he may go if he likes  i reckon we didnt come this far to give out captain sevier said she  you dont look to be the kind to give out mrs mcchesney said he and yet it may not be a matter of giving out he added more soberly this mixture of heartiness and gravity seemed to sit well on him surely you have been enterprising tom where in the name of the continental congress did you get the lad  i married him along with polly ann said tom  that was the bargain and i reckon he was worth it  id take a dozen to get her declared mr sevier while polly ann blushed well well suppers waiting us and cider and applejack for we dont get a wedding party every day some gentlemen are here whose word may have more weight and whose attractions may be greater than mine  he whistled to a negro lad who took our horses and led us through the courtyard and the house to the lawn at the far side of it a rude table was set there under a great tree and around it three gentlemen were talking my memory of all of them is more vivid than it might be were their names not household words in the western country captain sevier startled them  my friends said he if you have despatches for kaintuckee i pray you get them ready over night  they looked up at him one sternly the other two gravely  what the devil do you mean sevier said the stern one  that my friend tom mcchesney is going there with his wife unless we can stop him said sevier  stop him thundered the stern gentleman kicking back his chair and straightening up to what seemed to me a colossal height i stared at him boylike he had long irongray hair and a creased fleshy face and sunken eyes he looked as if he might stop anybody as he turned upon tom who the devil is this tom mcchesney he demanded  sevier laughed  the best scout i ever laid eyes on said he a deadly man with a deckard an unerring man at choosing a wife and he bowed to the reddening polly ann and a fool to run the risk of losing her  tut tut said the iron gentleman who was the famous captain evan shelby of kings meadows hell leave her here in our settlements while he helps us fight dragging canoe and his chickamauga pirates  if he leaves me said polly ann her eyes flashing thats an end to the bargain hell never find me more  captain sevier laughed again  theres spirit for you he cried slapping his whip against his boot  at this another gentleman stood up a younger counterpart of the first only he towered higher and his shoulders were broader he had a bigfeatured face and pleasant eyesthat twinkled nowsunken in with fleshy creases at the corners  tom mcchesney said he dont mind my father if any man besides logan can get inside the forts you can do you remember me  i reckon i do mr isaac shelby said tom putting a big hand into mr shelbys bigger one i reckon i wont soon forget how you stepped out of ranks and tuk command when the boys was runnin and turned the tide  he looked like the man to step out of ranks and take command  pish said mr isaac shelby blushing like a girl where would i have been if you and moore and findley and the rest hadnt stood em off till we turned round  by this time the third gentleman had drawn my attention not by anything he said for he remained silent sitting with his dark brown head bent forward quietly gazing at the scene from under his brows the instant he spoke they turned towards him he was perhaps forty and broadshouldered not so tall as mr sevier  why do you go to kaintuckee mcchesney he asked  i give my word to mr harrod and mr clark to come back mr robertson said tom  and the wife if you take her you run a great risk of losing her  and if he leaves me said polly ann flinging her head he will lose me sure  the others laughed but mr robertson merely smiled  faith cried captain sevier if those i met coming back helterskelter over the wilderness trace had been of that stripe theyd have more men in the forts now  with that the captain called for supper to be served where we sat he was a widower with lads somewhere near my own age and i recall being shown about the place by them and later when the fireflies glowed and the nollichucky sang in the darkness we listened to the talk of the war of the year gone by i needed not to be told that before me were the renowned leaders of the watauga settlements my hero worship cried it aloud within me these captains dwelt on the borderland of mystery conquered the wilderness and drove before them its savage tribes by their might when they spoke of the cherokees and told how that same stuartthe companion of cameronwas urging them to war against our people a fierce anger blazed within me for the cherokees had killed my father  i remember the menscarcely what they said evan shelbys words like heavy blows on an anvil isaac shelbys none the less forceful james robertson compelling his listeners by some strange power he was perchance the strongest man there though none of us guessed after ruling that region that he was to repeat untold hardships to found and rear another settlement farther west but best i loved to hear captain sevier whose talk lacked not force but had a daring a humor a lightness of touch that seemed more in keeping with that world i had left behind me in charlestown him i loved and at length i solved the puzzle to me he was nick temple grown to manhood  i slept in the room with captain seviers boys and one window of it was of paper smeared with bears grease through which the sunlight came all bleared and yellow in the morning i had a boys interest in affairs and i remember being told that the gentlemen were met here to discuss the treaty between themselves and the great oconostota chief of the cherokees and also to consider the policy of punishing once for all dragging canoe and his bandits at chickamauga  as we sat at breakfast under the trees these gentlemen generously dropped their own business to counsel tom and i observed with pride that he had gained their regard during the last years war shelbys threats and robertsons warnings and seviers exhortations having no effect upon his determination to proceed to kentucky they began to advise him how to go and he sat silent while they talked and finally when they asked him he spoke of making through carters valley for cumberland gap and the wilderness trail  egad cried captain sevier i have so many times found the boldest plan the safest that i have become a coward that way what do you say to it mr robertson  mr robertson leaned his square shoulders over the table  he may fall in with a party going over he answered without looking up  polly ann looked at tom as if to say that the whole continental army could not give her as much protection  we left that hospitable place about nine oclock mr robertson having written a letter to colonel daniel booneshut up in the fort at boonesboroshould we be so fortunate as to reach kaintuckee and another to a young gentleman by the name of george rogers clark apparently a leader there captain sevier bowed over polly anns hand as if she were a great lady and wished her a happy honeymoon and me he patted on the head and called a brave lad and soon we had passed beyond the cornfield into the wilderness again  our way was down the nollichucky past the great bend of it below lick creek and so to the great warpath the trail by which countless parties of red marauders had travelled north and south it led indeed northeast between the mountain ranges although we kept a watch by day and night we saw no sign of dragging canoe or his men and at length we forded the holston and came to the scattered settlement in carters valley  i have since racked my brain to remember at whose cabin we stopped there he was a rough backwoodsman with a wife and a horde of children but i recall that a great rain came out of the mountains and down the valley we were counting over the powder gourds in our packs when there burst in at the door as wild a man as has ever been my lot to see his brown beard was grown like a bramble patch his eye had a violet light and his hunting shirt was in tatters he was thin to gauntness ate ravenously of the food that was set before him and throwing off his soaked moccasins he spread his scalded feet to the blaze and the steaming odor of drying leather filled the room  whar be ye from asked tom  for answer the man bared his arm then his shoulder and two angry scars long and red revealed themselves and around his wrists were deep gouges where he had been bound  they killed sue he cried sculped her afore my very eyes and they chopped my boy outen the hickory withes and carried him to the creek nation at a place where there was a standin stone i broke loose from three of em and come here over the mountains and i aint had nothin stranger but berries and chainey brierroot for ten days god damn em he cried standing up and tottering with the pain in his feet if i can get a deckard  will you go back said tom  go back he shouted ill go back and fight em while i have blood in my body  he fell into a bunk but his sorrow haunted him even in his troubled sleep and his moans awed us as we listened the next day he told us his story with more calmness it was horrible indeed and might well have frightened a less courageous woman than polly ann imploring her not to go he became wild again and brought tears to her eyes when he spoke of his own wife they tomahawked her maam because she could not walk and the baby beside her and i standing by with my arms tied  as long as i live i shall never forget that scene and how tom pleaded with polly ann to stay behind but she would not listen to him  youre going tom she said  yes he answered turning away i gave em my word  and your word to me said polly ann  he did not answer  we fixed on a saturday to start to give the horses time to rest and in the hope that we might hear of some relief party going over the gap on thursday tom made a trip to the store in the valley and came back with a deckard rifle he had bought for the stranger whose name was weldon there was no news from kaintuckee but the carters valley settlers seemed to think that matters were better there it was that same night i believe that two men arrived from fort chiswell one whose name was cutcheon was a little man with a short forehead and a bad eye and he wore a weatherbeaten blue coat of military cut the second was a big lightcolored fleshy man and a loud talker he wore a hunting shirt and leggings they were both the worse for rum they had had on the road the big man talking very loud and boastfully  afeard to go to kaintuckee said he ive met a parcel o cowards on the road turned back there aint nothin to be afeard of eh stranger he added to tom who paid no manner of attention to him the small man scarce opened his mouth but sat with his head bowed forward on his breast when he was not drinking we passed a dismal crowded night in the room with such companions when they heard that we were to go over the mountains nothing would satisfy the big man but to go with us  come stranger said he to tom two good rifles such as we is aint to be throwed away  why do you want to go over asked tom be ye a tory he demanded suspiciously  why do you go over retorted riley for that was his name i reckon im no more of a tory than you  whar did ye come from said tom  chiswells mines taking out lead for the army o congress but there aint excitement enough in it  and you said tom turning to cutcheon and eying his military coat  i got tired of their damned discipline the man answered surlily he was a deserter  look you said tom sternly if you come what i say is law  such was the sacrifice we were put to by our need of company but in those days a man was a man and scarce enough on the wilderness trail in that year of 77 so we started away from carters valley on a bright saturday morning the grass glistening after a weeks rain the road sodden and the smell of the summer earth heavy tom and weldon walked ahead driving the two horses followed by cutcheon his head dropped between his shoulders the big man riley regaled polly ann  my pluck is said he my pluck is to give a redskin no chance shoot em down like hogs it takes a good un to stalk me maam up on the kanawha ive had handtohand fights with em and made em cry quits  law exclaimed polly ann nudging me it was a lucky thing we run into you in the valley  but presently we left the road and took a mountain trailas stiff a climb as we had yet had polly ann went up it like a bird talking all the while to riley who blew like a bellows for once he was silent  we spent two perchance three days climbing and descending and fording at night tom would suffer none to watch save weldon and himself not trusting riley or cutcheon and the rascals were well content to sleep at length we came to a cabin on a creek the corn between the stumps around it choked with weeds and no sign of smoke in the chimney behind it slanted up in giant steps a forestclad hill of a thousand feet and in front of it the stream was dammed and lined with cane  who keeps house cried tom at the threshold  he pushed back the door fashioned in one great slab from a forest tree his welcome was an angry whir and a huge yellow rattler lay coiled within his head reared to strike polly ann leaned back  mercy she cried thats a bad sign  but tom killed the snake and we made ready to use the cabin that night and the next day for the horses were to be rested and meat was to be got as we could not use our guns so freely on the far side of cumberland gap in the morning before he and weldon left tom took me around the end of the cabin  davy said he i dont trust these rascals kin you shoot a pistol  i reckoned i could  he had taken one out of the pack he had got from captain sevier and pushed it between the logs where the clay had fallen out if they try anything said he shoot em and dont be afeard of killing em he patted me on the back and went off up the slope with weldon polly ann and i stood watching them until they were out of sight  about eleven oclock riley and cutcheon moved off to the edge of a canebrake near the water and sat there for a while talking in low tones the horses were belled and spancelled near by feeding on the cane and wild grass and polly ann was cooking journeycakes on a stone  what makes you so sober davy she said  i didnt answer  davy she cried be happy while youre young tis a fine day and kaintuckees over yonder she picked up her skirts and sang              first upon the heeltap              then upon the toe   the men by the canebrake turned and came towards us  yere happy today mis mcchesney said riley  why shouldnt i be said polly ann were all agoin to kaintuckee  were agoin back to cyarters valley said riley in his blustering way this here aint as excitin as i thought i reckon there aint no redskins nohow  what cried polly ann in loud scorn yere agoin to desert therell be redskins enough by and by ill warrant ye  howd you like to come along of us says riley that aint any place for wimmen over yonder  along of you cried polly ann with flashing eyes do you hear that davy  i did meanwhile the man cutcheon was slowly walking towards her it took scarce a second for me to make up my mind i slipped around the corner of the house seized the pistol primed it with a trembling hand and came back to behold polly ann with flaming cheeks facing them they did not so much as glance at me riley held a little back of the two being the coward but cutcheon stood ready like a wolf  i did not wait for him to spring but taking the best aim i could with my two hands fired with a curse that echoed in the crags he threw up his arms and fell forward writhing on the turf  run for the cabin polly ann i shouted and bar the door  there was no need for an instant riley wavered and then fled to the cane  polly ann and i went to the man on the ground and turned him over his eyes slid upwards there was a bloody froth on his lips  davy cried she awestricken davy yeve killed him  i grew dizzy and sick at the thought but she caught me and held me to her presently we sat down on the door log gazing at the corpse then i began to reflect and took out my powder gourd and loaded the pistol  what are ye adoing she said  in case the other one comes back said i  pooh said polly ann hell not come back which was true i have never laid eyes on riley to this day  i reckon wed better fetch it out of the sun said she after a while and so we dragged it under an oak covered the face and left it  he was the first man i ever killed and the business by no means came natural to me and that day the journeycakes which polly ann had made were untasted by us both the afternoon dragged interminably try as we would we could not get out of our minds the thing that lay under the oak  it was near sundown when tom and weldon appeared on the mountain side carrying a buck between them tom glanced from one to the other of us keenly he was very quick to divine  whar be they said he  show him davy said polly ann  i took him over to the oak and polly ann told him the story he gave me one look i remember and there was more of gratitude in it than in a thousand words then he seized a piece of cold cake from the stone  which trace did he take he demanded of me   but polly ann hung on his shoulder  tom tom she cried you beant goin to leave us again tom hell die in the wilderness and we must git to kaintuckee                   the next vivid thing in my memory is the view of the last barrier nature had reared between us and the delectable country it stood like a lion at the gateway and for some minutes we gazed at it in terror from powells valley below how many thousands have looked at it with sinking hearts how many weaklings has its frown turned back there seemed to be engraved upon it the dark history of the dark and bloody land beyond nothing in this life worth having is won for the asking and the best is fought for and bled for and died for written too upon that towering wall of white rock in the handwriting of god himself is the history of the indomitable race to which we belong  for fifty miles we travelled under it towards the gap our eyes drawn to it by a resistless fascination the sun went over it early in the day as though glad to leave the place and after that a dark scowl would settle there at night we felt its presence like a curse even polly ann was silent and she had need to be now when it was necessary we talked in low tones and the bellclappers on the horses were not loosed at night it was here but four years gone that daniel boones family was attacked and his son killed by the indians  we passed from time to time deserted cabins and camps and some places that might once have been called settlements elk garden where the pioneers of the last four years had been wont to lay in a simple supply of seed corn and irish potatoes and the spot where henderson and his company had camped on the way to establish boonesboro two years before and at last we struck the trace that mounted upward to the gateway itself    chapter ix on the wilderness trail  and now we had our hands upon the latch and god alone knew what was behind the gate toil with a certainty but our lives had known it death perchance but death had been near to all of us and his presence did not frighten as we climbed towards the gap i recalled with strange aptness a quaint saying of my fathers that kaintuckee was the garden of eden and that men were being justly punished with blood for their presumption  as if to crown that judgment the day was dark and lowering with showers of rain from time to time and when we spokepolly ann and iit was in whispers the trace was very narrow with daniel boones blazes two years old upon the trees but the way was not over steep cumberland mountain was as silent and deserted as when the first man had known it  alas for the vanity of human presage we gained the top and entered unmolested no eden suddenly dazzled our eye no splendor burst upon it nothing told us as we halted in our weariness that we had reached the promised land the mists weighed heavily on the evergreens of the slopes and hid the ridges and we passed that night in cold discomfort it was the first of many without a fire  the next day brought us to the cumberland tawny and swollen from the rains and here we had to stop to fell trees to make a raft on which to ferry over our packs we bound the logs together with grapevines and as we worked my imagination painted for me many a red face peering from the bushes on the farther shore and when we got into the river and were caught and spun by the hurrying stream i hearkened for a shot from the farther bank while polly ann and i were scrambling to get the raft landed tom and weldon swam over with the horses and so we lay the second night dolefully in the rain but not so much as a whimper escaped from polly ann i have often told her since that the sorest trial she had was the guard she kept on her tonguea hardship indeed for one of irish inheritance many a pull had she lightened for us by a flash of humor  the next morning the sun relented and the wine of his dawn was wine indeed to our flagging hopes going down to wash at the rivers brink i heard a movement in the cane and stood frozen and staring until a great bearded head black as tar was thrust out between the stalks and looked at me with blinking red eyes the next step revealed the hump of the beast and the next his tasselled tail lashing his dirty brown quarters i did not tarry longer but ran to tell tom he made bold to risk a shot and light a fire and thus we had buffalo meat for some days after  we were still in the mountains the trail led down the river for a bit through the worst of canebrakes and every now and again we stopped while tom and weldon scouted once the roan mare made a dash through the brake and though polly ann burst through one way to head her off and i another we reached the bank of richland creek in time to see her nose and the top of her pack above the brown water there was nothing for it but to swim after her which i did and caught her quietly feeding in the cane on the other side by great good fortune the other horse bore the powder  drat you nancy said polly ann to the mare as she handed me my clothes id sooner carry the pack myself than be bothered with you  hush said i the redskins will get us  polly ann regarded me scornfully as i stood bedraggled before her  redskins she cried nonsense i reckon its all talk about redskins  but we had scarce caught up ere we saw tom standing rigid with his hand raised before him on a mound bared of cane were the charred remains of a fire the sight of them transformed weldon his eyes glared again even as when we had first seen him curses escaped under his breath and he would have darted into the cane had not tom seized him sternly by the shoulder as for me my heart hammered against my ribs and i grew sick with listening it was at that instant that my admiration for tom mcchesney burst bounds and that i got some real inkling of what woodcraft might be stepping silently between the tree trunks his eyes bent on the leafy loam he found a footprint here and another there and suddenly he went into the cane with a sign to us to remain it seemed an age before he returned then he began to rake the ashes and suddenly bending down seized something in themthe broken bowl of an indian pipe  shawnees he said i reckoned so it was at length the beseeching in polly anns eyes that he answered  a war partytracks three days old they took poplar  to take poplar was our backwoods expression for embarking in a canoe the dugouts being fashioned from the great poplar trees  i did not reflect then as i have since and often how great was the knowledge and resource tom practised that day our feeling for him polly anns and mine fell little short of worship in company ill at ease in the forest he became silent and masterfulan unerring woodsman capable of meeting the indian on his own footing and strangest thought of all he and many i could name who went into kentucky had escaped by a kind of strange fate being born in the north of ireland this was so of andrew jackson himself  the rest of the day he led us in silence down the trace his eye alert to penetrate every corner of the forest his hand near the trigger of his long deckard i followed in boylike imitation searching every thicket for alien form and color and yearning for stature and responsibility as for poor weldon he would stride for hours at a time with eyes fixed ahead a wild figureragged and fringed and we knew that the soul within him was torn with thoughts of his dead wife and of his child in captivity again when the trance left him he was an addition to our little party not to be despised  at dark polly ann and i carried the packs across a creek on a fallen tree she taking one end and i the other we camped there where the loam was trampled and torn by countless herds of bison and had only parched corn and the remains of a buffalo steak for supper as the meal was mouldy from its wetting and running low when weldon had gone a little distance up the creek to scout tom relented from the sternness which his vigilance imposed and came and sat down on a log beside polly ann and me  tis a hard journey little girl he said patting her i reckon i done wrong to fetch you  i can see him now as the twilight settled down over the wilderness his honest face red and freckled but aglow with the tenderness it had hidden during the day one big hand enfolding hers and the other on my shoulder  hark davy said polly ann hes fair tired of us already davy take me back  hush polly ann he answered delighted at her raillery but ive a word to say to you if we come on to the redskins you and davy make for the cane as hard as you kin kilter keep out of sight  as hard as we kin kilter exclaimed polly ann indignantly i reckon not tom mcchesney davy taught me to shoot long ago afore you made up your mind to come back from kaintuckee  tom chuckled so davy taught you to shoot he said and checked himself he aint such a bad one with a pistoland he patted mebut i allow yed better hunt kiver just the same and if they ketch ye polly ann just you go along and pretend to be happy and tear off a snatch of your dress now and then if you get a chance it wouldnt take me but a little time to run into harrodstown or boones station from here and fetch a party to follow ye  two days went bytwo days of strain in sunlight and of watching and fitful sleep in darkness but the wilderness trail was deserted here and there a leantosilent remnant of the year gone byspoke of the little bands of emigrants which had once made their way so cheerfully to the new country again it was a childs doll the rags of it beaten by the weather to a rusty hue every hour that we progressed seemed to justify the sagacity and boldness of toms plan nor did it appear to have entered a painted skull that a white man would have the hardihood to try the trail this year there were neither signs nor sounds save natures own the hoot of the woodowl the distant bark of a mountain wolf the whir of a partridge as she left her brood at length we could stand no more the repression that silence and watching put upon us and when a rotten bank gave way and flung polly ann and the sorrel mare into a creek even weldon smiled as we pulled her bedraggled and laughing from the muddy water this was after we had ferried the rockcastle river  our trace rose and fell over height and valley until we knew that we were come to a wonderland at last we stood one evening on a spur as the setting sun flooded the natural park below us with a crystal light and striking a tall sycamore turned its green to gold we were now on the hills whence the water ran down to nourish the fat land and i could scarce believe that the garden spot on which our eyes feasted could be the scene of the blood and suffering of which we had heard here at last was the fairyland of my childhood the country beyond the blue wall  we went down the river that led into it with awes as though we were trespassers against god himselfas though he had made it too beautiful and too fruitful for the toilers of this earth and you who read this an hundred years hence may not believe the marvels of it to the pioneer and in particular to one born and bred in the scanty hard soil of the mountains nature had made it for her parkay and scented it with her own perfumes giant trees which had watched generations come and go some of which mayhap had been saplings when the norman came to england grew in grovesthe gnarled and twisted oak and that godsend to the settlers the sugarmaple the coffee tree with its drooping buds the mulberry the cherry and the plum the sassafras and the pawpaw the poplar and the sycamore slender maidens of the forest garbed in daintier colorsay and that resplendent brunette with the white flowers the magnolia and all underneath in the green shade enamelled banks which the birds themselves sought to rival  at length one afternoon we came to the grove of wild apple trees so lovingly spoken of by emigrants as the crab orchard and where formerly they had delighted to linger the plain near by was flecked with the brown backs of feeding buffalo but we dared not stop and pressed on to find a camp in the forest as we walked in the filtered sunlight we had a great fright polly ann and i shrill discordant cries suddenly burst from the branches above us and a flock of strange green birds flecked with red flew over our heads even tom intent upon the trail turned and laughed at polly ann as she stood clutching me  shucks said he theyre only paroquets  we made our camp in a little dell where there was short green grass by the brookside and steep banks overgrown with brambles on either hand tom knew the place and declared that we were within thirty miles of the station a giant oak had blown down across the water and cutting out a few branches of this we spread our blankets under it on the turf tethering our faithful beasts and cutting a quantity of peavine for their nights food we lay down to sleep tom taking the first watch  i had the second for tom trusted me now and glorying in that trust i was alert and vigilant a shy moon peeped at me between the trees and was fantastically reflected in the water the creek rippled over the limestone and an elk screamed in the forest far beyond when at length i had called weldon to take the third watch i lay down with a sense of peace soothed by the sweet odors of the night  i awoke suddenly i had been dreaming of nick temple and temple bow and my father coming back to me there with a great gash in his shoulder like weldons i lay for a moment dazed by the transition staring through the gray light then i sat up the soft stamping and snorting of the horses in my ears the sorrel mare had her nose high her tail twitching but there was no other sound in the leafy wilderness with a bound of returning sense i looked for weldon he had fallen asleep on the bank above his body dropped across the trunk of the oak i leaped on the trunk and made my way along it stepping over him until i reached and hid myself in the great roots of the tree on the bank above the cold shiver of the dawn was in my body as i waited and listened should i wake tom the vast forest was silent and yet in its shadowy depths my imagination drew moving forms i hesitated  the light grew the boles of the trees came out one by one through the purple the tangled mass down the creek took on a shade of green and a faint breath came from the southward the sorrel mare sniffed it and stamped then silence againa long silence could it be that the cane moved in the thicket or had my eyes deceived me i stared so hard that it seemed to rustle all over perhaps some deer were feeding there for it was no unusual thing when we rose in the morning to hear the whistle of a startled doe near our camping ground i was thoroughly frightened nowand yet i had the speculative scotch mind the thicket was some one hundred and fifty yards above and on the flooded lands at a bend if there were indians in it they could not see the sleeping forms of our party under me because of a bend in the stream they might have seen me though i had kept very still in the twisted roots of the oak and now i was cramped if indians were there they could determine our position well enough by the occasional stamping and snorting of the horses and this made my fear more probable for i had heard that horses and cattle often warned pioneers of the presence of redskins  another thing if they were a small party they would probably seek to surprise us by coming out of the cane into the creek bed above the bend and stalk down the creek if a large band they would surround and overpower us i drew the conclusion that it must be a small partyif a party at all and i would have given a shot in the arm to be able to see over the banks of the creek finally i decided to awake tom  it was no easy matter to get down to where he was without being seen by eyes in the cane i clung to the under branches of the oak finally reached the shelving bank and slid down slowly i touched him on the shoulder he awoke with a start and by instinct seized the rifle lying beside him  what is it davy he whispered  i told what had happened and my surmise he glanced then at the restless horses and nodded pointing up at the sleeping figure of weldon in full sight on the log the indians must have seen him  tom picked up the spare rifle  davy said he you stay here beside polly ann behind the oak you kin shoot with a rest but dont shoot said he earnestly for gods sake dont shoot unless youre sure to kill  i nodded for a moment he looked at the face of polly ann sleeping peacefully and the fierce light faded from his eyes he brushed her on the cheek and she awoke and smiled at him trustfully lovingly he put his finger to his lips  stay with davy he said turning to me he added when you wake weldon wake him easy so he put his hand in mine and gradually tightened it wake him that way and he wont jump  polly ann asked no questions she looked at tom and her soul was in her face she seized the pistol from the blanket then we watched him creeping down the creek on his belly close to the bank next we moved behind the fallen tree and i put my hand in weldons he woke with a sigh started but we drew him down behind the log presently he climbed cautiously up the bank and took station in the muddy roots of the tree then we waited watching tom with a prayer in our hearts those who have not felt it know not the fearfulness of waiting for an indian attack  at last tom reached the bend in the bank beside some redbud bushes and there he stayed a level shaft of light shot through the forest the birds twittering awoke a great hawk soared high in the blue over our heads an hour passed i had sighted the rifle among the yellow leaves of the fallen oak an hundred times but polly ann looked not once to the right or left her eyes and her prayers followed the form of her husband  then like the cracking of a great drovers whip a shot rang out in the stillness and my hands tightened over the riflestock a piece of bark struck me in the face and a dead leaf fluttered to the ground almost instantly there was another shot and a blue wisp of smoke rose from the redbud bushes where tom was the horses whinnied there was a rustle in the cane and silence weldon bent over  my god he whispered hoarsely he hit one tom hit one  i felt polly anns hand on my face  davy dear she said are ye hurt  no said i dazed and wondering why weldon had not been shot long ago as he slumbered i was burning to climb the bank and ask him whether he had seen the indian fall  again there was silencea silence even more awful than before the sun crept higher the magic of his rays turning the creek from black to crystal and the birds began to sing again and still there was no sign of the treacherous enemy that lurked about us could tom get back i glanced at polly ann the same question was written in her yearning eyes staring at the spot where the gray of his hunting shirt showed through the bushes at the bend suddenly her hand tightened on mine the hunting shirt was gone  after that in the intervals when my terror left me i tried to speculate upon the plan of the savages their own numbers could not be great and yet they must have known from our trace how few we were scanning the ground i noted that the forest was fairly clean of undergrowth on both sides of us below the stream ran straight but there were growths of cane and briers looking up i saw weldon faced about it was the obvious move  but where had tom gone  next my eye was caught by a little run fringed with bushes that curved around the cane near the bend i traced its course unconsciously bit by bit until it reached the edge of a bank not fifty feet away  all at once my breath left me through the tangle of bramble stems at the mouth of the run above naked brown shoulders there glared at me hideously streaked with red a face had my fancy lied i stared again until my eyes were blurred now tortured by doubt now so completely convinced that my fingers almost released the triggerfor i had thrown the sights into line over the tree i know not to this day whether i shot from determination or nervousness my shoulder bruised by the kick the smoke like a veil before my face it was some moments ere i knew that the air was full of whistling bullets and then the gun was torn from my hands and i saw polly ann ramming in a new charge  the pistol davy she cried  one torture was over another on crack after crack sounded from the forestfrom here and there and everywhere it seemedand with a song that like a hurtling insect ran the scale of notes the bullets buried themselves in the trunk of our oak with a chug once in a while i heard weldons answering shot but i remembered my promise to tom not to waste powder unless i were sure the agony was the breathing space we had while they crept nearer then we thought of tom and i dared not glance at polly ann for fear that the sight of her face would unnerve me  then a longing to kill seized me a longing so strange and fierce that i could scarce be still i know now that it comes in battle to all men and with intensity to the hunted and it explained to me more clearly what followed i fairly prayed for the sight of a painted form and time after time my fancy tricked me into the notion that i had one and even as i searched the brambles at the top of the run a puff of smoke rose out of them a bullet burying itself in the roots near weldon who fired in return i say that i have some notion of what possessed the man for he was crazed with passion at fighting the race which had so cruelly wronged him horrorstruck i saw him swing down from the bank splash through the water with raised tomahawk and gain the top of the run in less time than it takes me to write these words he had dragged a hideous naked warrior out of the brambles and with an avalanche of crumbling earth they slid into the waters of the creek polly ann and i stared transfixed at the fearful fight that followed nor can i give any adequate description of it weldon had struck through the brambles but the savage had taken the blow on his gunbarrel and broken the handle of the tomahawk and it was man to man as they rolled in the shallow water locked in a death embrace neither might reach for his knife neither was able to hold the other down weldons curses surcharged with hatred the indian straining silently save for a gasp or a guttural note the white a bearded madman the savage a devil with a glistening paintstreaked body his features now agonized as his muscles strained and cracked now lighted with a diabolical joy but the pentup rage of months gave the white man strength  polly ann and i were powerless for fear of shooting weldon and gazed absorbed at the fiendish scene with eyes not to be withdrawn the treetrunk shook a long bronze arm reached out from above and a painted face glowered at us from the very roots where weldon had lain that moment i took to be my last and in it i seemed to taste all eternity i heard but faintly a noise beyond it was the shock of the heavy indian falling on polly ann and me as we cowered under the trunk and even then there was an instant that we stood gazing at him as at a worm writhing in the clay it was she who fired the pistol and made the great hole in his head and so he twitched and died after that a confusion of shots warwhoops a vision of two naked forms flying from tree to tree towards the cane and thengod be praisedtoms voice shouting  polly ann polly ann  before she had reached the top of the bank tom had her in his arms and a dozen tall gray figures leaped the six feet into the stream and stopped my own eyes turned with theirs to see the body of poor weldon lying face downward in the water but beyond it a tragedy awaited me defiant immovable save for the heaving of his naked chest the savage who had killed him stood erect with folded arms facing us the smoke cleared away from a gleaming riflebarrel and the brave staggered and fell and died as silent as he stood his feathers making ripples in the stream it was coldblooded if you like but war in those days was to the death and knew no mercy the tall backwoodsman who had shot him waded across the stream and in the twinkling of an eye seized the scalplock and ran it round with his knife holding up the bleeding trophy with a shout staggering to my feet i stretched myself but i had been cramped so long that i tottered and would have fallen had not toms hand steadied me  davy he cried thank god little davy the varmints didnt get ye  and you tom i answered looking up at him bewildered with happiness  they was nearer than i suspicioned when i went off he said and looked at me curiously drat the little deevil he said affectionately and his voice trembled he took care of polly ann ill warrant  he carried me to the top of the bank where we were surrounded by the whole band of backwoodsmen  that he did cried polly ann and fetched a redskin yonder as clean as you could have done it tom  the little deevil exclaimed tom again  i looked up burning with this praise from tom for i had never thought of praise nor of anything save his happiness and polly anns i looked up and my eyes were caught and held with a strange fascination by fearless blue ones that gazed down into them i give you but a poor description of the owner of these blue eyes for personal magnetism springs not from one feature or another he was a young manperhaps five and twenty as i now know agewoodsmanclad squarebuilt sunreddened his hair might have been orange in one light and sandcolored in another with a boys sense of such things i knew that the other woodsmen were waiting for him to speak for they glanced at him expectantly  you had a near call mcchesney said he at length fortunate for you we were after this bandshot some of it to pieces yesterday morning he paused looking at tom with that quality of tribute which comes naturally to a leader of men by god he said i didnt think youd try it  my word is good colonel clark answered tom simply  young colonel clark glanced at the lithe figure of polly ann he seemed a man of few words for he did not add to his praise of toms achievement by complimenting her as captain sevier had done in fact he said nothing more but leaped down the bank and strode into the water where the body of weldon lay and dragged it out himself we gathered around it silently and two great tears rolled down polly anns cheeks as she parted the hair with tenderness and loosened the clenched hands nor did any of the tall woodsmen speak poor weldon the tragedy of his life and death was the tragedy of kentucky herself they buried him by the waterside where he had fallen  but there was little time for mourning on the border the burial finished the kentuckians splashed across the creek and one of them stooping with a shout at the mouth of the run lifted out of the brambles a painted body with drooping head and feathers trailing  ay mac he cried heres a sculp for ye  its davys exclaimed polly ann from the top of the bank davy shot that one  hooray for davy cried a huge strapping backwoodsman who stood beside her and the others laughingly took up the shout hooray for davy bring him over cowan the giant threw me on his shoulder as though i had been a fox leaped down and took the stream in two strides i little thought how often he was to carry me in days to come but i felt a great awe at the strength of him as i stared into his rough features and his veined and weathered skin he stood me down beside the indians body smiled as he whipped my hunting knife from my belt and said now davy take the sculp  nothing loath i seized the indian by the long scalplock while my big friend guided my hand and amid laughter and cheers i cut off my first trophy of war nor did i have any other feeling than fierce hatred of the race which had killed my father  those who have known armies in their discipline will find it difficult to understand the leadership of the border such leadership was granted only to those whose force and individuality compelled men to obey them i had my first glimpse of it that day this colonel clark to whom tom delivered mr robertsons letter was perchance the youngest man in the company that had rescued us saving only a slim lad of seventeen whom i noticed and envied and whose name was james ray colonel clark so i was told by my friend cowan held that title in kentucky by reason of his prowess  clark had been standing quietly on the bank while i had scalped my first redskin then he called tom mcchesney to him and questioned him closely about our journey the signs we had seen and finally the news in the watauga settlements while this was going on the others gathered round them  what now asked cowan when he had finished  back to harrodstown answered the colonel shortly  there was a brief silence followed by a hoarse murmur from a thickset man at the edge of the crowd who shouldered his way to the centre of it  we set out to hunt a fight and my pluck is to clean up we aint finished em yet  the man had a deep coarse voice that was a piece with his roughness  i reckon this band aint agoin to harry the station any more mcgary cried cowan  by job what did we come out for wholl take the trail with me  there were some who answered him and straightway they began to quarrel among themselves filling the woods with a babel of voices while i stood listening to these disputes with a boys awe of a mans quarrel what was my astonishment to feel a hand on my shoulder it was colonel clarks and he was not paying the least attention to the dispute  davy said he you look as if you could make a fire  yes sir i answered gasping  well said he make one  i lighted a piece of punk with the flint and wrapping it up in some dry brush soon had a blaze started looking up i caught his eye on me again  mrs mcchesney said colonel clark to polly ann you look as if you could make johnnycake have you any meal  that i have cried polly ann though its fair mouldy davy run and fetch it  i ran to the pack on the sorrel mare when i returned mr clark said  that seems a handy boy mrs mcchesney  handy cried polly ann i reckon hes more than handy didnt he save my life twice on our way out here  and how was that said the colonel  run and fetch some water davy said polly ann and straightway launched forth into a vivid description of my exploits as she mixed the meal nay she went so far as to tell how she came by me the young colonel listened gravely though with a gleam now and then in his blue eyes leaning on his long rifle he paid no manner of attention to the angry voices near bywhich conduct to me was little short of the marvellous  now davy said he at length the rest of your history  there is little of it sir i answered i was born in the yadkin country lived alone with my father who was a scotchman he hated a man named cameron took me to charlestown and left me with some kin of his who had a place called temple bow and went off to fight cameron and the cherokees there i gulped he was killed at cherokee ford andand i ran away from temple bow and found polly ann  this time i caught something of surprise on the colonels face  by thunder davy said he but you have a clean gift for brief narrative where did you learn it  my father was a gentleman once and taught me to speak and read i answered as i brought a flat piece of limestone for polly anns baking  and what would you like best to be when you grow up davy he asked  six feet said i so promptly that he laughed  faith said polly ann looking at me comically he may be many things but ill warrant hell never be that  i have often thought since that young mr clark showed much of the wisdom of the famous king of israel on that day polly ann cooked a piece of a deer which one of the woodsmen had with him and the quarrel died of itself when we sat down to this and the johnnycake by noon we had taken up the trace for harrodstown marching with scouts ahead and behind mr clark walked mostly alone seemingly wrapped in thought at times he had short talks with different men oftenesti noted with pridewith tom mcchesney and more than once when he halted he called me to him my answers to his questions seeming to amuse him indeed i became a kind of pet with the backwoodsmen cowan often flinging me to his shoulder as he swung along the pack was taken from the sorrel mare and divided among the party and polly ann made to ride that we might move the faster  it must have been the next afternoon about four that the rough stockade of harrodstown greeted our eyes as we stole cautiously to the edge of the forest and the sight of no roofs and spires could have been more welcome than that of these logs and cabins broiling in the midsummer sun at a little distance from the fort a silent testimony of siege the stumpy cleared fields were overgrown with weeds tall and rank the corn choked nearer the stockade where the keepers of the fort might venture out at times a more orderly growth met the eye it was young james ray whom colonel clark singled to creep with our message to the gates at six when the smoke was rising from the stone chimneys behind the palisades ray came back to say that all was well then we went forward quickly hands waved a welcome above the logs the great wooden gates swung open and at last we had reached the haven for which we had suffered so much mangy dogs barked at our feet men and women ran forward joyfully to seize our hands and greet us  and so we came to kaintuckee    chapter x harrodstown  the old forts like harrodstown and boonesboro and logans at st asaphs have long since passed away it is many many years since i lived through that summer of siege in harrodstown the horrors of it are faded and dim the discomforts lost to a boy thrilled with a new experience i have read in my old age the books of travellers in kentucky english and french who wrote much of squalor and strife and sin and little of those qualities that go to the conquest of an empire and the making of a people perchance my own pages may be colored by gratitude and love for the pioneers amongst whom i found myself and thankfulness to god that we had reached them alive  i know not how many had been cooped up in the little fort since the early spring awaiting the chance to go back to their weedchoked clearings the fort at harrodstown was like an hundred others i have since seen but sufficiently surprising to me then imagine a great parallelogram made of log cabins set end to end their common outside wall being the wall of the fort and loopholed at the four corners of the parallelogram the cabins jutted out with ports in the angle in order to give a flanking fire in case the savages reached the palisade and then there were huge log gates with watchtowers on either sides where sentries sat day and night scanning the forest line within the fort was a big common dotted with forest trees where such cattle as had been saved browsed on the scanty grass there had been but the one scrawny horse before our arrival  and the settlers how shall i describe them as they crowded around us inside the gate some stared at us with sallow faces and eyes brightened by the fever yet others had the red glow of health many of the men wore rough beards unkempt and yellow weatherworn hunting shirts often stained with blood the barefooted women wore sunbonnets and loose homespun gowns some of linen made from nettles while the children swarmed here and there and everywhere in any costume that chance had given them all seemingly talking at once they plied us with question after question of the trace the watauga settlements the news in the carolinys and how the war went  a lad is it this one said an irish voice near me and a woman the dear help us and whod ave thought to see a woman come over the mountain this year where did ye find them bill cowan  near the crab orchard and the lad killed and sculped a sixfoot brave  the saints save us and whatll be his name  davy said my friend  is it davy sure his namesake killed a giant too  and is he come along also said another his shy blue eyes and stiff blond hair gave him a strange appearance in a hunting shirt  hist to him who will ye be talkin about poulsson is it king david ye mane  there was a roar of laughter and this was my introduction to terence mccann and swein poulsson the fort being crowded we were put into a cabin with terence and cowan and cowans wifea tall gaunt woman with a sharp tongue and a kind heartand her four brats all hugemsmug together as cowan said and that night we supped upon dried buffalo meat and boiled nettletops for of such was the fare in harrodstown that summer  tom mcchesney kept his faith one other man was to keep his faith with the little communitygeorge rogers clark and i soon learned that trustworthiness is held in greater esteem in a border community than anywhere else of course the love of the frontier was in the grain of these men but what did they come back to day after day would the sun rise over the forest and beat down upon the little enclosure in which we were penned the row of cabins leaning against the stockade marked the boundaries of our diminutive world beyond them invisible lurked a relentless foe within the greater souls alone were calm and a mans worth was set down to a hairs breadth some were always to be found squatting on their doorsteps cursing the hour which had seen them depart for this land some wrestled and fought on the common for a fist fight with a fair field and no favor was a favorite amusement of the backwoodsmen my big friend cowan was the champion of these and often of an evening the whole of the inhabitants would gather near the spring to see him fight those who had the courage to stand up to him his muscles were like hickory wood and i have known a man insensible for a quarter of an hour after one of his blows strangely enough he never fought in anger and was the first to the spring for a gourd of water after the fight was over but tom mcchesney was the best wrestler of the lot and could make a wider leap than any other man in harrodstown  toms reputation did not end there for he became one of the two breadwinners of the station i would better have said meatwinners woe be to the incautious who lulled by a week of fancied security ventured out into the dishevelled field for a little food in the early days of the siege man after man had gone forth for game never to return until tom came one only had been successfulthat lad of seventeen whose achievements were the envy of my boyish soul james ray he slept in the cabin next to cowans and long before the dawn had revealed the forest line had been wont to steal out of the gates on the one scrawny horse the indians had left them gain the salt river and make his way thence through the water to some distant place where the listening savages could not hear his shot and now tom took his turn often did i sit with polly ann till midnight in the sentrys tower straining my ears for the owls hoot that warned us of his coming sometimes he was emptyhanded but sometimes a deer hung limp and black across his saddle or a pair of turkeys swung from his shoulder  arrah darlin said terence to polly ann tis yer husband and james is the jools av the fort sure i niver loved me father as i do thim  i would have given kingdoms in those days to have been seventeen and james ray when he was in the fort i dogged his footsteps and listened with a painful yearning to the stories of his escapes from the roving bands and as many a character is watered in its growth by heroworship so my own grew firmer in the contemplation of rays resourcefulness my strange life had far removed me from lads of my own age and he took a fancy to me perhaps because of the very persistence of my devotion to him i cleaned his gun filled his powder flask and ran to do his every bidding  i used in the hot summer days to lie under the elm tree and listen to the settlers talk about a man named henderson who had bought a great part of kentucky from the indians and had gone out with boone to found boonesboro some two years before they spoke of much that i did not understand concerning the discountenance by virginia of these claims speculating as to whether hendersons grants were good for some of them held these grants and others virginia grantsa fruitful source of quarrel between them some spoke too of washington and his ragged soldiers going up and down the old colonies and fighting for a freedom which there seemed little chance of getting but their anger seemed to blaze most fiercely when they spoke of a mysterious british general named hamilton whom they called the har buyer and who from his stronghold in the north country across the great ohio sent down these hordes of savages to harry us i learned to hate hamilton with the rest and pictured him with the visage of a fiend we laid at his door every outrage that had happened at the three stations and put upon him the blood of those who had been carried off to torture in the indian villages of the northern forests and whenamidst great excitementa spent runner would arrive from boonesboro or st asaphs and beg mr clark for a squad it was commonly with the first breath that came into his body that he cursed hamilton  so the summer wore away while we lived from hand to mouth on such scanty fare as the two of them shot and what we could venture to gather in the unkempt fields near the gates a winter of famine lurked ahead and men were goaded near to madness at the thought of clearings made and corn planted in the spring within reach of their hands as it were and they might not harvest it at length when a fortnight had passed and tom and ray had gone forth day after day without sight or fresh sign of indians the weight lifted from our hearts there were many things that might yet be planted and come to maturity before the late kentucky frosts  the pressure within the fort like a flood opened the gates of it despite the sturdily disapproving figure of a young man who stood silent under the sentry box leaning on his deckard he was colonel george rogers clark1 commanderinchief of the backwoodsmen of kentucky whose power was reenforced by that strange thing called an education it was this no doubt gave him command of words when he chose to use them   1 it appears that mr clark had not yet received the title of colonel though he held commandeditor    faith said terence as we passed him tis a foine man he is and a gintleman born wasnt it him gathered the convintion here in harrodstown last year that chose him and another to go to the virginia legislatoor and him but a lad ye might say the divil fly away wid his caution sure the redskins is as toired as us and gone home to the wives and childher bad cess to thim  and so the first day the gates were opened we went into the fields a little way and the next day a little farther they had once seemed to me an unexplored and forbidden country as i searched them with my eyes from the sentry boxes and yet i felt a shame to go with polly ann and mrs cowan and the women while james ray and tom sat with the guard of men between us and the forest line like a child on a holiday polly ann ran hither and thither among the stalks her black hair flying and a song on her lips  soon well be having a little home of our own davy she cried tom has the place chose on a knoll by the river and the land is rich with hickory and pawpaw i reckon we may be going there next week  caution being born into me with all the strength of a vice i said nothing whereupon she seized me in her strong hands and shook me  ye little imp said she while the women paused in their work to laugh at us  the boy is right polly ann said mrs harrod and hes got more sense than most of the men in the fort  ay that he has the gaunt mrs cowan put in eying me fiercely while she gave one of her own offsprings a slap that sent him spinning  whatever polly ann might have said would have been to the point but it was lost for just then the sound of a shot came down the wind and a half a score of women stampeded through the stalks carrying me down like a reed before them when i staggered to my feet polly ann and mrs cowan and mrs harrod were standing alone for there was little of fear in those three  shucks said mrs cowan i reckon its that jim ray shooting at a mark and she began to pick nettles again  vimmen is a shy critter remarked swein poulsson coming up i had a shrewd notion that he had run with the others  wimmen mrs cowan fairly roared wimmen tell us how ye went in march with the boys to fight the varmints at the sugar orchard swein  we all laughed for we loved him none the less his little blue eyes were perfectly solemn as he answered  ve send you fight injuns mit your tongue mrs cowan then we haf no more troubles  land of canaan cried she i reckon i could do more harm with it than you with a gun  there were many such false alarms in the bright days following and never a bullet sped from the shadow of the forest each day we went farther afield and each night trooped merrily in through the gates with hopes of homes and clearings rising in our heartsuntil the motionless figure of the young virginian met our eye it was then that men began to scoff at him behind his back though some spoke with sufficient backwoods bluntness to his face and yet he gave no sign of anger or impatience not so the other leaders no sooner did the danger seem past than bitter strife sprang up within the walls even the two captains were mortal enemies one was harrod a tall spare darkhaired man of great endurancea type of the best that conquered the land for the nation the other that hugh mcgary of whom i have spoken coarse and brutal if you like but fearless and a leader of men withal  a certain sunday morning i remember broke with a cloudflecked sky and as we were preparing to go afield with such ploughs as could be got together we were to sow turnips the loud sounds of a quarrel came from the elm at the spring with one accord men and women and children flocked thither and as we ran we heard mcgarys voice above the rest worming my way boylike through the crowd i came upon mcgary and harrod glaring at each other in the centre of it  by job theres no devil if ill stand back from my clearing and waste the rest of the summer for the fears of a pack of cowards ill take a posse and march to shawanee springs this day and see any man a fair fight that tries to stop me  and whos in command here demanded harrod  i am for one said mcgary with an oath and my corns on the ear ive held back long enough i tell you and ill starve this winter for you nor any one else  harrod turned  wheres clark he said to bowman  clark roared mcgary clark be dd yed think he was a woman he strode up to harrod until their faces almost touched and his voice shook with the intensity of his anger by gd you nor clark nor any one else will stop me i say he swung around and faced the people come on boys well fetch that corn or know the reason why  a responding murmur showed that the bulk of them were with him weary of the pentup life longing for action and starved for a good meal the anger of his many followers against clark and harrod was nigh as great as his he started roughly to shoulder his way out and whether from accident or design captain harrod slipped in front of him i never knew the thing that followed happened quickly as the catching of my breath i saw mcgary powdering his pan and harrod his and felt the crowd giving back like buffalo all at once the circle had vanished and the two men were standing not five paces apart with their rifles clutched across their bodies each watching catlike for the other to level it was a cry that startled usand them there was a vision of a woman flying across the common and we saw the dauntless mrs harrod snatching her husbands gun from his resisting hands so she saved his life and mcgarys  at this point colonel clark was seen coming from the gate when he got to harrod and mcgary the quarrel blazed up again but now it was between the three of them and clark took harrods rifle from mrs harrod and held it however it was presently decided that mcgary should wait one more day before going to his clearing whereupon the gates were opened the picked men going ahead to take station as a guard and soon we were hard at work ploughing here and mowing there and in another place putting seed in the ground in the cheer of the work hardships were forgotten and we paused now and again to laugh at some sally of terence mccanns or odd word of swein poulssons as the day wore on to afternoon a blue hazeharbinger of autumnsettled over fort and forest bees hummed in the air as they searched hither and thither amongst the flowers or shot straight as a bullet for a distant hive but presently a rifle cracked and we raised our heads  hist said terence the bhoys on watch is that warlike whin theres no redskins to kill they must be wastin good powdher on a three  i leaped upon a stump and scanned the line of sentries between us and the woods only their heads and shoulders appeared above the rank growth i saw them looking from one to another questioningly some shouting words i could not hear then i saw some running and next as i stood there wondering came another crack and then a volley like the noise of a great fire licking into dry wood and things that were not bees humming round about a distant man in a yellow hunting shirt stumbled and was drowned in the tangle as in water around me men dropped ploughhandles and women baskets and as we ran our legs grew numb and our bodies cold at a sound which had haunted us in dreams by nightthe warwhoop the deep and guttural song of it rose and fell with a horrid fierceness an agonized voice was in my ears and i halted ashamed it was polly anns  davy she cried davy have ye seen tom  two men dashed by i seized one by the fringe of his shirt and he flung me from my feet the other leaped me as i knelt  run ye fools he shouted but we stood still with yearning eyes staring back through the frantic forms for a sight of toms  ill go back i cried ill go back for him do you run to the fort for suddenly i seemed to forget my fear nor did even the hideous notes of the scalp halloo disturb me before polly ann could catch me i had turned and started stumbledi thought on a stumpand fallen headlong among the nettles with a stinging pain in my leg staggering to my feet i tried to run on fell again and putting down my hand found it smeared with blood a man came by paused an instant while his eye caught me and ran on again i shall remember his face and name to my dying day but there is no reason to put it down here in a few seconds space as i lay i suffered all the pains of captivity and of death by torture that cry of savage man an hundred times more frightful than savage beast sounding in my ears and plainly nearer now by half the first distance nearer and nearer yetand then i heard my name called i was lifted from the ground and found myself in the lithe arms of polly ann  set me down i screamed set me down and must have added some of the curses i had heard in the fort but she clutched me tightly god bless the memory of those frontier women and flew like a deer toward the gates over her shoulder i glanced back a spare three hundred yards away in a ragged line a hundred red devils were bounding after us with feathers flying and mouths open as they yelled again i cried to her to set me down but though her heart beat faster and her breath came shorter she held me the tighter second by second they gained on us relentlessly were we near the fort hoarse shouts answered the question but they seemed distanttoo distant the savages were gaining and polly anns breath quicker still she staggered but the brave soul had no thought of faltering i had a sight of a man on a plough horse with dangling harness coming up from somewhere of the man leaping off of ourselves being pitched on the animals bony back and clinging there at the gallop the man running at the side shots whistled over our heads and here was the brown fort its big gates swung together as we dashed through the narrowed opening then as he lifted us off i knew that the man who had saved us was tom himself the gates closed with a bang and a patter of bullets beat against them like rain  through the shouting and confusion came a cry in a voice i knew now pleading now commanding  open open for gods sake open  its ray open for ray rays out  some were seizing the bar to thrust it back when the heavy figure of mcgary crushed into the crowd beside it  by job ill shoot the man that touches it he shouted as he tore them away but the sturdiest of them went again to it and cursed him and while they fought backward and forward the lads mother mrs ray cried out to them to open in tones to rend their hearts but mcgary had gained the bar and swore perhaps wisely that he would not sacrifice the station for one man where was ray  where was ray indeed it seemed as if no man might live in the hellish storm that raged without the walls as if the very impetus of hate and fury would carry the ravages over the stockade to murder us into the turmoil at the gate came colonel clark sending the disputants this way and that to defend the fort mcgary to command one quarter harrod and bowman another and every man that could be found to a loophole while mrs ray continued to run up and down wringing her hands now facing one man now another some of her words came to me shrilly above the noise  he fed youhe fed you oh my god and you are gratefulgrateful when you were starving he risked his life  torn by anxiety for my friend i dragged myself into the nearest cabin and a man was fighting there in the halflight at the port the huge figure i knew to be my friend cowans and when he drew back to load i seized his arm shouting rays name although the lead was pattering on the other side of the logs cowan lifted me to the port and there stretched on the ground behind a stump within twenty feet of the walls was james even as i looked the puffs of dust at his side showed that the savages knew his refuge i saw him level and fire and then bill cowan set me down and began to ram in a charge with tremendous energy  was there no way to save ray i stood turning this problem in my mind subconsciously aware of cowans movements of his yells when he thought he had made a shot when polly ann appeared at the doorway darting in she fairly hauled me to the shakedown in the far corner  will ye bleed to death davy she cried as she slipped off my legging and bent over the wound her eye lighting on a gourdful of water on the puncheon table she tore a strip from her dress and washed and bound me deftly the bullet was in the flesh and gave me no great pain  lie there ye imp she commanded when she had finished  some ones under the bed said i for i had heard a movement  in an instant we were down on our knees on the hard dirt floor and there was a mans foot in a moccasin we both grabbed it and pulled bringing to life a person with little blue eyes and stiff blond hair  swein poulsson exclaimed polly ann giving him an involuntary kick may the devil give ye shame  swein poulsson rose to a sitting position and clasped his knees in his hands  i haf one great fright said he  send him into the common with the women in yere place mis mcchesney growled cowan who was loading  by tam said swein poulsson leaping to his feet i vill stay here und fight i am prave once again stooping down he searched under the bed pulled out his rifle powdered the pan and flying to the other port fired at that cowan left his post and snatched the rifle from poulssons hands  yere but wasting powder he cried angrily  then by tam i am as vell under the bed said poulsson vat can i do  i had it  dig i shouted and seizing the astonished cowans tomahawk from his belt i set to work furiously chopping at the dirt beneath the log wall dig so that james can get under  cowan gave me the one look swore a mighty oath and leaping to the port shouted to ray in a thundering voice what we were doing  dig roared cowan dig for the love of god for he cant hear me  the three of us set to work with all our might poulsson making great holes in the ground at every stroke polly ann scraping at the dirt with the gourd two feet below the surface we struck the edge of the lowest log and then it was poulsson who got into the hole with his hunting knifeperspiring muttering to himself working as one possessed with a fury while we scraped out the dirt from under him at length after what seemed an age of staring at his legs the ground caved on him and he would have smothered if we had not dragged him out by the heels sputtering and all powdered brown but there was the daylight under the log  again cowan shouted at ray and again but he did not understand it was then the miracle happened i have seen brave men and cowards since and i am as far as ever from distinguishing them before we knew it poulsson was in the hole once morehad wriggled out of it on the other side and was squirming in a hail of bullets towards ray there was a full minute of suspenseperhaps twoduring which the very rifles of the fort were silent though the popping in the weeds was redoubled and then the barrel of a deckard was poked through the hole after it came james ray himself and lastly poulsson and a great shout went out from the loopholes and was taken up by the women in the common                   swein poulsson had become a hero nor was he willing to lose any of the glamour which was a heros right as the indians fire slackened he went from cabin to cabin and if its occupants failed to mention the exploit some did fail so to do out of mischief swein would say  you did not see me safe james no i vill tell you joost how  it never leaked out that swein was first of all under the bed for polly ann and bill cowan and myself swore to keep the secret but they told how i had thought of digging the hole under the logsa happy circumstance which got me a reputation for wisdom beyond my years there was a certain scotchman at harrodstown called mcandrew and it was he gave me the nickname canny davy and i grew to have a sort of precocious fame in the station often captain harrod or bowman or some of the others would pause in their arguments and say gravely what does davy think of it this was not good for a boy and the wonder of it is that it did not make me altogether insupportable one effect it had on meto make me long even more earnestly to be a man  the impulse of my reputation led me farther a fortnight of more inactivity followed and then we ventured out into the fields once more but i went with the guard this time not with the womenthanks to a whim the men had for humoring me  arrah and beant he a man all but two feet said terence wid more brain than me an bill cowan and poulsson togither tis a foxs nose davy has for the divils bill sure he can smell thim the same as you an me kin see the red paint on their faces  i reckon thats true said bill cowan with solemnity and so he carried me off  at length the cattle were turned out to browse greedily through the clearing while we lay in the woods by the forest and listened to the sound of their bells but when they strayed too far i was often sent to drive them back once when this happened i followed them to the shade at the edge of the woods for it was noon and the sun beat down fiercely and there i sat for some time watching them as they lashed their sides with their tails and pawed the ground for experience is a good master whether or not the flies were all that troubled them i could not tell and no sound save the tinkle of their bells broke the noonday stillness making a circle i drove them back toward the fort much troubled in mind i told cowan but he laughed and said it was the flies yet i was not satisfied and finally stole back again to the place where i had found them i sat a long time hidden at the edge of the forest listening until my imagination tricked me into hearing those noises which i feared and yet longed for trembling i stole a little farther in the shade of the woods and then a little farther still the leaves rustled in the summers breeze patches of sunlight flickered on the mould the birds twittered and the squirrels scolded a chipmunk frightened me as he flew chattering along a log and yet i went on i came to the creek as it flowed silently in the shade stepped in and made my way slowly down it i know not how far walking in the water my eye alert to every movement about me at length i stopped and caught my breath before me in a glade opening out under great trees what seemed a myriad of forked sticks were piled against one another three by three and it struck me all in a heap that i had come upon a great encampment but the skeletons of the pyramid tents alone remained where were the skins was the camp deserted  for a while i stared through the brier leaves then i took a venture pushed on and found myself in the midst of the place it must have held near a thousand warriors all about me were gray heaps of ashes and bones of deer and elk and buffalo scattered some picked clean some with the meat and hide sticking to them impelled by a strong fascination i went hither and thither until a sound brought me to a standthe echoing crack of a distant rifle on the heels of it came another then several together and a faint shouting borne on the light wind terrorized i sought for shelter a pile of brush underlain by ashes was by and i crept into that the sounds continued but seemed to come no nearer and my courage returning i got out again and ran wildly through the camp toward the briers on the creek expecting every moment to be tumbled headlong by a bullet and when i reached the briers what between panting and the thumping of my heart i could for a few moments hear nothing then i ran on again up the creek heedless of cover stumbling over logs and trailing vines when all at once a dozen bronze forms glided with the speed of deer across my path ahead they splashed over the creek and were gone bewildered with fear i dropped under a fallen tree shouts were in my ears and the noise of men running i stood up and there not twenty paces away was colonel clark himself rushing toward me he halted with a cry raised his rifle and dropped it at the sight of my queer little figure covered with ashes  my god he cried its davy  they crossed the creek i shouted pointing the way they crossed the creek some twelve of them  ay he said staring at me and by this time the rest of the guard were come up they too stared with different exclamations on their lipscowan and bowman and tom mcchesney and terence mccann in front  and theres a great camp below i went on deserted where a thousand men have been  a campdeserted said clark quickly  yes i said yes but he had already started forward and seized me by the arm  lead on he cried show it to us he went ahead with me travelling so fast that i must needs run to keep up and fairly lifting me over the logs but when we came in sight of the place he darted forward alone and went through it like a hound on the trail the others followed him crying out at the size of the place and poking among the ashes at length they all took up the trail for a way down the creek presently clark called a halt  i reckon that theyve made for the ohio he said and at this judgment from him the guard gave a cheer that might almost have been heard in the fields around the fort the terror that had hovered over us all that long summer was lifted at last  you may be sure that cowan carried me back to the station to think it was davy that found it he cried again and again to think it was davy found it  and wasnt it me that said he could smell the divils said terence as he circled around us in a mimic war dance and when from the fort they saw us coming across the fields they opened the gates in astonishment and on hearing the news gave themselves over to the wildest rejoicing for the backwoodsmen were children of nature bill cowan ran for the fiddle which he had carried so carefully over the mountain and that night we had jigs and reels on the common while the big fellow played billy of the wild woods and jump juba with all his might and the pine knots threw their fitful red light on the wild scenes of merriment i must have cut a queer little figure as i sat between cowan and tom watching the dance for presently colonel clark came up to us laughing in his quiet way  davy said he there is another great man here who would like to see you and led me away wondering i went with him toward the gate burning all over with pride at this attention and beside a torch there a broadshouldered figure was standing at sight of whom i had a start of remembrance  do you know who that is davy said colonel clark  its mr daniel boone said i  by thunder said clark i believe the boy is a wizard while mr boones broad mouth was creased into a smile and there was a trace of astonishment too in his kindly eye  mr boone came to my fathers cabin on the yadkin once i said he taught me to skin a deer  ay that i did exclaimed mr boone and i said yed make a woodsman sometime  mr boone it seemed had come over from boonesboro to consult with colonel clark on certain matters and had but just arrived but so modest was he that he would not let it be known that he was in the station for fear of interrupting the pleasure he was much the same as i had known him only grown older and his reputation now increased to vastness he and clark sat on a door log talking for a long time on kentucky matters the strength of the forts the prospect of new settlers that autumn of the british policy and finally of a journey which colonel clark was soon to make back to virginia across the mountains they seemed not to mind my presence at length colonel clark turned to me with that quiet jocose way he had when relaxed  davy said he well see how much of a general you are what would you do if a scoundrel named hamilton far away at detroit was bribing all the redskins he could find north of the ohio to come down and scalp your men  id go for hamilton i answered  by god exclaimed clark striking mr boone on the knee thats what id do    chapter xi fragmentary  mr boones visit lasted but a day i was a great deal with colonel clark in the few weeks that followed before his departure for virginia he held himself a little aloof as a leader should from the captains in the station without seeming to offend them but he had a fancy for james ray and for me and he often took me into the woods with him by day and talked with me of an evening  im going away to virginia davy he said will you not go with me well see williamsburg and come back in the spring and ill have you a little rifle made  my look must have been wistful  i cant leave polly ann and tom i answered  well he said i like that faith to your friends is a big equipment for life  but why are you going i asked  because i love kentucky best of all things in the world he answered smiling  and what are you going to do i insisted  ah he said that i cant tell even to you  to catch hamilton i ventured at random  he looked at me queerly  would you go along davy said he laughing now  would you take tom  among the first answered colonel clark heartily  we were seated under the elm near the spring and at that instant i saw tom coming toward us i jumped up thinking to please him by this intelligence when colonel clark pulled me down again  davy said he almost roughly i thought remember that we have been joking do you understandjoking you have a tongue in your mouth but sense enough in your head i believe to hold it he turned to tom mcchesney this is a queer lad you brought us said he  hes a little deevil agreed tom for that had become a formula with him  it was all very mysterious to me and i lay awake many a night with curiosity trying to solve a puzzle that was none of my business and one day to cap the matter two woodsmen arrived at harrodstown with clothes frayed and bodies lean from a long journey not one of the hundred questions with which they were beset would they answer nor say where they had been or why save that they had carried out certain orders of clark who was locked up with them in a cabin for several hours  the first of october the day of colonel clarks departure dawned crisp and clear he was to take with him the disheartened and the cowed the weaklings who loved neither work nor exposure nor danger and before he set out of the gate he made a little speech to the assembled people  my friends he said you know me i put the interests of kentucky before my own last year when i left to represent her at williamsburg there were some who said i would desert her it was for her sake i made that journey suffered the tortures of hell from scalded feet was near to dying in the mountains it was for her sake that i importuned the governor and council for powder and lead and when they refused it i said to them gentlemen a country that is not worth defending is not worth claiming  at these words the settlers gave a great shout waving their coonskin hats in the air  ay that ye did cried bill cowan and got the amminition  i made that journey for her sake i say colonel clark continued and even so i am making this one i pray you trust me and god bless and keep you while i am gone  he did not forget to speak to me as he walked between our lines and told me to be a good boy and that he would see me in the spring some of the women shed tears as he passed through the gate and many of us climbed to sentry box and cabin roof that we might see the last of the little company wending its way across the fields a motley company it was the refuse of the station headed by its cherished captain so they started back over the weary road that led to that now faraway land of civilization and safety  during the balmy indian summer when the sharper lines of nature are softened by the haze some came to us from across the mountains to make up for the deserters from time to time a little group would straggle to the gates of the station weary and footsore but overjoyed at the sight of white faces again the fathers walking ahead with watchful eyes the women and older children driving the horses and the babies slung to the pack in hickory withes nay some of our best citizens came to kentucky swinging to the tail of a patient animal the indians were still abroad and in small war parties darted hither and thither with incredible swiftness and at night we would gather at the fire around our new emigrants to listen to the stories they had to tellfamiliar stories to all of us sometimes it had been the gobble of a wild turkey that had lured to danger again a woodowl had cried strangely in the night  winter came and passedsomehow i cannot dwell here on the tediousness of it and the one bright spot it has left in my memory concerns polly ann did man woman or child fall sick it was polly ann who nursed them she had by nature the godgiven gift of healing knew by heart all the simple remedies that backwoods lore had inherited from the north of ireland or borrowed from the indians her sympathy and lovingkindness did more than these her never tiring and ever cheerful watchfulness she was deft too was polly ann and spun from nettle bark many a cut of linen that could scarce be told from flax before the sap began to run again in the maples there was not a soul in harrodstown who did not love her and i truly believe that most of them would have risked their lives to do her bidding  then came the sugaring the warm days and the freezing nights when the earth stirs in her sleep and the taps drip from red sunrise to red sunset old and young went to the camps the women and children boiling and graining the squads of men posted in guards round about and after that the days flew so quickly that it seemed as if the woods had burst suddenly into white flower and it was spring again and thena joy to be long rememberedi went on a hunting trip with tom and cowan and three others where the kentucky tumbles between its darkly wooded cliffs and other wonders of that strange land i saw then for the first time great licks trampled down for acres by the wild herds where the salt water oozes out of the hoofprints on the edge of one of these licks we paused and stared breathless at giant bones sticking here and there in the black mud and great skulls of fearful beasts halfembedded this was called the big bone lick and some travellers that went before us had made their tents with the thighs of these monsters of a past age  a danger past is oft a danger forgotten men went out to build the homes of which they had dreamed through the long winter axes rang amidst the white dogwoods and the crabs and redbuds and there were riotous lograisings in the clearings but i think the building of toms house was the most joyous occasion of all and for none in the settlement would men work more willingly than for him and polly ann the cabin went up as if by magic it stood on a rise upon the bank of the river in a grove of oaks and hickories with a big persimmon tree in front of the door it was in the shade of this tree that polly ann sat watching tom and me through the mild spring days as we barked the roof and none ever felt greater joy and pride in a home than she we had our first supper on a wide puncheon under the persimmon tree on the few pewter plates we had fetched across the mountain the blue smoke from our own hearth rising in the valley until the cold night air spread it out in a line above us while the horses grazed at the rivers edge  after that we went to ploughing an occupation which tom fancied but little for he loved the life of a hunter best of all but there was corn to be raised and fodder for the horses and a truckpatch to be cleared near the house  one day a great event happenedand after the manner of many great events it began in mystery leaping on the roan mare i was riding like mad for harrodstown to fetch mrs cowan and she when she heard the summons abandoned a turkey on the spit pitched her brats out of the door seized the mare and dashing through the gates at a gallop left me to make my way back afoot scenting a sensation i hurried along the wooded trace at a dog trot and when i came in sight of the cabin there was mrs cowan sitting on the step holding in her long but motherly arms something bundled up in nettle linen while tom stood sheepishly by staring at it  shucks mrs cowan was saying loudly i reckon yere as little use today as swein poulssonstandin there on one foot ye anger mejust grinning at it like a fooland yer own doin have ye forgot how to talk  tom grinned the more but was saved the effort of a reply by a loud noise from the bundle  heres another cried mrs cowan to me ye neednt act as if it was an animal faith yereself was like that once all red an crinkled but i warrant ye didnt have the heft and she lifted it judicially a grand baby attacking tom again and yere no more worthy to be his father than davy here  then i heard a voice calling me and pushing past mrs cowan i ran into the cabin polly ann lay on the log bedstead and she turned to mine a face radiant with a happiness i had not imagined  oh davy have ye seen him have ye seen little tom davy i reckon ill never be so happy again fetch him here mrs cowan  mrs cowan with a glance of contempt at tom and me put the bundle tenderly down on the coarse brown sheet beside her  poor little tom only the first fortnight of his existence was spent in peace i have a pathetic memory of it allof our little home of our hopes for it of our days of labor and nights of planning to make it complete and then one morning when the three of us were turning over the black loam in the patch while the baby slept peacefully in the shade a sound came to our ears that made us pause and listen with bated breath it was the sound of many guns muffled in the distant forest with a cry polly ann flew to the hickory cradle under the tree tom sprang for the rifle that was never far from his side while with a kind of instinct i ran to catch the spancelled horses by the river in silence and sorrow we fled through the tall cane nor dared to take one last look at the cabin or the fields lying black in the spring sunlight the shots had ceased but ere we had reached the little clearing mccann had made they began again though as distant as before tom went ahead while i led the mare and polly ann clutched the child to her breast but when we came in sight of the fort across the clearings the gates were closed there was nothing to do but cower in the thicket listening while the battle went on afar polly ann trying to still the cries of the child lest they should bring death upon us at length the shooting ceased stillness reigned then came a faint halloo and out of the forest beyond us a man rode waving his hat at the fort after him came others the gates opened and we rushed pellmell across the fields to safety  the indians had shot at a party shelling corn at captain bowmans plantation and killed two while the others had taken refuge in the crib fired at from every brake james ray had ridden to harrodstown for succor and the savages had been beaten off but only the foolhardy returned to their clearings now we were on the edge of another dreaded summer of siege the prospect of banishment from the homes we could almost see staring us in the face and the labors of the spring lost again there was bitter talk within the gates that night and many declared angrily that colonel clark had abandoned us but i remembered what he had said and had faith in him  it was that very night too i sat with cowan who had duty in one of the sentry boxes and we heard a voice calling softly under us fearing treachery cowan cried out for a sign then the answer came back loudly to open to a runner with a message from colonel clark to captain harrod cowan let the man in while i ran for the captain and in five minutes it seemed as if every man and woman and child in the fort were awake and crowding around the man by the gates their eager faces reddened by the smoking pine knots where was clark what had he been doing had he deserted them  deserted ye cried the runner and swore a great oath wasnt clark even then on the ohio raising a great army with authority from the commonwealth of virginia to rid them of the red scourge and would they desert him or would they be men and bring from harrodstown the company he asked for then captain harrod read the letter asking him to raise the company and before day had dawned they were ready for the word to marchready to leave cabin and clearing and wife and child trusting in clarks judgment for time and place never were volunteers mustered more quickly than in that cool april night by the gates of harrodstown station  and well fetch davy along for luck cried cowan catching sight of me beside him  sure well be wanting a dhrummer by said mccann  and so they enrolled me    chapter xii the campaign begins  davy take care of my tom cried polly ann  i can see her now standing among the women by the great hewn gateposts with little tom in her arms holding him out to us as we filed by and the vision of his little round face haunted tom and me for many weary miles of our tramp through the wilderness i have often thought since that that march of the volunteer company to join clark at the falls of the ohio was a superb example of confidence in one man and scarce to be equalled in history  in less than a week we of captain harrods little company stood on a forestclad bank gazing spellbound at the troubled waters of a mighty river that river was the ohio and it divided us from the strange north country whence the savages came from below the angry voice of the great falls cried out to us unceasingly smoke rose through the treetops of the island opposite and through the new gaps of its forest cabins could be seen and presently at a signal from us a big flatboat left its shore swung out and circled on the polished current and grounded at length in the mud below us a dozen tall boatmen buckskinclad dropped the big oars and leaped out on the bank with a yell of greeting at the head of them was a man of huge frame and long light hair falling down over the collar of his hunting shirt he wrung captain harrods hand  that theres simon kenton davy said cowan as we stood watching them  i ran forward for a better look at the backwoods hercules the tales of whose prowess had helped to while away many a winters night in harrodstown station bigfeatured and stern yet he had the kindly eye of the most indomitable of frontier fighters and i doubted not the truth of what was said of himthat he could kill any redskin handtohand  clarks thar he was saying to captain harrod god knows what his pluck is he aint said a word  he doesnt say whar hes going said harrod  not a notion answered kenton hes the greatest man to keep his mouth shut i ever saw he kept at the governor of virginny till he gave him twelve hundred pounds in continentals and power to raise troops then clark fetched a circle for fort pitt raised some troops thar and in virginny and some about red stone and come down the ohio here with em in a lot of flatboats now that yeve got here the kentucky boys is all in i come over with montgomery and dillards here from the holston country with a company  well said captain harrod i reckon well report  i went among the first boatload and as the men strained against the current kenton explained that colonel clark had brought a number of emigrants down the river with him that he purposed to leave them on this island with a little force that they might raise corn and provisions during the summer and that he had called the place corn island  sure theres the colonel himself cried terence mccann who was in the bow and indeed i could pick out the familiar figure among the hundred frontiersmen that gathered among the stumps at the landingplace as our keel scraped they gave a shout that rattled in the forest behind them and clark came down to the waterside  i knew that harrodstown wouldnt fail me he said and called every man by name as we waded ashore when i came splashing along after tom he pulled me from the water with his two hands  colonel said terence mccann weve brought ye a dhrummer by  wed have no luck at all without him said cowan and the men laughed  can you walk an hundred miles without food davy asked colonel clark eying me gravely  faith hes lean as a wolf and no stomach to hinder him said terence seeing me look troubled ill not be missing the bit of food the likes of him would eat  and as for the heft of him added cowan mac and ill not feel it  colonel clark laughed well boys he said if you must have him you must his excellency gave me no instructions about a drummer but well take you davy  in those days he was a man that wasted no time was colonel clark and within the hour our little detachment had joined the others felling trees and shaping the logends for the cabins that night as tom and cowan and mccann and james ray lay around their fire taking a wellearned rest a man broke excitedly into the light with a kettleshaped object balanced on his head which he set down in front of us the man proved to be swein poulsson and the object a big drum and he straightway began to beat upon it a tattoo with improvised drumsticks  a red stone man he cried a red stone man he have it in the flatboat it is for tavy  the saints be good to us said terence if it isnt the kings own drum he has and sure enough on the head of it gleamed the royal arms of england and on the other side as we turned it over the device of a regiment they flung the sling about my neck and the next day when the little army drew up for parade among the stumps there i was at the end of the line and prouder than any man in the ranks and colonel clark coming to my end of the line paused and smiled and patted me kindly on the cheek  have you put this man on the roll harrod says he  no colonel answers captain harrod amid the laughter of the men at my end  what says the colonel what an oversight from this day he is drummer boy and orderly to the commanderinchief beat the retreat my man  i did my best and as the men broke ranks they crowded around me laughing and joking and cowan picked me up drum and all and carried me off i rapping furiously the while  and so i became a kind of handy boy for the whole regiment from the colonel down for i was willing and glad to work i cooked the colonels meals roasting the turkey breasts and saddles of venison that the hunters brought in from the mainland and even made him journeycake a trick which polly ann had taught me and when i went about the island if a man were loafing he would seize his axe and cry heres davy hell tell the colonel on me thanks to the jokes of terence mccann i gained an owllike reputation for wisdom amongst these superstitious backwoodsmen and they came verily to believe that upon my existence depended the success of the campaign but day after day passed and no sign from colonel clark of his intentions  theres a good lad said terence hell be telling us where were going  i was asked the same question by a score or more but colonel clark kept his own counsel he himself was everywhere during the days that followed superintending the work on the blockhouse we were building and eying the men rumor had it that he was sorting out the sheep from the goats silently choosing those who were to remain on the island and those who were to take part in the campaign  at length the blockhouse stood finished amid the yellow stumps of the great trees the trunks of which were in its walls and suddenly the order went forth for the men to draw up in front of it by companies with the families of the emigrants behind them it was a picture to fix itself in a boys mind and one that i have never forgotten the line of backwoodsmen as fine a lot of men as i ever wish to see bronzed by the june sun strong and tireless as the wild animals of the forest stood expectant with rifles grounded and beside the tallest at the end of the line was a diminutive figure with a drum hung in front of it the early summer wind rustled in the forest and the never ending song of the great falls sounded from afar apart squareshouldered and indomitable stood a young man of twentysix  my friends and neighbors he said in a firm voice there is scarce a man standing among you today who has not suffered at the hands of savages some of you have seen wives and children killed before your eyesor dragged into captivity none of you can today call the home for which he has risked so much his own and who i ask you is to blame for this hideous war whose gold is it that buys guns and powder and lead to send the shawnee and the iroquois and algonquin on the warpath  he paused and a hoarse murmur of anger ran along the ranks  whose gold but georges by the grace of god king of great britain and ireland and what minions distribute it abbott at kaskaskia for one and hamilton at detroit the hair buyer for another  when he spoke hamiltons name his voice was nearly drowned by imprecations  silence cried clark sternly and they were silent my friends the best way for a man to defend himself is to maim his enemy one year since when you did me the honor to choose me commanderinchief of your militia in kentucky i sent two scouts to kaskaskia a dozen years ago the french owned that place and st vincent and detroit and the people there are still french my men brought back word that the french feared the long knives as the indians call us on the first of october i went to virginia and some of you thought again that i had deserted you i went to williamsburg and wrestled with governor patrick henry and his council with mr jefferson and mr mason and mr wythe virginia had no troops to send us and her men were fighting barefoot with washington against the armies of the british king but the governor gave me twelve hundred pounds in paper and with it i have raised the little force that we have here and with it we will carry the war into hamiltons country on the swift waters of this great river which flows past us have come tidings today and god himself has sent them tomorrow would have been too late the ships and armies of the french king are on their way across the ocean to help us fight the tyrant and this is the news that we bear to the kaskaskias when they hear this the french of those towns will not fight against us my friends we are going to conquer an empire for liberty and i can look onward he cried in a burst of inspired eloquence sweeping his arm to the northward toward the forests on the far side of the ohio i can look onward to the day when these lands will be filled with the cities of a great republic and who among you will falter at such a call  there was a brief silence and then a shout went up from the ranks that drowned the noise of the falls and many fell into antics some throwing their coonskin hats in the air and others cursing and scalping hamilton in mockery while i pounded on the drum with all my might but when we had broken ranks the rumor was whispered about that the holston company had not cheered and indeed the rest of the day these men went about plainly morose and discontentedsome saying openly and with much justice though we failed to see it then that they had their own families and settlements to defend from the southern indians and chickamauga bandits and could not undertake kentuckys fight at that time and when the enthusiasm had burned away a little the disaffection spread and some even of the kentuckians began to murmur against clark for faith or genius was needful to inspire men to his plan one of the malcontents from boonesboro came to our fire to argue  hes mad as a medicine man is clark to go into that country with less than two hundred rifles and hell force us will he id as lief have the king for a master  he brought every man in our circle to his feetray mccann cowan and tom but tom was nearest and words not coming easily to him he fell on the boonesboro man instead and they fought it out for ten minutes in the firelight with half the regiment around them at the end of it when the malcontents were carrying their champion away they were stopped suddenly at the sight of one bursting through the circle into the light and a hush fell upon the quarrel it was colonel clark  are you hurt mcchesney he demanded  i reckon not much colonel said tom grinning as he wiped his face  if any man deserts this camp tonight cried colonel clark swinging around i swear by god to have him chased and brought back and punished as he deserves captain harrod set a guard  i pass quickly over the rest of the incident how the holston men and some others escaped in the night in spite of our guard and swam the river on logs how at dawn we found them gone and kenton and harrod and brave captain montgomery set out in pursuit with cowan and tom and ray all day they rode relentless and the next evening returned with but eight weary and sullen fugitives of all those who had deserted  the next day the sun rose on a smiling world the polished reaches of the river golden mirrors reflecting the forests green and we were astir with the light preparing for our journey into the unknown country at seven we embarked by companies in the flatboats waving a farewell to those who were to be left behind some stayed through inclination and disaffection others because colonel clark did not deem them equal to the task but swein poulsson came with tears in his little blue eyes he had begged the colonel to take him and i remember him well on that june morning his red face perspiring under the white bristles of his hair as he strained at the big oar for we must needs pull a mile up the stream ere we could reach the passage in which to shoot downward to the falls suddenly poulsson dropped his handle causing the boat to swing round in the stream while the men damned him paying them no attention he stood pointing into the blinding disk of the sun across the edge of it a piece was bitten out in blackness  mein gott he cried the world is being ended just now  the holy saints remember us this day said mccann missing a stroke to cross himself will ye pull ye damned dutchman or well be the first to slide into hell this is no kind of a place at all at all  by this time the men all along the line of boats had seen it and many faltered clarks voice could be heard across the waters urging them to pull while the bows swept across the current they obeyed him but steadily the blackness ate out the light and a weird gloaming overspread the scene river and forest became stern the men silent the more ignorant were in fear of a cataclysm the others taking it for an omen  shucks said tom when appealed to ive seed it afore and it come all right again  clarks boat rounded the shoal next our turn came and then the whole line was gliding down the river the rising roar of the angry waters with which we were soon to grapple coming to us with an added grimness and now but a faint rim of light saved us from utter darkness big bill cowan undaunted in war stared at me with fright written on his face  and what ll ye think of it davy he said  i glanced at the figure of our commander in the boat ahead and took courage  its hamiltons scalp hanging by a lock i answered pointing to what was left of the sun soon it will be off and then well have light again  to my surprise he snatched me from the thwart and held me up with a shout and i saw colonel clark turn and look back  davy says the har buyers sculp hangs by the lock boys he shouted pointing at the sun  the word was cried from boat to boat and we could see the men pointing upwards and laughing and then as the light began to grow we were in the midst of the tumbling waters the steersmen straining now right now left to keep the prows in the smooth reaches between rock and bar we gained the still pools below the sun came out once more and smiled on the landscape and the spirits of the men reviving burst all bounds  thus i earned my reputation as a prophet  four days and nights we rowed down the great river our oars doublemanned for fear that our coming might be heralded to the french towns we made our first camp on a green little island at the mouth of the cherokee as we then called the tennessee and there i set about cooking a turkey for colonel clark which ray had shot chancing to look up i saw the colonel himself watching me  how is this davy said he i hear that you have saved my army for me before we have met the enemy  i did not know it sir i answered  well said he if you have learned to turn an evil omen into a good sign you know more than some generals what ails you now  theres a pirogue sir i cried staring and pointing  where said he alert all at once here mcchesney take a crew and put out after them  he had scarcely spoken ere tom and his men were rowing into the sunset the whole of our little army watching from the bank presently the other boat was seen coming back with ours and five strange woodsmen stepped ashore our men pressing around them but clark flew to the spot the men giving back  whos the leader here he demanded  a tall man stepped forward  i am said he bewildered but defiant  your name  john duff he answered as though against his will  your business  hunters said duff and i reckon were in our rights  ill judge of that said our colonel where are you from  thats no secret neither kaskasky ten days gone  at that there was a murmur of surprise from our companies clark turned  get your men back he said to the captains who stood about them and all of them not moving get your men back i say ill have it known whos in command here  at that the men retired who commands at kaskaskia he demanded of duff  monseer rocheblave a frenchy holding a british commission said duff and the british governor abbott has left post st vincent and gone to detroit who be you he added suspiciously be you rebels  colonel clark is my name and i am in the service of the commonwealth of virginia  duff uttered an exclamatory oath and his manner changed be you clark he said with respect and youre going after kaskasky wal the mility is prime and the injun scouts is keeping a good lookout but colonel ill tell ye something the frenchies is etarnal afeard of the long knives my god theyve got the notion that if you ketch em youll burn and scalp em same as the red sticks  good was all that clark answered  i reckon i dont know much about what the rebels is fighting for said john duff but i like your looks colonel and wharever youre going therell be a fight me and my boys would kinder like to go along  clark did not answer at once but looked john duff and his men over carefully  will you take the oath of allegiance to virginia and the continental congress he asked at length  i reckon it wont pizen us said john duff  hold up your hands said clark and they took the oath now my men said he you will be assigned to companies does any one among you know the old french trail from massacre to kaskaskia  why exclaimed john duff why johnny saunders here can tread it in the dark like the road to the grogshop  john saunders loose limbed grinning sheepishly shuffled forward and clark shot a dozen questions at him one after another yes the trail had been blazed the lord knew how long ago by the french and given up when they left massacre  look you said clark to him i am not a man to stand trifling if there is any deception in this you will be shot without mercy  and good riddance said john duff boys were rebels now steer clear of the har buyer    chapter xiii kaskaskia  for one more day we floated downward on the face of the waters between the forest walls of the wilderness and at length we landed in a little gully on the north shore of the river and there we hid our boats  davy said colonel clark lets walk about a bit tell me where you learned to be so silent  my father did not like to be talked to i answered except when he was drinking  he gave me a strange look many the stroll i took with him afterwards when he sought to relax himself from the cares which the campaign had put upon him this night was still and clear the west all yellow with the departing light and the mists coming on the river and presently as we strayed down the shore we came upon a strange sight the same being a huge fort rising from the waterside all overgrown with brush and saplings and tall weeds the palisades that held its earthenwork were rotten and crumbling and the mighty bastions of its corners sliding away behind the fort at the end farthest from the river we came upon gravelled walks hidden by the rank growth where the soldiers of his most christian majesty once paraded lost in thought clark stood on the parapet watching the water gliding by until the darkness hid itnay until the stars came and made golden dimples upon its surface but as we went back to the camp again he told me how the french had tried once to conquer this vast country and failed leaving to the spaniards the endless stretch beyond the mississippi called louisiana and this part to the english and he told me likewise that this fort in the days of its glory had been called massacre from a bloody event which had happened there more than threescore years before  threescore years i exclaimed longing to see the men of this race which had set up these monuments only to abandon them  ay lad he answered before you or i were born and before our fathers were born the french missionaries and soldiers threaded this wilderness and they called this river la belle rivierethe beautiful river  and shall i see that race at kaskaskia i asked wondering  that you shall he cried with a force that left no doubt in my mind  in the morning we broke camp and started off for the strange place which we hoped to capture a hundred miles it was across the trackless wilds and each man was ordered to carry on his back provisions for four days only  herr gott cried swein poulsson from the bottom of a flatboat whence he was tossing out venison flitches four day und vat is it ve eat then  frenchies sure said terence therell be plenty av thim for a season faith i do hear theyre tinder as lambs  youll no set tooth in the frenchies the pessimistic mcandrew put in wi five thousand redskins aboot and they lying in wait the colonels no vera mindful of that im thinking  will ye hush ye illomened hound cried cowan angrily pitch him in the crick mac  tom was diverted from this duty by a loud quarrel between captain harrod and five men of the company who wanted scout duty and on the heels of that came another turmoil occasioned by cowans dropping my drum into the water while he and mccann and tom were fishing it out colonel clark himself appeared quelled the mutiny that harrod had on his hands and bade the men sternly to get into ranks  what foolishness is this he said eying the dripping drum  sure colonel said mccann swinging it on his back wed have no heart in us at kaskasky widout the rattle of it in our ears bill cowan and me will not be feeling the heft of it bechune us  get into ranks said the colonel amusement struggling with the anger in his face as he turned on his heel his wisdom well knew when to humor a man and when to chastise  arrah said terence as he took his place id as soon lave me gun behind as davy and the dhrum  methinks i can see now as i write the long file of woodsmen with their swinging stride planting one foot before the other even as the indian himself threaded the wilderness though my legs were short i had both sinew and training and now i was at one end of the line and now at the other and often with a laugh some giant would hand his gun to a neighbor swing me to his shoulder and so give me a lift for a weary mile or two and perchance whisper to me to put down my hand into the wallet of his shirt where i would find a choice morsel which he had saved for his supper sometimes i trotted beside the colonel himself listening as he talked to this man or that and thus i got the gravest notion of the daring of this undertaking and of the dangers ahead of us this north country was infested with indians allies of the english and friends of the french their subjects and the fact was never for an instant absent from our minds that our little band might at any moment run into a thousand warriors be overpowered and massacred or worst of all that our coming might have been heralded to kaskaskia  for three days we marched in the green shade of the primeval wood nor saw the sky save in blue patches here and there again we toiled for hours through the coffeecolored waters of the swamps but the third day brought us to the first of those strange clearings which the french call prairies where the long grass ripples like a lake in the summer wind here we first knew raging thirst and longed for the loamspecked water we had scorned as our tired feet tore through the grass for saunders our guide took a line across the open in plain sight of any eye that might be watching from the forest cover but at length our column wavered and halted by reason of some disturbance at the head of it conjectures in our company the rear guard became rife at once  run davy darlin an see what the throuble is said terence  nothing loath i made my way to the head of the column where bowmans company had broken ranks and stood in a ring up to their thighs in the grass in the centre of the ring standing on one foot before our angry colonel was saunders  now what does this mean demanded clark my eye is on you and youve boxed the compass in this last hour  saunders jaw dropped  im guiding you right he answered with that sullenness which comes to his kind from fear but a man will slip his bearings sometimes in this country  clarks eyes shot fire and he brought down the stock of his rifle with a thud  by the eternal god he cried i believe you are a traitor ive been watching you every step and youve acted strangely this morning  ay ay came from the men round him  silence cried clark and turned again to the cowering saunders you pretend to know the way to kaskaskia you bring us to the middle of the indian country where we may be wiped out at any time and now you have the damned effrontery to tell me that you have lost your way i am a man of my word he added with a vibrant intensity and pointed to the limbs of a giant tree which stood at the edge of the distant forest i will give you half an hour but as i live i will leave you hanging there  the mans brown hand trembled as he clutched his rifle barrel  tis a hard country sir he said im lost i swear it on the evangels  a hard country cried clark a man would have to walk over it but once to know it i believe you are a damned traitor and perjurerin spite of your oath a british spy  saunders wiped the sweat from his brow on his buckskin sleeve  i reckon i could get the trace colonel if youd let me go a little way into the prairie  half an hour said clark and youll not go alone sweeping his eye over bowmans company he picked out a man here and a man there to go with saunders then his eye lighted on me wheres mcchesney he said fetch mcchesney  i ran to get tom and seven of them went away with saunders in the middle clark watching them like a hawk while the men sat down in the grass to wait fifteen minutes went by and twenty and twentyfive and clark was calling for a rope when some one caught sight of the squad in the distance returning at a run and when they came within hail it was saunders voice we heard shouting brokenly  ive struck it colonel ive struck the trace theres a pecan at the edge of the bottom with my own blaze on it  may you never be as near death again said the colonel grimly as he gave the order to march  the fourth day passed and we left behind us the patches of forest and came into the open prairieas far as the eye could reach a long level sea of waving green the scanty provisions ran out hunger was added to the pangs of thirst and weariness and here and there in the straggling file discontent smouldered and angry undertone was heard kaskaskia was somewhere to the west and north but how far clark had misled them and in addition it were foolish to believe that the garrison had not been warned english soldiers and french militia and indian allies stood ready for our reception of such was the talk as we lay down in the grass under the stars on the fifth night for in the rank and file an empty stomach is not hopeful  the next morning we took up our march silently with the dawn the prairie grouse whirring ahead of us at last as afternoon drew on a dark line of green edged the prairie to the westward and our spirits rose from mouth to mouth ran the word that these were the woods which fringed the bluff above kaskaskia itself we pressed ahead and the destiny of the new republic for which we had fought made us walk unseen excitement keyed us high we reached the shade plunged into it and presently came out staring at the bastioned corners of a fort which rose from the centre of a clearing it had once defended the place but now stood abandoned and dismantled beyond it at the edge of the bluff we halted astonished the sun was falling in the west and below us was the goal for the sight of which we had suffered so much at our feet across the wooded bottom was the kaskaskia river and beyond the peaceful little french village with its low houses and orchards and gardens colored by the touch of the evening light in the centre of it stood a stone church with its belfry but our searching eyes alighted on the spot to the southward of it near the river there stood a rambling stone building with the shingles of its roof weathered black and all around it a palisade of pointed sticks thrust in the ground and with a pair of gates and watchtowers drooping on its staff was the standard of england north and south of the village the emerald common gleamed in the slanting light speckled red and white and black by grazing cattle here and there in untidy brown patches were indian settlements and far away to the westward the tawny father of waters gleamed through the cottonwoods  through the waning day the men lay resting under the trees talking in undertones some cleaned their rifles and others lost themselves in conjectures of the attack but clark himself tireless stood with folded arms gazing at the scene below and the sunlight on his face illumined him to the lad standing at his side as the servant of destiny at length at eventide the sweettoned bell of the little cathedral rang to vespersa gentle message of peace to war colonel clark looked into my upturned face  davy do you know what day this is he asked  no sir i answered  two years have gone since the bells pealed for the birth of a new nationyour nation davy and minethe nation that is to be the refuge of the oppressed of this earththe nation which is to be made of all peoples out of all time and this land for which you and i shall fight tonight will belong to it and the lands beyond he pointed to the west until the sun sets on the sea again he put his hand on my head you will remember this when i am dead and gone he said  i was silent awed by the power of his words  darkness fell and still we waited impatient for the order and when at last it came the men bustled hither and thither to find their commands and we picked our way on the unseen road that led down the bluff our hearts thumping the lights of the village twinkled at our feet and now and then a voice from below was caught and borne upward to us once another noise startled us followed by an exclamation donnerblitzen and a volley of low curses from the company poor swein poulsson had loosed a stone which had taken a reverberating flight riverward  we reached the bottom and the long file turned and hurried silently northward searching for a crossing i try to recall my feelings as i trotted beside the tall forms that loomed above me in the night the sense of protection they gave me stripped me of fear and i was not troubled with that my thoughts were chiefly on polly ann and the child we had left in the fort now so far to the south of us and in my fancy i saw her cheerful ever helpful to those around her despite the load that must rest on her heart i saw her simple joy at our return but should we return my chest tightened and i sped along the ranks to harrods company and caught tom by the wrist  davy he murmured and seizing my hand in his strong grip pulled me along with him for it was not given to him to say what he felt but as i hurried to keep pace with his stride polly anns words rang in my ears davy take care of my tom and i knew that he too was thinking of her a hail aroused me the sound of a loud rapping and i saw in black relief a cabin ahead the door opened a man came out with a horde of children cowering at his heels a volley of frightened words pouring from his mouth in a strange tongue john duff was plying him with questions in french and presently the man became calmer and lapsed into broken english  kaskaskiayes she is prepare many spy is gone outcross la riviere but now they all sleep  even as he spoke a shout came faintly from the distant town  what is that demanded clark sharply  the man shrugged his shoulders une fete des negres peutetrethe negro he dance maybe  are you the ferryman said clark  ouii have some boat  we crossed the hundred and fifty yards of sluggish water squad by squad and in the silence of the night stood gathered expectant on the farther bank midnight was at hand commands were passed about and men ran this way and that jostling one another to find their places in a new order but at length our little force stood in three detachments on the rivers bank their captains repeating again and again the part which each was to play that none might mistake his duty the two larger ones were to surround the town while the picked force under simon kenton himself was to storm the fort should he gain it by surprise and without battle three shots were to be fired in quick succession the other detachments were to start the warwhoop while duff and some with a smattering of french were to run up and down the streets proclaiming that every habitan who left his house would be shot no provision being made for the drummer boy i had left my drum on the heights above i chose the favored column at the head of which tom and cowan and ray and mccann were striding behind kenton and colonel clark not a word was spoken there was a kind of cowpath that rose and fell and twisted along the riverbank this we followed and in ten minutes we must have covered the mile to the now darkened village the starlight alone outlined against the sky the houses of it as we climbed the bank then we halted breathless in a street but there was no sound save that of the crickets and the frogs forward again and twisting a corner we beheld the indented edge of the stockade still no hail nor had our moccasined feet betrayed us as we sought the river side of the fort and drew up before the big river gates of it simon kenton bore against them and tried the little postern that was set there but both were fast the spikes towered a dozen feet overhead  quick muttered clark a light man to go over and open the postern  before i guessed what was in his mind cowan seized me  send the lad colonel said he  ay ay said simon kenton hoarsely  in a second tom was on kentons shoulders and they passed me up with as little trouble as though i had been my own drum feverishly searching with my foot for toms shoulder i seized the spikes at the top clambered over them paused surveyed the empty area below me destitute even of a sentry and then let myself down with the aid of the crossbars inside as i was feeling vainly for the bolt of the postern rays of light suddenly shot my shadow against the door and next as i got my hand on the bolthead i felt the weight of another on my shoulder and a voice behind me said in english  in the devils name  i gave the one frantic pull the bolt slipped and caught again then colonel clarks voice rang out in the night  open the gate open the gate in the name of virginia and the continental congress  before i could cry out the man gave a grunt leaned his gun against the gate and tore my fingers from the bolthandle astonishment robbed me of breath as he threw open the postern  in the name of the continental congress he cried and seized his gun clark and kenton stepped in instantly no doubt as astounded as i and had the man in their grasp  who are you said clark  name o skene from pennsylvanya said the man and by the lord god ye shall have the fort  you looked for us said clark  faith never less said the pennsylvanian the one sentry is at the main gate  and the governor  rocheblave said the pennsylvanian he sleeps yonder in the old jesuit house in the middle  clark turned to tom mcchesney who was at his elbow  corporal said he swiftly secure the sentry at the main gate you he added turning to the pennsylvanian lead us to the governor but mind if you betray me ill be the first to blow out your brains  the man seized a lantern and made swiftly over the level ground until the rubblework of the old jesuit house showed in the light nor clark nor any of them stopped to think of the danger our little handful ran at the mercy of a stranger the house was silent we halted and clark threw himself against the rude panels of the door which gave to inward blackness our men filled the little passage and suddenly we found ourselves in a lowceiled room in front of a great fourposter bed and in it upright blinking at the light were two odd frenchified figures in tasselled nightcaps astonishment and anger and fear struggled in the faces of monsieur de rocheblave and his lady a regard for truth compels me to admit that it was madame who first found her voice and no uncertain one it was  first came a shriek that might have roused the garrison  villains murderers outragers of decency she cried with spirit pouring a heap of invectives now in french now in english much to the discomfiture of our backwoodsmen who peered at her helplessly  nom du diable cried the commandant when his ladys breath was gone what does this mean  it means sir answered clark promptly that you are my prisoner  and who are you gasped the commandant  george rogers clark colonel in the service of the commonwealth of virginia he held out his hand restrainingly for the furious monsieur rocheblave made an attempt to rise you will oblige me by remaining in bed sir for a moment  coquins canailles cochons shrieked the lady  madame said colonel clark politely the necessities of war are often cruel  he made a bow and paying no further attention to the torrent of her reproaches or the threats of the helpless commandant he calmly searched the room with the lantern and finally pulled out from under the bed a metal despatch box then he lighted a candle in a brass candlestick that stood on the simple walnut dresser and bowed again to the outraged couple in the fourposter  now sir he said you may dress we will retire  pardieu said the commandant in french a hundred thousand thanks  we had scarcely closed the bedroom door when three shots were heard  the signal exclaimed clark  immediately a pandemonium broke on the silence of the night that must have struck cold terror in the hearts of the poor creoles sleeping in their beds the warwhoop the scalp halloo in the dead of the morning with the hideous winding notes of them that reached the bluff beyond and echoed back were enough to frighten a man from his senses in the intervals in backwoods french john duff and his companions were heard in terrifying tones crying out to the habitants to venture out at the peril of their lives  within the fort a score of lights flew up and down like willothewisps and colonel clark standing on the steps of the governors house gave out his orders and despatched his messengers me he sent speeding through the village to tell captain bowman to patrol the outskirts of the town that no runner might get through to warn fort chartres and cohos as some called cahokia none stirred save the few indians left in the place and these were brought before clark in the fort sullen and defiant and put in the guardhouse there and rocheblave when he appeared was no better and was put back in his house under guard  as for the papers in the despatch box they revealed i know not what briberies of the savage nations and plans of the english but of other papers we found none though there must have been more madame rocheblave was suspected of having hidden some in the inviolable portions of her dress  at length the cocks crowing for day proclaimed the morning and while yet the blue shadow of the bluff was on the town colonel clark sallied out of the gate and walked abroad strange it seemed that war had come to this village so peaceful and remote and even stranger it seemed to me to see these arcadian homes in the midst of the fierce wilderness the little houses with their sloping roofs and wide porches the gardens ablaze with color the neat palingsall were a restful sight for our weary eyes and now i scarcely knew our commander for we had not gone far ere timidly a door opened and a mildvisaged man in the simple workaday smock that the french wore stood hesitating on the steps the odd thing was that he should have bowed to clark who was dressed no differently from bowman and harrod and duff and the mans voice trembled piteously as he spoke it needed not john duff to tell us that he was pleading for the lives of his family  he will sell himself as a slave if your excellency will spare them said duff translating  but clark stared at the man sternly  i will tell them my plans at the proper time he said and when duff had translated this the man turned and went silently into his house again closing the door behind him and before we had traversed the village the same thing had happened many times we gained the fort again i wondering greatly why he had not reassured these simple people it was bowman who asked this question he being closer to clark than any of the other captains clark said nothing then and began to give out directions for the day but presently he called the captain aside  bowman i heard him say we have one hundred and fifty men to hold a province bigger than the whole of france and filled with treacherous tribes in the kings pay i must work out the problem for myself  bowman was silent clark with that touch which made men love him and die for him laid his hand on the captains shoulder  have the men called in by detachments he said and fed god knows they must be hungryand you  suddenly i remembered that he himself had had nothing running around the commandants house to the kitchen door i came unexpectedly upon swein poulsson who was face to face with the linseywoolseyclad figure of monsieur rocheblaves negro cook the early sun cast long shadows of them on the ground  by tam my friend was saying so i vill eat i am choost like an ox for three days und chew grass prairie grass is it  mo pas capab michie said the cook with a terrified roll of his white eyes  herr gott cried swein poulsson i am red face aber herr gott i thank thee i am not a nigger und my hair is bristles yes davy spying me i thank herr gott it is not vool let us in the kitchen go  i am come to get something for the colonels breakfast said i pushing past the slave through the open doorway swein poulsson followed and here i struck another contradiction in his strange nature he helped me light the fire in the great stone chimneyplace and we soon had a pot of hominy on the crane and turning on the spit a piece of buffalo steak which we found in the larder nor did a mouthful pass his lips until i had sped away with a steaming portion to find the colonel by this time the men had broken into the storehouse and the open place was dotted with their breakfast fires clark was standing alone by the flagstaff his face careworn but he smiled as he saw me coming  whats this says he  your breakfast sir i answered i set down the plate and the pot before him and pressed the pewter spoon into his hand  davy said he  sir said i  what did you have for your breakfast  my lip trembled for i was very hungry and the rich steam from the hominy was as much as i could stand then the colonel took me by the arms as gently as a woman might set me down on the ground beside him and taking a spoonful of the hominy forced it between my lips i was near to fainting at the taste of it then he took a bit himself and divided the buffalo steak with his own hands and when from the campfires they perceived the colonel and the drummer boy eating together in plain sight of all they gave a rousing cheer  swein poulsson helped get your breakfast sir and would eat nothing either i ventured  davy said colonel clark gravely i hope you will be younger when you are twenty  i hope i shall be bigger sir i answered gravely    chapter xiv how the kaskaskeians were made citizens  never before had such a day dawned upon kaskaskia with july fierceness the sun beat down upon the village but man nor woman nor child stirred from the darkened houses what they awaited at the hands of the long knives they knew notcaptivity torture death perhaps through the deserted streets stalked a squad of backwoodsmen headed by john duff and two american traders found in the town who were bestirring themselves in our behalf knocking now at this door and anon at that  the colonel bids you come to the fort he said and was gone  the church bell rang with slow ominous strokes far different from its gentle vesper peal of yesterday two companies were drawn up in the sun before the old jesuit house and presently through the gate a procession came grave and mournful the tone of it was sombre in the white glare for men had donned their best as they thought for the last timecloth of camlet and cadiz and limbourg white cotton stockings and brassbuckled shoes they came like captives led to execution but at their head a figure held our eyea figure that spoke of dignity and courage of trials borne for others it was the village priest in his robes he had a receding forehead and a strong pointed chin but benevolence was in the curve of his great nose i have many times since seen his type of face in the french prints he and his flock halted before our young colonel even as the citizens of calais in a bygone century must have stood before the english king  the scene comes back to me on the one side not the warriors of a nation that has made its mark in war but peaceful peasants who had sought this place for its remoteness from persecution to live and die in harmony with all mankind on the other the sinewy advance guard of a race that knows not peace whose goddess of liberty carries in her hand a sword the plough might have been graven on our arms but always the rifle  the silence of the trackless wilds reigned while clark gazed at them sternly and when he spoke it was with the voice of a conqueror and they listened as the conquered listen with heads bowedall save the priest  clark told them first that they had been given a false and a wicked notion of the american cause and he spoke of the tyranny of the english king which had become past endurance to a free people as for ourselves the long knives we came in truth to conquer and because of their hasty judgment the kaskaskians were at our mercy the british had told them that the kentuckians were a barbarous people and they had believed  he paused that john duff might translate and the gist of what he had said sink in but suddenly the priest had stepped out from the ranks faced his people and was himself translating in a strong voice when he had finished a tremor shook the group but he turned calmly and faced clark once more  citizens of kaskaskia colonel clark went on the king whom you renounced when the english conquered you the great king of france has judged for you and the french people knowing that the american cause is just he is sending his fleets and regiments to fight for it against the british king who until now has been your sovereign  again he paused and when the priest had told them this a murmur of astonishment came from the boldest  citizens of kaskaskia know you that the long knives come not to massacre as you foolishly believed but to release from bondage we are come not against you who have been deceived but against those soldiers of the british king who have bribed the savages to slaughter our wives and children you have but to take the oath of allegiance to the continental congress to become free even as we are to enjoy the blessings of that american government under which we live and for which we fight  the face of the good priest kindled as he glanced at clark he turned once more and though we could not understand his words the thrill of his eloquence moved us and when he had finished there was a moments hush of inarticulate joy among his flock and then such transports as moved strangely the sternest men in our ranks the simple people fell to embracing each other and praising god the tears running on their cheeks out of the group came an old man a skullcap rested on his silvered hair and he felt the ground uncertainly with his goldheaded stick  monsieur he said tremulously you will pardon an old man if he show feeling i am born seventy year ago in gascon i inhabit this country thirty year and last night i think i not live any longer last night we make our peace with the good god and come here today to die but we know you not he cried with a sudden and surprising vigor ha we know you not they told us lies and we were humble and believed but now we are americains he cried his voice pitched high as he pointed with a trembling arm to the stars and stripes above him mes enfants vive les bostonnais vive les americains vive monsieur le colonel clark sauveur de kaskaskia  the listening village heard the shout and wondered and when it had died down colonel clark took the old gascon by the hand and not a man of his but saw that this was a masterstroke of his genius  my friends he said simply i thank you i would not force you and you will have some days to think over the oath of allegiance to the republic go now to your homes and tell those who are awaiting you what i have said and if any man of french birth wish to leave this place he may go of his own free will save only three whom i suspect are not our friends  they turned and in an ecstasy of joy quite pitiful to see went trooping out of the gate but scarce could they have reached the street and we have broken ranks when we saw them coming back again the priest leading them as before they drew near to the spot where clark stood talking to the captains and halted expectantly  what is it my friends asked the colonel  the priest came forward and bowed gravely  i am pere gibault sir he said cure of kaskaskia he paused surveying our commander with a clear eye there is something that still troubles the good citizens  and what is that sir said clark  the priest hesitated  if your excellency will only allow the church to be opened he ventured  the group stood wistful fearful that their boldness had displeased expectant of reprimand  my good father said colonel clark an american commander has but one relation to any church and that is he added with force to protect it for all religions are equal before the republic  the priest gazed at him intently  by that answer said he your excellency has made for your government loyal citizens in kaskaskia  then the colonel stepped up to the priest and took him likewise by the hand  i have arranged for a house in town said he monsieur rocheblave has refused to dine with me there will you do me that honor father  with all my heart your excellency said father gibault and turning to the people he translated what the colonel had said then their cup of happiness was indeed full and some ran to clark and would have thrown their arms about him had he been a man to embrace hurrying out of the gate they spread the news like wildfire and presently the church bell clanged in tones of unmistakable joy  sure davy dear it puts me in mind of the saints day at home said terence as he stood leaning against a picket fence that bordered the street savin the presence of the naygurs and thim red divils wid blankets an scowls as wud turrn the milk sour in the pail  he had stopped beside two kaskaskia warriors in scarlet blankets who stood at the corner watching with silent contempt the antics of the french inhabitants now and again one or the other gave a grunt and wrapped his blanket more tightly about him  umrrhh said terence faith i talk that langwidge mesilf when i have throuble the warriors stared at him with what might be called a stoical surprise umrrh does the holy father praych to ye wid thim wurrds ye haythens begorra tis a wondher ye wuddent wash yereselves he added making a face wid muddy wather to be had for the askin  we moved on through such a scene as i have seldom beheld the village had donned its best women in cap and gown were hurrying hither and thither some laughing and some weeping grown men embraced each other children of all colors flung themselves against terences legsdarkhaired creoles little negroes with woolly pates and naked indian lads with bow and arrow terence dashed at them now and then and they fled screaming into dooryards to come out again and mimic him when he had passed while mothers and fathers and grandfathers smiled at the good nature in his irish face presently he looked down at me comically  why wuddent ye be doin the like davy he asked amusha tis mesilf that wants to run and hop and skip wid the childher ye put me in mind of a wizened old man that sat all day makin shoes in killarneyall savin the fringe he had on his chin  a soldier must be dignified i answered  the saints bar that wurrd from hiven said terence trying to pronounce it come well go to mass or me mother will be visitin me this night  we crossed the square and went into the darkened church where the candles were burning it was the first church i had ever entered and i heard with awe the voice of the priest and the fervent responses but i understood not a word of what was said afterwards father gibault mounted to the pulpit and stood for a moment with his hand raised above his flock and then began to speak what he told them i have learned since and this i know that when they came out again into the sunlit square they were americans it matters not when they took the oath  as we walked back towards the fort we came to a little house with a flower garden in front of it and there stood colonel clark himself by the gate he stopped us with a motion of his hand  davy said he we are to live here for a while you and i what do you think of our headquarters he did not wait for me to reply but continued can you suggest any improvement  you will be needing a soldier to be on guard in front sir said i  ah said the colonel mcchesney is too valuable a man i am sending him with captain bowman to take cahokia  would you have terence sir i ventured while terence grinned whereupon colonel clark sent him to report to his captain that he was detailed for orderly duty to the commanding officer and within half an hour he was standing guard in the flower garden making grimaces at the children in the street colonel clark sat at a table in the little front room and while two of monsieur rocheblaves negroes cooked his dinner he was busy with a score of visitors organizing advising planning and commanding there were disputes to settle now that alarm had subsided and at noon three excitable gentlemen came in to inform against a certain monsieur cerre merchant and trader then absent at st louis when at length the colonel had succeeded in bringing their denunciations to an end and they had departed he looked at me comically as i stood in the doorway  davy said he all i ask of the good lord is that he will frighten me incontinently for a month before i die  i think he would find that difficult sir i answered  then theres no hope for me he answered laughing for i have observed that fright alone brings a man into a fit spiritual state to enter heaven what would you say of those slanderers of monsieur cerre  not expecting an answer he dipped his quill into the inkpot and turned to his papers  i should say that they owed monsieur cerre money i replied  the colonel dropped his quill and stared as for me i was puzzled to know why  egad said colonel clark most of us get by hard knocks what you seem to have been born with he fell to musing a worried look coming on his face that was no stranger to me later and his hand fell heavily on the loose pile of paper before him davy says he i need a commissarygeneral  what would that be sir i asked  a john law who will make something out of nothing who will make money out of this blank paper who will wheedle the creole traders into believing they are doing us a favor and making their everlasting fortune by advancing us flour and bacon  and doesnt congress make money sir i asked  that they do davy by the ton he replied and so must we as the rulers of a great province for mark me though the men are happy today in four days they will be grumbling and trying to desert in dozens  we were interrupted by a knock at the door and there stood terence mccann  his riverence he announced and bowed low as the priest came into the room  i was bid by colonel clark to sit down and dine with them on the good things which monsieur rocheblaves cook had prepared after dinner they went into the little orchard behind the house and sat drinking in the french fashion the commandants precious coffee which had been sent to him from faraway new orleans colonel clark plied the priest with questions of the french towns under english rule and father gibault speaking for his simple people said that the english had led them easily to believe that the kentuckians were cutthroats  ah monsieur he said if they but knew you if they but knew the principles of that government for which you fight they would renounce the english allegiance and the whole of this territory would be yours i know them from quebec to detroit and michilimackinac and saint vincennes listen monsieur he cried his homely face alight i myself will go to saint vincennes for you i will tell them the truth and you shall have the post for the asking  you will go to vincennes exclaimed clark a hard and dangerous journey of a hundred leagues  monsieur answered the priest simply the journey is nothing for a century the missionaries of the church have walked this wilderness alone with god often they have suffered and often died in torturesbut gladly  colonel clark regarded the man intently  the cause of liberty both religious and civil is our cause father gibault continued men have died for it and will die for it and it will prosper furthermore monsieur my life has not known many wants i have saved something to keep my old age with which to buy a little house and an orchard in this peaceful place the sum i have is at your service the good congress will repay me and you need the money  colonel clark was not an impulsive man but he felt none the less deeply as i know well his reply to this generous offer was almost brusque but it did not deceive the priest  nay monsieur he said it is for mankind i give it in remembrance of him who gave everything and though i receive nothing in return i shall have my reward an hundred fold  in due time i know not how the talk swung round again to lightness for the colonel loved a good story and the priest had many which he told with wit in his quaint french accent as he was rising to take his leave pere gibault put his hand on my head  i saw your excellencys son in the church this morning he said  colonel clark laughed and gave me a pinch  my dear sir he said the boy is old enough to be my father  the priest looked down at me with a puzzled expression in his brown eyes  i would i had him for my son said colonel clark kindly but the lad is eleven and i shall not be twentysix until next november  your excellency not twentysix cried father gibault in astonishment what will you be when you are thirty  the young colonels face clouded  god knows he said  father gibault dropped his eyes and turned to me with native tact  what would you like best to do my son he asked  i should like to learn to speak french said i for i had been much irritated at not understanding what was said in the streets  and so you shall said father gibault i myself will teach you you must come to my house today  and davy will teach me said the colonel    chapter xv days of trial  but i was not immediately to take up the study of french things began to happen in kaskaskia in the first place captain bowmans company with a few scouts of which tom was one set out that very afternoon for the capture of cohos or cahokia and this despite the fact that they had had no sleep for two nights if you will look at the map1 you will see dotted along the bottoms and the bluffs beside the great mississippi the string of villages kaskaskia la prairie du rocher fort chartres st philip and cahokia some few miles from cahokia on the western bank of the father of waters was the little french village of st louis in the spanish territory of louisiana from thence eastward stretched the great waste of prairie and forest inhabited by roving bands of the forty indian nations then you come to vincennes on the wabash fort st vincent the english and canadians called it for there were a few of the latter who had settled in kaskaskia since the english occupation   1 the best map which the editor has found of this district is in vol vi part 11 of winsors narrative and critical history of america p 721    we gathered on the western skirts of the village to give bowmans company a cheer and every man woman and child in the place watched the little column as it wound snakelike over the prairie on the road to fort chartres until it was lost in the cottonwoods to the westward  things began to happen in kaskaskia it would have been strange indeed if things had not happened one hundred and seventyfive men had marched into that territory out of which now are carved the great states of ohio indiana and illinois and to most of them the thing was a picnic a jaunt which would soon be finished many had left families in the frontier forts without protection the time of their enlistment had almost expired  there was a store in the village kept by a great citizennot a citizen of kaskaskia alone but a citizen of the world this i am aware sounds like fiction like an attempt to get an effect which was not there but it is true as gospel the owner of this store had many others scattered about in this foreign country at vincennes at st louis where he resided at cahokia he knew michilimackinac and quebec and new orleans he had been born some thirtyone years before in sardinia had served in the spanish army and was still a spanish subject the name of this famous gentleman was monsieur francois vigo and he was the rothschild of the country north of the ohio monsieur vigo though he merited it i had not room to mention in the last chapter clark had routed him from his bed on the morning of our arrival and whether or not he had been in the secret of frightening the inhabitants into making their wills and then throwing them into transports of joy i know not  monsieur vigos store was the village club it had neither glass in the window nor an attractive display of goods it was merely a log cabin set down on a weedy sunbaked plot the stuffy smell of skins and furs came out of the doorway within when he was in kaskaskia monsieur vigo was wont to sit behind his rough walnut table writing with a fine quill or dispensing the news of the villages to the priest and other prominent citizens or haggling with persistent blanketed braves over canoeloads of illsmelling pelts which they brought down from the green forests of the north monsieur vigos clothes were the color of the tobacco he gave in exchange his eyes were not unlike the black beads he traded but shrewd and kindly withal set in a square saffron face that had the contradiction of a small chin as the days wore into months monsieur vigos place very naturally became the headquarters for our army if army it might be called of a morning a dozen would be sitting against the logs in the black shadow and in the midst of them always squatted an unsavory indian squaw a few braves usually stood like statues at the corner and in front of the door another group of hunting shirts without was the paper money of the continental congress within the good tafia and tobacco of monsieur vigo one day monsieur vigos young creole clerk stood shrugging his shoulders in the doorway i stopped  by tam swein poulsson was crying to the clerk as he waved a worthless scrip above his head vat is money  this definition the clerk not being a doctor johnson was unable to give offhand  vat are you choost is it america demanded poulsson while the others looked on some laughing some serious and vich citizen are you since you are ours you vill please to give me one carrot of tobacco and he thrust the scrip under the clerks nose  the clerk stared at the uneven lettering on the scrip with disdain  money he exclaimed scornfully she is not money piastrespanish dollarethen i give you carrot  by god shouted bill cowan ye will take virginny paper and congress paper or else i reckon well have a drink and tobacey boys take or no take  hooray bill yere right cried several of our men  lemme in here said cowan but the frightened creole blocked the doorway  sacre he screamed and then voleurs  the excitement drew a number of people from the neighborhood nay it seemed as if the whole town was ringed about us  bravo jules they cried gardetu la porte a bas les bostonnais a bas les voleurs  damn such monkey talk said cowan facing them suddenly i knew him well and when the giant lost his temper it was gone irrevocably until a fight was over call a man a squar name  hey frenchy another of our men put in stalking up to the clerk i reckon this here stores ourn ef weve a mind to tek it i low youll give us the rum and the bacey come on boys  in between him and the clerk leaped a little robinlike man with a red waistcoat beside himself with rage bill cowan and his friends stared at this diminutive frenchman openmouthed as he poured forth a veritable torrent of unintelligible words plentifully mixed with sacres which he ripped out like snarls i would as soon have touched him as a ball of angry bees or a pair of fighting wildcats not so bill cowan when that worthy recovered from his first surprise he seized hold of some of the mans twisting arms and legs and lifted him bodily from the ground as he would have taken a perverse and struggling child there was no question of a fight cowan picked him up i say and before any one knew what happened he flung him on to the hot roof of the store the eaves were but two feet above his head and there the man stuck clinging to a loose shingle purpling and coughing and spitting with rage there was a loud gust of guffaws from the woodsmen and oaths like whipcracks from the circle around us menacing growls as it surged inward and our men turned to face it a few citizens pushed through the outskirts of it and ran away and in the hush that followed we heard them calling wildly the names of father gibault and clark and of vigo himself cowan thrust me past the clerk into the store where i stood listening to the little man on the roof scratching and clutching at the shingles and coughing still  but there was no fight shouts of monsieur vigo voici monsieur vigo were heard the crowd parted respectfully and monsieur vigo in his snuffcolored suit stood glancing from cowan to his pallid clerk he was not in the least excited  come in my frens he said it is too hot in the sun and he set the example by stepping over the sill on to the hardbaked earth of the floor within then he spied me ah he said the boy of monsieur le colonel and how are you called my son he added patting me kindly  davy sir i answered  ha he said and a brave soldier no doubt  i was flattered as well as astonished by this attention but monsieur vigo knew men and he had given them time to turn around by this time bill cowan and some of my friends had stooped through the doorway followed by a prying kaskaskian brave and as many creoles as could crowd behind them monsieur vigo was surprisingly calm  it make hot weather my frens said he how can i serve you messieurs  haint the congress got authority here said one  i am happy to say answered monsieur vigo rubbing his hands for i think much of your principle  then said the man we come here to trade with congress money haint that money good in kaskasky  there was an anxious pause then monsieur vigos eyes twinkled and he looked at me  and what you say davy he asked  the money would be good if you took it sir i said not knowing what else to answer  sapristi exclaimed monsieur vigo looking hard at me who teach you that  no one sir said i staring in my turn  and if congress lose and not pay where am i mon petit maitre de la haute finance demanded monsieur vigo with the palms of his hands outward  you will be in good company sir said i  at that he threw back his head and laughed and bill cowan and my friends laughed with him  good companycest la plupart de la vie said monsieur vigo et quel garconwhat a boy it is  i never seed his beat fer wisdom mister vigo said bill cowan now in good humor once more at the prospect of rum and tobacco and i found out later that he and the others had actually given to me the credit of this coup he never failed us yet haint that truth boys haint we agoin on to st vincent because he seen the har buyer sculped on the ohio  the rest assented so heartily but withal so gravely that i am between laughter and tears over the remembrance of it  at noon you come back said monsieur vigo i think till then about rate of exchange and talk with your colonel davy you stay here  i remained while the others filed out and at length i was alone with him and jules his clerk  davy how you like to be trader asked monsieur vigo  it was a new thought to me and i turned it over in my mind to see the strange places of the world and the stranger people to become a man of wealth and influence such as monsieur vigo and i fear i loved it best to match my brains with others at a bargaini turned it all over slowly gravely in my boyish mind rubbing the hard dirt on the floor with the toe of my moccasin and suddenly the thought came to me that i was a traitor to my friends a deserter from the little army that loved me so well  eh bien said monsieur vigo  i shook my head but in spite of me i felt the tears welling into my eyes and brushed them away shamefully at such times of stress some of my paternal scotch crept into my speech  i will no be leaving colonel clark and the boys i cried not for all the money in the world  congress money said monsieur vigo with a queer expression  it was then i laughed through my tears and that cemented the friendship between us it was a lifelong friendship though i little suspected it then  in the days that followed he never met me on the street that he did not stop to pass the time of day and ask me if i had changed my mind he came every morning to headquarters where he and colonel clark sat by the hour with brows knit monsieur vigo was as good as his word and took the congress money though not at such a value as many would have had him i have often thought that we were all children then and knew nothing of the ingratitude of republics monsieur vigo took the money and was all his life many many thousand dollars the poorer father gibault advanced his little store and lived to feel the pangs of want and colonel clark but i must not go beyond the troubles of that summer and the problems that vexed our commander one night i missed him from the room where we slept and walking into the orchard found him pacing there where the moon cast filmy shadows on the grass by day as he went around among the men his brow was unclouded though his face was stern but now i surprised the man so strangely moved that i yearned to comfort him he had taken three turns before he perceived me  davy he said what are you doing here  i missed you sir i answered staring at the furrows in his face  come he said almost roughly and seizing my hand led me back and forth swiftly through the wet grass for i know not how long the moon dipped to the uneven line of the ridgepole and slipped behind the stone chimney all at once he stopped dropped my hand and smote both of his together  i will hold on by the eternal he cried i will let no american read his history and say that i abandoned this land let them desert if ten men be found who will stay i will hold the place for the republic  will not virginia and the congress send you men sir i asked wonderingly  he laughed a laugh that was all bitterness  virginia and the continental congress know little and care less about me he answered some day you will learn that foresight sometimes comes to men but never to assemblies but it is often given to one man to work out the salvation of a people and be destroyed for it davy we have been up too long  at the morning parade from my wonted place at the end of the line i watched him with astonishment reviewing the troops as usual for the very first day i had crossed the river with terence climbed the heights to the old fort and returned with my drum but no sooner had i beaten the retreat than the men gathered here and there in groups that smouldered with mutiny and i noted that some of the officers were amongst these once in a while a sentence like a flaming brand was flung out their time was up their wives and children for all they knew sculped by the red varmints and by the etarnal clark or no man living could keep them  hi said one as i passed heres davy with his drum hell be leadin us back to kaintuck in the morning  ay ay cried another man in the group i reckon hes had his full of tyranny too  i stopped my face blazing red  shame on you for those words i shouted shrilly shame on you you fools to desert the man who would save your wives and children how are the redskins to be beaten if they are not cowed in their own country for i had learned much at headquarters  they stood silent astonished no doubt at the sight of my small figure atremble with anger i heard bill cowans voice behind me  theres truth for ye he said that will slink home when a things half done  ye neednt talk bill cowan its well enough for ye i reckon your wifed scare any redskin off her clearin  many the time she scart me said bill cowan  and so the matter went by with a laugh but the grumbling continued and the danger was that the french would learn of it the day passed yet the embers blazed not into the flame of open mutiny but he who has seen service knows how ominous is the gathering of men here and there the low humming talk the silence when a dissenter passes there were fights too that had to be quelled by company captains and no man knew when the loud quarrel between the two races at vigos store would grow into an ugly battle  what did clark intend to do this was the question that hung in the minds of mutineer and faithful alike they knew the desperation of his case without money save that which the generous creoles had advanced upon his personal credit without apparent resources without authority save that which the weight of his character exertedhow could he prevent desertion they eyed him as he went from place to place about his businesserect thoughtful undisturbed few men dare to set their will against a multitude when there are no fruits to be won columbus persisted and found a new world clark persisted and won an empire for thoughtless generations to enjoy  that night he slept not at all but sat while the candles flickered in their sockets poring over maps and papers i dared not disturb him but lay the darkness through with staring eyes and when the windows on the orchard side showed a gray square of light he flung down the parchment he was reading on the table it rolled up of itself and he pushed back his chair i heard him call my name and leaping out of bed i stood before him  you sleep lightly davy he said i think to try me  i did not answer fearing to tell him that i had been awake watching him  i have one friend at least said the colonel  you have many sir i answered as you will find when the time comes  the time has come said he today i shall be able to count them davy i want you to do something for me  now sir i answered overjoyed  as soon as the sun strikes that orchard he said pointing out of the window you have learned how to keep things to yourself now i want you to impart them to others go out and tell the village that i am going away  that you are going away sir i repeated  that i am going away he said with my army save the mark with my army and my drummer boy and my paper money such is my faith in the loyalty of the good people of these villages to the american cause that i can safely leave the flag flying over their heads with the assurance that they will protect it  i stared at him doubtfully for at times a pleasantry came out of his bitterness  ay he said go have you any love for me  i have sir i answered  by the lord i believe you he said and picking up my small hunting shirt he flung it at me put it on and go when the sun rises  as the first shaft of light over the bluff revealed the diamonds in the orchard grass i went out wondering suspecting would be a better word for the nature i had inherited but i had my orders terence was pacing the garden his leggings turned black with the dew i looked at him here was a vessel to disseminate  terence the colonel is going back to virginia with the army  him cried terence dropping the stock of his deckard to the ground and back to kaintuckee arrah tis a sin to be jokin before a man has a bit in his sthummick bad cess to yere plisantry before breakfast  im telling you what the colonel himself told me i answered and ran on davy darlin i heard him calling after me as i turned the corner but i looked not back  there was a single sound in the street a thin bronzed indian lad squatted against the pickets with his fingers on a reed his cheeks distended he broke off with a wild mournful note to stare at me a wisp of smoke stole from a stone chimney and the smell that cornpone and bacon leave was in the air a bolt was slammed back a door creaked and stuck was flung open and with a va ten mechant a cottonclad urchin was cast out of the house and fled into the dusty street breathing the morning air in the doorway stood a young woman in a cotton gown a saucepan in hand she had inquisitive eyes a pointed prying nose and i knew her to be the village gossip the wife of jules monsieur vigos clerk she had the same smattering of english as her husband now she stood regarding me narrowly between halfclosed lids  a la bonne heure que faistu donc what do you do so early  the garrison is getting ready to leave for kentucky today i answered  ha jules ecoutetoi nom de dieu is it true what you say  the visage of jules surmounted by a nightcap and heavy with sleep appeared behind her  ha eest daveed he said what news have you  i repeated whereupon they both began to lament  and why is it persisted jules  he has such faith in the loyalty of the kaskaskians i answered parrotlike  diable cried jules we shall perish we shall be as the acadians and loyaltyshe will not save us no  other doors creaked other inhabitants came in varied costumes into the street to hear the news lamenting if clark left the day of judgment was at hand for them that was certain between the savage and the briton not one stone would be left standing on another madame jules forgot her breakfast and fled up the street with the tidings and then i made my way to the fort where the men were gathering about the campfires talking excitedly terence relieved from duty had done the work here  and he as little as a fox wid all that in him he cried when he perceived me walking demurely past the sentry davy dear come here an tell the bys am i a liar  davys monstrous cute said bill cowan i reckon he knows as well as me the colonel haint agoin to do no such tomfool thing as leave  he is i cried for the benefit of some others hes fair sick of grumblers that havent got the grit to stand by him in trouble  by the lord said bill cowan and ill not blame him he turned fiercely his face reddening shame on ye all yere lives he shouted yere making the best man that ever led a regiment take the back trail yell fetch back to kaintuck and draw every redskin in the north woods suckin after ye like leaves in a harricane wind there haint a man of ye has the pluck of this little shaver that beats the drum i wish to god mcchesney was here  he turned away to cross the parade ground followed by the faithful terence and myself others gathered about him mcandrew who for all his sourness was true swein poulsson who would have died for the colonel john duff and some twenty more including saunders whose affection had not been killed though clark had nearly hanged him among the prairies  begob said terence davy has inflooence wid his excellency its davy well sind prayin him not to lave the frinch alone wid their loyalty  it was agreed and i was to repeat the name of every man that sent me  departing on this embassy i sped out of the gates of the fort but as i approached the little house where clark lived the humming of a crowd came to my ears and i saw with astonishment that the street was blocked it appeared that the whole of the inhabitants of kaskaskia were packed in front of the place wriggling my way through the people i had barely reached the gate when i saw monsieur vigo and the priest three creole gentlemen in uniform and several others coming out of the door they stopped and monsieur vigo raising his hand for silence made a speech in french to the people what he said i could not understand and when he had finished they broke up into groups and many of them departed before i could gain the house colonel clark himself came out with captain helm and captain harrod the colonel glanced at me and smiled  parade davy he said and walked on  i ran back to the fort and when i had gotten my drum the three companies were falling into line the men murmuring in undertones among themselves they were brought to attention colonel clark was seen to come out of the commandants house and we watched him furtively as he walked slowly to his place in front of the line a tremor of excitement went from sergeant to drummer boy the sentries closed the big gates of the fort  the colonel stood for a full minute surveying us calmlya disquieting way he had when matters were at a crisis then he began to talk  i have heard from many sources that you are dissatisfied that you wish to go back to kentucky if that be so i say to you go and god be with you i will hinder no man we have taken a brave and generous people into the fold of the republic and they have shown their patriotism by giving us freely of their money and stores he raised his voice they have given the last proof of that patriotism this day yes they have come to me and offered to take your places to finish the campaign which you have so well begun and wish to abandon today i shall enroll their militia under the flag for which you have fought  when he had ceased speaking a murmur ran through the ranks  but if there be any he said who have faith in me and in the cause for which we have come here who have the perseverance and the courage to remain i will reenlist them the rest of you shall march for kentucky he cried as soon as captain bowmans company can be relieved at cahokia the regiment is dismissed  for a moment they remained in ranks as though stupefied it was cowan who stepped out first snatched his coonskin hat from his head and waved it in the air  huzzay for colonel clark he roared ill foller him into canady and stand up to my lick log  they surrounded bill cowan not the twenty which had flocked to him in the morning but four times twenty and they marched in a body to the commandants house to be reenlisted the colonel stood by the door and there came a light in his eyes as he regarded us they cheered him again  thank you lads he said remember we may have to whistle for our pay  damn the pay cried bill cowan and we echoed the sentiment  well see what can be done about land grants said the colonel and he turned away  at dusk that evening i sat on the back doorstep by the orchard cleaning his rifle the sound of steps came from the little passage behind me and a hand was on my head  davee said a voice it was monsieur vigos do you know what is un coup detat  no sir  ha you execute one today is it not so monsieur le colonel  i reckon he was in the secret said colonel clark did you think i meant to leave kaskaskia davy  no sir  he is not so easy fool monsieur vigo put in he tell me paper money good if i take it cest la haute finance  colonel clark laughed  and why didnt you think i meant to leave said he  because you bade me go out and tell everybody i answered what you really mean to do you tell no one  nom du bon dieu exclaimed monsieur vigo  yesterday colonel clark had stood alone the enterprise for which he had risked all on the verge of failure by a masterstroke his ranks were repleted his position recovered his authority secured once more  few men recognize genius when they see it monsieur vigo was not one of these    chapter xvi davy goes to cahokia  i should make but a poor historian for i have not stuck to my chronology but as i write the vivid recollections are those that i set down i have forgotten two things of great importance first the departure of father gibault with several creole gentlemen and a spy of colonel clarks for vincennes and their triumphant return in august the sacrifice of the good priest had not been in vain and he came back with the joyous news of a peaceful conquest the stars and stripes now waved over the fort and the french themselves had put it there and the vast stretch of country from that place westward to the father of waters was now american  and that brings me to the second oversight the surprise and conquest of cahokia by bowman and his men was like that of kaskaskia and the french there were loyal too offering their militia for service in the place of those men of bowmans company who would not reenlist these came to kaskaskia to join our homegoers and no sooner had the hundred marched out of the gate and taken up their way for kentucky than colonel clark began the drilling of the new troops  captain leonard helm was sent to take charge of vincennes and captain montgomery set out across the mountains for williamsburg with letters praying the governor of virginia to come to our assistance  for another cloud had risen in the horizon another problem for clark to face of greater portent than all the others a messenger from captain bowman at cohos came riding down the street on a scraggly french pony and pulled up before headquarters the messenger was sergeant thomas mcchesney and his long legs almost reached the ground on either side of the little beast leaping from the saddle he seized me in his arms set me down and bade me tell colonel clark of his arrival  it was a sultry august morning within the hour colonel clark and tom and myself were riding over the dusty trace that wound westward across the common lands of the village which was known as the fort chartres road the heathaze shimmered in the distance and there was no sound in plain or village save the tinkle of a cowbell from the clumps of shade colonel clark rode twenty paces in front alone his head bowed with thinking  theyre coming into cahokia as thick as bees outn a gum davy said tom seems like theres thousands of em nothin will do em but they must see the colonelthe varmints and theyve got patience theyll wait thar till the bars git fat i reckon they low clarks got the armies of congress behind him if they knowed said tom with a chuckle if they knowed that wed only got seventy of the boys and some hundred frenchies in the army i reckon the colonels too cute for em  the savages in cahokia were as the leaves of the forest curiosity that mainspring of the indian character had brought the chiefs big and little to see with their own eyes the great captain of the long knives in vain had the faithful bowman put them off they would wait clark must come and clark was coming for he was not the man to quail at such a crisis for the crux of the whole matter was here and if he failed to impress them with his power with the might of the congress for which he fought no man of his would ever see kentucky again  as we rode through the bottom under the pecan trees we talked of polly ann tom and i and of our little home by the salt river far to the southward where we would live in peace when the campaign was over tom had written her painfully enough an affectionate scrawl which he sent by one of captain linns men and i too had written my letter had been about tom and how he had become a sergeant and what a favorite he was with bowman and the colonel poor polly ann she could not write but a runner from harrodstown who was a friend of toms had carried all the way to cahokia in the pocket with his despatches a fold of nettlebark linen tom pulled it from the bosom of his hunting shirt to show me and in it was a little ring of hair like unto the finest spun redgold this was the message polly ann had senta message from little tom as well  at prairie du rocher at st philippe the inhabitants lined the streets to do homage to this man of strange power who rode unattended and unafraid to the council of the savage tribes which had terrorized his people of kentucky from the ramparts of fort chartres once one of the mighty chain of strongholds to protect a new france and now deserted like massacre i gazed for the first time in awe at the turgid flood of the mississippi and at the lands of the spanish king beyond with never ceasing fury the river tore at his clay banks and worried the green islands that braved his charge and my boyish fancy pictured to itself the monsters which might lie hidden in his muddy depths  we lay that night in the open at a spring on the bluffs and the next morning beheld the church tower of cahokia a little way from the town we perceived an odd gathering on the road the yellowed and weathered hunting shirts of bowmans company mixed with the motley dress of the creole volunteers some of these gentlemen wore the costume of coureurs du bois others had odd regimental coats and hats which had seen much service besides the military was a sober deputation of citizens and hovering behind the whole a horde of curious blanketed braves come to get a first glimpse of the great white captain so escorted we crossed at the mill came to a shady street that faced the little river and stopped at the stone house where colonel clark was to abide  on that day and for many days more that street was thronged with warriors chiefs in gala dress strutted up and down feathered and plumed and blanketed smeared with paint bedecked with rude jewelleryearrings and bracelets from the remote forests of the north they had come where the cold winds blow off the blue lakes from the prairies to the east from the upper running waters where the mississippi flows clear and undefiled by the muddy flood from the villages and wigwams of the sluggish wabash and from the sandy piny country between the great northern seas where michilimackinac stands guard alonesacs and foxes chippeways and maumies and missesogies puans and pottawattomies chiefs and medicine men  well might the sleep of the good citizens be disturbed and the women fear to venture to the creek with their linen and their paddles  the lives of these people hung in truth upon a slender thingthe bearing of one man all day long the great chiefs sought an audience with him but he sent them word that matters would be settled in the council that was to come all day long the warriors lined the picket fence in front of the house and more than once tom mcchesney roughly shouldered a lane through them that timid visitors might pass like a pack of wolves they watched narrowly for any sign of weakness as for tom they were to him as so many dogs  ye varmints he cried ill take a blizzrd at ye if ye dont keep the way clear  at that they would give back grudgingly with a chorus of grunts only to close in again as tightly as before but they came to have a wholesome regard for the sunbrowned man with the red hair who guarded the colonels privacy the boy who sat on the doorstep the son of the great pale face chief as they called me was a never ending source of comment among them once colonel clark sent for me the little front room of this house was not unlike the one we had occupied at kaskaskia it had bare walls a plain table and chairs and a crucifix in the corner it served as dining room parlor bedroom for there was a pallet too now the table was covered with parchments and papers and beside colonel clark sat a grave gentleman of about his own age as i came into the room colonel clark relaxed turned toward this gentleman and said  monsieur gratiot behold my commissarygeneral my strategist my financier and monsieur gratiot smiled he struck me as a man who never let himself go sufficiently to laugh  ah he said vigo has told me how he settled the question of paper money he might do something for the congress in the east  davy is a scotchman like john law said the colonel and he is a master at perceiving a mans character and business  what would you call me at a venture davy asked monsieur gratiot  he spoke excellent english with only a slight accent  a citizen of the world like monsieur vigo i answered at a hazard  pardieu said monsieur gratiot you are not far away like monsieur vigo i keep a store here at cahokia like monsieur vigo i have travelled much in my day do you know where switzerland is davy  i did not  it is a country set like a cluster of jewels in the heart of europe said monsieur gratiot and there are mountains there that rise among the clouds and are covered with perpetual snows and when the sun sets on those snows they are rubies and the skies above them sapphire  i was born amongst the mountains sir i answered my pulse quickening at his description but they were not so high as those you speak of  then said monsieur gratiot you can understand a little my sorrow as a lad when i left it from switzerland i went to a foggy place called london and thence i crossed the ocean to the solemn forests of the north of canada where i was many years learning the characters of these gentlemen who are looking in upon us and he waved his arm at the line of peering red faces by the pickets monsieur gratiot smiled at clark and theres another point of resemblance between myself and monsieur vigo  have you taken the paper money i demanded  monsieur gratiot slapped his linen breeches that i have and this time i thought he was going to laugh but he did not though his eyes sparkled and do you think that the good congress will ever repay me davy  no sir said i  peste exclaimed monsieur gratiot but he did not seem to be offended or shaken  davy said colonel clark we have had enough of predictions for the present fetch this letter to captain bowman at the garrison up the street he handed me the letter are you afraid of the indians  if i were sir i would not show it i said for he had encouraged me to talk freely to him  avast cried the colonel as i was going out and why not  if i show that i am not afraid of them sir they will think that you are the less so  there you are for strategy gratiot said colonel clark laughing get out you rascal  tom was more concerned when i appeared  dont pester em davy said he fer gods sake dont pester em theyre spoilin fer a fight stand back thar ye critters he shouted brandishing his rifle in their faces ugh i reckon it wouldnt take a horse or a dog to scent ye today rank bars oil kite along davy  clutching the letter tightly i slipped between the narrowed ranks and gained the middle of the street not without a quickened beat of my heart thence i sped dodging this group and that until i came to the long log house that was called the garrison here our men were stationed where formerly a squad from an english regiment was quartered i found captain bowman delivered the letter and started back again through the brown dusty street which lay in the shade of the great forest trees that still lined it doubling now and again to avoid an idling brave that looked bent upon mischief for a single mischance might set the tide running to massacre i was nearing the gate again the dust flying from my moccasined feet the sight of the stalwart tom giving me courage again suddenly with the deftness of a panther an indian shot forward and lifted me high in his arms to this day i recall my terror as i dangled in midair staring into a hideous face by intuition i kicked him in the stomach with all my might and with a howl of surprise and rage his fingers gripped into my flesh the next thing i remember was being in the dust suffocated by that odor which he who has known it can never forget a medley of discordant cries was in my ears then i was snatched up bumped against heads and shoulders and deposited somewhere now it was toms face that was close to mine and the light of a fierce anger was in his blue eyes  did they hurt ye davy he asked  i shook my head before i could speak he was at the gate again confronting the mob of savages that swayed against the fence and the street was filled with running figures a voice of command that i knew well came from behind me it was colonel clarks  stay where you are mcchesney he shouted and tom halted with his hand on the latch  with your permission i will speak to them said monsieur gratiot who had come out also  i looked up at him and he was as calm as when he had joked with me a quarter of an hour since  very well said clark briefly  monsieur gratiot surveyed them scornfully  where is the hungry wolf who speaks english he said  there was a stir in the rear ranks and a lean savage with abnormal cheek bones pushed forward  hungry wolf here he said with a grunt  the hungry wolf knew the french trader at michilimackinac said monsieur gratiot he knows that the french traders word is a true word let the hungry wolf tell his companions that the chief of the long knives is very angry  the hungry wolf turned and began to speak his words hoarse and resonant seemed to come from the depths of his body presently he paused and there came an answer from the fiend who had seized me after that there were many grunts and the hungry wolf turned again  the north wind mean no harm he answered he play with the son of the great white chief and his belly is very sore where the chiefs son kicked him  the chief of the long knives will consider the offence said monsieur gratiot and retired into the house with colonel clark for a full five minutes the indians waited impassive and then monsieur gratiot reappeared alone  the chief of the long knives is mercifully inclined to forgive he said it was in play but there must be no more play with the chiefs son and the path to the great chiefs presence must be kept clear  again the hungry wolf translated the north wind grunted and departed in silence followed by many of his friends and indeed for a while after that the others kept a passage clear to the gate  as for the son of the great white chief he sat for a long time that afternoon beside the truck patch of the house and presently he slipped out by a byway into the street again among the savages his heart was bumping in his throat but a boyish reasoning told him that he must show no fear and that day he found what his colonel had long since learned to be true that in courage is the greater safety the power of the great white chief was such that he allowed his son to go forth alone and feared not for his life even so clark himself walked among them nor looked to right or left  two nights colonel clark sat through calling now on this man and now on that and conning the treaties which the english had made with the various tribesay and french and spanish treaties toountil he knew them all by heart there was no haste in what he did no uneasiness in his manner he listened to the advice of monsieur gratiot and other creole gentlemen of weight to the spanish officers who came in their regimentals from st louis out of curiosity to see how this man would treat with the tribes for he spoke of his intentions to none of them and gained the more respect by it within the week the council began and the scene of the great drama was a field near the village the background of forest trees few plays on the worlds stage have held such suspense few battles such excitement for those who watched here was the spectacle of one strong mans brain pitted against the combined craft of the wilderness in the midst of a stretch of waving grass was a table and a young man of sixandtwenty sat there alone around him were ringed the gathered tribes each chief in the order of his importance squatted in the inner circle their blankets making patches of bright color against the green behind the tribes was the little group of hunting shirts the men leaning on the barrels of their long rifles indolent but watchful here and there a gay uniform of a spanish or creole officer and behind these all the population of the village that dared to show itself  the ceremonies began with the kindling of the council firea rite handed down through unknown centuries of indian usage by it nations had been made and unmade broad lands passed even as they now might pass the yellow of its crackling flames was shamed by the summer sun and the black smoke of it was wafted by the south wind over the forest then for three days the chiefs spoke and a man listened unmoved the sound of these orations wild and fearful to my boyish ear comes back to me now yet there was a cadence in it a music of notes now falling now rising to a passion and intensity that thrilled us  bad birds flying through the land the british agents had besought them to take up the bloody hatchet they had sinned they had listened to the lies which the bad birds had told of the big knives they had taken their presents but now the great spirit in his wisdom had brought themselves and the chief of the big knives together therefore suiting the action to the word they stamped on the bloody belt and rent in pieces the emblems of the white king across the water so said the interpreters as the chiefs one after another tore the miniature british flags which had been given them into bits on the evening of the third day the white chief rose in his chair gazing haughtily about him there was a deep silence  tell your chiefs he said tell your chiefs that tomorrow i will give them an answer and upon the manner in which they receive that answer depends the fate of your nations good night  they rose and thronging around him sought to take his hand but clark turned from them  peace is not yet come he said sternly it is time to take the hand when the heart is given with it  a feathered headsman of one of the tribes gave back with dignity and spoke  it is well said by the great chief of the pale faces he answered these in truth are not the words of a man with a double tongue  so they sought their quarters for the night and suspense hung breathless over the village  there were many callers at the stone house that eveningspanish officers creole gentlemen an english canadian trader or two with my elbow on the sill of the open window i watched them awhile listening with a boys eagerness to what they had to say of the days doings they disputed amongst themselves in various degrees of english as to the manner of treating the red mannow gesticulating now threatening now seizing a rolled parchment treaty from the table clark sat alone a little apart silent save a word now and then in a low tone to monsieur gratiot or captain bowman here was an odd assortment of the races which had overrun the new world at intervals some disputant would pause in his talk to kill a mosquito or fight away a moth or a junebug but presently the argument reached such a pitch that the mosquitoes fed undisturbed  you have done much sir said the spanish commandant of st louis but the savage he will never be content without present he will never be won without present  clark was one of those men who are perforce listened to when they begin to speak  captain de leyba said he i know not what may be the present policy of his spanish majesty with mcgillivray and his creeks in the south but this i do believe and he brought down his fist among the papers that the old french and spanish treaties were right in principle here are copies of the english treaties that i have secured and in them thousands of sovereigns have been thrown away they are so much waste paper gentlemen the indians are children if you give them presents they believe you to be afraid of them i will deal with them without presents and if i had the gold of the bank of england stored in the garrison there they should not touch a piece of it  but captain de leyba incredulous raised his eyebrows and shrugged  por dios he cried whoever hear of one man and fifty militia subduing the northern tribes without a piastre  after a while the colonel called me in and sent me speeding across the little river with a note to a certain mr brady whose house was not far away like many another citizen of cahokia mr brady was terrorridden a party of young puan bucks had decreed it to be their pleasure to encamp in mr bradys yard to peer through the shutters into mr bradys house to enjoy themselves by annoying mr bradys family and others as much as possible during the indian occupation of cahokia this band had gained a welldeserved reputation for mischief and chief among them was the north wind himself whom i had done the honor to kick in the stomach tonight they had made a fire in this mr bradys flowergarden over which they were cooking venison steaks and as i reached the door the north wind spied me grinned rubbed his stomach made a false dash at me that frightened me out of my wits and finally went through the pantomime of scalping me i stood looking at him with my legs apart for the son of the great chief must not run away and i marked that the north wind had two great ornamental daubs like shutterfastenings painted on his cheeks i sniffed preparation too on his followers and i was sure they were getting ready for some new deviltry i handed the note to mr brady through the crack of the door that he vouchsafed to me and when he had slammed and bolted me out i ran into the street and stood for some time behind the trunk of a big hickory watching the followers of the north wind some were painting themselves others cleaning their rifles and sharpening their scalping knives all jabbered unceasingly now and again a silent brave passed paused a moment to survey them gravely grunted an answer to something they would fling at him and went on at length arrived three chiefs whom i knew to be high in the councils the north wind came out to them and the four blanketed forms stood silhouetted between me and the fire for a quarter of an hour by this time i was sure of a plot and fled away to another tree for fear of detection at length stalked through the street the hungry wolf the interpreter i knew this man to be friendly to clark and i acted on impulse he gave a grunt of surprise when i halted before him i made up my mind  the son of the great chief knows that the puans have wickedness in their hearts tonight i said the tongue of the hungry wolf does not lie  the big indian drew back with another grunt and the distant firelight flashed on his eyes as on polished black flints  umrrhh is the pale face chiefs son a prophet  the anger of the pale face chief and of his countrymen is as the hurricane i said scarce believing my own ears for a lad is imitative by nature and i had not listened to the interpreters for three days without profit  the hungry wolf grunted again after which he was silent for a long time then he said  let the chief of the long knives have guard tonight and suddenly he was gone into the darkness  i waded the creek and sped to clark he was alone now the shutters of the room closed and as i came in i could scarce believe that he was the same masterful man i had seen at the council that day and at the conference an hour gone he was once more the friend at whose feet i sat in private who talked to me as a companion and a father  where have you been davy he asked and then what is it my lad  i crept close to him and told him in a breathless undertone and i knew that i was shaking the while he listened gravely and when i had finished laid a firm hand on my head  there he said you are a brave lad and a canny  he thought a minute his hand still resting on my head and then rose and led me to the back door of the house it was near midnight and the sounds of the place were stilling the crickets chirping in the grass  run to captain bowman and tell him to send ten men to this door but they must come man by man to escape detection do you understand i nodded and was starting but he still held me god bless you davy you are a brave boy  he closed the door softly and i sped away my moccasins making no sound on the soft dirt i reached the garrison was challenged by jack terrill the guard and brought by him to bowmans room the captain sat undressed at the edge of his bed but he was a man of action and strode into the long room where his company was sleeping and gave his orders without delay  half an hour later there was no light in the village the colonels headquarters were dark but in the kitchen a dozen tall men were waiting    chapter xvii the sacrifice  so far as the world knew the chief of the long knives slept peacefully in his house and such was his sense of power that not even a sentry paced the street without for by these things is the indian mind impressed in the tiny kitchen a dozen men and a boy tried to hush their breathing and sweltered for it was very hot and the pentup odor of past cookings was stifling to men used to the open in a corner hooded under a box was a lighted lantern and tom mcchesney stood ready to seize it at the first alarm on such occasions the current of time runs sluggish thrice our muscles were startled into tenseness by the baying of a hound and once a cock crew out of all season for the night was cloudy and pitchy black and the dawn as far away as eternity  suddenly i knew that every man in the room was on the alert for the skilled frontiersman when watchful has a sixth sense none of them might have told you what he had heard the next sound was the faint creaking of colonel clarks door as it opened wrapping a blanket around the lantern tom led the way and we massed ourselves behind the front door another breathing space and then the warcry of the puans broke hideously on the night and children woke crying from their sleep in two bounds our little detachment was in the street the fire spouting red from the deckards faint shadowy forms fading along the line of trees after that an uproar of awakening cries here and there a drum beating madly for the militia the dozen flung themselves across the stream i hot in their wake through mr bradys gate which was open and there was a scene of sweet tranquillity under the lanterns raysthe north wind and his friends wrapped in their blankets and sleeping the sleep of the just  damn the sly varmints cried tom and he turned over the north wind with his foot as a log  with a grunt of fury the indian shed his blanket and scrambled to his feet and stood glaring at us through his paint but suddenly he met the fixed sternness of clarks gaze and his own shifted by this time his followers were up the north wind raised his hands to heaven in token of his innocence and then spread his palms outward where was the proof  look i cried quivering with excitement look their leggings and moccasins are wet  theres no devil if they beant said tom and there was a murmur of approval from the other men  the boy is right said the colonel and turned to tom sergeant have the chiefs put in irons he swung on his heel and without more ado went back to his house to bed the north wind and two others were easily singled out as the leaders and were straightway escorted to the garrison house their air of injured innocence availing them not a whit the militia was dismissed and the village was hushed once more  but all night long the chiefs went to and fro taking counsel among themselves what would the chief of the pale faces do  the morning came with a cloudy damp dawning within a decent time for the indian is decorous blanketed deputations filled the archways under the trees and waited there as the minutes ran into hours the chief of the long knives surveyed the morning from his doorstep and his eyes rested on a solemn figure at the gate it was the hungry wolf sorrow was in his voice and he bore messages from the twenty great chiefs who stood beyond they were come to express their abhorrence of the nights doings of which they were as innocent as the deer of the forest  let the hungry wolf tell the chiefs said colonel clark briefly that the council is the place for talk  and he went back into the house again  then he bade me run to captain bowman with an order to bring the north wind and his confederates to the council field in irons  the day followed the promise of the dawn the clouds hung low and now and again great drops struck the faces of the people in the field and like the heavens the assembly itself was charged with we knew not what was it peace or war as before a white man sat with supreme indifference at a table and in front of him three most unhappy chiefs squatted in the grass the shame of their irons hidden under the blanket folds audacity is truly a part of the equipment of genius to have rescued the north wind and his friends would have been childs play to have retired from the council with threats of war as easy  and yet they craved pardon  one chief after another rose with dignity in the ring and came to the table to plead an argument deserving mention was that the north wind had desired to test the friendship of the french for the big knivesset forth without a smile to all pleaders colonel clark shook his head he being a warrior cared little whether such people were friends or foes he held them in the hollow of his hand and at length they came no more  the very clouds seemed to hang motionless when he rose to speak and you who will may read in his memoir what he said the hungry wolf caught the spirit of it and was eloquent in his own tongue and no word of it was lost first he told them of the causes of war of the thirteen council fires with the english and in terms that the indian mind might grasp and how their old father the french king had joined the big knives in this righteous fight  warriors said he here is a bloody belt and a white one take which you choose but behave like men should it be the bloody path you may leave this town in safety to join the english and we shall then see which of us can stain our shirts with the most blood but should it be the path of peace as brothers of the big knives and of their friends the french and then you go to your homes and listen to the bad birds you will then no longer deserve to be called men and warriorsbut creatures of two tongues which ought to be destroyed let us then part this evening in the hope that the great spirit will bring us together again with the sun as brothers  so the council broke up white man and red went trooping into town staring curiously at the guard which was leading the north wind and his friends to another night of meditation what their fate would be no man knew many thought the tomahawk  that night the citizens of the little village of pain court as st louis was called might have seen the sky reddened in the eastward it was the loom of many fires at cahokia and around them the chiefs of the forty tribesall save the three in durance vilewere gathered in solemn talk would they take the bloody belt or the white one no man cared so little as the pale face chief when their eyes were turned from the fitful blaze of the logs the gala light of many candles greeted them and above the sound of their own speeches rose the merrier note of the fiddle the garrison windows shone like lanterns and behind these creole and backwoodsman swung the village ladies in the gay french dances the man at whose bidding this merrymaking was held stood in a corner watching with folded arms and none to look at him might know that he was playing for a stake  the troubled fires of the indians had died to embers long before the candles were snuffed in the garrison house and the music ceased  the sun himself was pleased to hail that last morning of the great council and beamed with torrid tolerance upon the ceremony of kindling the greatest of the fires on this morning colonel clark did not sit alone but was surrounded by men of weightby monsieur gratiot and other citizens captain bowman and the spanish officers and when at length the brush crackled and the flames caught the logs three of the mightiest chiefs arose the greatest victor in fifty tribal wars held in his hand the white belt of peace the second bore a longstemmed pipe with a huge bowl and after him with measured steps a third came with a smoking censerthe sacred fire with which to kindle the pipe halting before clark he first swung the censer to the heavens then to the earth then to all the spirits of the aircalling these to witness that peace was come at lastand finally to the chief of the long knives and to the gentlemen of dignity about his person next the indian turned and spoke to his brethren in measured sonorous tones he bade them thank that great spirit who had cleared the sky and opened their ears and hearts that they might receive the truthwho had laid bare to their understanding the lies of the english even as these english had served the big knives so might they one day serve the indians therefore he commanded them to cast the tomahawk into the river and when they should return to their land to drive the evil birds from it and they must send their wise men to kaskaskia to hear the words of wisdom of the great white chief clark he thanked the great spirit for this council fire which he had kindled at cahokia  lifting the bowl of the censer in the eyes of all the people he drew in a long whiff to bear witness of peace after him the pipe went the interminable rounds of the chiefs colonel clark took it and puffed captain bowman puffedeverybody puffed  davy must have a pull cried tom and even the chiefs smiled as i coughed and sputtered while my friends roared with laughter it gave me no great notion of the fragrance of tobacco and then came such a handshaking and grunting as a man rarely sees in a lifetime  there was but one disquieting question left what was to become of the north wind and his friends none dared mention the matter at such a time but at length as the day wore on to afternoon the colonel was seen to speak quietly to captain bowman and several backwoodsmen went off toward the town and presently a silence fell on the company as they beheld the dejected three crossing the field with a guard they were led before clark and when he saw them his face hardened to sternness  it is only women who watch to catch a bear sleeping he said the big knives do not kill women i shall give you meat for your journey home for women cannot hunt if you remain here you shall be treated as squaws set the women free  tom mcchesney cast off their irons as for clark he began to talk immediately with monsieur gratiot as though he had dismissed them from his mind and their agitation was a pitiful thing to see in vain they pressed about him in vain they even pulled the fringe of his shirt to gain his attention and then they went about among the other chiefs but these dared not intercede uneasiness was written on every mans face and the talk went haltingly but clark was serenity itself at length with a supreme effort they plucked up courage to come again to the table one holding out the belt of peace and the other the still smouldering pipe  clark paused in his talk he took the belt and flung it away over the heads of those around him he seized the pipe and taking up his sword from the table drew it and with one blow clave the stem in half there was no anger in either act but much deliberation  the big knives he said scornfully do not treat with women  the pleading began again the hungry wolf interpreting with tremors of earnestness their lives were spared but to what purpose since the white chief looked with disfavor upon them let him know that bad men from michilimackinac put the deed into their hearts  when the big knives come upon such people in the wilderness clark answered they shoot them down that they may not eat the deer but they have never talked of it  he turned from them once more they went away in a dejection to wring our compassion and we thought the matter ended at last the sun was falling low the people beginning to move away when to the astonishment of all the culprits were seen coming back again with them were two young men of their own nation the indians opened up a path for them to pass through and they came as men go to the grave so mournful so impressive withal that the crowd fell into silence again and the colonel turned his eyes the two young men sank down on the ground before him and shrouded their heads in their blankets  what is this clark demanded  the north wind spoke in a voice of sorrow  an atonement to the great white chief for the sins of our nation perchance the great chief will deign to strike a tomahawk into their heads that our nation may be saved in war by the big knives and the north wind held forth the pipe once more  i have nothing to say to you said clark  still they stood irresolute their minds now bereft of expedients and the young men sat motionless on the ground as clark talked they peered out from under their blankets once twice thrice he was still talking to the wondering monsieur gratiot but no other voice was heard and the eyes of all were turned on him in amazement but at last when the drama had risen to the pitch of unbearable suspense he looked down upon the two miserable pyramids at his feet and touched them the blankets quivered  stand up said the colonel and uncover  they rose cast the blankets from them and stood with a stoic dignity awaiting his pleasure wonderful finelimbed men they were and for the first time clarks eyes were seen to kindle  i thank the great spirit said he in a loud voice that i have found men among your nation that i have at last discovered the real chiefs of your people had they sent such as you to treat with me in the beginning all might have been well go back to your people as their chiefs and tell them that through you the big knives have granted peace to your nation  stepping forward he grasped them each by the hand and despite training joy shone in their faces while a longdrawn murmur arose from the assemblage but clark did not stop there he presented them to captain bowman and to the french and spanish gentlemen present and they were hailed by their own kind as chiefs of their nation to cap it all our troops backwoodsmen and creole militia paraded in line on the common and fired a salute in their honor  thus did clark gain the friendship of the forty tribes in the northwest country    chapter xviii an ye had been where i had been  we went back to kaskaskia colonel clark tom and myself and a great weight was lifted from our hearts  a peaceful autumn passed and we were happy save when we thought of those we had left at home there is no space here to tell of many incidents great chiefs who had not been to the council came hundreds of leagues across wide rivers that they might see with their own eyes this man who had made peace without gold and these had to be amused and entertained  the apples ripened and were shaken to the ground by the winds the good father gibault true to his promise strove to teach me french indeed i picked up much of that language in my intercourse with the inhabitants of kaskaskia how well i recall that simple lifeits dances its songs and the games with the laughing boys and girls on the common and the good people were very kind to the orphan that dwelt with colonel clark the drummer boy of his regiment  but winter brought forebodings when the garden patches grew bare and brown and the bleak winds from across the mississippi swept over the common untoward tidings came like water dripping from a roof bit by bit and day by day colonel clark looked graver the messengers he had sent to vincennes came not back and the coureurs and traders from time to time brought rumors of a british force gathering like a thundercloud in the northeast monsieur vigo himself who had gone to vincennes on his own business did not return as for the inhabitants some of them who had once bowed to us with a smile now passed with faces averted  the cold set the miry roads like cement in ruts and ridges a flurry of snow came and powdered the roofs even as the french loaves are powdered  it was january there was colonel clark on a runt of an indian pony tom mcchesney on another riding ahead several french gentlemen seated on stools in a twowheeled cart and myself we were going to cahokia and it was very cold and when the tireless wheels bumped from ridge to gully the gentlemen grabbed each other as they slid about and laughed  all at once the merriment ceased and looking forward we saw that tom had leaped from his saddle and was bending over something in the snow these chanced to be the footprints of some twenty men  the immediate result of this alarming discovery was that tom went on express to warn captain bowman and the rest of us returned to a painful scene at kaskaskia we reached the village the french gentlemen leaped down from their stools in the cart and in ten minutes the streets were filled with frenzied hooded figures hamilton called the hair buyer was upon them with no less than six hundred and he would hang them to their own gateposts for listening to the long knives these were but a handful after all was said there was father gibault for example father gibault would doubtless be exposed to the crows in the belfry of his own church because he had busied himself at vincennes and with other matters father gibault was human and therefore lovable he bade his parishioners a hasty and tearful farewell and he made a cold and painful journey to the territories of his spanish majesty across the mississippi  father gibault looked back and against the gray of the winters twilight there were flames like red maple leaves in the fort the men stood to their guns their faces flushed with staring at the burning houses only a few were burnedenough to give no cover for hamilton and his six hundred if they came  but they did not come the faithful bowman and his men arrived instead with the news that there had been only a roving party of forty and these were now in full retreat  father gibault came back but where was hamilton this was the disquieting thing  one bitter day when the sun smiled mockingly on the powdered common a horseman was perceived on the fort chartres road it was monsieur vigo returning from vincennes but he had been first to st louis by reason of the value he set upon his head yes monsieur vigo had been to vincennes remaining a little longer than he expected the guest of governor hamilton so governor hamilton had recaptured that place monsieur vigo was no spy hence he had gone first to st louis governor hamilton was at vincennes with much of king georges gold and many supplies and certain indians who had not been at the council eight hundred in all said monsieur vigo using his fingers and it was governor hamiltons design to march upon kaskaskia and cahokia and sweep over kentucky nay he had already sent certain emissaries to mcgillivray and his creeks and the southern indians with presents and these were to press forward on their side the governor could do nothing now but would move as soon as the rigors of winter had somewhat relented monsieur vigo shook his head and shrugged his shoulders he loved les americains what would monsieur le colonel do now  monsieur le colonel was grave but this was his usual manner he did not tear his hair but the ways of the long knives were past understanding he asked many questions how was it with the garrison at vincennes monsieur vigo was exact as a business man should be they were now reduced to eighty men and five hundred savages had gone out to ravage there was no chance then of hamilton moving at present monsieur vigo threw up his hands never had he made such a trip and he had been forced to come back by a northern route the wabash was as the great lakes and the forests grew out of the water a fox could not go to vincennes in this weather a fish monsieur vigo laughed heartily yes a fish might  then said colonel clark we will be fish  monsieur vigo stared and passed his hand from his forehead backwards over his long hair i leaned forward in my corner by the hickory fire  then we will be fish said colonel clark better that than food for the crows for if we stay here we shall be caught like bears in a trap and kentucky will be at hamiltons mercy  sacre exclaimed monsieur vigo you are mad mon ami i know what this country is and you cannot get to vincennes  i will get to vincennes said colonel clark so gently that monsieur vigo knew he meant it i will swim to vincennes  monsieur vigo raised his hands to heaven the three of us went out of the door and walked there was a snowy place in front of the church all partycolored like a clowns coatscarlet capotes yellow capotes and blue capotes and bright silk handkerchiefs they surrounded the colonel pardieu what was he to do now for the british governor and his savages were coming to take revenge on them because in their necessity they had declared for congress colonel clark went silently on his way to the gate but monsieur vigo stopped and kaskaskia heard with a shock that this man of iron was to march against vincennes  the gates of the fort were shut and the captains summoned undaunted woodsmen as they were they were lukewarm at first at the idea of this march through the floods who can blame them they had indeed sacrificed much but in ten minutes they had caught his enthusiasm which is one of the mysteries of genius and the men paraded in the snow likewise caught it and swung their hats at the notion of taking the hair buyer  tis no news to me said terence stamping his feet on the flinty ground wasnt it davy that pointed him out to us and the hair liftin from his head six months since  und you like schwimmin yes said swein poulsson his face like the rising sun with the cold  swimmin is it said terence sure the divil made worse things than wather and hamiltons beyant  i reckon thatll fetch us through bill cowan put in grimly  it was a blessed thing that none of us had a birdseye view of that same water no man of force will listen when his mind is made up and perhaps it is just as well for in that way things are accomplished clark would not listen to monsieur vigo and hence the financier had perforce to listen to clark there were several miracles before we left monsieur vigo for instance agreed to pay the expenses of the expedition though in his heart he thought we should never get to vincennes incidentally he was never repaid then there were the frenchyesterday running hither and thither in paroxysms of fear today enlisting in whole companies though it were easier to get to the wild geese of the swamps than to hamilton their ladies stitched colors day and night and presented them with simple confidence to the colonel in the church twenty stands of colors for 170 men counting those who had come from cahokia think of the industry of it of the enthusiasm behind it twenty stands of colors clark took them all and in due time it will be told how the colors took vincennes this was because colonel clark was a man of destiny  furthermore colonel clark was off the next morning at dawn to buy a mississippi keelboat he had her rigged up with two fourpounders and four swivels filled her with provisions and called her the willing she was the first gunboat on the western waters a great fear came into my heart and at dusk i stole back to the colonels house alone the snow had turned to rain and terence stood guard within the doorway  arrah he said what ails ye darlin  i gulped and the tears sprang into my eyes whereupon terence in defiance of all military laws laid his gun against the doorpost and put his arms around me and i confided my fears it was at this critical juncture that the door opened and colonel clark came out  whats to do here he demanded gazing at us sternly  savin your honors prisence said terence hes afeard your honor will be sending him on the boat sure he wants to go swimmin with the rest of us  colonel clark frowned bit his lip and terence seized his gun and stood to attention  it were right to leave you in kaskaskia said the colonel the water will be over your head  the kings drum would be floatin the likes of him said the irrepressible terence and the bys would be that lonesome  the colonel walked away without a word in an hours time he came back to find me cleaning his accoutrements by the fire for a while he did not speak but busied himself with his papers i having lighted the candles for him presently he spoke my name and i stood before him  i will give you a piece of advice davy said he if you want a thing go straight to the man that has it mcchesney has spoken to me about this wild notion of yours of going to vincennes and cowan and mccann and ray and a dozen others have dogged my footsteps  i only spoke to terence because he asked me sir i answered i said nothing to any one else  he laid down his pen and looked at me with an odd expression  what a weird little piece you are he exclaimed you seem to have wormed your way into the hearts of these men do you know that you will probably never get to vincennes alive  i dont care sir i said a happy thought struck me if they see a boy going through the water sir i hesitated abashed  what then said clark shortly  it may keep some from going back i finished  at that he gave a sort of gasp and stared at me the more  egad he said i believe the good lord launched you wrong end to perchance you will be a child when you are fifty  he was silent a long time and fell to musing and i thought he had forgotten  may i go sir i asked at length  he started  come here said he but when i was close to him he merely laid his hand on my shoulder yes you may go davy  he sighed and presently turned to his writing again and i went back joyfully to my cleaning  on a certain dark 4th of february picture the village of kaskaskia assembled on the riverbank in capote and hood ropes are cast off the keelboat pushes her blunt nose through the cold muddy water the oars churn up dirty yellow foam and cheers shake the sodden air so the willing left on her long journey down the kaskaskia into the flood of the mississippi against many weary leagues of the ohios current and up the swollen wabash until they were to come to the mouth of the white river near vincennes there they were to await us  should we ever see them again i think that this was the unspoken question in the hearts of the many who were to go by land  the 5th was a mild gray day with the melting snow lying in patches on the brown bluff and the sun making shift to pierce here and there we formed the regiment in the fortbackwoodsman and creole now to fight for their common country jacques and pierre and alphonse and mother and father sweetheart and wife waiting to wave a last goodby bravely we marched out of the gate and into the church for father gibaults blessing and then forming once more we filed away on the road leading northward to the ferry our colors flying leaving the weeping cheering crowd behind in front of the tall men of the column was a wizened figure beating madly on a drum stepping proudly with head thrown back it was cowans voice that snapped the strain  go it davy my little gamecock he cried and the men laughed and cheered and so we came to the bleak ferry landing where we had crossed on that hot july night six months before  we were soon on the prairies and in the misty rain that fell and fell they seemed to melt afar into a gray and cheerless ocean the sodden grass was matted now and unkempt lifeless lakes filled the depressions and through them we waded mile after mile ankledeep there was a little cavalcade mounted on the tiny french ponies and sometimes i rode with these but oftenest cowan or tom would fling me drum and all on his shoulder for we had reached the forest swamps where the water is the color of the creole coffee and day after day as we marched the soft rain came out of the east and wet us to the skin  it was a journey of torments and even that first part of it was enough to discourage the most resolute spirit men might be led through it but never driven it is ever the mind which suffers through the monotonies of bodily discomfort and none knew this better than clark himself every morning as we set out with the wet hide chafing our skin the colonel would run the length of the regiment crying  who gives the feast tonight boys  now it was bowmans company now mccartys now bayleys how the hunters vied with each other to supply the best and spent the days stalking the deer cowering in the wet thickets we crossed the saline and on the plains beyond was a great black patch a herd of buffalo a party of chosen men headed by tom mcchesney was sent after them and never shall i forget the sight of the mad beasts charging through the water  that night when our chilled feet could bear no more we sought out a patch of raised ground a little firmer than a quagmire and heaped up the beginnings of a fire with such brush as could be made to burn robbing the naked thickets saddle and steak sizzled leather steamed and stiffened hearts and bodies thawed grievances that men had nursed over miles of water melted courage sits best on a full stomach and as they ate they cared not whether the atlantic had opened between them and vincennes an hour agone and there were twenty cursing laggards counting the leagues back to kaskaskia now            cetait un vieux sauvage           tout noir tour barbouilla              ouich ka           avec sa vieill couverte           et son sac a tabac              ouich ka           ah ah tenaouich tenaga           tenaouich tenaga              ouich ka  so sang antoine dit le gris in the pulsing red light and when between the verses he went through the agonies of a huron wardance the assembled regiment howled with delight some men know cities and those who dwell in the quarters of cities but grizzled antoine knew the half of a continent and the manners of trading and killing of the tribes thereof  and after antoine came gabriel a marked contrastgabriel five feet six and the glare showing but a faint dark line on his quivering lip gabriel was a patriota tribute we must pay to all of those brave frenchmen who went with us nay gabriel had left at home on his little farm near the village a young wife of a fortnight and so his lip quivered as he sang         petit rocher de la haute montagne         je vien finir ici cette campagne         ah doux echos entendez mes soupirs         en languissant je vais bientot mouir  we had need of gayety after that and so bill cowan sang billy of the wild wood and terence mccann wailed an irish jig stamping the water out of the spongy ground amidst storms of mirth as he desisted breathless and panting he flung me up in the firelight before the eyes of them all crying  its davy can bate me  ay davy davy they shouted for they were in the mood for anything there stood colonel clark in the dimmer light of the background we must keep em screwed up davy he had said that very day  there came to me on the instant a wild song that my father had taught me when the liquor held him in dominance exhilarated i sprang from terences arms to the sodden bared space and methinks i yet hear my shrill piping note and see my legs kicking in the fling of it there was an uproar a deeper voice chimed in and here was mcandrew flinging his legs with mine         ive faught on land ive faught at sea           at hame i faught my aunty o         but i met the deevil and dundee           on the braes o killiecrankie o         an ye had been where i had been           ye wad na be sae cantie o         an ye had seen what i hae seen           on the braes o killiecrankie o  in the morning clark himself would be the first off through the gray rain laughing and shouting and waving his sword in the air and i after him as hard as i could pelt through the mud beating the charge on my drum until the warcries of the regiment drowned the sound of it for we were upon a pleasure triplest any man forgeta pleasure trip amidst stark woods and brown plains flecked with ponds so we followed him until we came to a place where in summer two quiet rivers flowed through green foreststhe little wabashes and now now hickory and maple oak and cottonwood stood shivering in three feet of water on what had been a league of dry land we stood dismayed at the crumbling edge of the hill and one hundred and seventy pairs of eyes were turned on clark with a mere glance at the running stream high on the bank and the drowned forest beyond he turned and faced them  i reckon youve earned a rest boys he said well have games today  there were some dozen of the unflinching who needed not to be amused choosing a great poplar these he set to hollowing out a pirogue and himself came among the others and played leapfrog and the indian game of ball until night fell and these instead of moping and quarrelling forgot that night as i cooked him a buffalo steak he drew near the fire with bowman  for the love of god keep up their spirits bowman said the colonel keep up their spirits until we get them across once on the farther hills they cannot go back  here was a different being from the shouting boy who had led the games and the wardance that night in the circle of the blaze tired out we went to sleep with the ring of the axes in our ears and in the morning there were more games while the squad crossed the river to the drowned neck built a rough scaffold there and notched a trail across it to the scaffold the baggage was ferried and the next morning bit by bit the regiment even now the pains shoot through my body when i think of how man after man plunged waistdeep into the icy water toward the farther branch the pirogue was filled with the weak and in the end of it i was curled up with my drum  heroism is a manysided thing it is one matter to fight and finish another to endure hells tortures hour after hour all day they waded with numbed feet vainly searching for a footing in the slime truly the agony of a brave man is among the greatest of the worlds tragedies to see as they splashed onward through the treetrunks many a joke went forth though lips were drawn and teeth pounded together i have not the heart to recall these jokesit would seem a sacrilege there were quarrels too the men striving to push one another from the easier paths and deeds sublime when some straggler clutched at the bole of a tree for support and was helped onward through excruciating ways a dozen held tremblingly to the pirogues gunwale lest they fall and drown one walked ahead with a smile or else fell back to lend a helping shoulder to a fainting man  and there was tom mcchesney all day long i watched him and thanked god that polly ann could not see him thus and yet how the pride would have leaped within her humor came not easily to him but charity and courage and unselfishness he had in abundance what he suffered none knew but through those awful hours he was always among the stragglers helping the weak and despairing when his strength might have taken him far ahead toward comfort and safety im all right davy he would say in answer to my look as he passed me but on his face was written something that i did not understand  how the creole farmers and traders unused even to the common ways of woodcraft endured that fearful day and others that followed i know not and when a tardy justice shall arise and compel the people of this land to raise a shaft in memory of clark and those who followed him let not the loyalty of the french be forgotten though it be not understood  at eventide came to lurid and disordered brains the knowledge that the other branch was here and mercifully it was shallower than the first holding his rifle high with a warwhoop bill cowan plunged into the stream unable to contain myself more i flung my drum overboard and went after it and amid shouts and laughter i was towed across by james ray  colonel clark stood watching from the bank above and it was he who pulled me bedraggled to dry land i ran away to help gather brush for a fire as i was heaping this in a pile i heard something that i should not have heard nor ought i to repeat it now though i did not need the flames to send the blood tingling through my body  mcchesney said the colonel we must thank our stars that we brought the boy along he has grit and as good a head as any of us i reckon if it hadnt been for him some of them would have turned back long ago  i saw tom grinning at the colonel as gratefully as though he himself had been praised  the blaze started and soon we had a bonfire some had not the strength to hold out the buffalo meat to the fire even the grumblers and mutineers were silent owing to the ordeal they had gone through but presently when they began to be warmed and fed they talked of other trials to be borne the embarrass and the big wabash for example these must be like the sea itself  take the back trail if ye like said bill cowan with a loud laugh i reckon the rest of us kin float to vincennes on davys drum  but there was no taking the back trail now and well they knew it the games began the unwilling being forced to play and before they fell asleep that night they had taken vincennes scalped the hair buyer and were far on the march to detroit  mercifully now that their stomachs were full they had no worries few knew the danger we were in of being cut off by hamiltons roving bands of indians there would be no retreat no escape but a fight to the death and i heard this and much more that was spoken of in low tones at the colonels fire far into the night of which i never told the rank and filenot even tom mcchesney  on and on through rain and water we marched until we drew near to the river embarrass drew near did i say sure darlin said terence staring comically over the gray waste weve been in it since choosdy there was small exaggeration in it in vain did our feet seek the deeper water it would go no higher than our knees and the sound which the regiment made in marching was like that of a great flatboat going against the current it had been a sad lavendercolored day and now that the gloom of the night was setting in and not so much as a hummock showed itself above the surface the creoles began to murmur and small wonder where was this man leading them this clark who had come amongst them from the skies as it were did he know himself night fell as though a blanket had been spread over the treetops and above the dreary splashing men could be heard calling to one another in the darkness nor was there any supper ahead for our food was gone and no game was to be shot over this watery waste a cold like that of eternal space settled in our bones even terence mccann grumbled  begob said he tis fine weather for fishes and the birrds are that comfortable in the threes tis no place for a baste at all at all  sometime in the night there was a cry ray had found the water falling from an oozy bank and there we dozed fitfully until we were startled by a distant boom  it was governor hamiltons morning gun at fort sackville vincennes  there was no breakfast how we made our way benumbed with hunger and cold to the banks of the wabash i know not captain mccartys company was set to making canoes and the rest of us looked on apathetically as the huge trees staggered and fell amidst a fountain of spray in the shallow water we were but three leagues from vincennes a raft was bound together and tom mcchesney and three other scouts sent on a desperate journey across the river in search of boats and provisions lest we starve and fall and die on the wet flats before he left tom came to me and the remembrance of his gaunt face haunted me for many years after he drew something from his bosom and held it out to me and i saw that it was a bit of buffalo steak which he had saved i shook my head and the tears came into my eyes  come davy he said yere so little and i beant hungry  again i shook my head and for the life of me i could say nothing  i reckon polly annd never forgive me if anything was to happen to you said he  at that i grew strangely angry  its you who need it i cried its you that has to do the work and she told me to take care of you  the big fellow grinned sheepishly as was his wont  tis only a bite he pleaded twouldnt only make me hungry andhe looked hard at meand it might be the savin of you yell not eat it for polly anns sake he asked coaxingly  twould not be serving her i answered indignantly  yere an obstinate little deevil he cried and dropping the morsel on the freshly cut stump he stalked away i ran after him crying out but he leaped on the raft that was already in the stream and began to pole across i slipped the piece into my own hunting shirt  all day the men who were too weak to swing axes sat listless on the bank watching in vain for some sight of the willing they saw a canoe rounding the bend instead with a single occupant paddling madly and who should this be but captain willings own brother escaped from the fort where he had been a prisoner he told us that a man named maisonville with a party of indians was in pursuit of him and the next piece of news he had was in the way of raising our despair a little governor hamiltons astonishment at seeing this force here and now would be as great as his own governor hamilton had said indeed that only a navy could take vincennes this year unfortunately mr willing brought no food next in order came five frenchmen trapped by our scouts nor had they any provisions but as long as i live i shall never forget how tom mcchesney returned at nightfall the hero of the hour he had shot a deer and never did wolves pick an animal cleaner they pressed on me a choice piece of it these greathearted men who were willing to go hungry for the sake of a child and when i refused it they would have forced it down my throat swein poulsson he that once hid under the bed deserves a special tablet to his memory he was for giving me all he had though his little eyes were unnaturally bright and the red had left his cheeks now  he haf no belly only a leedle on his backbone he cried  begob thin he has the backbone said terence  i have a piece said i and drew forth that which tom had given me  they brought a quarter of a saddle to colonel clark but he smiled at them kindly and told them to divide it amongst the weak he looked at me as i sat with my feet crossed on the stump  i will follow davys example said he  at length the canoes were finished and we crossed the river swimming over the few miserable skeletons of the french ponies we had brought along we came to a sugar camp and beyond it stretching between us and vincennes was a sea of water here we made our camp if camp it could be called there was no fire no food and the water seeped out of the ground on which we lay some of those even who had not yet spoken now openly said that we could go no farther for the wind had shifted into the northwest and for the first time since we had left kaskaskia we saw the stars gleaming like scattered diamonds in the sky bit by bit the ground hardened and if by chance we dozed we stuck to it morning found the men huddled like sheep their hunting shirts hard as boards and long before hamiltons gun we were up and stamping antoine poked the butt of his rifle through the ice of the lake in front of us  i think we not get to vincennes this day he said  colonel clark who heard him turned to me  fetch mcchesney here davy he said tom came  mcchesney said he when i give the word take davy and his drum on your shoulders and follow me and davy do you think you can sing that song you gave us the other night  oh yes sir i answered  without more ado the colonel broke the skim of ice and taking some of the water in his hand poured powder from his flask into it and rubbed it on his face until he was the color of an indian stepping back he raised his sword high in the air and shouting the shawanee warwhoop took a flying leap up to his thighs in the water tom swung me instantly to his shoulder and followed i beating the charge with all my might though my hands were so numb that i could scarce hold the sticks strangest of all to a man they came shouting after us  now davy said the colonel         ive faught on land ive faught at sea           at hame i faught my aunty o         but i met the deevil and dundee           on the braes o killiecrankie o  i piped it at the top of my voice and sure enough the regiment took up the chorus for it had a famous swing         an ye had been where i had been           ye wad na be sae cantie o         an ye had seen what i hae seen           on the braes o killiecrankie o  when their breath was gone we heard cowan shout that he had found a path under his feeta path that was on dry land in the summertime we followed it feeling carefully and at length when we had suffered all that we could bear we stumbled on to a dry ridge here we spent another night of torture with a second backwater facing us coated with a full inch of ice  and still there was nothing to eat    chapter xix the hair buyer trapped  to lie the night on adamant pierced by the needles of the frost to awake shivering and famished until the meaning of an inch of ice on the backwater comes to your mindthese are not calculated to put a man into an equable mood to listen to oratory nevertheless there was a kind of oratory to fit the case to picture the misery of these men is wellnigh impossible they stood sluggishly in groups dazed by suffering and their faces were drawn and their eyes ringed their beards and hair matted and many found it in their hearts to curse clark and that government for which he fought  when the red fire of the sun glowed through the bare branches that morning it seemed as if the campaign had spent itself like an arrow which drops at the foot of the mark could life and interest and enthusiasm be infused again in such as these i have ceased to marvel how it was done a man no less haggard than the rest but with a compelling force in his eyes pointed with a blade to the hills across the river they must get to them he said and their troubles would be ended he said more and they cheered him these are the bare facts he picked a man here and another there and these went silently to a grim duty behind the regiment  if any try to go back shoot them down he cried  then with a gunbutt he shattered the ice and was the first to leap into the water under it they followed some with a cheer that was most pitiful of all they followed him blindly as men go to torture but they followed him and the splashing and crushing of the ice were sounds to freeze my body i was put in a canoe in my day i have beheld great suffering and hardship and none of it compared to this torn with pity i saw them reeling through the water now grasping trees and bushes to try to keep their feet the strongest breaking the way ahead and supporting the weak between them more than once clark himself tottered where he beat the ice at the apex of the line some swooned and would have drowned had they not been dragged across the canoe and chafed back to consciousness by inches the water shallowed clark reached the high ground and then bill cowan with a man on each shoulder then others endured to the shallows to fall heavily in the crumbled ice and be dragged out before they died but at length by gods grace the whole regiment was on the land fires would not revive some but clark himself seized a fainting man by the arms and walked him up and down in the sunlight until his blood ran again  it was a glorious day a day when the sap ran in the maples and the sun soared upwards in a sky of the palest blue all this we saw through the tracery of the leafless branchesa mirthless shivering crowd crept through a hell of weather into the hair buyers very lair had he neither heard nor seen  down the steelblue lane of water between the ice came a canoe our stunted senses perceived it unresponsive a man cried out it was tom mcchesney now some of them had leaped into the pirogue now they were returning in the towed canoe two fat and stolid squaws and a pappoose were huddled and beside themgod be praisedfood a piece of buffalo on its way to town and in the end compartment of the boat tallow and bears grease lay revealed by two blows of the tomahawk the kettleslong disusedwere fetched and broth made and fed in sips to the weakest while the strongest looked on and smiled in an agony of selfrestraint it was a fearful thing to see men whose legs had refused service struggle to their feet when they had drunk the steaming greasy mixture and the colonel standing by the rivers edge turned his face awaydownstream and then as often i saw the other side of the man suddenly he looked at me standing wistful at his side  they have cursed me said he by way of a question they have cursed me every day and seeing me silent he insisted tell me is it not so davy  it is so i said wondering that he should pry but it was while they suffered andand some refrained  and you he asked queerly  ii could not sir for i asked leave to come  if they have condemned me to a thousand hells said he dispassionately i should not blame them again he looked at me do you understand what you have done he asked  no sir i said uneasily  and yet there are some human qualities in you davy you have been worth more to me than another regiment  i stared  when you grow older if you ever do tell your children that once upon a time you put a hundred men to shame it is no small thing  seeing him relapse into silence i did not speak for the space of half an hour he stared down the river and i knew that he was looking vainly for the willing  at noon we crossed piecemeal a deep lake in the canoes and marching awhile came to a timbercovered rise which our french prisoners named as the warriors island and from the shelter of its trees we saw the steely lines of a score of low ponds and over the tops of as many ridges a huddle of brown houses on the higher ground  and this was the place we had all but sold our lives to behold this was vincennes at last we were on the heights behind the townwe were at the back door as it were at the far side on the wabash river was the front door or fort sackville where the banner of england snapped in the february breeze  we stood there looking as the afternoon light flooded the plain suddenly the silence was broken  hooray for clark cried a man at the edge of the copse  hooray for clarkit was the whole regiment this time from execration to exaltation was but a step after all and the creoles fell to scoffing at their sufferings and even forgot their hunger in staring at the goal the backwoodsmen took matters more stolidly having acquired long since the art of waiting they lounged about cleaning their guns watching the myriad flocks of wild ducks and geese casting blueblack shadows on the ponds  arrah mcchesney said terence as he watched the circling birds clarks a great man but tis more riverince id have for him if wan av thim was sizzling on the end of me ramrod  id sooner hev the har buyers sculp said tom  presently there was a drama performed for our delectation a shot came down the wind and we perceived that several innocent creole gentlemen unconscious of what the timber held were shooting the ducks and geese whereupon clark chose antoine and three of our own creoles to sally out and shoot likewiseas decoys we watched them working their way over the ridges and finally saw them coming back with one of the vincennes sportsmen i cannot begin to depict the astonishment of this man when he reached the copse and was led before our lean squareshouldered commander yes monsieur he was a friend of les americains did governor hamilton know that a visit was imminent pardieu with many shrugs and outward gestures of the palms governor hamilton had said if the long knives had wings or fins they might reach him nowhe was all unprepared  gentlemen said colonel clark to captains bowman and mccarty and williams we have come so far by audacity and we must continue by audacity it is of no use to wait for the gunboat and every moment we run the risk of discovery i shall write an open letter to the inhabitants of vincennes which the prisoner shall take into town i shall tell them that those who are true to the oath they swore to father gibault shall not be molested if they remain quietly in their houses let those who are on the side of the hair buyer general and his king go to the fort and fight there  he bade me fetch the portfolio he carried and with numbed fingers wrote the letter while his captains stared in admiration and amazement what a stroke was this there were six hundred men in the town and fortsoldiers inhabitants and indianswhile we had but 170 starved and weakened by their incredible march but clark was not to be daunted whipping out his fieldglasses he took a stand on a little mound under the trees and followed the fastgalloping messenger across the plain saw him enter the town saw the stir in the streets knots of men riding out and gazing hands on foreheads towards the place where we were but as the minutes rolled into hours there was no further alarm no gun no beat to quarters or buglecall from fort sackville what could it mean  clarks next move was an enigma for he set the men to cutting and trimming tall sapling poles to these were tied how reverently the twenty stands of colors which loving creole hands had stitched the boisterous day was reddening to its close as the colonel lined his little army in front of the wood and we covered the space of four thousand for the men were twenty feet apart and every tenth carried a standard suddenly we were aghast as the full meaning of the inspiration dawned upon us the command was given and we started on our march toward vincennes but not straightzigzagging always keeping the ridges between us and the town and to the watching inhabitants it seemed as if thousands were coming to crush them night fell the colors were furled and the saplings dropped and we pressed into serried ranks and marched straight over hill and dale for the lights that were beginning to twinkle ahead of us  we halted once more a quarter of a mile away clark himself had picked fourteen men to go under lieutenant bayley through the town and take the fort from the other side here was audacity with a vengeance you may be sure that tom and cowan and ray were among these and i trotted after them with the drum banging against my thighs  was ever stronghold taken thus  they went right into the town the fourteen of them into the main street that led directly to the fort the simple citizens gave back stupefied at sight of the tall striding forms muffled indians stood like statues as we passed but these raised not a hand against us where were hamilton hamiltons soldiers and savages it was as if we had come atrading  the street rose and fell in waves like the prairie over which it ran as we climbed a ridge here was a little log church the rude cross on the belfry showing dark against the sky and there in front of us flanked by blockhouses with conical caps was the frowning mass of fort sackville  take cover said williams hoarsely it seemed incredible  the men spread hither and thither some at the corners of the church some behind the fences of the little gardens tom chose a great forest tree that had been left standing and i went with him he powdered his pan and i laid down my drum beside the tree and then with an impulse that was rare tom seized me by the collar and drew me to him  davy he whispered and i pinched him davy i reckon polly annd be kinder surprised if she knew where we was eh  i nodded it seemed strange indeed to be talking thus at such a place life has taught me since that it was not so strange for however a man may strive and suffer for an object he usually sits quiet at the consummation here we were in the dooryard of a peaceful cabin the ground frozen in lumps under our feet and it seemed to me that the wind had something to do with the lightness of the night  davy whispered tom again howd ye like to see the little feller to home  i pinched him again and harder this time for i was at a loss for adequate words the muscles of his legs were as hard as the strands of a rope and his buckskin breeches frozen so that they cracked under my fingers  suddenly a flickering light arose ahead of us and another and we saw that they were candles beginning to twinkle through the palings of the fort these were badly set the width of a mans hand apart presently here comes a soldier with a torch and as he walked we could see from crack to crack his bluff face all reddened by the light and so near were we that we heard the words of his song         o there came a lass to sudbury fair          with a hey and a ho nonnynonny         and she had a rose in her raven hair          with a hey and a ho nonnynonny  by the etarnal said tom following the man along the palings with the muzzle of his deckard by the etarnal tis like shootin beef  a gust of laughter came from somewhere beyond the burly soldier paused at the foot of the blockhouse  hi jem have ye seen the generals man his honors in a igh temper i warrant ye  it was fortunate for jem that he put his foot inside the blockhouse door  now boys  it was williamss voice and fourteen rifles sputtered out a ragged volley  there was an instants silence and then a score of voices raised in consternationshouting cursing commanding heavy feet pounded on the platform of the blockhouse while tom was savagely jamming in powder and ball the wicket gate of the fort opened a man came out and ran to a house a biscuits throw away and ran back again before he was shot at slamming the gate after him tom swore  weve got but the ten rounds he said dropping his rifle to his knee i reckon tis no use to waste it  the willing may come tonight i answered  there was a bugle winding a strange call and the roll of a drum and the running continued  dont fire till youre sure boys said captain williams  our eyes caught sight of a form in the blockhouse port there was an instant when a candle flung its rays upon a cannons flank and toms rifle spat a rod of flame a red blot hid the cannons mouth and behind it a man staggered and fell on the candle while the shot crunched its way through the logs of the cottage in the yard where we stood and now the battle was on in earnest fire darting here and there from the black wall bullets whistling and flying wide and at intervals cannon belching their shot grinding through trees and houses but our men waited until the gunners lit their matches in the cannonportsit was no trick for a backwoodsman  at length there came a popping right and left and we knew that bowman and mccartys men had swung into position there  an hour passed and a shadow came along our line darting from cover to cover it was lieutenant bayley and he sent me back to find the colonel and to tell him that the men had but a few rounds left i sped through the streets on the errand spied a creole company waiting in reserve and near them behind a warehouse a knot of backwoodsmen french and indians lighted up by a smoking torch and here was colonel clark talking to a big blanketed chief i was hovering around the skirts of the crowd and seeking for an opening when a hand pulled me off my feet  whatll ye be afther now said a voice which was terences  let me go i cried i have a message from lieutenant bayley  sure said terence a mand think ye had the hair buyers sculp in yere pocket the colonel is treatymakin with tobaceys son the grreatest injun in these parrts  i dont care  hist said terence  let me go i yelled so loudly that the colonel turned and terence dropped me like a live coal i wormed my way to where clark stood tobaccos son was at that moment protesting that the big knives were his brothers and declaring that before morning broke he would have one hundred warriors for the great white chief had he not made a treaty of peace with captain helm who was even then a prisoner of the british general in the fort  colonel clark replied that he knew well of the fidelity of tobaccos son to the big knives that tobaccos son had remained stanch in the face of bribes and presents this was true now all that colonel clark desired of tobaccos son besides his friendship was that he would keep his warriors from battle the big knives would fight their own fight to this sentiment tobaccos son grunted extreme approval colonel clark turned to me  what is it davy he asked  i told him  tobaccos son has dug up for us king georges ammunition he said go tell lieutenant bayley that i will send him enough to last him a month  i sped away with the message presently i came back again upon another message and they were eatingthose reservesthey were eating as i had never seen men eat but once at kaskaskia the baker stood by with lifted palms imploring the saints that he might have some compensation until clark sent him back to his shop to knead and bake again the good creoles approached the fires with the contents of their larders in their hands terence tossed me a loaf the size of a cannon ball and another  fetch that wan to wan av the bys said he  i seized as much as my arms could hold and scurried away to the firing line once more and heedless of whistling bullets darted from man to man until the bread was exhausted not a one but gave me a god bless you davy ere he seized it with a great hand and began to eat in wolfish bites his deckard always on the watch the while  there was no sleep in the village all night long while the rifles sputtered the villagers in their capotesmen women and childrenhuddled around the fires the young men of the militia begged clark to allow them to fight and to keep them well affected he sent some here and there amongst our lines for our colonels strength was not counted by rifles or men alone he fought with his brain as hamilton the hair buyer made his rounds he believed the town to be in possession of a horde of kentuckians shouts warwhoops and bursts of laughter went up from behind the town surely a great force was there a small part of which had been sent to play with him and his men on the fighting line when there was a lull our backwoodsmen stood up behind their trees and cursed the enemy roundly and often by these taunts persuaded the furious gunners to open their ports and fire their cannon woe be to him that showed an arm or a shoulder though a casement be lifted ever so warily a dozen balls would fly into it and at length when some of the besieged had died in their anger the ports were opened no more it was then our sharpshooters crept up boldly to within thirty yards of themnay it seemed as if they lay under the very walls of the fort and through the night the figure of the colonel himself was often seen amongst them praising their markmanship pleading with every man not to expose himself without cause he spied me where i had wormed myself behind the footboard of a picket fence beneath the cannonport of a blockhouse it was during one of the breathing spaces  whats this said he to cowan sharply feeling me with his foot  i reckon its davy sir said my friend somewhat sheepishly we cant do nothin with him hes been up and down the line twenty times this night  what doing says the colonel  bread and powder and bullets answered bill  but thats all over says clark  hes the very devil to pry answered bill the first we know hell be into the fort under the logs  or between them says clark with a glance at the open palings come here davy  i followed him dodging between the houses and when we had got off the line he took me by the two shoulders from behind  you little rascal said he shaking me how am i to look out for an army and you besides have you had anything to eat  yes sir i answered  we came to the fires and captain bowman hurried up to meet him  were piling up earthworks and barricades said the captain for the fight tomorrow my god if the willing would only come we could put our cannon into them  clark laughed  bowman said he kindly has davy fed you yet  no says the captain surprised ive had no time to eat  he seems to have fed the whole army said the colonel he paused have they scented lamothe or maisonville  devil a scent cried the captain and weve scoured wood and quagmire they tell me that lamothe has a very pretty force of redskins at his heels  let mcchesney go said clark sharply mcchesney and ray ill warrant they can find em  now i knew that maisonville had gone out achasing captain willings brotherhe who had run into our arms lamothe was a noted indian partisan and a dangerous man to be dogging our rear that night suddenly there came a thought that took my breath and set my heart ahammering when the colonels back was turned i slipped away beyond the range of the firelight and i was soon on the prairie stumbling over hummocks and floundering into ponds yet going as quietly as i could turning now and again to look back at the distant glow or to listen to the rifles popping around the fort the night was cloudy and pitchy dark twice the whirring of startled waterfowl frightened me out of my senses but ambition pricked me on in spite of fear i may have gone a mile thus perchance two or three straining every sense when a sound brought me to a stand at first i could not distinguish it because of my heavy breathing but presently i made sure that it was the low drone of human voices getting down on my hands and knees i crept forward and felt the ground rising the voices had ceased i gained the crest of a low ridge and threw myself flat a rattle of musketry set me shivering and in an agony of fright i looked behind me to discover that i could not be more than four hundred yards from the fort i had made a circle i lay very still my eyes watered with staring and thenthe droning began again i went forward an inch then another and another down the slope and at last i could have sworn that i saw dark blurs against the ground i put out my hand my weight went after and i had crashed through a coating of ice up to my elbow in a pool there came a second of sheer terror a hoarse challenge in french and then i took to my heels and flew towards the fort at the top of my speed  i heard them coming after me leap and bound and crying out to one another ahead of me there might have been a floor or a precipice as the ground looks level at night i hurt my foot cruelly on a frozen clod of earth slid down the washed bank of a run into the wabash picked myself up scrambled to the top of the far side and had gotten away again when my pursuer shattered the ice behind me a hundred yards more two figures loomed up in front and i was pulled up choking  hang to him fletcher said a voice  great god cried fletcher its davy what are ye up to now  let me go i cried as soon as i had got my wind as luck would have it i had run into a pair of daredevil young kentuckians who had more than once tasted the severity of clarks disciplinefletcher blount and jim willis they fairly shook out of me what had happened and then dropped me with a warwhoop and started for the prairie i after them crying out to them to beware of the run a man must indeed be fleet of foot to have escaped these young ruffians and so it proved when i reached the hollow there were the two of them fighting with a man in the water the ice jangling as they shifted their feet  whats yere name said fletcher cuffing and kicking his prisoner until he cried out for mercy  maisonville said the man whereupon fletcher gave a warwhoop and kicked him again  thats no way to use a prisoner said i hotly  hold your mouth davy said fletcher you didnt ketch him  you wouldnt have had him but for me i retorted  fletchers answer was an oath they put maisonville between them ran him through the town up to the firing line and there to my horror they tied him to a post and used him for a shield despite his heartrending yells in mortal fear that the poor man would be shot down i was running away to find some one who might have influence over them when i met a lieutenant he came up and ordered them angrily to unbind maisonville and bring him before the colonel fletcher laughed whipped out his hunting knife and cut the thongs but he and willis had scarce got twenty paces from the officer before they seized poor maisonville by the hair and made shift to scalp him this was merely backwoods play had maisonville but known it persuaded however that his last hour was come he made a desperate effort to clear himself whereupon fletcher cut off a piece of his skin by mistake maisonville making sure that he had been scalped stood groaning and clapping his hand to his head while the two young rascals drew back and stared at each other  whats to do now said willis  take our medicine i reckon answered fletcher grimly and they seized the tottering man between them and marched him straightway to the fire where clark stood  they had seen the colonel angry before but now they were fairly withered under his wrath and he could have given them no greater punishment for he took them from the firing line and sent them back to wait among the reserves until the morning  nom de dieu said maisonville wrathfully as he watched them go they should hang  the stuff that brought them here through ice and flood is apt to boil over captain remarked the colonel dryly  if you please sir said i they did not mean to cut him but he wriggled  clark turned sharply  eh said he did you have a hand in this too  peste cried the captain the little ferretyou call himhe find me on the prairie i run to catch him with some men and fall into the crick he pointed to his soaked leggings and your demons they fall on top of me  i wish to heaven you had caught lamothe instead davy said the colonel and joined despite himself in the laugh that went up falling sober again he began to question the prisoner where was lamothe pardieu maisonville could not say how many men did he have etc etc the circle about us deepened with eager listeners who uttered exclamations when maisonville between his answers put up his hand to his bleeding head suddenly the circle parted and captain bowman came through  ray has discovered lamothe sir said he what shall we do  let him into the fort said clark instantly  there was a murmur of astonished protest  let him into the fort exclaimed bowman  certainly said the colonel if he finds he cannot get in he will be off before the dawn to assemble the tribes  but the fort is provisioned for a month bowman expostulated and they must find out tomorrow how weak we are  tomorrow will be too late said clark  and suppose he shouldnt go in  he will go in said the colonel quietly withdraw your men captain from the north side  captain bowman departed whatever he may have thought of these orders he was too faithful a friend of the colonels to delay their execution murmuring swearing oaths of astonishment man after man on the firing line dropped his rifle at the word and sullenly retreated the crack crack of the deckards on the south and east were stilled not a barrel was thrust by the weary garrison through the logs and the place became silent as the wilderness it was the long hour before the dawn and as we lay waiting on the hard ground stiff and cold and hungry talking in whispers somewhere near six of the clock on that february morning the great square of fort sackville began to take shape there was the long line of the stockade the projecting blockhouses at each corner with peaked caps and a higher capped square tower from the centre of the enclosure the banner of england drooping there and clinging forlorn to its staff as though with a presentiment then as the light grew the closelipped casements were seen scarred with our bullets the little log houses of the town came out the sapling palings and the bare treesall grim and gaunt at that cruel season cattle lowed here and there and horses whinnied to be fed  it was a dirty gray dawn and we waited until it had done its best from where we lay hid behind log house and palings we strained our eyes towards the prairie to see if lamothe would take the bait until our view was ended at the fuzzy top of a hillock bill cowan doubled up behind a woodpile and breathing heavily nudged me  davy davy what dye see  was it a head that broke the line of the crest even as i stared breathless half a score of forms shot up and were running madly for the stockade twenty more broke after them indians and frenchmen dodging swaying crowding looking fearfully to right and left and from within the fort came forth a hubbubcries and scuffling orders oaths and shouts in plain view of our impatient deckards soldiers manned the platform and we saw that they were flinging down ladders an officer in a faded scarlet coat stood out among the rest shouting himself hoarse involuntarily cowan lined his sights across the woodpile on this mark of color  lamothes men a seething mass were fighting like wolves for the ladders fearful yet that a volley might kill half of them where they stood and so fast did they scramble upwards that the men before them stepped on their fingers all at once and by acclamation the fierce warwhoops of our men rent the air and some toppled in sheer terror and fell the twelve feet of the stockade at the sound of it then every man in the regiment creole and backwoodsman lay back to laugh the answer of the garrison was a defiant cheer and those who had dropped finding they were not shot at picked themselves up again and gained the top helping to pull the ladders after them bowmans men swung back into place the rattle and drag were heard in the blockhouse as the cannon were run out through the ports and the battle which had held through the night watches began again with redoubled vigor but there was more caution on the side of the british for they had learned dearly how the kentuckians could measure crack and crevice  there followed two hours and a futile waste of ammunition the lead from the garrison flying harmless here and there and not a patch of skin or cloth showing    chapter xx the campaign ends  if i am obliged to storm you may depend upon such treatment as is justly due to a murderer and beware of destroying stores of any kind or any papers or letters that are in your possession or of hurting one house in the town for by heaven if you do there shall be no mercy shown you  to lieutenantgovernor hamilton  so read colonel clark as he stood before the log fire in monsieur boutons house at the back of the town the captains grouped in front of him  is that strong enough gentlemen he asked  to raise his hair said captain charleville  captain bowman laughed loudly  i reckon the boys will see to that said he  colonel clark folded the letter addressed it and turned gravely to monsieur bouton  you will oblige me sir said he by taking this to governor hamilton you will be provided with a flag of truce  monsieur bouton was a round little man as his name suggested and the men cheered him as he strode soberly up the street a piece of sheeting tied to a sapling and flung over his shoulder through such humble agencies are the ends of providence accomplished monsieur bouton walked up to the gate disappeared sidewise through the postern and we sat down to breakfast in a very short time monsieur bouton was seen coming back and his face was not so impassive that the governors message could not be read thereon  tis not a loveletter he has ill warrant said terence as the little man disappeared into the house so accurately had monsieur boutons face betrayed the news that the men went back to their posts without orders some with half a breakfast in hand and soon the rank and file had the message  lieutenantgovernor hamilton begs leave to acquaint colonel clark that he and his garrison are not disposed to be awed into any action unworthy of british subjects  our men had eaten their enemy was within their grasp and clark and all his officers could scarce keep them from storming such was the deadliness of their aim that scarce a shot came back and time and again i saw men fling themselves in front of the breastworks with a warwhoop wave their rifles in the air and cry out that they would have the har buyers sculp before night should fall it could not last not tuned to the nicer courtesies of warfare the memory of hamiltons war parties of blackened homes of families dead and missing raged unappeased these were not content to leave vengeance in the lords hands and when a white flag peeped timorously above the gate a great yell of derision went up from riverbank to riverbank out of the postern stepped the officer with the faded scarlet coat and in due time went back again haughtily his head high casting contempt right and left of him again the postern opened and this time there was a cheer at sight of a man in hunting shirt and leggings and coonskin cap after him came a certain major hay indianenticer of detested memory the lieutenant of him who followedthe hair buyer himself a murmur of hatred arose from the men stationed there and many would have shot him where he stood but for clark  the devil has the grit said cowan though his eyes blazed  it was the involuntary tribute lieutenantgovernor hamilton stared indifferently at the glowering backwoodsmen as he walked the few steps to the church not so major hay his eyes fell there was colonel clark waiting at the door through which the good creoles had been wont to go to worship bowing somewhat ironically to the british general it was a strange meeting they had in st xaviers by the light of the candles on the altar hot words passed in that house of peace the general demanding protection for all his men and our colonel replying that he would do with the indian partisans as he chose  and whom mean you by indian partisans the undaunted governor had demanded  i take major hay to be one of them our colonel had answered  it was soon a matter of common report how clark had gazed fixedly at the major when he said this and how the major turned pale and trembled with our own eyes we saw them coming out major hay as near to staggering as a man could be the governor blushing red for shame of him so they went sorrowfully back to the gate  colonel clark stood at the steps of the church looking after them  what was that firing he demanded sharply i gave orders for a truce  we who stood by the church had indeed heard firing in the direction of the hills east of the town and had wondered thereat perceiving a crowd gathered at the far end of the street we all ran thither save the colonel who directed to have the offenders brought to him at monsieur boutons we met the news halfway a party of canadians and indians had just returned from the falls of the ohio with scalps they had taken captain williams had gone out with his company to meet them had lured them on and finally had killed a number and was returning with the prisoners yes here they were williams himself walked ahead with two dishevelled and frightened coureurs du bois twoscore at least of the townspeople of vincennes friends and relatives of the prisoners pressing about and crying out to williams to have mercy on them as for williams he took them in to the colonel the townspeople pressing into the dooryard and banking in front of it on the street behind all a tragedy impended nor can i think of it now without sickening  the frightened creoles in the street gave back against the fence and from behind them issuing as a stormcloud came the half of williams company yelling like madmen pushed and jostled ahead of them were four indians decked and feathered the halfdried scalps dangling from their belts impassive true to their creed despite the indignity of jolts and jars and blows on and on pressed the mob gathering recruits at every corner and when they reached st xaviers before the fort half the regiment was there others watched too from the stockade and what they saw made their knees smite together with fear here were four bronzed statues in a row across the street the space in front of them clear that their partisans in the fort might look and consider what was passing in the savage mind no man might know not a lip trembled nor an eye faltered when a backwoodsman his memory aflame at sight of the pitiful white scalps on their belts thrust through the crowd to curse them fletcher blount frenzied snatched his tomahawk from his side  sink varmint he cried with a great oath by the etarnal well pay the har buyer in his own coin sound your drums he shouted at the fort call the garrison fer the show  he had raised his arm and turned to strike when the savage put up his hand not in entreaty but as one man demanding a right from another the cries the curses the murmurs even were hushed throwing back his head arching his chest the notes of a song rose in the heavy air wild strange notes they were that struck vibrant chords in my own quivering being and the song was the deathsong ay and the lifesong of a soul which had come into the world even as mine own and somewhere there lay in the song half revealed the awful mystery of that creator whom the soul leaped forth to meet the myriad green of the sun playing with the leaves the fish swimming lazily in the brown pool the doe grazing in the thicket and a naked boy as free from care as these and still the life grows brighter as strength comes and stature and power over man and beast and then god knows what memories of fierce love and fiercer wars and triumphs of desires gained and enemies conqueredgod who has made all lives akin to something which he holds in the hollow of his hand and thenthe rain beating on the forest crown beating beating beating  the song ceased the indian knelt in the black mud not at the feet of fletcher blount but on the threshold of the great spirit who ruleth all things the axe fell yet he uttered no cry as he went before his master  so the four sang each in turn and died in the sight of some who pitied and some who feared and some who hated for the sake of land and women so the four went beyond the power of gold and gewgaw and were dragged in the mire around the walls and flung into the yellow waters of the river  through the dreary afternoon the men lounged about and cursed the parley and hearkened for the tattoothe signal agreed upon by the leaders to begin the fighting there had been no command against taunts and jeers and they gathered in groups under the walls to indulge themselves and even tried to bribe me as i sat braced against a house with my drum between my knees and the sticks clutched tightly in my hands  heres a spanish dollar for a couple o taps davy shouted jack terrell  come on ye pack of rebel cutthroats yelled a man on the wall  he was answered by a torrent of imprecations and so they flung it back and forth until nightfall when out comes the same fadedscarlet officer holding a letter in his hand and marches down the street to monsieur boutons there would be no storming now nor any man suffered to lay fingers on the hair buyer                           i remember in particular hamilton the hair buyer not the fiend my imagination had depicted i have since learned that most villains do not look the part but a man with a great sorrow stamped upon his face the sun rose on that 25th of february and the mud melted and one of our companies drew up on each side of the gate downward slid the lion of england the garrison drums beat a dirge and the hair buyer marched out at the head of his motley troops  then came my own greatest hour all morning i had been polishing and tightening the drum and my pride was so great as we fell into line that so much as a smile could not be got out of me picture it all vincennes in black and white by reason of the bright day eaves and gables stockade line and capped towers sharply drawn and straight above these a stark flagstaff waiting for our colors pigs and fowls straying hither and thither unmindful that this day is red on the calendar ah here is a bit of color toothe villagers on the side streets to see the spectacle gay wools and gayer handkerchiefs there amid the joyous cheering crowd of thricechanged nationality  vive les bostonnais vive les americains vive monsieur le colonel clark vive le petit tambour  vive le petit tambour that was the drummer boy stepping proudly behind the colonel himself with a soul lifted high above mire and puddle into the blue above there was laughter amongst the giants behind me and cowan saying softly as when we left kaskaskia go it davy my little gamecock and the whisper of it was repeated among the ranks drawn up by the gate  yes here was the gate and now we were in the fort and an empire was gained never to be lost again the stars and stripes climbed the staff and the folds were caught by an eager breeze thirteen cannon thundered from the blockhousesone for each colony that had braved a king  there in the miry square within the vincennes fort thin and bronzed and travelstained were the men who had dared the wilderness in ugliest mood and yet none by himself would have done iteach had come here compelled by a spirit stronger than his own by a master mind that laughed at the body and its ailments  colonel george rogers clark stood in the centre of the square under the flag to whose renown he had added three stars straight he was and square and selfcontained no weakening tremor of exultation softened his face as he looked upon the men by whose endurance he had been able to do this thing he waited until the white smoke of the last gun had drifted away on the breeze until the snapping of the flag and the distant village sounds alone broke the stillness  we have not suffered all things for a reward he said but because a righteous cause may grow and though our names may be forgotten our deeds will be remembered we have conquered a vast land that our children and our childrens children may be freed from tyranny and we have brought a just vengeance upon our enemies i thank you one and all in the name of the continental congress and of that commonwealth of virginia for which you have fought you are no longer virginians kentuckians kaskaskians and cahokiansyou are americans  he paused and we were silent though his words moved us strongly they were beyond us  i mention no deeds of heroism of unselfishness of lives saved at the peril of others but i am the debtor of every man here for the years to come to see that he and his family have justice from the commonwealth and the nation  again he stopped and it seemed to us watching that he smiled a little  i shall name one he said one who never lagged who never complained who starved that the weak might be fed and walk david ritchie come here  i trembled my teeth chattered as the water had never made them chatter i believe i should have fallen but for tom who reached out from the ranks i stumbled forward in a daze to where the colonel stood and the cheering from the ranks was a thing beyond me the colonels hand on my head brought me to my senses  david ritchie he said i give you publicly the thanks of the regiment the parade is dismissed  the next thing i knew i was on cowans shoulders and he was tearing round and round the fort with two companies at his heels  the divil said terence mccann he dhrummed us over the wather an through the wather and faix he would have dhrummed the sculp from hamiltons head and the colonel had said the worrd  by gar cried antoine le gris now he drum us on to detroit  out of the gate rushed cowan the frightened villagers scattering right and left antoine had a friend who lived in this street and in ten minutes there was rum in the powderhorns and the toast was on to detroit  colonel clark was sitting alone in the commanding officers room of the garrison and the afternoon sun slanting through the square of the window fell upon the maps and papers before him he had sent for me i halted in sheer embarrassment on the threshold looked up at his face and came on troubled  davy he said do you want to go back to kentucky  i should like to stay to the end colonel i answered  the end he said this is the end  and detroit sir i returned  detroit he cried bitterly a man of sense measures his force and does not try the impossible i could as soon march against philadelphia this is the end i say and the general must give way to the politician and may god have mercy on the politician who will try to keep a peoples affection without money or help from congress  he fell back wearily in his chair while i stood astonished wondering i had thought to find him elated with victory  congress or virginia said he will have to pay monsieur vigo and father gibault and monsieur gratiot and the other good people who have trusted me do you think they will do so  the congress are far from here i said  ay he answered too far to care about you and me and what we have suffered  he ended abruptly and sat for a while staring out of the window at the figures crossing and recrossing the muddy paradeground  tom mcchesney goes tonight to kentucky with letters to the county lieutenant you are to go with him and then i shall have no one to remind me when i am hungry and bring me hominy i shall have no financier no strategist for a tight place he smiled a little sadly at my sorrowful look and then drew me to him and patted my shoulder it is no place for a young ladan idle garrison i think he continued presently i think you have a future david if you do not lose your head kentucky will grow and conquer and in twenty years be a thriving community and presently you will go to virginia and study law and come back again do you hear  yes colonel  and i would tell you one thing said he with force serve the people as all true men should in a republic but do not rely upon their gratitude you will remember that  yes colonel  a long time he paused looking on me with a significance i did not then understand and when he spoke again his voice showed no trace of emotion save in the note of it  you have been a faithful friend davy when i needed loyalty perhaps the time may come again promise me that you will not forget me if i amunfortunate  unfortunate sir i exclaimed  goodby davy he said and god bless you i have work to do  still i hesitated he stared at me but with kindness  what is it davy he asked  please sir i said if i might take my drum  at that he laughed  you may said he you may perchance we may need it again  i went out from his presence vaguely troubled to find tom and before the early sun had set we were gliding down the wabash in a canoe past places forever dedicated to our agonies towards kentucky and polly ann  davy said tom i reckon shell be standin under the simmon tree waitin fer us with the little shaver in her arms  and so she was       book ii flotsam and jetsam   chapter i in the cabin  the eden of one man may be the inferno of his neighbor and now i am to throw to the winds like leaves of a worthless manuscript some years of time and introduce you to a new kentuckya kentucky that was not for the pioneer one page of this manuscript might have told of a fearful winter when the snow lay in great drifts in the bare woods when tom and i fashioned canoes or noggins out of the great roots when a new and feminine bit of humanity cried in the bark cradle and polly ann sewed deer leather another pagenay a dozencould be filled with indian horrors ambuscades and massacres and also i might have told how there drifted into this land hitherto unsoiled the refuse cast off by the older colonies i must add quickly that we got more than our share of their best stock along with this  no sooner had the sun begun to pit the snow hillocks than wild creatures came in from the mountains haggard with hunger and hardship they had left their homes in virginia and the carolinas in the autumn an unheralded winter of arctic fierceness had caught them in its grip bitter tales they told of wives and children buried among the rocks fast on the heels of these wretched ones trooped the spring settlers in droves and i have seen whole churches march singing into the forts the preacher leading and thanking god loudly that he had delivered them from the wilderness and the savage the little forts would not hold them and they went out to hew clearings from the forest and to build cabins and stockades and our own people starved and snowbound went out likewisetom and polly ann and their little family and myself to the farm at the riverside and while the water flowed between the stumps over the black land we planted and ploughed and prayed always alert watching north and south against the coming of the indians  but tom was no husbandman he and his kind were the scouts the advance guard of civilization not tillers of the soil or lovers of close communities farther and farther they went afield for game and always they grumbled sorely against this horde which had driven the deer from his cover and the buffalo from his wallow  looking back i can recall one evening when the long summer twilight lingered to a close tom was lounging lazily against the big persimmon tree smoking his pipe the two children digging at the roots and polly ann seated on the doorlog sewing as i drew near she looked up at me from her work she was a woman upon whose eternal freshness industry made no mar  davy she exclaimed how yeve growed i thought yed be a wizened little body but this year yeve shot up like a cornstalk  my father was six feet two inches in his moccasins i said  hell be wallopin me soon said tom with a grin he took a long whiff at his pipe and added thoughtfully i reckon this aint no place fer me now with all the settler folks and landgrabbers comin through the gap  tom said i theres a bit of a fall on the river here  ay he said and nary a fish left  something better i answered well put a dam there and a mill and a hominy pounder  and make our fortune grinding corn for the settlers cried polly ann showing a line of very white teeth i always said yed be a rich man davy  tom was mildly interested and went with us at daylight to measure the fall and he allowed that he would have the more time to hunt if the mill were a success for a month i had had the scheme in my mind where the dam was to be put the race and the wondrous wheel rimmed with cow horns to dip the water and fixed on the wheel there was to be a crank that worked the pounder in the mortar so we were to grind until i could arrange with mr scarlett the new storekeeper in harrodstown to have two grindingstones fetched across the mountains  while the corn ripened and the melons swelled and the flax flowered our axes rang by the rivers side and sometimes as we worked cowan and terrell and mccann and other long hunters would come and jeer goodnaturedly because we were turning civilized often they gave us a lift  it was september when the millstones arrived and i spent a joyous morning of final bargaining with mr myron scarlett this mr scarlett was from connecticut had been a quartermaster in the army and at much risk brought ploughs and hardware and scissors and buttons and broadcloth and corduroy across the alleghanies and down the ohio in flatboats these he sold at great profit we had no money not even the worthless scrip that congress issued but a beaver skin was worth eighteen shillings a bearskin ten and a fox or a deer or a wildcat less half the village watched the barter the rest lounged sullenly about the land court  the land courtcurse of kentucky it was just a windowless log house built outside the walls our temple of avarice the case was this henderson for whose company daniel boone cut the wilderness road believed that he had bought the country and issued grants therefor tom held one of these grants alas and many others whom i knew virginia repudiated henderson keenfaced speculators bought acre upon acre and tract upon tract from the state and crossed the mountains to extort claims conflicted titles lapped there was the court set in the sunlight in the midst of a fair land held by the shameless thronged day after day by the homeless and the needy jostling quarrelling beseeching even as i looked upon this strife a man stood beside me  drat em said the stranger as he watched a hawkeyed extortioner in drab for these did not condescend to hunting shirts drat em ef i had my way id wring the neck of every mothers son of em  i turned with a start and there was mr daniel boone  howdy davy he said yeve growed some sence yeve ben with clark he paused and then continued in the same strain tis the same at boonesboro and up thar at the falls settlement the critters is everywhar robbin men of their claims davy said mr boone earnestly you know that i come into kaintuckee when it warent nothin but wilderness and resked my life time and again them varmints is wussn redskinstheyve robbed me already of half my claims  robbed you i exclaimed indignant that he of all men should suffer  ay he said robbed me theyve took one claim after another tracts that i staked out long afore they heerd of kaintuckee he rubbed his rifle barrel with his buckskin sleeve i get a little for my skins and a little by surveyin but when the game goes i reckon ill go after it  where mr boone i asked  whar whar the varmints cyant foller acrost the mississippi into the spanish wilderness  and leave kentucky i cried  davy he answered sadly you kin cope with em they tell me youre buildin a mill up at mcchesneys and i reckon youre as cute as any of em they beat me im good for nothin but shootin and explorin  we stood silent for a while our attention caught by a quarrel which had suddenly come out of the doorway one of the men was jim willismy friend of clarks campaignwho had a henderson claim near shawanee springs the other was the hawkeyed man of whom mr boone had spoken and fragments of their curses reached us where we stood the hunting shirts surged around them alert now at the prospect of a fight men came running in from all directions and shouts of hang him tomahawk him were heard on every side mr boone did not move it was a common enough spectacle for him and he was not excitable moreover he knew that the death of one extortioner more or less would have no effect on the system they had become as the fowls of the air  i was acrost the mountain last month said mr boone presently and one of them skunks had stole campbells silver spoons at abingdon campbell was out arter him for a week with a coil of rope on his saddle but the varmint got to cover  mr boone wished me luck in my new enterprise bade me goodby and set out for redstone where he was to measure a tract for a revolutioner the speculator having been rescued from jim williss clutches by the sheriff the crowd goodnaturedly helped us load our stones between packhorses and some of them followed us all the way home that they might see the grinding half of mcafees new station had heard the news and came over likewise and from that day we ground as much corn as could be brought to us from miles around  polly ann and i ran the mill and kept the accounts often of a crisp autumn morning we heard a gobblegobble above the tumbling of the water and found a wild turkey perched on top of the hopper eating his fill some of our meat we got that way as for tom he was off and on when the roving spirit seized him he made journeys to the westward with cowan and ray generally they returned with packs of skins but sometimes soberly thanking heaven that their hair was left growing on their heads this and patrolling the wilderness road and other militia duties made up toms life no sooner was the mill fairly started than off he went to the cumberland i mention this not alone because i remember well the day of his return but because of a certain happening then that had a heavy influence on my after life  the episode deals with an easymannered gentleman named potts who was the agent for a certain major colfax of virginia tom owned under a henderson grant the major had been given this and other lands for his services in the war mr potts arrived one rainy afternoon and found me standing alone under the little leanto that covered the hopper how we served him with the aid of mccann and cowan and other neighbors and how we were near getting into trouble because of the prank will be seen later the next morning i rode into harrodstown not wholly easy in my mind concerning the wisdom of the thing i had done there was no one to advise me for colonel clark was far away building a fort on the banks of the mississippi tom had laughed at the consequences he cared little about his land and was for moving into the wilderness again but for polly anns sake i wished that we had treated the land agent less cavalierly i was soon distracted from these thoughts by the sight of harrodstown itself  i had no sooner ridden out of the forest shade when i saw that the place was in an uproar men and women gathering in groups and running here and there between the cabins urging on the mare i cantered across the fields and the first person i met was james ray  whats the matter i asked  matter enough an army of redskins has crossed the ohio and not a man to take command my god cried ray pointing angrily at the swarms about the land office what trash we have got this last year kentucky can go to the devil half the stations be wiped out and not a thrip do they care  have you sent word to the colonel i asked  if he was here said ray bitterly hed have half of em swinging inside of an hour ill warrant hed send em to the rightabout  i rode on into the town potts gone out of my mind apart from the landoffice crowds and looking on in silent rage stood a group of the old settlerstall lean powerful yet impotent for lack of a leader a contrast they were these buckskinclad pioneers to the illassorted humanity they watched absorbed in struggles for the very lands they had won  by the eternal said jack terrell if the yeath was ter swaller em up theyd keep on adickerin in hell  somethings got to be done captain harrod put in gloomily the red varmintsll be on us in another day in gods name whar is clark  hold cried fletcher blount whats that  the broiling about the land court too was suddenly hushed men stopped in their tracks staring fixedly at three forms which had come out of the woods into the clearing  redskins or theres no devil said terrell  redskins they were but not the blanketed kind that drifted every day through the station their warpaint gleamed in the light and the white edges of the feathered headdresses caught the sun one held up in his right hand a white belttoken of peace on the frontier  lord amighty said fletcher blount be they cricks  chickasaws by the headgear said terrell davy youve got a hoss ride out and look em over  nothing loath i put the mare into a gallop and i passed over the very place where polly ann had picked me up and saved my life long since the indians came on at a dog trot but when they were within fifty paces of me they halted abruptly the chief waved the white belt around his head  davy says he and i trembled from head to foot how well i knew that voice  colonel clark i cried and rode up to him thank god you are come sir said i for the people here are landmad and the northern indians are crossing the ohio  he took my bridle and leading the horse began to walk rapidly towards the station  ay he answered i know it a runner came to me with the tidings where i was building a fort on the mississippi and i took willis here and saunders and came  i glanced at my old friends who grinned at me through the berrystain on their faces we reached a ditch through which the rain of the night before was draining from the fields clark dropped the bridle stooped down and rubbed his face clean up he got again and flung the feathers from his head and i thought that his eyes twinkled despite the sternness of his look  davy my lad said he you and i have seen some strange things together perchance we shall see stranger today  a shout went up for he had been recognized and captain harrod and ray and terrell and cowan who had just ridden in ran up to greet him and press his hand he called them each by name these men whose loyalty had been proved but said no word more nor paused in his stride until he had reached the edge of the mob about the land court there he stood for a full minute and we who knew him looked on silently and waited  the turmoil had begun again the speculators calling out in strident tones the settlers bargaining and pushing and all clamoring to be heard while there was money to be made or land to be got they had no ear for the public weal a man shouldered his way through roughly and they gave back cursing surprised he reached the door and flinging those who blocked it right and left entered there he was recognized and his name flew from mouth to mouth  clark  he walked up to the table strewn with books and deeds  silence he thundered but there was no needthey were still for once this court is closed he cried while kentucky is in danger not a deed shall be signed nor an acre granted until i come back from the ohio out you go  out they went indeed judge brokers speculatorsthe evicted and the triumphant together and when the place was empty clark turned the key and thrust it into his hunting shirt he stood for a moment on the step and his eyes swept the crowd  now he said there have been many to claim this landwho will follow me to defend it  as i live they cheered him hands were flung up that were past counting and men who were barely rested from the hardships of the wilderness trail shouted their readiness to go but others slunk away and were found that morning grumbling and cursing the chance that had brought them to kentucky within the hour the news had spread to the farms and men rode in to harrodstown to tell the colonel of many who were leaving the plough in the furrow and the axe in the wood and starting off across the mountains in anger and fear the colonel turned to me as he sat writing down the names of the volunteers  davy said he when you are grown you shall not stay at home i promise you take your mare and ride as for your life to mcchesney and tell him to choose ten men and go to the crab orchard on the wilderness road tell him for me to turn back every man woman and child who tries to leave kentucky  i met tom coming in from the field with his rawhide harness over his shoulders polly ann stood calling him in the door and the squirrel broth was steaming on the table he did not wait for it kissing her he flung himself into the saddle i had left and we watched him mutely as he waved back to us from the edge of the woods                   in the night i found myself sitting up in bed listening to a running and stamping near the cabin  polly ann was stirring davy she whispered the stock is oneasy  we peered out of the loophole together and through the little orchard we had planted the moon flooded the fields and beyond it the forest was a dark blur i can recall the scene now the rude mill standing by the waterside the twisted rail fences and the black silhouettes of the horses and cattle as they stood bunched together behind us little tom stirred in his sleep and startled us that very evening polly ann had frightened him into obedience by telling him that the shawanees would get him  what was there to do mcafees station was four miles away and rays clearing two ray was gone with tom i could not leave polly ann alone there was nothing for it but to wait  silently that the children might not be waked and lurking savage might not hear we put the powder and bullets in the middle of the room and loaded the guns and pistols for polly ann had learned to shoot she took the loopholes of two sides of the cabin i of the other two and then began the fearful watching and waiting which the frontier knows so well suddenly the cattle stirred again and stampeded to the other corner of the field there came a whisper from polly ann  what is it i answered running over to her  look out she said what dye see near the mill  her sharp eyes had not deceived her for mine perceived plainly a dark form skulking in the hickory grove next a movement behind the rail fence and darting back to my side of the house i made out a long black body wriggling at the edge of the withered cornpatch they were surrounding us how i wished that tom were home  a stealthy sound began to intrude itself upon our ears listening intently i thought it came from the side of the cabin where the leanto was where we stored our wood in winter the black shadow fell on that side and into a patch of bushes peering out of the loophole i could perceive nothing there the noise went on at intervals all at once there grew on me with horror the discovery that there was digging under the cabin  how long the sound continued i know notit might have been an hour it might have been less now i thought i heard it under the wall now beneath the puncheons of the floor the pitchy blackness within was such that we could not see the boards moving and therefore we must needs kneel down and feel them from time to time yes this one was lifting from its bed on the hard earth beneath i was sure of it it rose an inchthen an inch more gripping the handle of my tomahawk i prayed for guidance in my stroke for the blade might go wild in the darkness upward crept the board and suddenly it was gone from the floor i swung a full circleand to my horror i felt the axe plunging into soft flesh and crunching on a bone i had missed the head a yell shattered the night as the puncheon fell with a rattle on the boards and my tomahawk was gone from my hand without the fierce warcry of the shawanees that i knew so well echoed around the log walls and the door trembled with a blow the children awoke crying  there was no time to think my great fear was that the devil in the cabin would kill polly ann just then i heard her calling out to me  hide i cried hide under the shakedown has he got you  i heard her answer and then the sound of a scuffle that maddened me knife in hand i crept slowly about and put my fingers on a mans neck and side next polly ann careened against me and i lost him again davy davy i heard her gasp look out fer the floor  it was too late the puncheon rose under me i stumbled and it fell again once more the awful changing notes of the warwhoop sounded without a body bumped on the boards a white light rose before my eyes and a sharp pain leaped in my side then all was black again but i had my senses still and my fingers closed around the knotted muscles of an arm i thrust the pistol in my hand against flesh and fired two of us fell together but the thought of polly ann got me staggering to my feet again calling her name by the grace of god i heard her answer  are ye hurt davy  no said i no and you  we drifted together twas she who had the presence of mind  the chestquick the chest  we stumbled over a body in reaching it we seized the handles and with all our strength hauled it athwart the loose puncheon that seemed to be lifting even then a mighty splintering shook the door  to the ports cried polly ann as our heads knocked together  to find the rifles and prime them seemed to take an age next i was staring through the loophole along a barrel and beyond it were three black forms in line on a long beam i think we firedpolly ann and iat the same time one fell we saw a comedy of the beam dropping heavily on the foot of another and he limping off with a guttural howl of rage and pain i fired a pistol at him but missed him and then i was ramming a powder charge down the long barrel of the rifle suddenly there was silenceeven the children had ceased crying outside in the dooryard a feathered figure writhed like a snake towards the fence the moon still etched the picture in black and white  shots awoke me i think distant shots and they sounded like the ripping and tearing of cloth for a wound twas no new sound to me  davy dear said a voice tenderly  out of the mist the tearstained face of polly ann bent over me i put up my hand and dropped it again with a cry then my senses coming with a rush the familiar objects of the cabin outlined themselves toms winter hunting shirt polly anns woollen shift and sunbonnet on their pegs the big stone chimney the ladder to the loft the closed door with a long jagged line across it where the wood was splintered and dearest of all the chubby forms of peggy and little tom playing on the trundlebed then my glance wandered to the floor and on the puncheons were three stains i closed my eyes  again came a faroff rattle like stones falling from a great height down a rocky bluff  whats that i whispered  theyre fighting at mcafees station said polly ann she put her cool hand on my head and little tom climbed up on the bed and looked up into my face wistfully calling my name  oh davy said his mother i thought ye were never coming back  and the redskins i asked  she drew the child away lest he hurt me and shuddered  i reckon twas only a warparty she answered the rest is at mcafees and if they beat em off she stopped abruptly  we shall be saved i said  i shall never forget that day polly ann left my side only to feed the children and to keep watch out of the loopholes and i lay on my back listening and listening to the shots at last these became scattered then though we strained our ears we heard them no more was the fort taken the sun slid across the heavens and shot narrow blades of light now through one loophole and now through another until a ray slanted from the western wall and rested upon the redandblack paint of two dead bodies in the corner i stared with horror  i was afeard to open the door and throw em out said polly ann apologetically  still i stared one of them had a great cleft across his face  but i thought i hit him in the shoulder i exclaimed  polly ann thrust her hand gently across my eyes davy ye mustnt talk she said thats a dear  drowsiness seized me but i resisted  you killed him polly ann i murmured you  hush said polly ann  and i slept again    chapter ii the beggars are come to town  they was that destitute said tom twas a pity to see em  and they be grand folks ye say said polly ann  grand folks i reckon and helpless as babes on the wilderness trail they had two niggershis nigger an hersand they was tuckered too fer a fact  lawsy exclaimed polly ann be still honey taking a piece of cornpone from the cupboard she bent over and thrust it between little peggys chubby fingers be still honey and listen to what your pa says whar did ye find em tom  twas jim ray found em said tom we went up to crab orchard accordin to the colonels orders and we was thar three days ye ought to hev seen the trash we turned back polly ann most of em was scared plum crazy and they was fer gittin out n kaintuckee at any cost some was fer fightin their way through us  the skulks exclaimed polly ann they tried to kill ye what did ye do  tom grinned his mouth full of bacon  do says he we shot a couple of em in the legs and arms and bound em up again they was in a tarin rage im more afeard of a scart mana real scart mannor a rattler they cussed us till they was hoarse said theyd hev us hung an clark too said they hed a right to go back to virginny if they hed a mind  an what did ye say demanded polly ann pausing in her work her eyes flashing with resentment did ye tell em they was cowards to want to settle lands and not fight for em other folks lands too  we didnt tell em nothin said tom jest sent em kitin back to the stations whar they come from  i reckon they wont go foolin with clarks boys again said polly ann resuming a vigorous rubbing of the skillet ye was tellin me about these fine folks ye fetched home she tossed her head in the direction of the open door and i wondered if the fine folks were outside  oh ay said tom they was comin this way from the carolinys jim ray went out to look for a deer and found em off n the trail by the etarnal they was tuckered he was the wust jim said lyin down on a bed of laurels she and the niggers made she has

kaintuck was kinder rough  mercy said polly ann ter think that they was use ter silver spoons and linen and niggers ter wait on em tom ye must shoot a turkey and ill do my best to give em a good

little deevil said he hes hed a hard time  hell be right again soon said polly ann hes been sleepin that way off and on fer a week her voice faltered into a note of tenderness as her eyes rested on me  i reckon we owe davy a heap polly ann said he  i was about to interrupt but polly anns next remark arrested me  tom said she he oughter be eddicated  eddicated exclaimed tom with a kind of dismay  yes eddicated she repeated he aint like you and me hes different he oughter be a lawyer or somethin  tom reflected  ay he answered the colonel says that same thing he oughter be sent over the mountain to git larnin  and well be missing him sore said polly ann with a sigh  i wanted to speak then but the words would not come  whar hev they gone said tom  to take a walk said polly ann and laughed the gentry has sech fancies as that tom i reckon ill fly over to mrs mccanns an beg some of that prime bacon she has  tom picked up his ride and they went out together i lay for a long time reflecting to the strange guests whom tom in the kindness of his heart had brought back and befriended i gave little attention i was overwhelmed by the love which had just been revealed to me and so i was to be educated it had been in my mind these many years but i had never spoken of it to polly ann dear polly ann my eyes filled at the thought that she herself had determined upon this sacrifice  there were footsteps at the door and these i heard and heeded not then there came a voicea womans voice modulated and trained in the perfections of speech and in the art of treating things lightly at the sound of that voice i caught my breath  what a pastoral harry if we have sought for virtue in the wilderness we have found it  when have we ever sought for virtue sarah  it was the man who answered and stirred another chord of my memory  when indeed said the woman tis a luxury that is denied us i fear me  egad we have run the gamut all but that  i thought the woman sighed  our hosts are gone out she said bless their simple souls tis arcady harry where thieves do not break in and steal thats biblical isnt it she paused and joined in the mans laugh i remember she stopped abruptly  thieves said he not in our sense and yet a fortnight ago this sylvan retreat was the scene of murder and sudden death  yes indians said the woman but they are beaten off and forgotten troubles do not last here did you see the boy hes in there in the corner getting well of a fearful hacking mrs mcchesney says he saved her and her brats  ay mcchesney told me said the man lets have a peep at him  in they came and i looked on the woman and would have leaped from my bed had the strength been in me superb she was though her closefitting travelling gown of green cloth was frayed and torn by the briers and the beauty of her face enhanced by the marks of i know not what trials and emotions little darkpencilled lines under the eyes were nigh robbing these of the haughtiness i had once seen and hated set high on her hair was a curving green hat with a feather illsuited to the wilderness  i looked on the man he was as illequipped as she a london tailor must have cut his suit of gray a single band of linen soiled by the journey was wound about his throat and i remember oddly the buttons stuck on his knees and cuffs and these silkembroidered in a crisscross pattern of lighter gray some had been torn off as for his face twas as handsome as ever for dissipation sat well upon it  my thoughts flew back to that day long gone when a friendless boy rode up a long drive to a pillared mansion i saw again the picture the horse with the craning neck the liveried servant at the bridle the listless young gentleman with the shiny boots reclining on the horseblock and above him under the portico the grand lady whose laugh had made me sad and i remembered too the wild neglected lad who had been to me as a brother warmhearted and generous who had shared what he had with a foundling who had wept with me in my first great sorrow where was he  for i was face to face once more with mrs temple and mr harry riddle  the lady started as she gazed at me and her tired eyes widened she clutched mr riddles arm  harry she cried harry he puts me in mind ofof some onei cannot think  mr riddle laughed nervously  there there sally says he all brats resemble somebody i have heard you say so a dozen times  she turned upon him an appealing glance  oh she said with a little catch of her breath is there no such thing as oblivion is there a place in the world that is not haunted i am cursed with memory  or the lack of it answered mr riddle pulling out a silver snuffbox from his pocket and staring at it ruefully damme the snuff i fetched from paris is gone all but a pinch here is a real tragedy  it was the same in rome the lady continued unheeding when we met the izards and at venice that nasty colonel tarleton saw us at the opera in london we must needs run into the manners from maryland in paris  in paris we were safe enough mr riddle threw in hastily  and why she flashed back at him  he did not answer that  a truce with your fancies madam said he behold a soul of good nature i have followed you through half the civilized countries of the globenone of them are good enough you must needs cross the ocean again and come to the wilds we nearly die on the trail are picked up by a samaritan in buckskin and taken into the bosom of his worthy family and forsooth you look at a backwoods urchin and are nigh to swooning  hush harry she cried starting forward and peering into my face he will hear you  tut said harry what if he does london and paris are words to him we might as well be speaking french and ill take my oath hes sleeping  the corner where i lay was dark for the cabin had no windows and if my life had depended upon speaking i could have found no fit words then  she turned from me and her mood changed swiftly for she laughed lightly musically and put a hand on his shoulder  perchance i am ghostridden she said  they are not ghosts of a past happiness at all events he answered  she sat down on a stool before the hearth and clasping her fingers upon her knee looked thoughtfully into the embers of the fire presently she began to speak in a low even voice he looking down at her his feet apart his hand thrust backward towards the heat  harry she said do you remember all our contrivances how you used to hold my hand in the garden under the table while i talked brazenly to mr mason and how jealous jack temple used to get she laughed again softly always looking at the fire  damnably jealous agreed mr riddle and yawned served him devilish right for marrying you and he was a blind fool for five long years  yes blind the lady agreed how could he have been so blind how well i recall the day he rode after us in the woods  twas the parson told curse him said mr riddle we should have gone that night if your courage had held  my courage she cried flashing a look upwards my foresight a pretty mess we had made of it without my inheritance tis small enough the lord knows in europe we should have been dregs we should have starved in the wilderness with you afarming  he looked down at her curiously  devilish queer talk said he but while we are in it i wonder where temple is now he got aboard the kings frigate with a price on his head williams told me he saw him in london at whites havehave you ever heard sarah  she shook her head her glance returning to the ashes  no she answered  faith says mr riddle hell scarce turn up here  she did not answer that but sat motionless  hell scarce turn up here in these wilds mr riddle repeated and what i am wondering sarah is how the devil we are to live here  how do these good people live who helped us when we were starving  mr riddle flung his hand eloquently around the cabin there was something of disgust in the gesture  you see he said love in a cottage  but it is love said the lady in a low tone  he broke into laughter  sally he cried i have visions of you gracing the board at which we sat today patting journeycakes on the hearth stewing squirrel broth with the same pride that you once planned a rout cleaning the pots and pans and standing anxious at the doorway staring through a sunbonnet for your lord and master  my lord and master said the lady and there was so much of scorn in the words that mr riddle winced  come he said i grant now that you could make pans shine like pierglasses that you could cook bacon to a turnalthough i would have laid an hundred guineas against it some years ago what then are you to be contented with four log walls with the intellectual companionship of the mcchesneys and their friends are you to depend for excitement upon the chances of having the hair neatly cut from your head by red fiends come well go back to the rue st dominique to the suppers and the card parties of the countess well be rid of regrets for a life upon which we have turned our backs forever  she shook her head sadly  its no use harry said she well never be rid of regrets  well never have a barony like temple bow and races every week and gentry round about but damn it the rebels have spoiled all that since the war  those are not the regrets i mean answered mrs temple  what then in heavens name he cried you were not wont to be thus but now i vow you go beyond me what then  she did not answer but sat leaning forward over the hearth he staring at her in angry perplexity a sound broke the afternoon stillnessthe pattering of small bare feet on the puncheons a tremor shook the womans shoulders and little tom stood before her a quaint figure in a butternut smock his blue eyes questioning he laid a hand on her arm  then a strange thing happened with a sudden impulse she turned and flung her arms about the boy and strained him to her and kissed his brown hair he struggled but when she released him he sat very still on her knee looking into her face for he was a solemn child the lady smiled at him and there were two splashes like raindrops on her fair cheeks  as for mr riddle he went to the door looked out and took a last pinch of snuff  here is the mistress of the house coming back he cried and singing like the shepherdess in the opera  it was polly ann indeed at the sound of his mothers voice little tom jumped down from the ladys lap and ran past mr riddle at the door mrs temples thoughts were gone across the mountains  and what is that you have under your arm said mr riddle as he gave back  ive fetched some prime bacon fer your supper sir said polly ann all rosy from her walk what i have aint fit to give ye  mrs temple rose  my dear she said what you have is too good for us and if you do such a thing again i shall be very angry  lord maam exclaimed polly ann and you use ter dainties an silver an linen tom is gone to try to git a turkey for ye she paused and looked compassionately at the lady bless ye maam yere that tuckered from the mountains tis a fearsome journey  yes said the lady simply i am tired  small wonder exclaimed polly ann to think what yeve been throughyere husband near to dyin afore yere eyes and ye areskin yere own life to save himso tom tells me when tom goes out afightin redskins im that fidgety i cant set still i wouldnt let him know what i feel fer the world but well ye know the pain of it who love yere husband like that  the lady would have smiled bravely had the strength been given her she tried and then with a shudder she hid her face in her hands  oh dont she exclaimed dont  mr riddle went out  there there maam she said i hednt no right ter speak and ye fair worn out she drew her gently into a chair set down maam and dont ye stir tell suppers ready she brushed her eyes with her sleeve and stepping briskly to my bed bent over me davy she said davy how be ye  davy  it was the ladys voice she stood facing us and never while i live shall i forget that which i saw in her eyes some resemblance it bore to the look of the hunted deer but in the animal it is dumb appealing understanding made the look of the woman terrible to beholdunderstanding ay and courage for she did not lack this last quality polly ann gave back in a kind of dismay and i shivered  yes i answered i am david ritchie  youyou dare to judge me she cried  i knew not why she said this  to judge you i repeated  yes to judge me she answered i know you david ritchie and the blood that runs in you your mother was a foolishsaint she laughed who lifted her eyebrows when i married her brother john temple that was her condemnation of me and it stung me more than had a thousand sermons a doting saint because she followed your father into the mountain wilds to her death for a whim of his and your father a calvinist fanatic who had no mercy on sin save for that particular weakness of his own  stop mrs temple i cried lifting up in bed and to my astonishment she was silenced looking at me in amazement you had your vengeance when i came to you when you turned from me with a lift of your shoulders at the news of my fathers death and now  and now she repeated questioningly  now i thought you were changed i said slowly for the excitement was telling on me  you listened she said  i pitied you  oh pity she cried my god that you should pity me she straightened and summoned all the spirit that was in her i would rather be called a name than have the pity of you and yours  you cannot change it mrs temple i answered and fell back on the nettlebark sheets you cannot change it i heard myself repeating as though it were anothers voice and i knew that polly ann was bending over me and calling me          where did they go polly ann i asked  acrost the mississippi to the lands of the spanish king said polly ann  and where in those dominions i demanded  john saunders took em as far as the falls polly ann answered he lowed they was goin to st louis but they never said a word i reckon theyll be hunted as long as they live  i had thought of them much as i lay on my back recovering from the feverthe fever for which mrs temple was to blame yet i bore her no malice and many other thoughts i had probing back into childhood memories for the solving of problems there  i knowed ye come of gentlefolks davy polly ann had said when we talked together  so i was first cousin to nick and nephew to that selfish gentleman mr temple in whose affectionate care i had been left in charlestown by my father and my father who had he been i remembered the speech that he had used and taught me and how his neighbors had dubbed him aristocrat but mrs temple was gone and it was not in likelihood that i should ever see her more    chapter iii we go to danville  two years went by two uneventful years for me two mighty years for kentucky westward rolled the tide of emigrants to change her character but to swell her power towns and settlements sprang up in a season and flourished and a man could scarce keep pace with the growth of them doctors came and ministers and lawyers generals and majors and captains and subalterns of the revolution to till their grants and to found families there were gentry too from the tidewaters come to retrieve the fortunes which they had lost by their patriotism there were storekeepers like mr scarlett adventurers and neerdoweels who hoped to start with a clean slate and a host of lazy vagrants who thought to scratch the soil and find abundance  i must not forget how at the age of seventeen i became a landowner thanks to my name being on the roll of colonel clarks regiment for in a spirit of munificence the assembly of the commonwealth of virginia had awarded to every private in that regiment one hundred and eight acres of land on the ohio river north of the falls sergeant thomas mcchesney as a reward for his services in one of the severest campaigns in history received a grant of two hundred and sixteen acres you who will may look at the plat made by william clark surveyor for the board of commissioners and find sixteen acres marked for thomas mcchesney in section 169 and two hundred more in section 3 section 3 fronted the ohio some distance above bear grass creek and was of course on the illinois shore as for my own plots some miles in the interior i never saw them but i own them to this day  i mention these things as bearing on the story of my life with which i must get on and therefore i may not dwell upon this injustice to the men who won an empire and were flung a bone long afterwards  it was early autumn once more and such a busy week we had had at the mill that tom was perforce obliged to remain at home and help though he longed to be gone with cowan and ray ahunting to the southwest up rides a man named jarrott flings himself from his horse passes the time of day as he watches the grinding helps tom to tie up a sack or two and hands him a paper  whats this says tom staring at it blankly  ye wont blame me mac answers mr jarrott somewhat ashamed of his role of processserver taint none of my doins  read it davy said tom giving it to me  i stopped the mill and unfolding the paper read i remember not the quaint wording of it save that it was illspelled and illwrit generally in short it was a summons for tom to appear before the court at danville on a certain day in the following week and i made out that a mr neville colfax was the plaintiff in the matter and that the suit had to do with land  neville colfax i exclaimed thats the man for whom mr potts was agent  ay ay said tom and sat him down on the mealbags drat the varmint he kin hev the land  hev the land cried polly ann who had come in upon us hev ye no sperrit tom mcchesney  theres no chance agin the law said tom hopelessly thars perkins had his land tuck away last year and terrells moved out and twenty more i could name and thars danl boone himself most the rich bottom he tuck up the critters hev got away from him  yell go to danville and take davy with ye and fight it answered polly ann decidedly davy has a word to say i reckon twas he made the mill and scart that mr potts away i reckon hell git us out of this fix  mr jarrott applauded her courage  ye have the grit maam he said as he mounted his horse again heres luck to ye  the remembrance of mr potts weighed heavily upon my mind during the next week perchance tom would have to pay for this prank likewise twas indeed a foolish childish thing to have done and i might have known that it would only have put off the evil day of reckoning since then by reason of the mill site and the business we got by it the land had become the most valuable in that part of the country had i known colonel clarks whereabouts i should have gone to him for advice and comfort as it was we were forced to await the issue without counsel polly ann and i talked it over many times while tom sat morose and silent in a corner he was the pioneer pure and simple afraid of no man red or white in open combat but defenceless in such matters as this  tis davy will save us tom said polly ann with the larnin hes got while the corn was grindin  i had indeed been reading at the mill while the hopper emptied itself such odd books as drifted into harrodstown one of these was called bacons abridgment it dealt with law and it puzzled me sorely  and the children polly ann continuedyell not make me pick up the four of em and pack it to louisiana because mr colfax wants the land weve made for ourselves  there were four of them now indeedthe youngest still in the bark cradle in the corner he bore a no less illustrious name than that of the writer of these chronicles  it would be hard to say which was the more troubled tom or i that windy morning we set out on the danville trace polly ann alone had been sereneay and smiling and hopeful she had kissed us each goodby impartially and we left her with a future governor of kentucky on her shoulder tripping lightly down to the mill to grind the mcgarrys corn  when the forest was cleared at danville justice was housed first she was not the serene inexorable dame whom we have seen in pictures holding her scales above the jars of earth justice at danville was a somewhat highspirited quarrelsome lady who decided matters oftenest with the stroke of a sword there was a certain dignity about her temple withalfor instance if a judge wore linen that linen must not be soiled nor was it etiquette for a judge to lay his own hands in chastisement on contemptuous persons though justice at danville had more compassion than her sisters in older communities upon human failings  there was a temple built to her of hewed or sawed logs nine inches thickso said the specifications within the temple was a rude platform which served as a bar and since justice is supposed to carry a torch in her hand there were no windowsnor any windows in the jail next door where some dozen offenders languished on the afternoon that tom and i rode into town  there was nothing auspicious in the appearance of danville and no man might have said then that the place was to be the scene of portentous conventions which were to decide the destiny of a state here was a sprinkling of log cabins some in the building and an inn by courtesy so called tom and i would have preferred to sleep in the woods near by with our feet to the blaze this was partly from motives of economy and partly because tom in common with other pioneers held an inn in contempt but to come back to our arrival  it was a sunny and windy afternoon and the leaves were flying in the air around the courthouse was a familiar buzzing scenethe backwoodsmen lounging against the wall or brawling over their claims the sleek agents and attorneys and half a dozen of a newer type these were adventurous young gentlemen of family some of them lawyers and some of them late officers in the continental army who had been rewarded with grants of land these were the patrons of the log tavern which stood near by with the blackened stumps around it where there was much cardplaying and roistering ay and even duelling of nights  thars mac cried a backwoodsman who was sitting on the courthouse steps as we rode up howdy mac be they tryin to git your land too  howdy mac said a dozen more paying a tribute to toms popularity and some of them greeted me  is this whar they take a mans land away says tom jerking his thumb at the open door  tom had no intention of uttering a witticism but his words were followed by loud guffaws from all sides even the lawyers joining in  i reckon this is the place tom came the answer  i reckon ill take a peep in thar said tom leaping off his horse and shouldering his way to the door i followed him curious the building was half full two elderly gentlemen of grave demeanor sat on stools behind a puncheon table and near them a young man was writing behind the young man was a young gentleman who was closing a speech as we entered and he had spoken with such vehemence that the perspiration stood out on his brow there was a murmur from those listening and i saw tom pressing his way to the front  hev any of ye seen a feller named colfax cries tom in a loud voice he says he owns the land i settled and he aint ever seed it  there was a roar of laughter and even the judges smiled  whar is he cries tom said hed be here today  another gust of laughter drowned his words and then one of the judges got up and rapped on the table the gentleman who had just made the speech glared mightily and i supposed he had lost the effect of it  what do you mean by interrupting the court cried the judge get out sir or ill have you fined for contempt  tom looked dazed but at that moment a hand was laid on his shoulder and tom turned  why says he thars no devil if it aint the colonel polly ann told me not to let em scar me colonel  and quite right tom colonel clark answered smiling he turned to the judges if your honors please said he this gentleman is an old soldier of mine and unused to the ways of court i beg your honors to excuse him  the judges smiled back and the colonel led us out of the building  now tom said he after he had given me a nod and a kind word i know this mr colfax and if you will come into the tavern this evening after court well see what can be done i have a case of my own at present  tom was very grateful he spent the remainder of the daylight hours with other friends of his shooting at a mark near by serenely confident of the result of his case now that colonel clark had a hand in it tom being one of the best shots in kentucky he had won two beaver skins before the early autumn twilight fell as for me i had an afternoon of excitement in the court fascinated by the marvels of its procedures by the impassioned speeches of its advocates by the gravity of its judges ambition stirred within me  the big room of the tavern was filled with men in heated talk over the days doings some calling out for black betty some for rum and some demanding apple toddies the landlords slovenly negro came in with candles their feeble rays reenforcing the firelight and revealing the mudchinked walls tom and i had barely sat ourselves down at a table in a corner when in came colonel clark beside him was a certain swarthy gentleman whom i had noticed in the court a man of some thirtyfive years with a fine fleshy face and coalblack hair his expression was not one to give us the hope of an amicable settlementin fact he had the scowl of a thundercloud he was talking quite angrily and seemed not to heed those around him  why the devil should i see the man clark he was saying  the colonel did not answer until they had stopped in front of us  major colfax said he this is sergeant tom mcchesney one of the best friends i have in kentucky i think a vast deal of tom major he was one of the few that never failed me in the illinois campaign he is as honest as the day you will find him plainspoken if he speaks at all and i have great hopes that you will agree tom the major and i are boyhood friends and for the sake of that friendship he has consented to this meeting  i fear that your kind efforts will be useless colonel major colfax put in rather tartly mr mcchesney not only ignores my rights but was near to hanging my agent  what says colonel clark  i glanced at tom however helpless he might be in a court he could be counted on to stand up stanchly in a personal argument his retorts would certainly not be brilliant but they surely would be dogged major colfax had begun wrong  i reckon yeve got no rights that i know on said tom i cleart the land and settled it and i have a better right to it nor any man and ive got a grant fer it  a henderson grant cried the major tis so much worthless paper  i reckon its good enough fer me answered tom it come from those who blazed their way out here and druv the redskins off i dont know nothin about this newfangled law but tis a queer thing to my thinkin if them that fit fer a place aint got the fust right to it  major colfax turned to colonel clark with marked impatience  i told you it would be useless clark said he i care not a fig for a few paltry acres and as god hears me im a reasonable man he did not look it then but i swear by the evangels ill let no squatter have the better of me i did not serve virginia for gold or land but i lost my fortune in that service and before i know it these backwoodsmen will have every acre of my grant its an old story said mr colfax hotly and why the devil did we fight england if it wasnt that every man should have his rights by god ill not be frightened or wheedled out of mine i sent an agent to kentucky to deal politely and reasonably with these gentry what did they do to him some of them threw him out neck and crop and if i am not mistaken said major colfax fixing a piercing eye upon tom if i am not mistaken it was this worthy sergeant of yours who came near to hanging him and made the poor devil flee kentucky for his life  this remark brought me near to an untimely laugh at the remembrance of mr potts and this though i was far too sober over the outcome of the conference colonel clark seized hold of a chair and pushed it under major colfax  sit down gentlemen we are not so far apart said the colonel coolly the slovenly negro lad passing at that time he caught him by the sleeve here boy a bowl of toddy quick and mind you brew it strong now tom said he what is this fine tale about a hanging  twant nothin said tom  you tell me you didnt try to hang mr potts cried major colfax  i tell you nothin said tom and his jaw was set more stubbornly than ever  major colfax glanced at colonel clark  you see he said a little triumphantly  i could hold my tongue no longer  major colfax is unjust sir i cried twas tom saved the man from hanging  eh says colonel clark turning to me sharply so you had a hand in this davy i might have guessed as much  who the devil is this says mr colfax  a sort of ward of mine answers the colonel drummer boy financier strategist in my illinois campaign allow me to present to you major mr david ritchie when my men objected to marching through iceskimmed water up to their necks mr ritchie showed them how  god bless my soul exclaimed the major staring at me from under his black eyebrows he was but a child  with an old head on his shoulders said the colonel and his banter made me flush  the negro boy arriving with the toddy colonel clark served out three generous gourdfuls a smaller one for me your health my friends and i drink to a peaceful settlement  you may drink to the devil if you like says major colfax glaring at tom  come davy said colonel clark when he had taken half the gourd lets have the tale ill warrant youre behind this  i flushed again and began by stammering for i had a great fear that major colfaxs temper would fly into bits when he heard it  well sir said i i was grinding corn at the mill when the man came i thought him a smoothmannered person and he did not give his business he was just for wheedling me and was this mcchesneys mill said he ay said i thomas mcchesney ay said i then he was all for praise of thomas mcchesney where is he said he he is at the far pasture said i and may be looked for any moment whereupon he sits down and tries to worm out of me the business of the mill the yield of the land after that he begins to talk about the great people he knows sevier and shelby and robertson and boone and the like ay and his intimates the randolphs and the popes and the colfaxes in virginia twas then i asked him if he knew colonel campbell of abingdon  and what deviltry was that demanded the colonel as he dipped himself more of the toddy  ill come to it sir yes colonel campbell was his intimate and ranted if he did not tarry a week with him at abingdon on his journeys after that he follows me to the cabin and sees polly ann and tom and the children on the floor poking a possum ah says he in his softest voice a pleasant family scene and this is mr mcchesney im your man says tom then he praised the mill site and the land all over again tis good enough for a farmer says tom who holds under hendersons grant i cried twas that you wished to say an hour ago and i saw i had caught him fair  by the eternal cried colonel clark bringing down his fist upon the table and what then  i glanced at major colfax but for the life of me i could make nothing of his look  and what did your man say said colonel clark  he called on the devil to bite me sir i answered the colonel put down his gourd and began to laugh the major was looking at me fixedly  and what then said the colonel  it was then polly ann called him a thief to take away the land tom had fought for and paid for and tilled the man was all politeness once more said that the matter was unfortunate and that a new and good title might be had for a few skins  he said that interrupted major colfax half rising in his chair he was a damned scoundrel  so i thought sir i answered  the devil you did said the major  tut colfax said the colonel pulling him by the sleeve of his greatcoat sit down and let the lad finish and then  mr boone had told me of a land agent who had made off with colonel campbells silver spoons from abingdon and how the colonel had ridden east and west after him for a week with a rope hanging on his saddle i began to tell this story and instead of the description of mr boones man i put in that of mr pottsin height some five feet nine spare of sallow complexion and a green greatcoat  major colfax leaped up in his chair  great jehovah he shouted you described the wrong man  colonel clark roared with laughter thereby spilling some of his toddy  ill warrant he did so he cried and ill warrant your agent went white as birch bark go on davy  theres not a great deal more sir i answered looking apprehensively at major colfax who still stood the man vowed i lied but tom laid hold of him and was for hurrying him off to harrodstown at once  which would ill have suited your purpose put in the colonel and what did you do with him  we put him in a loft sir and then i told tom that he was not campbells thief at all but i had a craving to scare the man out of kentucky so i rode off to the neighbors and gave them the tale and bade them come after nightfall as though to hang campbells thief which they did and they were near to smashing the door trying to get in the cabin tom told them the rascal had escaped but they must needs come in and have jigs and toddies until midnight when they were gone and we called down the man from the loft he was in such a state that he could scarce find the rungs of the ladder with his feet he rode away into the night and that was the last we heard of him tom was not to blame sir  colonel clark was speechless and when for the moment he would conquer his mirth a glance at major colfax would set him off again in laughter i was puzzled i thought my colonel more human than of old  how now colfax he cried giving a poke to the majors ribs you hold the sequel to this farce  the majors face was purplewith what emotion i could not say suddenly he swung full at me  do you mean to tell me that you were the general of this hoaxyou he demanded in a strange voice  the thing seemed an injustice to me sir i replied in selfdefence and the man a rascal  a rascal cried the major a knave a poltroon a simpleton and he came to me with no tale of having been outwitted by a stripling whereupon major colfax began to shake gently at first and presently he was in such a gale of laughter that i looked on him in amazement colonel clark joining in again the majors eye rested at length upon tom and gradually he grew calm  mcchesney said he well have no bickerings in court among soldiers the land is yours and tomorrow my attorney shall give you a deed of it your hand mcchesney  the stubbornness vanished from toms face and there came instead a dazed expression as he thrust a great hard hand into the majors  twant the land sir he stammered these varmints of settlers is gittin thick as flies in july twas polly ann i reckon im obleeged to ye major  there there said the major i thank the lord i came to kentucky to see for myself damn the land i have plenty moreand little else he turned quizzically to colonel clark revealing a line of strong white teeth suppose we drink a health to your drummer boy said he lifting up his gourd    chapter iv i cross the mountains once more  tis what yeve a right to davy said polly ann and she handed me a little buckskin bag on which she had been sewing i opened it with trembling fingers and poured out chinking on the table such a motley collection of coins as was never seenspanish milled dollars english sovereigns and crowns and shillings paper issues of the confederacy and i know not what else tom looked on with a grin while little tom and peggy reached out their hands in delight their mother vigorously blocking their intentions  yeve earned it yerself said polly ann forestalling my protest tis what ye got by the mill and ive laid it by bit by bit for yer eddication  and what do you get i cried striving by feigned anger to keep the tears back from my eyes have you no family to support  faith she answered we have the mill that ye gave us and the farm and toms rifle i reckon well fare better than ye think tho well miss ye sore about the place  i picked out two sovereigns from the heap dropped them in the bag and thrust it into my hunting shirt  there said i my voice having no great steadiness not a penny more ill keep the bag for your sake polly ann and ill take the mare for toms  she had had a song on her lips ever since our coming back from danville seven days agone a song on her lips and banter on her tongue as she made me a new hunting shirt and breeches for the journey across the mountains and now with a sudden movement she burst into tears and flung her arms about my neck  oh davy tis no time to be stubborn she sobbed and eddication is a costly thing ever sence i found ye on the trace years ago ive thought of ye one day as a great man and when ye come back to us so big and larned id wish to be saying with pride that i helped ye  and who else polly ann i faltered my heart racked with the parting you found me a homeless waif and you gave me a home and a father and mother  davy yell not forget us when yere great i know yell not tis not in ye  she stood back and smiled at me through her tears the light of heaven was in that smile and i have dreamed of it even since age has crept upon me truly god sets his own mark on the pure in heart on the unselfish  i glanced for the last time around the rude cabin every timber of which was dedicated to our sacrifices and our love the fireplace with its rough stones on the pegs the quaint butternut garments which polly ann had stitched the baby in his bark cradle the rough bedstead and the little trundle pushed under itand the very homely odor of the place is dear to me yet despite the rigors and the dangers of my life here should i ever again find such happiness and peace in the world the children clung to my knees and with a god bless ye davy and come back to us tom squeezed my hand until i winced with pain i leaped on the mare and with blinded eyes rode down the familiar trail past the mill to harrodsburg  there mr neville colfax was waiting to take me across the mountains  there is a story in every mans life like the kernel in the shell of a hickory nut i am ill acquainted with the arts of a biographer but i seek to give in these pages little of the shell and the whole of the kernel of mine twould be unwise and tiresome to recount the journey over the bare mountains with my new friend and benefactor he was a strange gentleman now jolly enough to make me shake with laughter and forget the sorrow of my parting now moody for a night and a day now he was all sweetness now all fire now he was abstemious now selfindulgent and prodigal he had a will like flint and under it a soft heart cross his moods and he hated you i never thought to cross them therefore he called me davy and his friendliness grew with our journey his anger turned against rocks and rivers landlords and emigrants but never against me and for this i was silently thankful  and how had he come to take me over the mountains and to put me in the way of studying law mindful of the kernel of my story i have shortened the chapter to tell you out of the proper place major colfax had made tom and me sup with himself and colonel clark at the inn in danville and so pleased had the major professed himself with my story of having outwitted his agent that he must needs have more of my adventures colonel clark gave him some and tomhis tongue loosed by the toddyothers and the colonel added to the debt i owed him by suggesting that major colfax take me to virginia and recommend me to a lawyer there  nay cried the major i will do more i like the lad for he is modest despite the way you have paraded him i have an uncle in richmond judge wentworth to whom i will take him in person and when the judge has done with him if he is not flayed and tattooed with blackstone you may flay and tattoo me  thus did i break through my environment and it was settled that i should meet the major in seven days at harrodstown  once in the journey did the major make mention of a subject which had troubled me  davy said he clark has changed he is not the same man he was when i saw him in williamsburg demanding supplies for his campaign  virginia has used him shamefully sir i answered and suddenly there came flooding to my mind things i had heard the colonel say in the campaign  commonwealths have short memories said the major they will accept any sacrifice with a smile shakespeare i believe speaks of royal ingratitudehe knew not commonwealths clark was closelipped once not given to levity andto toddy there there he is my friend as well as yours and i will prove it by pushing his cause in virginia is yours scotch anger then the devil fend me from it a monarch would have given him fifty thousand acres on the wabash a palace and a sufficient annuity virginia has given him a sword eight thousand wild acres to be sure repudiated the debts of his army and left him to starve is there no room for a genius in our infant military establishment  at length as christmas drew near we came to major colfaxs seat some forty miles out of the town of richmond it was called nevilles grange the majors grandfather having so named it when he came out from england some sixty years before it was a huge rambling draughty house of woodmortgaged so the major cheerfully informed me thanks to the patriotism of the family at nevilles grange the major kept a somewhat roisterous bachelors hall the place was overrun with negroes and dogs and scarce a night went by that there was not merrymaking in the house with the neighbors the time passed pleasantly enough until one frosty january morning major colfax had a twinge of remembrance cried out for horses took me into richmond and presented me to that very learned and decorous gentleman judge wentworth  my studies began within the hour of my arrival    chapter v i meet an old bedfellow  i shall burden no one with the dry chronicles of a law office the acquirement of learning is a slow process in life and perchance a slower one in the telling i lacked not application during the three years of my stay in richmond and to earn my living i worked at such odd tasks as came my way  the judge resembled major colfax in but one trait he was choleric but he was painstaking and cautious and i soon found out that he looked askance upon any one whom his nephew might recommend he liked the major but he vowed him to be a roisterer and spendthrift and one day some months after my advent the judge asked me flatly how i came to fall in with major colfax i told him at the end of this conversation he took my breath away by bidding me come to live with him like many lawyers of that time he had a little house in one corner of his grounds for his office it stood under great spreading trees and there i was wont to sit through many a summer day wrestling with the authorities in the evenings we would have political arguments for the confederacy was in a seething state between the federalists and the republicans over the new constitution now ratified between the federalists and the jacobins i would better say for the virulence of the french revolution was soon to be reflected among the parties on our side kentucky swelled into an unmanageable territory was come near to rebellion because the government was not strong enough to wrest from spain the free navigation of the mississippi  and yet i yearned to go back and looked forward eagerly to the time when i should have stored enough in my head to gain admission to the bar i was therefore greatly embarrassed when my examinations came by an offer from judge wentworth to stay in richmond and help him with his practice it was an offer not to be lightly set aside and yet i had made up my mind he flew into a passion because of my desire to return to a wild country of outlaws and vagabonds  why damme he cried kentucky and this pretty state of franklin which desired to chip off from north carolina are traitorous places disloyal to congress intriguing with a spanish minister and the spanish governor of louisiana to secede from their own people and join the king of spain bah he exclaimed if our new federal constitution is adopted i would hang jack sevier of franklin and your kentuckian wilkinson to the highest trees west of the mountains  i can see the little gentleman as he spoke his black broadcloth coat and lace ruffles his hand clutching the gold head of his cane his face screwed up with indignation under his white wig it was on a sunday and he was standing by the lilac bushes on the lawn in front of his square brick house  david said he more calmly i trust i have taught you something besides the law i trust i have taught you that a strong federal government alone will be the salvation of our country  you cannot blame kentucky greatly sir said i feeling that i must stand up for my friends the federal government has done little enough for its people and treated them to a deal of neglect they won that western country for themselves with no federal nor virginia or north carolina troops to help them no man east of the mountains knows what that fight has been no man east of the mountains knows the horror of that indian warfare this government gives them no protection now nay congress cannot even procure for them an outlet for their commerce they must trade or perish spain closes the mississippi arrests our merchants seizes their goods and often throws them into prison no wonder they scorn the congress as weak and impotent  the judge stared at me aghast it was the first time i had dared oppose him on this subject  what he sputtered what you are a separatistyou whom i have received into the bosom of my family seizing the cane at the middle he brandished it in my face  dont misunderstand me sir said i you have given me books to read and have taught me what may be the destiny of our nation on this continent but you must forgive a people whose lives have been spent in a fierce struggle for their homes whose families have nearly all lost some member by massacre who are separated by hundreds of miles of wilderness from you  he looked at me speechless and turned and walked into the house i thought i had sinned past forgiveness and i was beyond description uncomfortable for he had been like a parent to me but the next morning at half after seven he walked into the little office and laid down some gold pieces on my table gold was very scarce in those days  they are for your journey david said he my only comfort in your going back is that you may grow up to put some temperance into their wild heads i have a commission for you at jonesboro in what was once the unspeakable state of franklin you can stop there on your way to kentucky he drew from his pocket a great bulky letter addressed to thomas wright esquire barristeratlaw in jonesboro north carolina for the good gentleman could not bring himself to write franklin  it was late in september of the year 1788 when i set out on my homeward wayfor kentucky was home to me i was going back to polly ann and tom and visions of that homecoming rose before my eyes as i rode in a packet in my saddlebags were some dozen letters which mr wrenn the schoolmaster at harrodstown had writ at polly anns bidding i have the letters yet for mr wrenn was plainly an artist and had set down on the paper the words just as they had flowed from her heart ay and there was news in the letters though not surprising news among those pioneer families whom god blessed so abundantly since david ritchie mcchesney i mention the name with pride had risen above the necessities of a bark cradle two more had succeeded him a brother and a sister i spurred my horse onward and thought impatiently of the weary leagues between my family and me  i have often pictured myself on that journey i was twentyone years of age though one would have called me older my looks were nothing to boast of and i was grown up tall and weedy so that i must have made quite a comical sight with my long legs dangling on either side of the pony i wore a suit of gray homespun and in my saddlebags i carried four precious law books the stock in trade which my generous patron had given me but as i mounted the slopes of the mountains my spirits rose too at the prospect of the life before me the woods were all aflame with color with wine and amber and gold and the hills wore the misty mantle of shadowy blue so dear to my youthful memory as i left the rude taverns of a morning and jogged along the heights i watched the vapors rise and troll away from the valleys far beneath and saw great flocks of ducks and swans and cackling geese darkening the air in their southward flight strange that i fell in with no company for the trail leading into the tennessee country was widened and broadened beyond belief and everywhere i came upon blackened fires and abandoned leantos and refuse bones gnawed by the wolves and bleached by the weather i slept in some of these leantos with my fire going brightly indifferent to the howl of wolves in chase or the scream of a panther pouncing on its prey for i was born of the wilderness it had no terrors for me nor did i ever feel alone the great cliffs with their clinging gnarled trees the vast mountains clothed in the motley colors of the autumn the sweet and smoky smell of the indian summerall were dear to me  as i drew near to jonesboro my thoughts began to dwell upon that strange and fascinating man who had entertained polly ann and tom and me so lavishly on our way to kentuckycaptain john sevier for he had made a great noise in the world since then and the wrath of such men as my late patron was heavy upon him yes john sevier nollichucky jack had been a king in all but name since i had seen him the head of such a principality as stirred the blood to read about it comprised the watauga settlement among the mountains of what is now tennessee and was called prosaically as is the wont of the anglosaxon the free state of franklin there were certain conservative and unimaginative souls in this mountain principality who for various reasons held their old allegiance to the state of north carolina one colonel tipton led these loyalist forces and armed partisans of either side had for some years ridden up and down the length of the land burning and pillaging and slaying we in virginia had heard of two sets of courts in franklin of two sets of legislators but of late the rumor had grown persistently that nollichucky jack was now a kind of fugitive and that he had passed the summer pleasantly enough fighting indians in the vicinity of nickajack cave  it was court day as i rode into the little town of jonesboro the air sparkling like a blue diamond over the mountain crests and i drew deep into my lungs once more the scent of the frontier life i had loved so well in the streets currents of excited men flowed and backed and eddied backwoodsmen and farmers in the familiar hunting shirts of hide or homespun and lawyers in dress less rude a line of horses stood kicking and switching their tails in front of the log tavern rough carts and wagons had been left here and there with their poles on the ground and between these piles of skins were heaped up and bags of corn and grain the log meetinghouse was deserted but the courthouse was the centre of such a swirling crowd as i had often seen at harrodstown now there are brawls and brawls and i should have thought with shame of my kentucky bringingup had i not perceived that this was no ordinary court day and that an unusual excitement was in the wind  tying my horse and making my way through the press in front of the tavern door i entered the common room and found it stifling brawling and drinking going on apace scarce had i found a seat before the whole room was emptied by one consent all crowding out of the door after two men who began a roughandtumble fight in the street i had seen roughandtumble fights in kentucky and if i have forborne to speak of them it is because there always has been within me a loathing for them and so i sat quietly in the common room until the landlord came i asked him if he could direct me to mr wrights house as i had a letter for that gentleman his answer was to grin at me incredulously  i reckoned you wahnt from these parts said he wrightsout o town  what is the excitement i demanded  he stared at me  nollichucky jacks been heah in jonesboro young man said he  what i exclaimed colonel sevier  ay sevier he repeated with martin and tipton and all the caroliny men right heah having a council of mility officers in the courthouse in rides jack with his frontier boys like a whirlwind he beant afeard of em and a bench warrant out agin him for high treason never seed sech a recklessness never had sech a jamboree sence i kept the tavern they was in this here room most of the day and they was five fights before they set down to dinner  and colonel tipton i said  oh tipton said he he haint afeard neither but he haint got men enough  and where is sevier now i demanded  how long hev you ben in town was his answer  i told him  wal said he shifting his tobacco from one sallow cheek to the other i reckon he and his boys rud out just afore you come in mark me he added when i tell ye therell be trouble yet tipton and martin and the caroliny folks is burnin mad with chucky jack for the murder of corn tassel and other peaceful chiefs but jack hez a wild lot with himsome of the nollichucky cave traders and theres one young lad that looks like he was a gentleman once i reckon jack himself wouldnt like to get into a fight with him hes a wild one great goliah he exclaimed running to the door ef thar aint agoin to be another fight never seed sech a day in jonesboro  i likewise ran to the door and this fight interested me there was a great blackbearded mountaineerfarmerdesperado in the midst of a circle pouring out a torrent of abuse at a tall young man  that thars hump gibson said the landlord genially pointing out the blackbearded ruffian and the young lawyer feller hez git a jedgment agin him hes got spunk but i reckon humpll tar the innards outn him ef he stands thar a great while  yell git jedgment agin me ye caroliny splinter will ye yelled mr gibson with an oath ill pay bill wilder the skins when i git ready and all the pinhook lawyers in washington county wont budge me a mite  youll pay bill wilder or go to jail by the eternal cried the young man quite as angrily whereupon i looked upon him with a mixture of admiration and commiseration with a gulping certainty in my throat that i was about to see murder done he was a strange young man with the rare marked look that would compel even a poor memory to pick him out again for example he was very tall and very slim with red hair blown every which way over a high and towering forehead that seemed as long as the face under it the face too was long and all freckled by the weather the blue eyes held me in wonder and these blazed with such prodigious wrath that if a look could have killed hump gibson would have been stricken on the spot mr gibson was however very much alive  skin out o here afore i kill ye he shouted and he charged at the slim young man like a buffalo while the crowd held its breath i who had looked upon cruel sights in my day was turning away with a kind of sickening when i saw the slim young man dodge the rush he did more with two strides of his long legs he reached the fence ripped off the topmost rail and his huge antagonist having changed his direction and coming at him with a bellow was met with the point of a scantling in the pit of his stomach and mr gibson fell heavily to the ground it had all happened in a twinkling and there was a moments lull while the minds of the onlookers needed readjustment and then they gave vent to ecstasies of delight  great goliah cried the landlord breathlessly he shet him up jest like a jackknife  awestruck i looked at the tall young man and he was the very essence of wrath unmindful of the plaudits he stood brandishing the fencerail over the great writhing figure on the ground and he was slobbering i recall that this fact gave a twinge to something in my memory  come on hump gibson he cried come onat which the crowd went wild with pure joy witticisms flew  thought ye was goin to eat im up hump said a friend  ye aint hed yer meal yet hump reminded another  mr hump gibson arose slowly out of the dust yet he did not stand straight  come on come on cried the young lawyerfellow and he thrust the point of the rail within a foot of mr gibsons stomach  come on hump howled the crowd but mr gibson stood irresolute he lacked the supreme test of courage which was demanded on this occasion then he turned and walked away very slowly as though his pace might mitigate in some degree the shame of his retreat the young man flung away the fencerail and thrusting aside the overzealous among his admirers he strode past me into the tavern his anger still hot  hooray fer jackson they shouted hooray fer andy jackson  andy jackson then i knew then i remembered a slim wild sandyhaired boy digging his toes in the red mud long ago at the waxhaws settlement and i recalled with a smile my own fierce struggle at the schoolhouse with the same boy and how his slobbering had been my salvation i turned and went in after him with the landlord who was rubbing his hands with glee  i reckon hump wont come crowin round heah any more cot days mr jackson said our host  but mr jackson swept the room with his eyes and then glared at the landlord so that he gave back  wheres my man he demanded  your man mr jackson stammered the host  great jehovah cried mr jackson i believe hes afraid to race he had a horse that could show heels to my nancy did he and hes gone you say  a light seemed to dawn on the landlords countenance  god bless ye mr jackson he cried ye dont mean that young daredevil that was with sevier  with sevier says jackson  ay says the landlord hes been afightin with sevier all summer and i reckon he aint afeard of nothin any more than you waithis name was templenick temple they called him  nick temple i cried starting forward  wheres he gone said mr jackson he was going to bet me a sixforty he has at nashboro that his horse could beat mine on the greasy cove track wheres he gone  gone said the landlord apologetically nollichucky jack and his boys left town an hour ago  is he a man of honor or isnt he said mr jackson fiercely  lord sir i only seen him once but id stake my oath on it  do you mean to say mr temple has been herenicholas temple i said  the bewildered landlord turned towards me helplessly  who the devil are you sir cried mr jackson  tell me what this mr temple was like said i  the landlords face lighted up  faith a thoroughbred hoss says he sech nostrils and sech a gray eye with the devil in it fer goyellow har and ez tall ez mr jackson heah  and you say hes gone off again with sevier  they rud into town he lowered his voice for the room was filling snapped their fingers at tipton and his warrant and rud out agin my god but that was like nollichucky jack say stranger when your mr temple smiled  he is the man i cried tell me where to find him  mr jackson who had been divided between astonishment and impatience and anger burst out again  what the devil do you mean by interfering with my business sir  because it is my business too i answered quite as testily my claim on mr temple is greater than yours  by jehovah cried jackson come outside sir come outside  the landlord backed away and the men in the tavern began to press around us expectantly  gallop into him andy cried one  dont let him git near no fences stranger said another  mr jackson turned on this man with such truculence that he edged away to the rear of the room  step out sir said mr jackson starting for the door before i could reply i followed perforce not without misgivings the crowd pushing eagerly after before we reached the dusty street jackson began pulling off his coat in a trice the shouting onlookers had made a ring and we stood facing each other he in his shirtsleeves  well fight fair said he his lips wetting  very good said i if you are still accustomed to this hasty manner you have not asked my name my standing nor my reasons for wanting mr temple  i know not whether it was what i said that made him stare or how i said it  pistols if you like said he  no said i i am in a hurry to find mr temple i fought you this way once and its quicker  you fought me this way once he repeated the noise of the crowd was hushed and they drew nearer to hear  come mr jackson said i you are a lawyer and a gentleman and so am i i do not care to be beaten to a pulp but i am not afraid of you and i am in a hurry if you will step back into the tavern i will explain to you my reasons for wishing to get to mr temple  mr jackson stared at me the more  by the eternal said he you are a cool man give me my coat he shouted to the bystanders and they helped him on with it now said he as they made to follow him keep back i would talk to this gentleman by the heavens he cried when he had gained the room i believe you are not afraid of me i saw it in your eyes  then i laughed  mr jackson said i doubtless you do not remember a homeless boy named david whom you took to your uncles house in the waxhaws  i do he exclaimed as i live i do why we slept together  and you stumped your toe getting into bed and swore said i  at that he laughed so heartily that the landlord came running across the room  and we fought together at the old fields school are you that boy and he scanned me again by god i believe you are suddenly his face clouded once more  but what about temple said he  ah i answered i come to that quickly mr temple is my cousin after i left your uncles house my father took me to charlestown  is he a charlestown temple demanded mr jackson for i spent some time gambling and horseracing with the gentry there and i know many of them i was a wild lad i repeat his exact words and i ran up a bill in charlestown that would have filled a folio volume faith all i had left me was the clothes on my back and a good horse i made up my mind one night that if i could pay my debts and get out of charlestown i would go into the back country and study law and sober down there was a mr braiden in the ordinary who staked me two hundred dollars at rattleandsnap against my horse gad sir that was providence i won i left charlestown with honor i studied law at salisbury in north carolina and i have come here to practise it  you seem to have the talent said i smiling at the remembrance of the hump gibson incident  that is my history in a nutshell said mr jackson  and now he added since you are mr temples cousin and friend and an old acquaintance of mine to boot i will tell you where i think he is  where is that i asked eagerly  ill stake a cowbell that sevier will stop at the widow browns he replied ill put you on the road but mind you you are to tell mr temple that he is to come back here and race me at greasy cove  ill warrant him to come said i  whereupon we left the inn together more amicably than before mr jackson had a thoroughbred horse near by that was a pleasure to see and my admiration of his mount seemed to set me as firmly in mr jacksons esteem again as that gentleman himself sat in the saddle he was as good as his word rode out with me some distance on the road and reminded me at the last that nick was to race him    chapter vi the widow browns  it was not to my credit that i should have lost the trail after mr jackson put me straight but the night was dark the country unknown to me and heavily wooded and mountainous in addition to these things my mind ran like fire my thoughts sometimes flew back to the wondrous summer evening when i trod the nollichucky trace with tom and polly ann when i first looked down upon the log palace of that prince of the border john sevier well i remembered him broadshouldered handsome gay a courtier in buckskin small wonder he was idolized by the watauga settlers that he had been their leader in the struggle of franklin for liberty and small wonder that nick temple should be in his following  nick my mind was in a torment concerning him what of his mother should i speak of having seen her i went blindly through the woods for hours after the night fell my horse stumbling and weary until at length i came to a lonely clearing on the mountain side and a fierce pack of dogs dashed barking at my horses heels there was a dark cabin ahead indistinct in the starlight and there i knocked until a gruff voice answered me and a tousled man came to the door yes i had missed the trail he shook his head when i asked for the widow browns and bade me share his bed for the night no i would go on i was used to the backwoods thereupon he thawed a little kicked the dogs and pointed to where the mountain dipped against the starstudded sky there was a trail there which led direct to the widow browns if i could follow it so i left him  once the fear had settled deeply of missing nick at the widow browns i put my mind on my journey and thanks to my early training i was able to keep the trail it doubled around the spurs forded stony brooks in diagonals and often in the darkness of the mountain forest i had to feel for the blazes on the trees there was no making time i gained the notch with the small hours of the morning started on with the descent crisscrossing following a stream here and a stream there until at length the song of the higher waters ceased and i knew that i was in the valley suddenly there was no crowncover over my head i had gained the road once more and i followed it hopefully avoiding the stumps and the deep wagon ruts where the ground was spongy  the morning light revealed a milky mist through which the trees showed like phantoms then there came stains upon the mist of royal purple of scarlet of yellow like a mandarins robe peeps of deep blue fading into azure as the mist lifted the fiery eye of the sun was cocked over the crest and beyond me i saw a house with its logs all golden brown in the level rays the withered cornstalks orange among the blackened stumps my horse stopped of his own will at the edge of the clearing a cock crew a lean hound prostrate on the porch of the house rose to his haunches sniffed growled leaped down and ran to the road and sniffed again i listened startled and made sure of the distant ring of many hoofs and yet i stayed there irresolute could it be tipton and his men riding from jonesboro to capture sevier the hoofbeats grew louder and then the hound in the road gave tongue to the short sharp bark that is the call to arms other dogs hitherto unseen took up the cry and turning in my saddle i saw a body of men riding hard at me through the alley in the forest at their head on a heavy stronglegged horse was one who might have stood for the figure of turbulence and i made no doubt that this was colonel tipton himselfcolonel tipton once secessionist now champion of the old north state and archenemy of john sevier at sight of me he reined up so violently that his horse went back on his haunches and the men behind were near overriding him  look out boys he shouted with a fierce oath theyve got guards out he flung back one hand to his holster for a pistol while the other reached for the powder flask at his belt he primed the pan and seeing me immovable set his horse forward at an amble his pistol at the cock  who in hell are you he cried  a traveller from virginia i answered  and what are you doing here he demanded with another oath  i have just this moment come here said i as calmly as i might i lost the trail in the darkness  he glared at me purpling perplexed  is sevier there said he pointing at the house  i dont know said i  tipton turned to his men who were listening  surround the house he cried and watch this fellow  i rode on perforce towards the house with tipton and three others while his men scattered over the cornfield and cursed the dogs and then we saw in the open door the figure of a woman shading her eyes with her hand we pulled up five of us before the porch in front of her  good morning mrs brown said tipton gruffly  good morning colonel answered the widow  tipton leaped from his horse flung the bridle to a companion and put his foot on the edge of the porch to mount then a strange thing happened the lady turned deftly seized a chair from within and pulled it across the threshold she sat herself down firmly an expression on her face which hinted that the late lamented mr brown had been a dominated man colonel tipton stopped staggering from the very impetus of his charge and gazed at her blankly  i have come for colonel sevier he blurted and then his anger rising i will have no trifling maam he is in this house  la you dont tell me answered the widow in a tone that was wholly conversational  he is in this house shouted the colonel  i reckon youve guessed wrong colonel said the widow  there was an awkward pause until tipton heard a titter behind him then his wrath exploded  i have a warrant against the scoundrel for high treason he cried and by god i will search the house and serve it  still the widow sat tight the rock of ages was neither more movable nor calmer than she  surely colonel you would not invade the house of an unprotected female  the colonel evidently with a great effort throttled his wrath for the moment his new tone was apologetic but firm  i regret to have to do so maam said he but both sexes are equal before the law  the law repeated the widow seemingly tickled at the word she smiled indulgently at the colonel what a pity mr tipton that the law compels you to arrest such a good friend of yours as colonel sevier what selfsacrifice colonel tipton what nobility  there was a second titter behind him whereat he swung round quickly and the crimson veins in his face looked as if they must burst he saw me with my hand over my mouth  you warned him damn you he shouted and turning again leaped to the porch and tried to squeeze past the widow into the house  how dare you sir she shrieked giving him a vigorous push backwards the four of us his three men and myself laughed outright tiptons rage leaped its bounds he returned to the attack again and again and yet at the crucial moment his courage would fail him and he would let the widow thrust him back suddenly i became aware that there were two new spectators of this comedy i started and looked again and was near to crying out at sight of one of them the others did cry out but tipton paid no heed  ten years had made his figure more portly but i knew at once the man in the wellfitting hunting shirt with the long hair flowing to his shoulders with the keen dark face and courtly bearing and humorous eyes yes humorous even now for he stood smiling at this comedy played by his enemy unmindful of his peril the widow saw him before tipton did so intent was he on the struggle  enough she cried enough john tipton tipton drew back involuntarily and a smile broadened on the widows face shame on you for doubting a ladys word allow me to present to youcolonel sevier  tipton turned stared as a man might who sees a ghost and broke into such profanity as i have seldom heard  by the eternal god john sevier he shouted ill hang you to the nearest tree  colonel sevier merely made a little ironical bow and looked at the gentleman beside him  i have surrendered to colonel love he said  tipton snatched from his belt the pistol which he might have used on me and there flashed through my head the thought that some powder might yet be held in its pan we cried out all of us his men the widow and myselfall save sevier who stood quietly smiling suddenly while we waited for murder a tall figure shot out of the door past the widow the pistol flew out of tiptons hand and tipton swung about with something like a bellow to face mr nicholas temple  well i knew him and oddly enough at that time riddles words of long ago came to me god help the woman you love or the man you fight how shall i describe him he was thin even to seeming frailnessyet it was the frailness of the racehorse the golden hair suntanned awry across his forehead the face the same thin and finely cut face of the boy the gray eyes held an anger that did not blaze it was far more dangerous than that colonel john tipton looked and as i live he recoiled  if you touch him ill kill you said mr temple nor did he say it angrily i marked for the first time that he held a pistol in his slim fingers what tipton might have done when he swung to his new bearings is mere conjecture for colonel sevier himself stepped up on the porch laid his hand on temples arm and spoke to him in a low tone what he said we didnt hear the astonishing thing was that neither of them for the moment paid any attention to the infuriated man beside them i saw nicks expression change he smiledthe smile the landlord had described the smile that made men and women willing to die for him after that colonel sevier stooped down and picked up the pistol from the floor of the porch and handed it with a bow to tipton butt first tipton took it seemingly without knowing why and at that instant a negro boy came around the house leading a horse sevier mounted it without a protest from any one  i am ready to go with you gentlemen he said  colonel tipton slipped his pistol back into his belt stepped down from the porch and leaped into his saddle and he and his men rode off into the stumplined alley in the forest that was called a road nick stood beside the widow staring after them until they had disappeared  my horse boy he shouted to the gaping negro who vanished on the errand  what will you do mr temple asked the widow  rescue him maam cried nick beginning to pace up and down ill ride to turners cozby and evans are there and before night we shall have made jonesboro too hot to hold tipton and his cutthroats  la mr temple said the widow with unfeigned admiration i never saw the like of you but i know john tipton and hell have colonel sevier started for north carolina before our boys can get to jonesboro  then well follow says nick beginning to pace again suddenly at a cry from the widow he stopped and stared at me a light in his eye like a point of steel his hand slipped to his waist  a spy he said and turned and smiled at the lady who was watching him with a kind of fascination but damnably cool he continued looking at me i wonder if he thinks to outride me on that beast look you sir he cried as mrs browns negro came back struggling with a deepribbed highcrested chestnut that was making half circles on his hind legs ill give you to the edge of the woods and lay you a sixforty against a pair of moccasins that you never get back to tipton  god forbid that i ever do i answered fervently  what he exclaimed and you here with him on this sneaks errand  i am here with him on no errand said i he and his crew came on me a quarter of an hour since at the edge of the clearing mr temple i am here to find you and to save time i will ride with you  egad youll have to ride like the devil then said he and he stooped and snatched the widows hand and kissed it with a daring gallantry that i had thought to find in him he raised his eyes to hers  goodby mr temple she saidthere was a tremor in her voiceand may you save our jack  he snatched the bridle from the boy and with one leap he was on the rearing wheeling horse come on he cried to me and waving his hat at the lady on the porch he started off with a gallop up the trail in the opposite direction from that which tiptons men had taken  all that i saw of mr nicholas temple on that ride to turners was his back and presently i lost sight of that in truth i never got to turners at all for i met him coming back at the winds pace a huge swarthy determined man at his side and four others spurring after the spume dripping from the horses mouths they did not so much as look at me as they passed and there was nothing left for me to do but to turn my tired beast and follow at any pace i could make towards jonesboro  it was late in the afternoon before i reached the town the town set down among the hills like a caldron boiling over with the wrath of franklin the news of the capture of their beloved sevier had flown through the mountains like seeds on the autumn wind and from north south east and west the faithful were coming in cursing tipton and carolina as they rode  i tethered my tired beast at the first picket and was no sooner on my feet than i was caught in the hurrying stream of the crowd and fairly pushed and beaten towards the courthouse around it a thousand furious men were packed i heard cheering hoarse and fierce cries threats and imprecations and i knew that they were listening to oratory i was suddenly shot around the corner of a house saw the orator himself and gasped  it was nicholas temple there was something aweimpelling in the tall slim boyish figure that towered above the crowd in the finely wrought passionate face in the voice charged with such an anger as is given to few men  what has north carolina done for franklin he cried protected her no repudiated her yes you gave her to the confederacy for a war debt and the confederacy flung her back you shook yourselves free from carolinas tyranny and traitors betrayed you again and now they have betrayed your leader will you avenge him or will you sit down like cowards while they hang him for treason  his voice was drowned but he stood immovable with arms folded until there was silence again  will you rescue him he cried and the roar rose again will you avenge him by tomorrow we shall have two thousand here invade north carolina humble her bring her to her knees and avenge john sevier  pandemonium reigned hats were flung in the air rifles fired shouts and curses rose and blended into one terrifying note gradually in the midst of this mad uproar the crowd became aware that another man was standing upon the stump from which nicholas temple had leaped cozby some one yelled cozby the cry was taken up huzzay for cozby hell lead us into caroliny he was the huge swarthy man i had seen riding hard with nick that morning a sculptor might have chosen his face and frame for a type of the ironhanded leader of pioneers will was supreme in the great featuresinflexible indomitable will his hunting shirt was open across his great chest his black hair fell to his shoulders and he stood with a compelling hand raised for silence and when he spoke slowly resonantly men fell back before his words  i admire mr temples courage and above all his loyalty to our beloved general said major cozby but mr temple is young and the heated counsels of youth must not prevail my friends in order to save jack sevier we must be moderate  his voice strong as it was was lost to hell with moderation they shouted down with north carolina well fight her  he got silence again by the magnetic strength he had in him  very good he said but get your general first if we lead you across the mountains now his blood will be upon your heads no man is a better friend to jack sevier than i leave his rescue to me and i will get him for you he paused and they were stilled perforce i will get him for you he repeated slowly or north carolina will pay for the burial of james cozby  there was an instant when they might have swung either way  how will ye do it came in a thin piping voice from somewhere near the stump it may have been this that turned their minds others took up the question how will ye do it major cozby  i dont know cried the major i dont know and if i did know i wouldnt tell you but i will get nollichucky jack if i have to burn morganton and rake the general out of the cinders  five hundred hands flew up five hundred voices cried im with ye major cozby but the major only shook his head and smiled what he said was lost in the roar fighting my way forward i saw him get down from the stump put his hand kindly on nicks shoulder and lead him into the courthouse they were followed by a score of others and the door was shut behind them  it was then i bethought myself of the letter to mr wright and i sought for some one who would listen to my questions as to his whereabouts at length the man himself was pointed out to me haranguing an excited crowd of partisans in front of his own gate some twenty minutes must have passed before i could get any word with him he was a vigorous little man with black eyes like buttons he wore brown homespun and white stockings and his hair was clubbed when he had yielded the ground to another orator i handed him the letter he drew me aside read it on the spot and became all hospitality at once the town was full and though he had several friends staying in his house i should join them was my horse fed dinner had been forgotten that day but would i enter and partake in short i found myself suddenly provided for and i lost no time in getting my weary mount into mr wrights little stable and then i sat down with several other gentlemen at mr wrights board where there was much guessing as to major cozbys plan  no other man west of the mountains could have calmed that crowd after that young daredevil temple had stirred them up declared mr wright  i ventured to say that i had business with mr temple  faith then i will invite him here said my host but i warn you mr ritchie that he is a trigger set on the hair if he does not fancy you he may quarrel with you and shoot you and he is in no temper to be trifled with today  i am not an easy person to quarrel with i answered  to look at you i shouldnt say that you were said he we are going to the courthouse and i will see if i can get a word with the young hotspur and send him to you do you wait here  i waited on the porch as the day waned the tumult of the place had died down for men were gathering in the houses to discuss and conjecture and presently sauntering along the street in a careless fashion his spurs trailing in the dust came nicholas temple he stopped before the house and stared at me with a fine insolence and i wondered whether i myself had not been too hasty in reclaiming him a greeting died on my lips  well sir he said so you are the gentleman who has been dogging me all day  i dog no one mr temple i replied bitterly  well not quibble about words said he would it be impertinent to ask your businessand perhaps your name  did not mr wright give you my name i exclaimed  he might have mentioned it i did not hear is it of such importance  at that i lost my temper entirely  it may be and it may not i retorted i am david ritchie  he changed before my eyes as he stared at me and then ere i knew it he had me by both arms crying out  david ritchie my davywho ran away from meand we were going to kentucky together oh i have never forgiven youthe smile that there was no resisting belied his words as he put his face close to minei never will forgive you i might have known youyouve grown but i vow youre still an old mandavy you renegade and where the devil did you run to  kentucky i said laughing  oh you traitorand i trusted you i loved you davy do you remember how i clung to you in my sleep and when i woke up the world was black i followed your trail down the drive and to the crossroads  it was not ingratitude nick i said you were all i had in the world and then i faltered the sadness of that faroff time coming over me in a flood and the remembrance of his generous sorrow for me  and how the devil did you track me to the widow browns he demanded releasing me  a mr jackson had a shrewd notion you were there and by the way he was in a fine temper because you had skipped a race with him  that sorreltopped lanternheaded mr jackson said nick hell be killed in one of his fine tempers damn a man who cant keep his temper ill race him of course and where are you bound now davy  for louisville in kentucky at the falls of the ohio it is a growing place and a promising one for a young man in the legal profession to begin life  when do you leave said he  tomorrow morning nick said i you wanted once to go to kentucky why not come with me  his face clouded  i do not budge from this town said he i do not budge until i hear that jack sevier is safe damn cozby if he had given me my way we should have been forty miles from here by this ill tell you cozby is even now picking five men to go to morganton and steal sevier and he puts me off with a kind word hell not have me he says  he thinks you too hot it needs discretion and an old head said i  egad then ill commend you to him said nick  now i said its time for you to tell me something of yourself and how you chanced to come into this country  twas darnleys fault said nick  darnley i exclaimed he whom you got into the duel with i stopped abruptly with a sharp twinge of remembrance that was like a pain in my side twas nick took up the name  with harry riddle he spoke quietly that was the terrifying part of it david ive looked for that man in italy and france ive scoured london for him and by god ill find him before he dies and when i do find him i swear to you that there will be no such thing as time wasted or mercy  i shuddered in all my life i had never known such a moment of indecision should i tell him my conscience would give me no definite reply the question had haunted me all the night and i had lost my way in consequence nor had the mornings ride from the widow browns sufficed to bring me to a decision of what use to tell him would riddles death mend matters the woman loved him that had been clear to me yet by telling nick what i knew i might induce him to desist from his search and if i did not tell nick might some day run across the trail follow it up take riddles life and lose his own the moment made for confession as it was passed  they have ruined my life said nick i curse him and i curse her  hold i cried she is your mother  and therefore i curse her the more he said you know what she is youve tasted of her charity and you are my fathers nephew if you have been without experience i will tell you what she is a common i reached out and put my hand across his mouth  silence i cried you shall say no such thing and have you not manhood enough to make your own life for yourself  manhood he repeated and laughed it was a laugh that i did not like they made a man of me my parents my father played false with the rebels and fled to england for his reward a year after he went i was left alone at temple bow to the tender mercies of the niggers mr mason came back and snatched what was left of me he was a good man he saved me an annuity out of the estate he took me abroad after the war on a grand tour and died of a fever in rome i made my way back to charlestown and there i learned to gamble to hold liquor like a gentleman to run horses and fight like a gentleman we were speaking of darnley he said  yes of darnley i repeated  the devil of a man said nick do you remember him with the cracked voice and fat calves  at any other time i should have laughed at the recollection  darnley turned whig became a continental colonel and got a grant out here in the cumberland country of three thousand acres and now i own it  you own it i exclaimed  rattleandsnap said nick i played him for the land at the ordinary one night and won it it is out here near a place called nashboro where this wild longfaced mr jackson says he is going soon i crossed the mountains to have a look at it fell in with nollichucky jack and went off with him for a summer campaign theres a man for you davy he cried a man to follow through hellfire if they touch a hair of his head well sack the state of north carolina from morganton to the sea  but the land i asked  oh a fig for the land answered nick as soon as nollichucky jack is safe ill follow you into kentucky he slapped me on the knee egad davy it seems like a fairy tale we always said we were going to kentucky didnt we what is the name of the place you are to startle with your learning and calm by your example  louisville i answered laughing by the falls of the ohio  i shall turn up there when jack sevier is safe and i have won some more land from mr jackson well have a rare old time together though i have no doubt you can drink me under the table beware of these sober men egad davy you need only a woolsack to become a fullfledged judge and now tell me how fortune has buffeted you  it was my second night without sleep for we sat burning candles in mr wrights house until the dawn making up the time which we had lost away from each other    chapter vii i meet a hero  when left to myself i was wont to slide into the commonplace and where my own dull life intrudes to clog the action i cut it down here and pare it away there until i am merely explanatory and not too much in evidence i rode out the wilderness trail fell in with other travellers was welcomed by certain old familiar faces at harrodstown and pressed on i have a vivid recollection of a beloved vigorous figure swooping out of a cabin door and scattering a brood of children right and left polly ann i said and she halted trembling  tom she cried tom its davy come back and tom himself flew out of the door ramrod in one hand and rifle in the other never shall i forget them as they stood there he grinning with sheer joy as of yore and she with her hair flying and her blue gown snapping in the wind in a tremor between tears and laughter i leaped to the ground and she hugged me in her arms as though i had been a child calling my name again and again and little tom pulling at the skirts of my coat i caught the youngster by the collar  polly ann said i hes grown to what i was when you picked me up a foundling  and now its little davy no more she answered swept me a courtesy and added with a little quiver in her voice ye are a gentleman now  my heart is still where it was said i  ay ay said tom im sure o that davy  i was with them a fortnight in the familiar cabin and then i took up my journey northward heavy at leaving again but promising to see them from time to time for tom was often at the falls when he went ascouting into the illinois country it was as of old polly ann who ran the mill and was the real breadwinner of the family  louisville was even then bursting with importance and as i rode into it one bright november day i remembered the wilderness i had seen here not ten years gone when i had marched hither with captain harrods company to join clark on the island it was even then a thriving little town of log and clapboard houses and schools and churches and wise men were saying of itwhat colonel clark had long ago predictedthat it would become the first city of commercial importance in the district of kentucky  i do not mean to give you an account of my struggles that winter to obtain a foothold in the law the time was a heyday for young barristers and troubles in those early days grew as plentifully in kentucky as corn in short i got a practice for colonel clark was here to help me and thanks to the men who had gone to kaskaskia and vincennes i had a fairly large acquaintance in kentucky i hired rooms behind mr credes store which was famed for the glass windows which had been fetched all the way from philadelphia mr crede was the embodiment of the enterprising spirit of the place and often of an evening he called me in to see the new fashionable things his barges had brought down the ohio the next day certain young sparks would drop into my room to waylay the belles as they came to pick a costume to be worn at mr nickles dancing school or at the ball at fort finney  the winter slipped away and one cool evening in may there came a negro to my room with a note from colonel clark bidding me sup with him at the tavern and meet a celebrity  i put on my best blue clothes that i had brought with me from richmond and repaired expectantly to the tavern about eight of the clock pushed through the curious crowd outside and entered the big room where the company was fast assembling against the red blaze in the great chimneyplace i spied the figure of colonel clark more portly than of yore and beside him stood a gentleman who could be no other than general wilkinson  he was a man to fill the eye handsome of face symmetrical of figure easy of manner and he wore a suit of bottlegreen that became him admirably in short so fascinated and absorbed was i in watching him as he greeted this man and the other that i started as though something had pricked me when i heard my name called by colonel clark  come here davy he cried across the room and i came and stood abashed before the hero general allow me to present to you the drummer boy of kaskaskia and vincennes mr david ritchie  i hear that you drummed them to victory through a very hell of torture mr ritchie said the general it is an honor to grasp the hand of one who did such service at such a tender age  general wilkinson availed himself of that honor and encompassed me with a smile so benignant so winning in its candor that i could only mutter my acknowledgment and colonel clark must needs apologize laughing for my youth and timidity  mr ritchie is not good at speeches general said he but i make no doubt he will drink a bumper to your health before we sit down gentlemen he cried filling his glass from a bottle on the table a toast to general wilkinson emancipator and saviour of kentucky  the company responded with a shout tossed off the toast and sat down at the long table chance placed me between a young dandy from lexingtonone of several the general had brought in his trainand mr wharton a prominent planter of the neighborhood with whom i had a speaking acquaintance this was a backwoods feast though served in something better than the old backwoods style and we had venison and bears meat and prairie fowl as well as pork and beef and breads that came stinging hot from the dutch ovens toasts to this and that were flung back and forth and jests and gibes and the butt of many of these was that poor federal government which as one gentleman avowed was like a bantam hen trying to cover a nestful of turkeys eggs and clucking with importance all the time this picture brought on gusts of laughter  and what say you of the jay cried one what will he hatch  hisses greeted the name for mr jay wished to enter into a treaty with spain agreeing to close the river for five and twenty years colonel clark stood up and rapped on the table  gentlemen said he louisville has as her guest of honor tonight a man of whom kentucky may well be proud loud cheering five years ago he favored lexington by making it his home and he came to us with the laurel of former achievements still clinging to his brow he fought and suffered for his country and attained the honorable rank of major in the continental line he was chosen by the people of pennsylvania to represent them in the august body of their legislature and now he has got new honor in a new field renewed cheering he has come to kentucky to show her the way to prosperity and glory kentucky had a grievance loud cries of yes yes her hogs and cattle had no market her tobacco and agricultural products of all kinds were rotting because the spaniards had closed the mississippi to our traffic could the federal government open the river shouts of no no and hisses who opened it cries of wilkinson wilkinson he said to the kentucky planters give your tobacco to me and i will sell it he put it in barges he floated down the river and as became a man of such distinction he was met by governorgeneral miro on the levee at new orleans where is that tobacco now gentlemen colonel clark was here interrupted by such roars and stamping that he paused a moment and during this interval mr wharton leaned over and whispered quietly in my ear  ay where is it  i stared at mr wharton blankly he was a man nearing the middle age with a lacing of red in his cheeks a pleasant gray eye and a singularly quiet manner  thanks to the genius of general wilkinson colonel clark continued waving his hand towards the smilingly placid hero that tobacco has been deposited in the kings store at ten dollars per hundreda privilege heretofore confined to spanish subjects well might wilkinson return from new orleans in a chariot and four to a grateful kentucky this year we have tripled nay quadrupled our crop of tobacco and we are here tonight to give thanks to the author of this prosperity alas colonel clarks hand was not as steady as of yore and he spilled the liquor on the table as he raised his glass gentlemen a health to our benefactor  they drank it willingly and withal so lengthily and noisily that mr wilkinson stood smiling and bowing for full three minutes before he could be heard he was a very paragon of modesty was the general and a man whose attitudes and expressions spoke as eloquently as his words none looked at him now but knew before he opened his mouth that he was deprecating such an ovation  gentlemenmy friends and fellowkentuckians he said i thank you from the bottom of my heart for your kindness but i assure you that i have done nothing worthy of it loud protests i am a simple practical man who loves kentucky better than he loves himself this is no virtue for we all have it we have the misfortune to be governed by a set of worthy gentlemen who know little about kentucky and her wants and think less cries of ay ay i am not decrying general washington and his cabinet it is but natural that the wants of the seaboard and the welfare and opulence of the eastern cities should be uppermost in their minds another interruption kentucky if she would prosper must look to her own welfare and if any credit is due to me gentlemen it is because i reserved my decision of his excellency governorgeneral miro and his people until i saw them for myself a little calm reason a plain statement of the case will often remove what seems an insuperable difficulty and i assure you that governorgeneral miro is a most reasonable and courteous gentleman who looks with all kindliness and neighborliness on the people of kentucky let us drink a toast to him to him your gratitude is due for he sends you word that your tobacco will be received  in general wilkinsons barges said mr wharton leaning over and subsiding again at once  the general was the first to drink the toast and he sat down very modestly amidst a thunder of applause  the young man on the other side of me somewhat flushed leaped to his feet  down with the federal government he cried what have they done for us indeed before general wilkinson went to new orleans the spaniards seized our flat boats and cargoes and flung our traders into prison ay and sent them to the mines of brazil the federal government takes sides with the indians against us and what has that government done for you colonel he demanded turning to clark you who have won for them half of their territory they have cast you off like an old moccasin the continental officers who fought in the east have halfpay for life or five years full pay and what have you  there was a breathless hush a swift vision came to me of a man young alert commanding stern under necessity selfrepressed at all timesa man who by the very dominance of his character had awed into submission the fierce northern tribes of a continent who had compelled men to follow him until the life had all but ebbed from their bodies who had led them to victory in the end and i remembered a boy who had stood awestruck before this man in the commandants house at fort sackville ay and i heard again his words as though he had just spoken them promise me that you will not forget me if i amunfortunate i did not understand then and now because of a certain blinding of my eyes i did not see him clearly as he got slowly to his feet he clutched the table he looked around himi dare not sayvacantly and then suddenly he spoke with a supreme anger and a supreme bitterness  not a shilling has this government given me he cried virginia was more grateful from her i have some acres of wild land anda sword he laughed a sword gentlemen and not new at that oh a grateful government we serve one careful of the honor of her captains gentlemen i stand today a discredited man because the honest debts i incurred in the service of that government are repudiated because my friends who helped it father gibault vigo and gratiot and others have never been repaid one of them is ruined  a dozen men had sprung clamoring to their feet before he sat down one more excited than the rest got the ear of the company  do we lack leaders he cried we have them here with us tonight in this room who will stop us not the contemptible enemies in kentucky who call themselves federalists shall we be supine forever we have fought once for our liberties let us fight again let us make a common cause with our real friends on the far side of the mississippi  i rose sick at heart but every man was standing and then a strange thing happened i saw general wilkinson at the far end of the room his hand was raised and there was that on his handsome face which might have been taken for a smile and yet was not a smile others saw him too i know not by what exertion of magnetism they looked at him and they held their tongues  i fear that we are losing our heads gentlemen he said and i propose to you the health of the first citizen of kentucky colonel george rogers clark  i found myself out of the tavern and alone in the cool may night and as i walked slowly down the deserted street my head in a whirl a hand was laid on my shoulder i turned startled to face mr wharton the planter  i would speak a word with you mr ritchie he said may i come to your room for a moment  certainly sir i answered  after that we walked along together in silence my own mind heavily occupied with what i had seen and heard we came to mr credes store went in at the picket gate beside it and down the path to my own door which i unlocked i felt for the candle on the table lighted it and turned in surprise to discover that mr wharton was poking up the fire and pitching on a log of wood he flung off his greatcoat and sat down with his feet to the blaze i sat down beside him and waited thinking him a sufficiently peculiar man  you are not famous mr ritchie said he presently  no sir i answered  nor particularly handsome he continued nor conspicuous in any way  i agreed to this perforce  you may thank god for it said mr wharton  that would be a strange outpouring sir said i  he looked at me and smiled  what think you of this paragon general wilkinson he demanded suddenly  i have federal leanings sir i answered  egad said he well add caution to your lack of negative accomplishments i have had an eye on you this winter though you did not know it i have made inquiries about you and hence i am not here tonight entirely through impulse you have not made a fortune at the law but you have worked hard steered wide of sensation kept your mouth shut is it not so  astonished i merely nodded in reply  i am not here to waste your time or steal your sleep he went on giving the log a push with his foot and i will come to the point when i first laid eyes on this fine gentleman general wilkinson i too fell a victim to his charms it was on the eve of this epochmaking trip of which we heard so glowing an account tonight and i made up my mind that no spaniard however wily could resist his persuasion he said to me wharton give me your crop of tobacco and i promise you to sell it in spite of all the royal mandates that go out of madrid he went he saw he conquered the obdurate miro as he has apparently conquered the rest of the world and he actually came back in a chariot and four as befitted him a heavy crop of tobacco was raised in kentucky that year i helped to raise it added mr wharton dryly i gave the general my second crop and he sent it down mr ritchie i have to this day never received a piastre for my merchandise nor am i the only planter in this situation yet general wilkinson is prosperous  my astonishment somewhat prevented me from replying to this too was it possible that mr wharton meant to sue the general i reflected while he paused i remembered how inconspicuous he had named me and hope died mr wharton did not look at me but stared into the fire for he was plainly not a man to rail and rant  mr ritchie you are young but mark my words that man wilkinson will bring kentucky to ruin if he is not found out the whole district from crab orchard to bear grass is mad about him even clark makes a fool of himself  colonel clark sir i cried  he put up a hand  so you have some hot blood he said i know you love him so do i or i should not have been there tonight do i blame his bitterness do i blameanything he does the treatment he has had would bring a blush of shame to the cheek of any nation save a republic republics are wasteful sir in george rogers clark they have thrown away a general who might some day have decided the fate of this country they have left to stagnate a man fit to lead a nation to war and now he is ready to intrigue against the government with any adventurer who may have convincing ways and a smooth tongue  mr wharton i said rising did you come here to tell me this  but mr wharton continued to stare into the fire  i like you the better for it my dear sir said he and i assure you that i mean no offence colonel clark is enshrined in our hearts democrats and federalists alike whatever he may do we shall love him always but this other manpooh he exclaimed which was as near a vigorous expression as he got now sir to the point i too am a federalist a friend of mr humphrey marshall and as you know we are sadly in the minority in kentucky now i came here tonight to ask you to undertake a mission in behalf of myself and certain other gentlemen and i assure you that my motives are not wholly mercenary he paused smiled and put the tips of his fingers together i would willingly lose every crop for the next ten years to convict this wilkinson of treason against the federal government  treason i repeated involuntarily  mr ritchie answered the planter i gave you credit for some shrewdness do you suppose the federal government does not realize the danger of this situation in kentucky they have tried in vain to open the mississippi and are too weak to do it this man wilkinson goes down to see miro and miro straightway opens the river to us through him how do you suppose wilkinson did it by his charming personality  i said something i know not what as the light began to dawn on me and then i added i had not thought about the general  ah replied mr wharton just so and now you may easily imagine that general wilkinson has come to a very pretty arrangement with miro for a certain stipulated sum best known to wilkinson and miro general wilkinson agrees gradually to detach kentucky from the union and join it to his catholic majestys dominion of louisiana the bribethe opening of the river what the government could not do wilkinson did by the lifting of his finger  still mr wharton spoke without heat  mind you he said we have no proof of this and that is my reason for coming here tonight mr ritchie i want you to get proof of it if you can  you want me i said bewildered  i repeat that you are not handsomei think he emphasized this undulythat you are selfeffacing inconspicuous in short you are not a man to draw suspicion you might travel anywhere and scarcely be noticedi have observed that about you in addition to this you are wary you are discreet you are painstaking i ask you to go first to st louis in louisiana territory and this for two reasons first because it will draw any chance suspicion from your real objective new orleans and second because it is necessary to get letters to new orleans from such leading citizens of st louis as colonel chouteau and monsieur gratiot and i will give you introductions to them you are then to take passage to new orleans in a barge of furs which monsieur gratiot is sending down mind we do not expect that you will obtain proof that miro is paying wilkinson money if you do so much the better but we believe that both are too sharp to leave any tracks you will make a report however upon the conditions under which our tobacco is being received and of all other matters which you may think germane to the business in hand will you go  i had made up my mind  yes i will go i answered  good said mr wharton but with no more enthusiasm than he had previously shown i thought i had not misjudged you is your law business so onerous that you could not go tomorrow  i laughed  i think i could settle what affairs i have by noon mr wharton i replied  egad mr ritchie i like your manner said he and now for a few details and you may go to bed  he sat with me half an hour longer carefully reviewing his instructions and then he left me to a night of contemplation    chapter viii to st louis  by eleven oclock the next morning i had wound up my affairs having arranged with a young lawyer of my acquaintance to take over such cases as i had and i was busy in my room packing my saddlebags for the journey the warm scents of spring were wafted through the open door and window smells of the damp earth giving forth the green things and tender shades greeted my eyes when i paused and raised my head to think purple buds littered the black ground before my doorstep and against the living green of the grass i saw the red stain of a robins breast as he hopped spasmodically hither and thither now pausing immovable with his head raised now tossing triumphantly a wriggling worm from the sod suddenly he flew away and i heard a voice from the street side that brought me stark upright  hold there neighbor can you direct me to the mansion of that celebrated barrister mr ritchie  there was no mistaking that voiceit was nicholas temples i heard a laugh and an answer the gate slammed and mr temple himself in a long gray ridingcoat booted and spurred stood before me  davy he cried come out here and hug me why you look as if i were your grandmothers ghost  and if you were i answered you could not have surprised me more where have you been  at jonesboro acting the gallant with the widow winning and losing skins and cowbells and land at rattleandsnap horseracing with that wild mr jackson faith he near shot the top of my head off because i beat him at greasy cove  i laughed despite my anxiety  and sevier i demanded  you have not heard how sevier got off exclaimed nick egad that was a crowning stroke of genius cozby and evans captains greene and gibson and seviers two boys whom you met on the nollichucky rode over the mountains to morganton greene and gibson and seviers boys hid themselves with the horses in a clump outside the town while cozby and evans disguised as bumpkins in hunting shirts jogged into the town with seviers racing mare between them they jogged into the town i say through the crowds of white trash and rode up to the courthouse where sevier was being tried for his life evans stood at the open door and held the mare and gaped while cozby stalked in and shouldered his way to the front within four feet of the bar like a big awkward countryman jack sevier saw him and he saw evans with the mare outside then by thunder cozby takes a step right up to the bar and cries out judge arent you about done with that man faith it was like judgment day such a mixup as there was after that and nollichucky jack made three leaps and got on the mare and in the confusion cozby and evans were off too and the whole state of north carolina couldnt catch em then nick sighed id have given my soul to have been there he said  come in said i for lack of something better  cursed if you havent given me a sweet reception davy said he have you lost your practice or is there a lady here you rogue and he poked into the cupboard with his stick hullo where are you going now he added his eye falling on the saddlebags  i had it on my lips to say and then i remembered mr whartons injunction  im going on a journey said i  when said nick  i leave in about an hour said i  he sat down then i leave too he said  what do you mean nick i demanded  i mean that i will go with you said he  but i shall be gone three months or more i protested  i have nothing to do said nick placidly  a vague trouble had been working in my mind but now the full horror of it dawned upon me i was going to st louis mrs temple and harry riddle were gone there so polly ann had avowed and nick could not help meeting riddle sorely beset i bent over to roll up a shirt and refrained from answering  he came and laid a hand on my shoulder  what the devil ails you davy he cried if it is an elopement of course i wont press you im hanged if ill make a third  it is no elopement i retorted my face growing hot in spite of myself  then i go with you said he for i vow you need taking care of you cant put me off i say but never in my life have i had such a reception and from my own first cousin too  i was in a quandary so totally unforeseen was this situation and then a glimmer of hope came to me that perhaps his mother and riddle might not be in st louis after all i recalled the conversation in the cabin and reflected that this wayward pair had stranded on so many beaches had drifted off again on so many tides that one place could scarce hold them long perchance they had sunkwho could tell i turned to nick who stood watching me  it was not that i did not want you i said you must believe that i have wanted you ever since that night long ago when i slipped out of your bed and ran away i am going first to st louis and then to new orleans on a mission of much delicacy a mission that requires discretion and secrecy you may come with all my heart with one condition onlythat you do not ask my business  done cried nick davy i was always sure of you you are the one fixed quantity in my life to st louis eh and to new orleans egad what havoc well make among the creole girls may i bring my nigger hell do things for you too  by all means said i laughing only hurry  ill run to the inn said nick and be back in ten minutes he got as far as the door slapped his thigh and looked back davy we may run across  who i asked with a catch of my breath  harry riddle he answered and if so may god have mercy on his soul  he ran down the path the gate clicked and i heard him whistling in the street on his way to the inn  after dinner we rode down to the ferry nick on the thoroughbred which had beat mr jacksons horse and his man benjy on a scraggly pony behind benjy was a small black negro with a very squat nose alert and talkative save when nick turned on him benjy had been born at temple bow he worshipped his master and all that pertained to him and he showered upon me all the respect and attention that was due to a member of the temple family for this i was very grateful it would have been an easier journey had we taken a boat down to fort massac but such a proceeding might have drawn too much attention to our expedition i have no space to describe that trip overland which reminded me at every stage of the march against kaskaskia the woods the chocolate streams the coffeecolored swamps flecked with dead leavesand at length the prairies the grass not waisthigh now but young and tender giving forth the acrid smell of spring nick was delighted he made me recount every detail of my trials as a drummer boy or kept me in continuous spells of laughter over his own escapades in short i began to realize that we were as near to each other as though we had never been parted  we looked down upon kaskaskia from the selfsame spot where i had stood on the bluff with colonel clark and the sounds were even then the samethe sweet tones of the church bell and the lowing of the cattle we found a few virginians and pennsylvanians scattered in amongst the french the forerunners of that change which was to come over this country and we spent the night with my old friend father gibault still the faithful pastor of his flock cheerful though the savings of his lifetime had never been repaid by that country to which he had given his allegiance so freely travelling by easy stages on the afternoon of the second day after leaving kaskaskia we picked our way down the high bluff that rises above the american bottom and saw below us that yellow monster among the rivers the mississippi a blind monster he seemed searching with troubled arms among the islands for his bed swept onward by an inexorable force and on his heaving shoulders he carried great trees pilfered from the unknown forests of the north  down in the moist and shady bottom we came upon the log hut of a halfbreed trapper and he agreed to ferry us across as for our horses a keel boat must be sent after these and monsieur gratiot would no doubt easily arrange for this and so we found ourselves about five oclock on that saturday evening embarked in a wide pirogue on the current dodging the driftwood avoiding the eddies and drawing near to a village set on a low bluff on the spanish side and gleaming white among the trees and as i looked the thought came again like a twinge of pain that mrs temple and riddle might be there thinking themselves secure in this spot so removed from the world and its doings  how now my man of mysterious affairs cried nick from the bottom of the boat you are as puckered as a sour persimmon have you a treaty with spain in your pocket or a declaration of war what can trouble you  nothing if you do not i answered smiling  lord send we dont admire the same lady then said nick pierrot he cried turning to one of the boatmen il y a des belles demoiselles la nestce pas  the man missed a stroke in his astonishment and the boat swung lengthwise in the swift current  dame monsieur il y en a he answered  where did you learn french nick i demanded  mr mason had it hammered into me he answered carelessly his eyes on the line of keel boats moored along the shore our guides shot the canoe deftly between two of these the prow grounded in the yellow mud and we landed on spanish territory  we looked about us while our packs were being unloaded and the place had a strange flavor in that year of our lord 1789 a swarthy boatman in a tow shirt with a bright handkerchief on his head stared at us over the gunwale of one of the keel boats and spat into the still yellow water three highcheeked indians with smudgy faces and dirty red blankets regarded us in silent contempt and by the waterside above us was a sled loaded with a huge water cask a bony mustang pony between the shafts and a chanting negro dipping gourdfuls from the river a road slanted up the little limestone bluff and above and below us stone houses could be seen nestling into the hill houses higher on the river side and with galleries there we climbed the bluff benjy at our heels with the saddlebags and found ourselves on a yellowclay street lined with grass and wild flowers a great peace hung over the village an air of a different race a restfulness strange to a kentuckian clematis and honeysuckle climbed the high palings and behind the privacy of these low bigchimneyed houses of limestone weathered gray could be seen their roofs sloping in gentle curves to the shaded porches in front or again houses of posts set upright in the ground and these filled between with plaster and so immaculately whitewashed that they gleamed against the green of the trees which shaded them behind the houses was often a kind of pinkandcream paradise of flowering fruit trees so dear to the french settlers there were vineyards too and thrifty patches of vegetables and lines of flowers set in the carefully raked mould  we walked on enraptured by the sights around us by the heavy scent of the roses and the blossoms here was a quaint stone horsemill a stable or a barn set uncouthly on the street a bakers shop with a glimpse of the whitecapped baker through the shaded doorway and an appetizing smell of hot bread in the air a little farther on we heard the tinkle of the blacksmiths hammer and the man himself looked up from where the hoof rested on his leather apron to give us a kindly bon soir messieurs as we passed and here was a cabaret with the inevitable porch from whence came the sharp click of billiard balls  we walked on stopping now and again to peer between the palings when we heard amidst the rattling of a cart and the jingling of bells a chorus of voices         a cheval a cheval pour aller voir ma mie              lon lon la  a shaggy indian pony came ambling around the corner between the long shafts of a charette a bareheaded young man in tow shirt and trousers was driving and three laughing girls were seated on the stools in the cart behind him suddenly before i quite realized what had happened the young man pulled up the pony the girls fell silent and nick was standing in the middle of the road with his hat in his hand bowing elaborately  je vous salue mesdemoiselles he cried mes anges a charabanc pouvezvous me diriger chez monsieur gratiot  sapristi exclaimed the young man but he laughed the young women stood up giggling and peered at nick over the young mans shoulder one of them wore a fresh redandwhite calamanco gown she had a complexion of ivory tinged with red raven hair and dusky longlashed mischievous eyes brimming with merriment  volontiers monsieur she answered before the others could catch their breath premiere droite et premiere gauche allons gaspard she cried tapping the young man sharply on the shoulder es tu fou  gaspard came to himself flicked the pony and they went off down the road with shouts of laughter while nick stood waving his hat until they turned the corner  egad said he id take to the highway if i could be sure of holding up such a cargo every time off with you benjy and find out where she lives he cried and the obedient benjy dropped the saddlebags as though such commands were not uncommon  pick up those bags benjy said i laughing  benjy glanced uncertainly at his master  do as i tell you you black scalawag said nick or ill tan you what are you waiting for  marse dave began benjy rolling his eyes in discomfiture  look you nick temple said i when you shipped with me you promised that i should command i cant afford to have the town about our ears  oh very well if you put it that way said nick a little honest diversionpick up the bags benjy and follow the parson  obeying mademoiselles directions we trudged on until we came to a comfortable stone house surrounded by trees and set in a halfblock bordered by a sevenfoot paling hardly had we opened the gate when a tall gentleman of grave demeanor and sober dress rose from his seat on the porch and i recognized my friend of cahokia days monsieur gratiot he was a little more portly his hair was dressed now in an eelskin and he looked every inch the man of affairs that he was he greeted us kindly and bade us come up on the porch where he read my letter of introduction  why he exclaimed immediately giving me a cordial grasp of the hand of course the strategist the john law the reader of character of colonel clarks army yes and worse the prophet mr ritchie  and why worse sir i asked  you predicted that congress would never repay me for the little loan i advanced to your colonel  it was not such a little loan monsieur i said  nimporte said he i went to richmond with my box of scrip and promissory notes but i was not ill repaid if i did not get my money i acquired at least a host of distinguished acquaintances but mr ritchie you must introduce me to your friend  my cousin mr nicholas temple i said  monsieur gratiot looked at him fixedly  of the charlestown temples he asked and a sudden vague fear seized me  yes said nick there was once a family of that name  and now said monsieur gratiot puzzled  now said nick now they are become a worthless lot of refugees and outlaws who by good fortune have escaped the gallows  before monsieur gratiot could answer a child came running around the corner of the house and stood surprised staring at us nick made a face stooped down and twirled his finger shouting with a terrified glee the boy fled to the garden path nick after him  i like mr temple said monsieur gratiot smiling he is young but he seems to have had a history  the revolution ruined many familieshis was one i answered with what firmness of tone i could muster and then nick came back carrying the shouting youngster on his shoulders at that instant a lady appeared in the doorway leading another child and we were introduced to madame gratiot  gentlemen said monsieur gratiot you must make my house your home i fear your visit will not be as long as i could wish mr ritchie he added turning to me if mr wharton correctly states your business i have an engagement to have my furs in new orleans by a certain time i am late in loading and as there is a moon i am sending off my boats tomorrow night the men will have to work on sunday  we were fortunate to come in such good season i answered  after a delicious supper of gumbo a creole dish of fricassee of creme brule of red wine and fresh wild strawberries we sat on the porch the crickets chirped in the garden the moon cast fantastic shadows from the pecan tree on the grass while nick struggling with his french talked to madame gratiot and now and then their gay laughter made monsieur gratiot pause and smile as he talked to me of my errand it seemed strange to me that a man who had lost so much by his espousal of our cause should still be faithful to the american republic although he lived in louisiana he had never renounced the american allegiance which he had taken at cahokia he regarded with no favor the pretensions of spain toward kentucky and remarkably enough he looked forward even then to the day when louisiana would belong to the republic i exclaimed at this  mr ritchie said he the most casual student of your race must come to the same conclusion you have seen for yourself how they have overrun and conquered kentucky and the cumberland districts despite a hideous warfare waged by all the tribes your people will not be denied and when they get to louisiana they will take it as they take everything else  he was a man strong in argument was monsieur gratiot for he loved it and he beat me fairly  nay he said finally spain might as well try to dam the mississippi as to dam your commerce on it as for france i love her though my people were exiled to switzerland by the edict of nantes but france is rotten through the prodigality of her kings and nobles and she cannot hold louisiana the kingdom is sunk in debt he cleared his throat as for this wilkinson of whom you speak i know something of him i have no doubt that miro pensions him but i know miro likewise and you will obtain no proof of that you will however discover in new orleans many things of interest to your government and to the federal party in kentucky colonel chouteau and i will give you letters to certain french gentlemen in new orleans who can be trusted there is saintgre for instance who puts a french louisiana into his prayers he has never forgiven oreilly and his spaniards for the murder of his father in sixtynine saintgre is a good fellowa cousin of the present marquis in franceand his ancestors held many positions of trust in the colony under the french regime he entertains lavishly at les iles his plantation on the mississippi he has the gossip of new orleans at his tongues tip and you will be suspected of nothing save a desire to amuse yourselves if you go there he paused interrupted by the laughter of the others when strangers of note or of position drift here and pass on to new orleans i always give them letters to saintgre he has a charming daughter and a worthless son  monsieur gratiot produced his tabatiere and took a pinch of snuff i summoned my courage for the topic which had trembled all the evening on my lips  some years ago monsieur gratiot a lady and a gentleman were rescued on the wilderness trail in kentucky they left us for st louis did they come here  monsieur gratiot leaned forward quickly  they were people of quality he demanded  yes  and their name  theythey did not say  it must have been the clives he cried it can have been no other tell mea woman still beautiful commanding of perhaps eight and thirty a woman who had a sorrowa great sorrow though we have never learned it and mr clive a man of fashion ill content too and pining for the life of a capital  yes i said eagerly my voice sinking near to a whisper yesit is they and are they here  monsieur gratiot took another pinch of snuff it seemed an age before he answered  it is curious that you should mention them for i gave them letters to new orleansamongst others to saintgre mrs clive waswhat shall i sayhaunted monsieur clive talked of nothing but paris where they had lived once and at last she gave in they have gone there  to paris i said taking breath  yes it is more than a year ago he continued seeming not to notice my emotion they went by way of new orleans in one of chouteaus boats mrs clive seemed a woman with a great sorrow    chapter ix cherchez la femme  sunday came with the soft haziness of a june morning and the dew sucked a fresh fragrance from the blossoms and the grass i looked out of our window at the orchard all pink and white in the early sun and across a patch of clover to the stone kitchen a pearly feathery smoke was wafted from the chimney a delicious aroma of creole coffee pervaded the odor of the blossoms and a cottonclad negro a pieds nus came down the path with two steaming cups and knocked at our door he who has tasted creole coffee will never forget it the effect of it was lost upon nick for he laid down the cup sighed and promptly went to sleep again while i dressed and went forth to make his excuses to the family i found monsieur and madame with their children walking among the flowers madame laughed  he is charming your cousin said she let him sleep by all means until after mass then you must come with us to madame chouteaus my mothers her children and grandchildren dine with her every sunday  madame chouteau my motherinlaw is the queen regent of st louis mr ritchie said monsieur gratiot gayly we are all afraid of her and i warn you that she is a very determined and formidable personage she is the widow of the founder of st louis the sieur laclede although she prefers her own name she rules us with a strong hand dispenses justice settles disputes andsometimes indulges in them herself it is her right  you will see a very pretty french custom of submission to parents said madame gratiot and afterwards there is a ball  a ball i exclaimed involuntarily  it may seem very strange to you mr ritchie but we believe that sunday was made to enjoy they will have time to attend the ball before you send them down the river she added mischievously turning to her husband  certainly said he the loading will not be finished before eight oclock  presently madame gratiot went off to mass while i walked with monsieur gratiot to a storehouse near the rivers bank whence the skins neatly packed and numbered were being carried to the boats on the sweating shoulders of the negroes the halfbreeds and the canadian boatmenbulky bales of yellow elk from the upper plains of the missouri of buffalo and deer and bear and priceless little packages of the otter and the beaver trapped in the green shade of the endless northern forests and brought hither in pirogues down the swift river by the red tribesmen and canadian adventurers  afterwards i strolled about the silent village even the cabarets were deserted a private of the spanish louisiana regiment in a dirty uniform slouched behind the palings in front of the commandants quartersa quaint stone house set against the hill with dormer windows in its curving roof with a wide porch held by eight sturdy hewn pillars here and there the muffled figure of a prowling indian loitered or a barefooted negress shuffled along by the fence crooning a folksong all the world had obeyed the call of the church bell save theseand nick i bethought myself of nick and made my way back to monsieur gratiots  i found my cousin railing at benjy who had extracted from the saddlebags a wondrous gray suit of london cut in which to array his master clothes became nicks slim figure remarkably this coat was cut away smartly like a uniform towards the tails and was brought in at the waist with an infinite art  whither now my conquistador i said  to mass said he  to mass i exclaimed but you have slept through the greater part of it  the best part is to come said nick giving a final touch to his neckband followed by benjys adoring eyes he started out of the door and i followed him perforce we came to the little church of upright logs and plaster with its crudely shingled peaked roof with its tiny belfry crowned by a cross with its porches on each side shading the line of windows there beside the church a little at the back was the cures modest house of stone and at the other hand under spreading trees the graveyard with its rough wooden crosses and behind these graves rose the wooded hill that stretched away towards the wilderness  what a span of life had been theirs who rested here their youth perchance had been spent amongst the crooked streets of some french village streets lined by redtiled houses and crossing limpid streams by quaint bridges death had overtaken them beside a monster tawny river of which their imaginations had not conceived a river which draws tribute from the remote places of an unknown landa river indeed which mixing all the waters seemed to symbolize a coming race which was to conquer the land by its resistless flow even as the mississippi bore relentlessly towards the sea  these were my own thoughts as i listened to the tones of the priest as they came droningly out of the door while nick was exchanging jokes in doubtful french with some halfbreeds leaning against the palings then we heard benches scraping on the floor and the congregation began to file out  those who reached the steps gave back respectfully and there came an elderly lady in a sober turban a black mantilla wrapped tightly about her shoulders and i made no doubt that she was monsieur gratiots motherinlaw madame chouteau she whom he had jestingly called the queen regent i was sure of this when i saw madame gratiot behind her madame chouteau indeed had the face of authority a highbridged nose a determined chin a mouth that shut tightly madame gratiot presented us to her mother and as she passed on to the gate madame chouteau reminded us that we were to dine with her at two  after her the congregation the welltodo and the poor alike poured out of the church and spread in merry groups over the grass keel boatmen in tow shirts and partycolored worsted belts the blacksmith the shoemaker the farmer of a small plot in the common fields in large cotton pantaloons and lightwove camlet coat the more favored in skullcaps linen smallclothes cotton stockings and silverbuckled shoesevery man pausing dipping into his tabatiere for a word with his neighbor the women too made a picture strange to our eyes the matrons in jacket and petticoat a madras handkerchief flung about their shoulders the girls in fresh cottonade or calamanco  all at once cries of polyte polyte were heard and a nimble young man with a jesterlike face hopped around the corner of the church trundling a barrel behind polyte came two rotund little men perspiring freely and laden down with various articlesa birdcage with two yellow birds a hattrunk an inlaid card box a roll of scarlet cloth and i know not what else they deposited these on the grass beside the barrel which polyte had set on end and proceeded to mount encouraged by the shouts of his friends who pressed around the barrel  its an auction i said  but nick did not hear me i followed his glance to the far side of the circle and my eye was caught by a red ribbon a blush that matched it a glance shot from underneath long lashesbut not for me beside the girl and palpably uneasy stood the young man who had been called gaspard  ah said i your angel of the tumbrel  but nick had pulled off his hat and was sweeping her a bow the girl looked down smoothing her ribbon gaspard took a step forward and other young women near us tittered with delight the voice of hippolyte rolling his rs called out in a french dialect  mssieurs et mesdames ce sont des effets dun pauvre officier qui est mort who will buy he opened the hattrunk produced an antiquated beaver with a gold cord and surveyed it with a covetousness that was admirably feigned for polyte was an actor mssieurs to own such a hat were a patent of nobility am i bid twenty livres  there was a loud laughter and he was bid four  gaspard cried the auctioneer addressing the young man of the tumbrel suzanne would no longer hesitate if she saw you in such a hat and with the trunk too ah mon dieu can you afford to miss it  the crowd howled suzanne simpered and gaspard turned as pink as clover but he was not to be bullied the hat was sold to an elderly person the red cloth likewise a pot of grease went to a housewife and there was a veritable scramble for the box of playing cards and at last hippolyte held up the wooden cage with the fluttering yellow birds  ha he cried his eyes on gaspard once more a gentle presenta present to make a heart relent and monsieur leon perchance you will make a bid although they are not gamecocks  instantly from somewhere under the barrel a cock crew even the yellow birds looked surprised and as for polyte he nearly dropped the cage one elderly person crossed himself i looked at nick his face was impassive but suddenly i remembered his boyhood gift how he had imitated the monkeys and i began to shake with inward laughter there was an uncomfortable silence  peste cest la magie said an old man at last searching with an uncertain hand for his snuff  monsieur cried nick to the auctioneer i will make a bid but first you must tell me whether they are cocks or yellow birds  parbleu answered the puzzled hippolyte that i do not know monsieur  everybody looked at nick including suzanne  very well said he i will make a bid and if they turn out to be gamecocks i will fight them with monsieur leon behind the cabaret two livres  there was a laugh as of relief  three cried gaspard and his voice broke  hippolyte looked insulted  mssieurs he shouted they are from the canaries diable un berger doit etre genereux  another laugh and gaspard wiped the perspiration from his face  five said he  six said nick and the villagers turned to him in wonderment what could such a fine monsieur want with two yellow birds  en avant gaspard said hippolyte and suzanne shot another barbed glance in our direction  seven muttered gaspard  eight said nick immediately  nine said gaspard  ten said nick  ten cried hippolyte i am offered ten livres for the yellow birds une bagatelle onze gaspard onze onze livres pour lamour de suzanne  but gaspard was silent no appeals entreaties or taunts could persuade him to bid more and at length hippolyte with a gesture of disdain handed nick the cage as though he were giving it away  monsieur he said the birds are yours since there are no more lovers who are worthy of the name they do not exist  monsieur answered nick it is to disprove that statement that i have bought the birds mademoiselle he added turning to the flushing suzanne i pray that you will accept this present with every assurance of my humble regard  mademoiselle took the cage and amidst the laughter of the village at the discomfiture of poor gaspard swept nick a frightened courtesyone that nevertheless was full of coquetry and at that instant to cap the situation a rotund little man with a round face under a linen biretta grasped nick by the hand and cried in painful but sincere english  monsieur you mek my daughter ver happy she want those bird ever sence captain lopez he die monsieur i am jean baptiste lenoir colonel chouteaus miller and we ver happy to see you at the pon  if monsieur will lead the way said nick instantly taking the little man by the arm  but you are to dine at madame chouteaus i expostulated  to be sure said he au revoir monsieur au revoir mademoiselle plus tard mademoiselle nous danserons plus tard  what devil inhabits you i said when i had got him started on the way to madame chouteaus  your own at present davy he answered laying a hand on my shoulder else i should be on the way to the pon with lenoir but the ball is to come and he executed several steps in anticipation davy i am sorry for you  why i demanded though feeling a little selfcommiseration also  you will never know how to enjoy yourself said he with conviction  madame chouteau lived in a stone house wide and low surrounded by trees and gardens it was a pretty tribute of respect her children and grandchildren paid her that day in accordance with the old french usage of honoring the parent i should like to linger on the scene and tell how nick made them all laugh over the story of suzanne lenoir and the yellow birds and how the children pressed around him and made him imitate all the denizens of wood and field amid deafening shrieks of delight  you have probably delayed gaspards wooing another year mr temple suzanne is a sad coquette said colonel auguste chouteau laughing as we set out for the ball  the sun was hanging low over the western hills as we approached the barracks and out of the open windows came the merry mad sounds of violin guitar and flageolet the tinkle of a triangle now and then the shouts of laughter the shuffle of many feet over the puncheons within the door smiling and benignant unmindful of the stifling atmosphere sat the blackrobed village priest talking volubly to an elderly man in a scarlet cap and several stout ladies ranged along the wall beyond them on a platform zeron the baker fiddled as though his life depended on it the perspiration dripping from his brow frowning gesticulating at them with the flageolet and the triangle and in a dim noisy heated whirl the whole village went round and round and round under the low ceiling in the valse young and old rich and poor high and low the sound of their laughter and the scraping of their feet cut now and again by an agonized squeak from zerons fiddle from time to time a staggering panting couple would fling themselves out help themselves liberally to pink sirop from the bowl on the side table and then fling themselves in once more until zeron stopped from sheer exhaustion to tune up for a pas de deux  across the room by the sirop bowl a pair of red ribbons flaunted a pair of eyes sent a swift challenge zeron and his assistants struck up again and there in a corner was nick temple with characteristic effrontery attempting a pas de deux with suzanne though nick was ignorant he was not ungraceful and the village laughed and admired and when zeron drifted back into a valse he seized suzannes plump figure in his arms and bore her unresisting like a prize among the dancers avoiding alike the fat and unwieldy the clumsy and the spiteful for a while the tune held its mad pace and ended with a shriek and a snap on a high note for zeron had broken a string amid a burst of laughter from the far end of the room i saw nick stop before an open window in which a prying indian was framed swing suzanne at arms length and bow abruptly at the brave with a grunt that startled him into life  vaten mechant shrieked suzanne excitedly  poor gaspard poor hippolyte they would gain suzanne for a dance only to have her snatched away at the next by the slim and reckless young gentleman in the gray court clothes little nick cared that the affair soon became the amusement of the company from time to time as he glided past with suzanne on his shoulder he nodded gayly to colonel chouteau or made a long face at me and to save our souls we could not help laughing  the girl has met her match for she has played shuttlecock with all the hearts in the village said monsieur chouteau but perhaps it is just as well that mr temple is leaving tonight i have signed a bond mr ritchie by which you can obtain money at new orleans and do not forget to present our letter to monsieur de saint gre he has a daughter by the way who will be more of a match for your friends fascinations than suzanne  the evening faded into twilight with no signs of weariness from the dancers and presently there stood beside us jean baptiste lenoir the colonels miller  bsoir monsieur le colonel he said touching his skullcap the water is very low you fren he added turning to me he stay long time in st louis  he is going away tonightin an hour or so i answered with thanksgiving in my heart  i am sorry said monsieur lenoir politely but his looks belied his words he is ver fond suzanne peut etre he marry her but i think not i come away from france to escape the fine gentlemen long time ago they want to run off with my wife she was like suzanne  how long ago did you come from france monsieur i asked to get away from an uncomfortable subject  it is twenty years said he dreamily in french i was born in the quartier saint jean on the harbor of the city of marseilles near notre dame de la nativite and he told of a tall uneven house of four stories with a high pitched roof and a little barred door and window at the bottom giving out upon the rough cobbles he spoke of the smell of the sea of the rollicking sailors who surged through the narrow street to embark on his majestys menofwar and of the kings white soldiers in ranks of four going to foreign lands and how he had become a farmer the tenant of a country family excitement grew on him and he mopped his brow with his blue rumal handkerchief  they desire all the nobles he cried i make the land good and they seize it i marry a pretty wife and monsieur le comte he want her lbon dieu he added bitterly relapsing into french france is for the king and the nobility monsieur the poor have but little chance there in the country i have seen the peasants eat roots and in the city the poor devour the refuse from the houses of the rich it was we who paid for their luxuries and with mine own eyes i have seen their gilded coaches ride down weak men and women in the streets but it cannot last they will murder louis and burn the great chateaux i who speak to you am of the people monsieur i know it  the sun had long set and with flint and tow they were touching the flame to the candles which flickered transparent yellow in the deepening twilight so absorbed had i become in listening to lenoirs description that i had forgotten nick now i searched for him among the promenading figures and missed him in vain did i seek for a glimpse of suzannes red ribbons and i grew less and less attentive to the millers reminiscences and arraignments of the nobility had nick indeed run away with his daughter  the dancing went on with unabated zeal and through the open door in the fainting azure of the sky the summer moon hung above the hills like a great yellow orange striving to hide my uneasiness i made my farewells to madame chouteaus sons and daughters and their friends and with colonel chouteau i left the hall and began to walk towards monsieur gratiots hoping against hope that nick had gone there to change but we had scarce reached the road before we could see two figures in the distance hazily outlined in the midlight of the departed sun and the coming moon the first was monsieur gratiot himself the second benjy monsieur gratiot took me by the hand  i regret to inform you mr ritchie said he politely that my keel boats are loaded and ready to leave were you on any other errand i should implore you to stay with us  is temple at your house i asked faintly  why no said monsieur gratiot i thought he was with you at the ball  where is your master i demanded sternly of benjy  i aint seed him marse dave sence i put him inter dem fine clothes at he wars acoutin  he has gone off with the girl put in colonel chouteau laughing  but where i said with growing anger at this lack of consideration on nicks part  ill warrant that gaspard or hippolyte beaujais will know if they can be found said the colonel neither of them willingly lets the girl out of his sight  as we hurried back towards the throbbing sounds of zerons fiddle i apologized as best i might to monsieur gratiot declaring that if nick were not found within the halfhour i would leave without him my host protested that an hour or so would make no difference we were about to pass through the group of loungers that loitered by the gate when the sound of rapid footsteps arrested us and we turned to confront two panting and perspiring young men who halted beside us one was hippolyte beaujais more fantastic than ever as he faced the moon and the other was gaspard they had plainly made a common cause but it was hippolyte who spoke  monsieur he cried you seek your friend ha we have found himwe will lead you to him  where is he said colonel chouteau repressing another laugh  on the pond monsieurin a boat monsieur with suzanne monsieur le colonel and moreover he will come ashore for no one  parbleu said the colonel i should think not for any arguments that you two could muster but we will go there  how far is it i asked thinking of monsieur gratiot  about a mile said colonel chouteau a pleasant walk  we stepped out hippolyte and gaspard running in front the colonel and monsieur gratiot and myself following and a snicker which burst out now and then told us that benjy was in the rear on any other errand i should have thought the way beautiful for the country road rutted by wooden wheels wound in and out through pleasant vales and over gentle rises whence we caught glimpses from time to time of the mississippi gleaming like molten gold to the eastward here and there nestling against the gentle slopes of the hillside clearing was a lowthatched farmhouse among its orchards as we walked nicks escapade instead of angering monsieur gratiot seemed to present itself to him in a more and more ridiculous aspect and twice he nudged me to call my attention to the two vengefully triumphant figures silhouetted against the moon ahead of us from time to time also i saw colonel chouteau shaking with laughter as for me it was impossible to be angry at nick for any space nobody else would have carried off a girl in the face of her rivals for a moonlight row on a pond a mile away  at length we began to go down into the valley where chouteaus pond was and we caught glimpses of the shimmering of its waters through the trees ay and presently heard them tumbling lightly over the milldam the spot was made for romancea sequestered vale clad with forest trees cleared a little by the waterside where monsieur lenoir raised his maize and his vegetables below the mill so monsieur gratiot told me where the creek lay in pools on its limestone bed the village washing was done and every monday morning barelegged negresses strode up this road the bundles of clothes balanced on their heads the paddles in their hands followed by a stream of black urchins who tempted providence to drown them  down in the valley we came to a path that branched from the road and led under the oaks and hickories towards the pond and we had not taken twenty paces in it before the notes of a guitar and the sound of a voice reached our ears and then when the six of us stood huddled in the rank growth at the waters edge we saw a boat floating idly in the forest shadow on the far side  i put my hand to my mouth  nick i shouted  there came for an answer with the careless and unskilful thrumming of the guitar the end of the verse         thine eyes are bright as the stars at night         thy cheeks like the rose of the dawning oh  helas exclaimed hippolyte sadly there is no other boat  nick i shouted again reenforced vociferously by the others  the music ceased there came feminine laughter across the water then nicks voice in french that dared everything  go away and amuse yourselves at the dance peste it is scarce an hour ago i threatened to row ashore and break your heads allez vous en jaloux  a scream of delight from suzanne followed this sally which was received by gaspard and hippolyte with a rattle of sacres anddespite our irritationthe colonel monsieur gratiot and myself with a burst of involuntary laughter  parbleu said the colonel choking it is a pity to disturb such a one gratiot if it was my boat id delay the departure till morning  indeed i shall have had no small entertainment as a solace said monsieur gratiot listen  the tinkle of the guitar was heard again and nicks voice strong and full and undisturbed       sposin i was to go to n oleans an take sick an die      like a bird into the country my spirit would fly         go way old man and leave me alone         for i am a stranger and a long way from home  there was a murmur of voices in the boat the sound of a paddle gurgling as it dipped and the dugout shot out towards the middle of the pond and drifted again  i shouted once more at the top of my lungs  come in here nick instantly  there was a moments silence  by gad its parson davy i heard nick exclaim halloo davy how the deuce did you get there  no thanks to you i retorted hotly come in  lord said he is it time to go to new orleans  one might think new orleans was across the street said monsieur gratiot what an attitude of mind  the dugout was coming towards us now propelled by easy strokes and nick could be heard the while talking in low tones to suzanne we could only guess at the tenor of his conversation which ceased entirely as they drew near at length the prow slid in among the rushes was seized vigorously by gaspard and hippolyte and the boat hauled ashore  thank you very much messieurs you are most obliging said nick and taking suzanne by the hand he helped her gallantly over the gunwale monsieur he added turning in his most irresistible manner to monsieur gratiot if i have delayed the departure of your boat i am exceedingly sorry but i appeal to you if i have not the best of excuses  and he bowed to suzanne who stood beside him coyly looking down as for polyte and gaspard they were quite breathless between rage and astonishment but colonel chouteau began to laugh  diable monsieur you are right he cried and rather than have missed this entertainment i would pay gratiot for his cargo  au revoir mademoiselle said nick i will return when i am released from bondage when this terrible mentor relaxes vigilance i will escape and make my way back to you through the forests  oh cried mademoiselle to me you will let him come back monsieur  assuredly mademoiselle i said but i have known him longer than you and i tell you that in a month he will not wish to come back  hippolyte gave a grunt of approval to this plain speech suzanne exclaimed but before nick could answer footsteps were heard in the path and lenoir himself perspiring panting exhausted appeared in the midst of us  suzanne he cried suzanne and turning to nick he added quite simply so monsieur you did not run off with her after all  there was no place to run monsieur answered nick  praise be to god for that said the miller heartily there is some advantage in living in the wilderness when everything is said  i shall come back and try monsieur said nick  the miller raised his hands  i assure you that he will not monsieur i put in  he thanked me profusely and suddenly an idea seemed to strike him  there is the priest he cried monsieur le cure retires late there is the priest monsieur  there was an awkward silence broken at length by an exclamation from gaspard colonel chouteau turned his back and i saw his shoulders heave all eyes were on nick but the rascal did not seem at all perturbed  monsieur he said bowing marriage is a serious thing and not to be entered into lightly i thank you from my heart but i am bound now with mr ritchie on an errand of such importance that i must make a sacrifice of my own interests and affairs to his  if mr temple wishes i began with malicious delight but nick took me by the shoulder  my dear davy he said giving me a vicious kick i could not think of it i will go with you at once adieu mademoiselle said he bending over suzannes unresisting hand adieu messieurs and i thank you for your great interest in me this to gaspard and hippolyte  and now monsieur gratiot i have already presumed too much on your patience i will follow you monsieur  we left them lenoir suzanne and her two suitors standing at the pond and made our way through the path in the forest it was not until we reached the road and had begun to climb out of the valley that the silence was broken between us  monsieur said colonel chouteau slyly do you have many such escapes  it might have been closer said nick  closer ejaculated the colonel  assuredly said nick to the extent of abducting monsieur le cure as for you davy he added between his teeth i mean to get even with you  it was well for us that the colonel and monsieur gratiot took the escapade with such good nature and so we walked along through the summer night talking gayly until at length the lights of the village twinkled ahead of us and in the streets we met many parties making merry on their homeward way we came to monsieur gratiots bade our farewells to madame picked up our saddlebags the two gentlemen escorting us down to the river bank where the keel boat was tugging at the ropes that held her impatient to be off her captain a picturesque canadian by the name of xavier paret was presented to us we bade our friends farewell and stepped across the plank to the deck as we were casting off monsieur gratiot called to us that he would take the first occasion to send our horses back to kentucky the oars were manned the heavy hulk moved and we were shot out into the mighty current of the river on our way to new orleans  nick and i stood for a long time on the deck and the windows of the little village gleamed like stars among the trees we passed the last of its houses that nestled against the hill and below that the forest lay like velvet under the moon the song of our boatmen broke the silence of the night         voici le temps et la saison         voici le temps et la saison         ah vrai que les journees sont longues         ah vrai que les journees sont longues    chapter x the keel boat  we were embarked on a strange river in a strange boat and bound for a strange city to us westerners a halo of romance of unreality hung over new orleans to us it had an old world almost oriental flavor of mystery and luxury and pleasure and we imagined it swathed in the moisture of the delta built of quaint houses with courts of shining orange trees and magnolias and surrounded by flowering plantations of unimagined beauty it was most fitting that such a place should be the seat of dark intrigues against material progress and this notion lent added zest to my errand thither as for nick it took no great sagacity on my part to predict that he would forget suzanne and begin to look forward to the creole beauties of the mysterious city  first there was the furladen keel boat in which we travelled gone forever now from western navigation it had its rude square sail to take advantage of the river winds its mast strongly braced to hold the long towropes but towropes were for the endless upriver journey when a numerous crew strained day after day along the bank chanting the voyageurs songs now we were lightmanned two halfbreeds and two canadians to handle the oars in time of peril and captain xavier who stood aft on the cabin roof leaning against the heavy beam of the long curved tiller watching hawklike for snag and eddy and bar within the cabin was a great fireplace of stones where our cooking was done and bunks set round for the men in cold weather and rainy but in these fair nights we chose to sleep on deck  far into the night we sat nick and i our feet dangling over the forward edge of the cabin looking at the glory of the moon on the vast river at the endless forest crown at the haze which hung like silver dust under the high bluffs on the american side we slept we awoke again as the moon was shrinking abashed before the light that glowed above these cliffs and the river was turned from brown to gold and then to burnished copper the forest to a thousand shades of green from crest to the banks where the river was licking the twisted roots to nakedness the south wind wafted the sharp woodsmoke from the chimney across our faces in the stern xavier stood immovable against the tiller his short pipe clutched between his teeth the colors of his new worsted belt made gorgeous by the rising sun  bjour michie he said and added in the english he had picked up from the british traders the breakfas he is ready and jean make him good will you have the grace to descen  we went down the ladder into the cabin where the odor of the furs mingled with the smell of the cooking there was a fricassee steaming on the crane some of zerons bread brought from st louis and coffee that monsieur gratiot had provided for our use we took our bowls and cups on deck and sat on the edge of the cabin  by gad cried nick it lacks but the one element to make it a paradise  and what is that i demanded  a woman said he  xavier who overheard gave a delighted laugh  parbleu michie you have right he said but michie gratiot he say no in nouvelle orleans we find some  nick got to his feet and if anything he did could have surprised me i should have been surprised when he put his arm coaxingly about xaviers neck xavier himself was surprised and correspondingly delighted  tell me xavier he said with a look not to be resisted do you think i shall find some beauties there  beauties exclaimed xavier la nouvelle orleansit is the home of beauty michie they promenade themselves on the levee they look down from ze gallerie mais  but what xavier  but mon dieu michie they are vair difficile they are not like englis beauties there is the father and the mother andthe convent and xavier who had a wen under his eye laid his finger on it  for shame xavier cried nick and you are balked by such things  xavier thought this an exceedingly good joke and he took his pipe out of his mouth to laugh the better  me mais non michie and yet ze alcalde he mek me afraid once he put me in ze calaboose when i tried to climb ze balcon  nick roared  i will show you how xavier he said as to climbing the balconies there is a convenance in it as in all else for instance one must be daring and discreet and nimble and ready to give the law a presentable answer and lacking that a piastre and then the fair one must be a fair one indeed  diable michie cried xavier you are ze mischief  nay said nick i learned it all and much more from my cousin mr ritchie  xavier stared at me for an instant and considering that he knew nothing of my character i thought it extremely impolite of him to laugh indeed he tried to control himself for some reason standing in awe of my appearance and then he burst out into such loud hawhaws that the crew poked their heads above the cabin hatch  michie reetchie said xavier and again he burst into laughter that choked further speech he controlled himself and laid his finger on his wen  you dont believe it said nick offended  michie reetchie a gallant said xavier  an incurable said nick an amazingly clever rogue at device when there is a petticoat in it davy do i do you justice  xavier roared again  quel maitre he said  xavier said nick gently taking the tiller out of his hand i will teach you how to steer a keel boat  mon dieu said xavier and who is to pay michie gratiot for his fur the river she is full of things  yes i know xavier but you will teach me to steer  volontiers michie as we go now but there come a time when i even i who am twenty year on her do not know whether it is right or left ze rockhe vair hard ze snag he grip you like dat and xavier twined his strong arms around nick until he was helpless ze barhe hol you by ze leg an who is to tell you how far he run under ze yellow water michie i who speak to you know but i know not how i know ze water sometime she tell sometime she say noting  a bas xavier said nick pushing him away i will teach you the river  xavier laughed and sat down on the edge of the cabin nick took easily to accomplishments and he handled the clumsy tiller with a certainty and distinction that made the boatmen swear in two languages and a patois a great waterlogged giant of the northern forests loomed ahead of us xavier sprang to his feet but nick had swung his boat swiftly smoothly into the deeper water on the outer side  saint jacques michie cried xavier you mek him better zan i thought  fascinated by a new accomplishment nick held to the tiller while xavier with a trained eye scanned the troubled yellowglistening surface of the river ahead the wind died the sun beat down with a moist and venomous sting and northeastward above the edge of the bluff a bank of cloud like sulphur smoke was lifted gradually xavier ceased his jesting and became quiet  looks like a hurricane said nick  mon dieu said xavier you have right michie and he called in his rapid patois to the crew who lounged forward in the cabins shade there came to my mind the memory of that hurricane at temple bow long ago a storm that seemed to have brought so much sorrow into my life i glanced at nick but his face was serene  the cloudbank came on in black and yellow masses and the saffron light i recalled so well turned the living green of the forest to a sickly pallor and the yellow river to a tinge scarce to be matched on earth xavier had the tiller now and the men were straining at the oars to send the boat across the current towards the nearer western shore and as my glance took in the scale of things the miles of bluff frowning above the bottom the river that seemed now like a lake of lava gently boiling and the wilderness of the western shore that reached beyond the ken of man i could not but shudder to think of the conflict of natures forces in such a place a grim stillness reigned over all broken only now and again by a sharp command from xavier the men were rowing for their lives the sweat glistening on their red faces  she come said xavier  i looked not to the northeast whence the banks of cloud had risen but to the southwest and it seemed as though a little speck was there against the hurrying film of cloud we were drawing near the forest line where a little creek made an indentation i listened and from afar came a sound like the strumming of low notes on a guitar and sad the terrified scream of a panther broke the silence of the forest and then the other distant note grew stronger and stronger yet and rose to a high hum like unto no sound on this earth and mingled with it now was a lashing like water falling from a great height we grounded and xavier seizing a great towrope leaped into the shallow water and passed the bight around a trunk i cried out to nick but my voice was drowned he seized me and flung me under the cabins lee and then above the fearful note of the storm came cracklings like gunshots of great trees snapping at their trunk we saw the forest wall burst outhow far away i know notand the air was filled as with a flock of giant birds and boughs crashed on the roof of the cabin and tore the water in the darkness how long we lay clutching each other in terror on the rocking boat i may not say but when the veil first lifted there was the river like an angry sea and limitless the wind in its fury whipping the foam from the crests and bearing it off into space and presently as we stared the note lowered and the wind was gone again and there was the water tossing foolishly and we lay safe amidst the green wreckage of the forest as by a miracle  it was nick who moved first with white face he climbed to the roof of the cabin and idly seizing the great limb that lay there tried to move it xavier who lay on his face on the bank rose to a sitting posture and crossed himself beyond me crowded the four members of the crew unhurt then we heard xaviers voice in french thanking the blessed virgin for our escape  further speech was gone from us for men do not talk after such a matter we laid hold of the tree across the cabin and straining flung it over into the water a great drop of rain hit me on the forehead and there came a silvergray downpour that blotted out the scene and drove us down below and then from somewhere in the depths of the dark cabin came a sound to make a mans blood run cold  whats that i said clutching nick  benjy said he thank god he did not die of fright we lighted a candle and poking around found the negro where he had crept into the farthest corner of a bunk with his face to the wall and when we touched him he gave vent to a yell that was bloodcurdling  ise a bad nigger lod yes i is he moaned i aint fit fo jedgment lod  nick shook him and laughed  come out of that benjy he said youve got another chance  benjy turned perforce the whites of his eyes gleaming in the candlelight and stared at us  you aint gone yit marse he said  gone where said nick  ise done been tole de quality ll be jedged fust marse  nick hauled him out on the floor climbing to the deck we found that the boat was already under way running southward in the current through the misty rain and gazing shoreward a sight met my eyes which i shall never forget a wide vista carpeted with wreckage was cut through the forest to the rivers edge and the yellow water was strewn for miles with green boughs we stared down it overwhelmed until we had passed beyond its line  it is as straight said nick as straight as one of her majestys alleys i saw cut through the forest at saintcloud                   had i space and time to give a faithful account of this journey it would be chiefly a tribute to xaviers skill for they who have not put themselves at the mercy of the mississippi in a small craft can have no idea of the dangers of such a voyage infinite experience a keen eye a steady hand and a nerve of iron are required now when the current swirled almost to a rapid we grazed a rock by the width of a ripple and again despite the effort of xavier and the crew we would tear the limbs from a huge tree which had we hit it fair would have ripped us from bow to stern once indeed we were fast on a sandbar whence as nick said xavier fairly cursed us off we took care to moor at night where we could be seen as little as possible from the river and divided the watches lest we should be surprised by indians and as we went southward our hands and faces became blotched all over by the bites of mosquitoes and flies and we smothered ourselves under blankets to get rid of them at times we fished and one evening after we had passed the expanse of water at the mouth of the ohio nick pulled a hideous thing from the inscrutable yellow depthsa slimy scaleless catfish he came up like a log and must have weighed seventy pounds xavier and his men and myself made two good meals of him but nick would not touch the meat  the great river teemed with life there were flocks of herons and cranes and water pelicans and i know not what other birds and as we slipped under the banks we often heard the paroquets chattering in the forests and once as we drifted into an inlet at sunset we caught sight of the shaggy head of a bear above the brown water and leaping down into the cabin i primed the rifle that stood there and shot him it took the seven of us to drag him on board and then i cleaned and skinned him as tom had taught me and showed jean how to put the caul fat and liver in rows on a skewer and wrap it in the bears handkerchief and roast it before the fire nick found no difficulty in eating thisit was a dish fit for any gourmand  we passed the great red chickasaw bluff which sits facing westward looking over the limitless louisiana forests where new and wondrous vines and flowers grew and came to the beautiful walnut hills crowned by a spanish fort we did not stop there to exchange courtesies but pressed on to the grand gulf the grave of many a keel boat before and since this was by far the most dangerous place on the mississippi and xavier was never weary of recounting many perilous escapes there or telling how such and such a priceless cargo had sunk in the mud by reason of the lack of skill of particular boatmen he knew of and indeed the canadians face assumed a graver mien after the walnut hills were behind us  you laugh michie he said to nick a little resentfully i who speak to you say that there is four foot on each side of ze bateau too much tafia a little too much excite and he made a gesture with his hand expressive of total destruction ze tornado i would sooner have him  bah said nick stroking xaviers black beard give me the tiller i will see you through safely and we will not spare the tafia either and he began to sing a song of xaviers own           marianson dame jolie           ou est alle votre mari  ah toujours les dames said xavier but i tell you michie le diablehe is at ze bottom of ze grand gulf and his mouth openso and he suited the action to the word  at night we tied up under the shore within earshot of the mutter of the place and twice that night i awoke with clinched hands from a dream of being spun fiercely against the rock of which xavier had told and sucked into the devils mouth under the water dawn came as i was fighting the mosquitoesa still sultry dawn with thunder muttering in the distance  we breakfasted in silence and with the crew standing ready at the oars and xavier scanning the wide expanse of waters ahead seeking for that unmarked point whence to embark on this perilous journey we floated down the stream the prospect was sufficiently disquieting on that murky day below us on the one hand a rocky bluff reached out into the river and on the far side was a timberclad point round which the mississippi doubled and flowed back on itself it needed no trained eye to guess at the perils of the place on the one side the mighty current charged against the bluff and furious at the obstacle lashed itself into a hundred sucks and whirls their course marked by the flotsam plundered from the forests above woe betide the boat that got into this devils caldron and on the other side near the timbered point ran a counter current marked by forest wreckage flowing upstream to venture too far on this side was to be grounded or at least to be sent back to embark once more on the trial  but where was the channel we watched xavier with bated breath not once did he take his eyes from the swirling water ahead but gave the tiller a touch from time to time now right now left and called in a monotone for the port or starboard oars nearer and nearer we sped dodging the snags until the water boiled around us and suddenly the boat shot forward as in a millrace and we clutched the cabins roof a triumphant gleam was in xaviers eyes for he had hit the channel squarely and then like a monster out of the deep the scaly black back of a great northern pine was flung up beside us and sheered us across the channel until we were at the very edge of the foamspecked spinning water but xavier saw it and quick as lightning brought his helm over and laughed as he heard it crunching along our keel and so we came swiftly around the bend and into safety once more the next day there was the petite gulf which bothered xavier very little and the day after that we came in sight of natchez on her heights and guided our boat in amongst the others that lined the shore scowled at by lounging indians there and eyed suspiciously by a hatchetfaced spaniard in a tawdry uniform who represented his majestys customs here we stopped for a day and a night that xavier and his crew might get properly drunk on tafia while nick and i walked about the town and waited until his excellency the commandant had finished dinner that we might present our letters and obtain his passport natchez at that date was a sufficiently unkempt and evil place of dirty ramshackle houses and gambling dens where men of the four nations gamed and quarrelled and fought we were glad enough to get away the following morning xavier somewhat saddened by the loss of thirty livres of which he had no memory and nick and myself relieved at having the passports in our pockets i have mine yet among my papers           natchez 29 de junio de 1789  concedo libre y seguro paeaporte a don david ritchie para que pase a la nueva orleans por agna pido y encargo no se le ponga embarazo  a few days more and we were running between low shores which seemed to hold a dark enchantment the rivers now flowed out of and not into the mississippi and xavier called them bayous and often it took much skill and foresight on his part not to be shot into the lane they made in the dark forest of an evening and the forestit seemed an impenetrable mystery a strange tangle of fantastic growths the liveoak chene vert its widespreading limbs hung funereally with spanish moss and twined in the mistletoes death embrace the dark cypress swamp with the conelike knees above the yellow backwaters and here and there grew the bridelike magnolia which we had known in kentucky wafting its perfume over the waters and wondrous flowers and vines and trees with french names that bring back the scene to me even now with a whiff of romance bois darc lilac grande volaille waterlily birds flew hither and thither the names of every one of which xavier knewthe whistling papabot the mournful bittern gardesoleil and the nightheron grosbeck who stood like a sentinel on the points  one night i awoke with the sweat starting from my brow trying to collect my senses and i lay on my blanket listening to such plaintive and heartrending cries as i had never known human cries they were cries as of children in distress and i rose to a sitting posture on the deck with my hair standing up straight to discover nick beside me in the same position  god have mercy on us i heard him mutter whats that it sounds like the wail of all the babies since the world began  we listened together and i can give no notion of the hideous mournfulness of the sound we lay in a swampy little inlet and the forest wall made a dark blur against the starstudded sky there was a splash near the boat that made me clutch my legs the wails ceased and began again with redoubled intensity nick and i leaped to our feet and stood staring horrified over the gunwale into the black water presently there was a laugh behind us and we saw xavier resting on his elbow  what devilhaunted place is this demanded nick  ha ha said xavier shaking with unseemly mirth you have never heard ze alligator sing michie  alligator cried nick there are babies in the water i tell you  ha ha laughed xavier flinging off his blanket and searching for his flint and tinder he lighted a pine knot and in the red pulsing flare we saw what seemed to be a dozen black logs floating on the surface and then xavier flung the cresset at them fire and all there was a lashing a frightful howl from one of the logs and the nights silence once more  often after that our slumbers were disturbed and we would rise with maledictions in our mouths to fling the handiest thing at the serenaders when we arose in the morning we would often see them by the dozens basking in the shallows with their wide mouths flapped open waiting for their prey sometimes we ran upon them in the water where they looked like the roughbark pine logs from the north and nick would have a shot at them when he hit one fairly there would be a leviathanlike roar and a churning of the river into suds  at length there were signs that we were drifting out of the wilderness and one morning we came in sight of a rich plantation with its dark orange trees and fields of indigo with its widegalleried manorhouse in a grove and as we drifted we heard the negroes chanting at their work the plaintive cadence of the strange song adding to the mystery of the scene here in truth was a new world a land of peaceful customs green and moist the softtoned bells of it seemed an expression of its lifeso far removed from our own striving and fighting existence in kentucky here and there between plantations a belfry could be seen above the cluster of the little white village planted in the green and when we went ashore amongst these simple french people they treated us with such gentle civility and kindness that we would fain have lingered there the river had become a vast yellow lake and often as we drifted of an evening the wail of a slave dance and monotonous beating of a tomtom would float to us over the water  at last late one afternoon we came in sight of that strange city which had filled our thoughts for many days    chapter xi the strange city  nick and i stood by the mast on the forward part of the cabin staring at the distant lowlying city while xavier sought for the entrance to the eddy which here runs along the shore if you did not gain this entranceso he explainedyou were carried by a swift current below new orleans and might by no means get back save by the hiring of a crew xavier however was not to be caught thus and presently we were gliding quietly along the eastern bank or levee which held back the river from the lowlands then as we looked the levee became an esplanade shaded by rows of willows and through them we caught sight of the upper galleries and low curving roofs of the city itself there cried xavier was the governors house on the corner where the great miro lived and beyond it the house of the intendant and then gliding into an open space between the keel boats along the bank stared at by a score of boatmen and idlers from above we came to the end of our long journey no sooner had we made fast than we were boarded by a shabby customs officer who when he had seen our passports bowed politely and invited us to land we leaped ashore gained the gravelled walk on the levee and looked about us  squalidity first met our eyes below us crowded between the levee and the row of houses were dozens of squalid marketstalls tended by cottonclad negroes beyond across the bare place darmes a blackened gap in the line of houses bore witness to the devastation of the year gone by while here and there a roof struck by the setting sun gleamed fiery red with its new tiles the levee was deserted save for the negroes and the river men  time for siesta michie said xavier joining us i will show you ze inn of which i spik she is kep by my fren madame bouvet  xavier said nick looking at the rolling flood of the river suppose this levee should break  ah said xavier then some spaniard who never have a bathhe feel what water is lak  followed by benjy with the saddlebags we went down the steps set in the levee into this strange foreign city it was like unto nothing we had ever seen nor can i give an adequate notion of how it affected ussuch a mixture it seemed of dirt and poverty and wealth and romance the narrow muddy streets ran with filth and on each side along the houses was a sunbaked walk held up by the curved sides of broken flatboats where two men might scarcely pass the houses too had an odd and foreign look some of wood some of upright logs and plaster and newer ones spanish in style of adobe with curving roofs of red tiles and strong eaves spreading over the banquette as the sidewalk was called casting shadows on lemoncolored walls since new orleans was in a swamp the older houses for the most part were lifted some seven feet above the ground and many of these houses had wide galleries on the street side here and there a shop was set in the wall a watchmaker was to be seen poring over his work at a tiny window a shoemaker crosslegged on the floor again at an open wicket we caught a glimpse through a cool archway into a flowering courtyard stalwart negresses with bright kerchiefs made way for us on the banquette hands on hips they swung along erect with baskets of cakes and sweetmeats on their heads musically crying their wares  at length turning a corner we came to a white wooden house on the rue royale with a flight of steps leading up to the entrance in place of a door a flimsy curtain hung in the doorway and pushing this aside we followed xavier through a darkened hall to a wide gallery that overlooked a courtyard this courtyard was shaded by several great trees which grew there the house and gallery ran down one other side of it and the two remaining sides were made up of a series of low cabins these forming the various outhouses and the kitchen at the far end of this gallery a sallow buxom lady sat sewing at a table and xavier saluted her very respectfully  madame he said i have brought you from st louis with michie gratiots compliments two young american gentlemen who are travelling to amuse themselves  the lady rose and beamed upon us  from monsieur gratiot she said you are very welcome gentlemen to such poor accommodations as i have it is not unusual to have american gentlemen in new orleans for many come here first and last and i am happy to say that two of my best rooms are vacant zoey  there was a shrill answer from the court below and a negro girl in a yellow turban came running up while madame bouvet bustled along the gallery and opened the doors of two darkened rooms within i could dimly see a walnut dresser a chair and a walnut bed on which was spread a mosquito bar  voila messieurs cried madame bouvet there is still a little time for a siesta no siesta cried madame eying us aghast ah the americans they never restnever  we bade farewell to the good xavier promising to see him soon and nick shouting to benjy to open the saddlebags proceeded to array himself in the clothes which had made so much havoc at st louis i boded no good from this proceeding but i reflected as i watched him dress that i might as well try to turn the mississippi from its course as to attempt to keep my cousin from the search for gallant adventure and i reflected that his indulgence in pleasureseeking would serve the more to divert any suspicions which might fall upon my own head at last when the setting sun was flooding the courtyard he stood arrayed upon the gallery ready to venture forth to conquest  madame bouvets tavern or hotel or whatever she was pleased to call it was not immaculately clean before passing into the street we stood for a moment looking into the public room on the left of the hallway a long saloon evidently used in the early afternoon for a dining room and at the back of it a wide manypaned window capped by a spanish arch looked out on the gallery near this window was a gay party of young men engaged at cards waited on by the yellowturbaned zoey and drinking what evidently was claret punch the sounds of their jests and laughter pursued us out of the house  the town was waking from its siesta the streets filling and people stopped to stare at nick as we passed but nick who was plainly in search of something he did not find hurried on we soon came to the quarter which had suffered most from the fire where new houses had gone up or were in the building beside the blackened logs of many of bienvilles time then we came to a high white wall that surrounded a large garden and within it was a long massive building of some beauty and pretension with a high latticed belfry and heavy walls and with arched dormers in the sloping roof as we stood staring at it through the iron grille set in the archway of the lodge nick declared that it put him in mind of some of the chateaux he had seen in france and he crossed the street to get a better view of the premises an old man in coarse blue linen came out of the lodge and spoke to me  it is the convent of the good nuns the ursulines monsieur he said in french and it was built long ago in the sieur de bienvilles time when the colony was young for fortyfive years monsieur the young ladies of the city have come here to be educated  what does he say demanded nick pricking up his ears as he came across the street  that young men have been sent to the mines of brazil for climbing the walls i answered  who wants to climb the walls said nick disgusted  the young ladies of the town go to school here i answered it is a convent  it might serve to pass the time said nick gazing with a new interest at the latticed windows how much would you take my friend to let us in at the back way this evening he demanded of the porter in french  the good man gasped lifted his hands in horror and straightway let loose upon nick a torrent of french invectives that had not the least effect except to cause a blacksmiths apprentice and two negroes to stop and stare at us  pooh exclaimed nick when the man had paused for want of breath it is no trick to get over that wall  bon dieu cried the porter you are kentuckians yes i might have known that you were kentuckians and i shall advise the good sisters to put glass on the wall and keep a watch  the young ladies are beautiful you say said nick  at this juncture with the negroes grinning and the porter near bursting with rage there came out of the lodge the fattest woman i have ever seen for her size she seized her husband by the back of his loose frock and pulled him away crying out that he was losing time by talking to vagabonds besides disturbing the good sisters then we went away nick following the convent wall down to the river turning southward under the bank past the huddle of marketstalls we came suddenly upon a sight that made us pause and wonder  new orleans was awake a gay and laughing throng paced the esplanade on the levee under the willows with here and there a cavalier on horseback on the royal road below across the place darmes the spire of the parish church stood against the fading sky and to the westward the mighty river stretched away like a gilded floor it was a strange throng there were grave spaniards in long cloaks and feathered beavers jolly merchants and artisans in short linen jackets each with his tabatiere the wives with bits of finery the children laughing and shouting and dodging in and out between fathers and mothers beaming with quiet pride and contentment swarthy boatmen with their worsted belts gaudy negresses chanting in the soft patois and here and there a blanketed indian nor was this all some occasion so madame bouvet had told us had brought a sprinkling of fashion to town that day and it was a fashion to astonish me there were fine gentlemen with swords and silk waistcoats and silver shoebuckles and ladies in filmy summer gowns greuze ruled the mode in france then but new orleans had not got beyond watteau as for nick and me we knew nothing of greuze and watteau then and we could only stare in astonishment and for once we saw an officer of the louisiana regiment resplendent in a uniform that might have served at court  ay and there was yet another sort every flatboatman who returned to kentucky was full of tales of the marvellous beauty of the quadroons and octoroons stories which i had taken with a grain of salt but they had not indeed been greatly overdrawn for here were these ladies in the flesh their great opaque almond eyes consuming us with a swift glance and each walking with a languid grace beside her duenna their faces were like old ivory their dress the stern miro himself could scarce repress in former times they had been lavish in their finery and even now earrings still gleamed and color broke out irrepressibly  nick was delighted but he had not dragged me twice the length of the esplanade ere his eye was caught by a young lady in pink who sauntered between an elderly gentleman in black silk and a young man more gayly dressed  egad said nick there is my divinity and i need not look a step farther  i laughed  you have but to choose i suppose and all falls your way i answered  but look he cried halting me to stare after the girl what a face and what a form and what a carriage by jove there is breeding for you and davy did you mark the gentle rounded arm thank heaven these short sleeves are the fashion  you are mad nick i answered pulling him on these people are not to be stared at so and once i present our letters to monsieur de saintgre it will not be difficult to know any of them  look said he that young man lover or husband is a brute on my soul they are quarrelling  the three had stopped by a bench under a tree the young man who wore claret silk and a sword had one of those thin faces of dirty complexion which show the ravages of dissipation and he was talking with a rapidity and vehemence of which only a latin tongue will admit we could see likewise that the girl was answering with spiritindeed i should write a stronger word than spiritwhile the elderly gentleman who had a goodhumored fleshy face and figure was plainly doing his best to calm them both people who were passing stared curiously at the three  your divinity evidently has a temper i remarked  for that scoundelcertainly said nick but come they are moving on  you mean to follow them i exclaimed  why not said he we will find out where they live and who they are at least  and you have taken a fancy to this girl  i have looked them all over and shes by far the best ive seen i can say so much honestly  but she may be married i said weakly  tut davy he answered its more than likely from the violence of their quarrel but if so we will try again  we i exclaimed  oh come on he cried dragging me by the sleeve or we shall lose them  i resisted no longer but followed him down the levee in my heart thanking heaven that he had not taken a fancy to an octoroon twilight had set in strongly the gay crowd was beginning to disperse and in the distance the three figures could be seen making their way across the place darmes the girl hanging on the elderly gentlemans arm and the young man following with seeming sullenness behind they turned into one of the narrower streets and we quickened our steps lights gleamed in the houses voices and laughter and once the tinkle of a guitar came to us from courtyard and gallery but nick hurrying on came near to bowling more than one respectable citizen we met on the banquette into the ditch we reached a corner and the three were nowhere to be seen  curse the luck cried nick we have lost them the next time ill stop for no explanations  there was no particular reason why i should have been penitent but i ventured to say that the house they had entered could not be far off  and how the devil are we to know it demanded nick  this puzzled me for a moment but presently i began to think that the two might begin quarrelling again and said so nick laughed and put his arm around my neck  you have no mean ability for intrigue when you put your mind to it davy he said i vow i believe you are in love with the girl yourself  i disclaimed this with some vehemence indeed i had scarcely seen her  they cant be far off said nick well pitch on a likely house and camp in front of it until bedtime  and be flung into a filthy calaboose by a constable said i no thank you  we walked on and halfway down the block we came upon a new house with more pretensions than its neighbors it was set back a little from the street and there was a high adobe wall into which a pair of gates were set and a wicket opening in one of them over the wall hung a dark fringe of magnolia and orange boughs on each of the gateposts a crouching lion was outlined dimly against the fainting light and by crossing the street we could see the upper line of a latticed gallery under the low roof we took our stand within the empty doorway of a blackened house nearly opposite and there we waited nick murmuring all sorts of ridiculous things in my ear but presently i began to reflect upon the consequences of being taken in such a situation by a constable and dragged into the light of a public examination i put this to nick as plainly as i could and was declaring my intention of going back to madame bouvets when the sound of voices arrested me the voices came from the latticed gallery and they were low at first but soon rose to such an angry pitch that i made no doubt we had hit on the right house after all what they said was lost to us but i could distinguish the womans voice lowpitched and vibrant as though insisting upon a refusal and the mans scarce adult tones now high as though with balked passion now shaken and imploring i was for leaving the place at once but nick clutched my arm tightly and suddenly as i stood undecided the voices ceased entirely there were the sounds of a scuffle and the lattice of the gallery was flung open in the all but darkness we saw a figure climb over the railing hang suspended for an instant and drop lightly to the ground then came the light relief of a womans gown in the opening of the lattice the cry auguste auguste the wicket in the gate opened and slammed and a man ran at top speed along the banquette towards the levee  instinctively i seized nick by the arm as he started out of the doorway  let me go he cried angrily let me go davy  but i held on  are you mad i said  he did not answer but twisted and struggled and before i knew what he was doing he had pushed me off the stone step into a tangle of blackened beams behind i dropped his arm to save myself and it was mere good fortune that i did not break an ankle in the fall when i had gained the step again he was gone after the man and a portly citizen stood in front of me looking into the doorway  questcequilya la dedans he demanded sharply  it was a sufficiently embarrassing situation i put on a bold front however and not deigning to answer pushed past him and walked with as much leisure as possible along the banquette in the direction which nick had taken as i turned the corner i glanced over my shoulder and in the darkness i could just make out the man standing where i had left him in great uneasiness i pursued my way my imagination summing up for nick all kinds of adventures with disagreeable consequences i walked for some timeit may have been half an houraimlessly and finally decided it would be best to go back to madame bouvets and await the issue with as much calmness as possible he might not after all have caught the fellow  there were few people in the dark streets but at length i met a man who gave me directions and presently found my way back to my lodging place talk and laughter floated through the latticed windows into the street and when i had pushed back the curtain and looked into the saloon i found the same gaming party at the end of it sitting in their shirtsleeves amidst the moths and insects that hovered around the candles  ah monsieur said madame bouvets voice behind me you must excuse them they will come here and play the young gentlemen and i cannot find it in my heart to drive them away though sometimes i lose a respectable lodger by their noise but after all what would you she added with a shrug i love them the young men but monsieur she cried you have had no supper and where is monsieur your companion comme il est beau garcon  he will be in presently i answered with unwarranted assumption  madame shot at me the swiftest of glances and laughed and i suspected that she divined nicks propensity for adventure however she said nothing more than to bid me sit down at the table and presently zoey came in with lights and strange highly seasoned dishes which i ate with avidity notwithstanding my uneasiness of mind watching the while the party at the far end of the room there were five young gentlemen playing a game i knew not with intervals of intense silence and boisterous laughter and execrations while the cards were being shuffled and the money rang on the board and glasses were being filled from a stand at one side presently madame bouvet returned and placing before me a cup of wondrous coffee advanced down the room towards them  ah messieurs she cried you will ruin my poor house  the five rose and bowed with marked profundity one of them with a puffy weak goodnatured face answered her briskly and after a little raillery she came back to me i had a question not over discreet on my tongues tip  there are some fine residences going up here madame i said  since the fire monsieur the dreadful fire of good friday a year ago you admire them  i saw one i answered with indifference with a wall and lions on the gateposts  mon dieu that is a house exclaimed madame it belongs to monsieur de saintgre  to monsieur de saintgre i repeated  she shot a look at me she had bright little eyes like a birds that shone in the candlelight  you know him monsieur  i heard of him in st louis i answered  you will meet him no doubt she continued he is a very fine gentleman his grandfather was commissarygeneral of the colony and he himself is a cousin of the marquis de saintgre who has two chateaux a house in paris and is a favorite of the king she paused as if to let this impress itself upon me and added archly tenez monsieur there is a daughter  she stopped abruptly  i followed her glance and my first impressionof claretcolorgave me a shock my second confirmed it for in the semidarkness beyond the rays of the candle was a thin eager face prematurely lined with coalblack lustrous eyes that spoke eloquently of indulgence in an instant i knew it to be that of the young man whom i had seen on the levee  monsieur auguste stammered madame  bon soir madame he cried gayly with a bow diable they are already at it i see and the punch in the bowl i will win back tonight what i have lost by a week of accursed luck  monsieur your father has relented perhaps said madame deferentially  relented cried the young man not a sou cest egal i have the means here and he tapped his pocket i have the means here to set me on my feet again madame  he spoke with a note of triumph and madame took a curious step towards him  questceque cest monsieur auguste she inquired  he drew something that glittered from his pocket and beckoned to her to follow him down the room which she did with alacrity  ha adolphe he cried to the young man of the puffy face i will have my revenge tonight voila and he held up the shining thing this goes to the highest bidder and you will agree that it is worth a pretty sum  they rose from their chairs and clustered around him at the table madame in their midst staring with bent heads at the trinket which he held to the light it was madames voice i heard first in a kind of frightened cry  mon dieu monsieur auguste you will not part with that she exclaimed  why not demanded the young man indifferently it was painted by boze the back is solid gold and the jew in the rue toulouse will give me four hundred livres for it tomorrow morning  there followed immediately such a chorus of questions exclamations and shrill protests from madame bouvet that i being such a laborious french scholar could distinguish but little of what they said i looked in wonderment at the gesticulating figures grouped against the light madame imploring the youthful profile of the newcomer marked with a cynical and scornful refusal more than once i was for rising out of my chair to go over and see for myself what the object was and then suddenly i perceived madame bouvet coming towards me in evident agitation she sank into the chair beside me  if i had four hundred livres she said if i had four hundred livres  and what then i asked  monsieur she said a terrible thing has happened auguste de saintgre  auguste de saintgre i exclaimed  he is the son of that monsieur de saintgre of whom we spoke she answered a wild lad a spendthrift a gambler if you like and yet he is a saintgre monsieur and i cannot refuse him it is the miniature of mademoiselle helene de saintgre the daughter of the marquis sent to mamselle toinette his sister from france how he has obtained it i know not  ah i exclaimed sharply the explanation of the scene of which i had been a witness coming to me swiftly the rascal had wrenched it from her in the gallery and fled  monsieur continued madame too excited to notice my interruption if i had four hundred livres i would buy it of him and monsieur de saintgre pere would willingly pay it back in the morning  i reflected i had a letter in my pocket to monsieur de saintgre the sum was not large and the act of monsieur auguste de saintgre in every light was detestable a rising anger decided me and i took a wallet from my pocket  i will buy the miniature madame i said  she looked at me in astonishment  god bless you monsieur she cried if you could see mamselle toinette you would pay twice the sum the whole town loves her monsieur auguste monsieur auguste she shouted here is a gentleman who will buy your miniature  the six young men stopped talking and stared at me with one accord madame arose and i followed her down the room towards them and had it not been for my indignation i should have felt sufficiently ridiculous young monsieur de saintgre came forward with the goodnatured easy insolence to which he had been born and looked me over  monsieur is an american he said  i understand that you have offered this miniature for four hundred livres i said  it is the jews price he answered mais pardieu what will you he added with a shrug i must have the money regardez monsieur you have a bargain here is mademoiselle helene de saintgre daughter of my lord the marquis of whom i have the honor to be a cousin and he made a bow it is by the famous court painter joseph boze and mademoiselle de saintgre herself is a favorite of her majesty he held the portrait close to the candle and regarded it critically mademoiselle helene victoire marie de saintgre painted in a costume of henry the seconds time with a ruff you notice which she wore at a ball given by his highness the prince of conde at chantilly a trifle haughty if you like monsieur but i venture to say you will be hopelessly in love with her within the hour  at this there was a general titter from the young gentlemen at the table  all of which is neither here nor there monsieur i answered sharply the question is purely a commercial one and has nothing to do with the ladys character or position  it is well said monsieur madame bouvet put in  monsieur auguste de saintgre shrugged his slim shoulders and laid down the portrait on the walnut table  four hundred livres monsieur he said  i counted out the money scrutinized by the curious eyes of his companions and pushed it over to him he bowed carelessly sat him down and began to shuffle the cards while i picked up the miniature and walked out of the room before i had gone twenty paces i heard them laughing at their game and shouting out the stakes suddenly i bethought myself of nick what if he should come in and discover the party at the table i stopped short in the hallway and there madame bouvet overtook me  how can i thank you monsieur she said and then you will return the portrait to monsieur de saintgre  i have a letter from monsieur gratiot to that gentleman which i shall deliver in the morning i answered and now madame i have a favor to ask of you  i am at monsieurs service she answered simply  when mr temple comes in he is not to go into that room i said pointing to the door of the saloon i have my reasons for requesting it  for answer madame went to the door closed it and turned the key then she sat down beside a little table with a candlestick and took up her knitting  it will be as monsieur says she answered  i smiled  and when mr temple comes in will you kindly say that i am waiting for him in his room i asked  as monsieur says she answered i wish monsieur a goodnight and pleasant dreams  she took a candlestick from the table lighted the candle and handed it me with a courtesy i bowed and made my way along the gallery above the deserted courtyard entering my room and closing the door after me i drew the miniature from my pocket and stood gazing at it for i know not how long    chapter xii les iles  i stood staring at the portrait i say with a kind of fascination that astonished me seeing that it had come to me in such a way it was no french face of my imagination and as i looked it seemed to me that i knew mademoiselle helene de saintgre and yet i smile as i write this realizing full well that my strange and foreign surroundings and my unforeseen adventure had much to do with my state of mind the lady in the miniature might have been eighteen or thirtyfive her features were of the clearest cut the nose the least trifle aquiline and by a blurred outline the painter had given to the black hair piled high upon the head a suggestion of waviness the eyebrows were straight the brown eyes looked at the world with an almost scornful sense of humor and i marked that there was determination in the chin here was a face that could be infinitely haughty or infinitely tender a mouth of wittynay perhaps cuttingrepartee of brevity and force a lady who spoke quickly moved quickly or reposed absolutely a person who commanded by nature and yet dare i venture the thought was capable of a supreme surrender i was aroused from this odd revery by footsteps on the gallery and nick burst into the room without pausing to look about him he flung himself lengthwise on the bed on top of the mosquito bar  a thousand curses on such a place he cried it is full of rat holes and rabbit warrens  did you catch your man i asked innocently  catch him said nick with a little excusable profanity he went in at one end of such a warren and came out at another i waited for him in two streets until an officious person chanced along and threatened to take me before the alcalde what the devil is that you have got in your hand davy he demanded raising his head  a miniature that took my fancy and which i bought  he rose from the bed yawned and taking it in his hand held it to the light i watched him curiously  lord he said it is such a passion as i might have suspected of you davy  there was nothing said about passion i answered  then why the deuce did you buy it he said with some pertinence  this staggered me  a man may fancy a thing without indulging in a passion i suppose i replied  nick held the picture at arms length in the palm of his hand and regarded it critically  faith said he you may thank heaven it is only a picture if such a one ever got hold of you davy she would general you even as you general me egad he added with a laugh there would be no more walking the streets at night in search of adventure for you consider carefully the masterful features of that lady and thank god you havent got her  i was inclined to be angry but ended by laughing  there will be no rivalry between us at least i said  rivalry exclaimed nick heaven forbid that i should aspire to such abject slavery when i marry it will be to command  all the more honor in such a conquest i suggested  davy said he i have long been looking for some such flaw in your insuperable wisdom but i vow i can keep my eyes open no longer benjy  a smothered response came from the other side of the wall and benjy duly appeared in the doorway blinking at the candlelight to put his master to bed  we slept that night with no bed covering save the mosquito bar as was the custom in new orleans indeed the heat was most oppressive but we had become to some extent inured to it on the boat and we were both in such sound health that our slumbers were not disturbed early in the morning however i was awakened by a negro song from the courtyard and i lay pleasantly for some minutes listening to the early sounds breathing in the aroma of coffee which mingled with the odor of the flowers of the court until zoey herself appeared in the doorway holding a cup in her hand i arose and taking the miniature from the table gazed at it in the yellow morning light and then having dressed myself i put it carefully in my pocket and sat down at my portfolio to compose a letter to polly ann knowing that a description of what i had seen in new orleans would amuse her this done i went out into the gallery where madame was already seated at her knitting in the shade of the great tree that stood in the corner of the court and spread its branches over the eaves she arose and courtesied with a questioning smile  madame i asked is it too early to present myself to monsieur de saintgre  pardieu no monsieur we are early risers in the south for we have our siesta you are going to return the portrait monsieur  i nodded  god bless you for the deed said she tenez monsieur she added stepping closer to me you will tell his father that you bought it from monsieur auguste  i saw that she had a soft spot in her heart for the rogue  i will make no promises madame i answered  she looked at me timidly appealingly but i bowed and departed the sun was riding up into the sky the walls already glowing with his heat and a midsummer languor seemed to pervade the streets as i walked along the shadows now were sharply defined the checkered foliage of the trees was flung in black against the yellowwhite wall of the house with the lions and the greenlatticed gallery which we had watched the night before seemed silent and deserted i knocked at the gate and presently a brightturbaned gardienne opened it  was monsieur de saintgre at home the gardienne looked me over and evidently finding me respectable replied with many protestations of sorrow that he was not that he had gone with mamselle very early that morning to his country place at les iles this information i extracted with difficulty for i was not by any means versed in the negro patois  as i walked back to madame bouvets i made up my mind that there was but the one thing to do to go at once to monsieur de saintgres plantation finding madame still waiting in the gallery i asked her to direct me thither  you have but to follow the road that runs southward along the levee and some three leagues will bring you to it monsieur you will inquire for monsieur de saintgre  can you direct me to mr daniel clarks i asked  the american merchant and banker the friend and associate of the great general wilkinson whom you sent down to us last year certainly monsieur he will no doubt give you better advice than i on this matter  i found mr clark in his countingroom and i had not talked with him five minutes before i began to suspect that if a treasonable understanding existed between wilkinson and the spanish government mr clark was innocent of it he being the only prominent american in the place it was natural that wilkinson should have formed with him a business arrangement to care for the cargoes he sent down indeed after we had sat for some time chatting together mr clark began himself to make guarded inquiries on this very subject did i know wilkinson how was his enterprise of selling kentucky products regarded at home but i do not intend to burden this story with accounts of a matter which though it has never been wholly clear has been long since fairly settled in the public mind mr clark was most amiable accepted my statement that i was travelling for pleasure and honored monsieur chouteaus bon for my purchase of the miniature had deprived me of nearly all my ready money and said that mr temple and i would need horses to get to les iles  and unless you purpose going back to kentucky by keel boat or round by sea to philadelphia or new york and cross the mountains he said you will need good horses for your journey through natchez and the cumberland country there is a consignment of spanish horses from the westward just arrived in town he added and i shall be pleased to go with you to the place where they are sold i shall not presume to advise a kentuckian on such a purchase  the horses were crowded together under a dirty shed near the levee and the vessel from which they had been landed rode at anchor in the river they were the scrawny tough ponies of the plains reasonably cheap and it took no great discernment on my part to choose three of the strongest and most intelligent looking we went next to a saddlers where i selected three saddles and bridles of spanish workmanship and mr clark agreed to have two of his servants meet us with the horses before madame bouvets within the hour he begged that we would dine with him when we returned from les iles  you will not find an island mr ritchie he said saintgres plantation is a huge block of land between the river and a cypress swamp behind saintgre is a man with a wonderful quality of mind who might like his ancestors have made his mark if necessity had probed him or opportunity offered he never forgave the spanish government for the murder of his father nor do i blame him he has his troubles his son is an incurable rake and degenerate as you may have heard  i went back to madame bouvets to find nick emerging from his toilet  what deviltry have you been up to davy he demanded  i have been to the house of the lions to see your divinity i answered and in a very little while horses will be here to carry us to her  what do you mean he asked grasping me by both shoulders  i mean that we are going to her fathers plantation some way down the river  on my honor davy i did not suspect you of so much enterprise he cried and her husband  does not exist i replied perhaps after all i might be able to give you instruction in the conduct of an adventure the man you chased with such futility was her brother and he stole from her the miniature of which i am now the fortunate possessor  he stared at me for a moment in rueful amazement  and her name he demanded  antoinette de saintgre i answered our letter is to her father  he made me a rueful bow  i fear that i have undervalued you mr ritchie he said you have no peer i am unworthy to accompany you and furthermore it would be useless  and why useless i inquired laughing  you have doubtless seen the lady and she is yours said he  you forget that i am in love with a miniature i said  in half an hour we were packed and ready the horses had arrived we bade goodby to madame bouvet and rode down the miry street until we reached the road behind the levee turning southward we soon left behind the shaded esplanade and the citys roofs below us and came to the first of the plantation houses set back amidst the dark foliage no tremor shook the fringe of moss that hung from the heavy boughs so still was the day and an indefinable milky haze stretched between us and the cloudless sky above the suns rays pierced it and gathered fire the mighty river beside us rolled listless and sullen flinging back the heat defiantly and on our left was a tropical forest in all its bewildering luxuriance the liveoak the hackberry the myrtle the spanish bayonet in bristling groups and the shaded places gave out a scented moisture like an orangery anon we passed fields of corn and cotton swamps of rice stretches of povertystricken indigo plants gnawed to the stem by the pest our ponies ambled on unmindful but nick vowed that no woman under heaven would induce him to undertake such a journey again  some three miles out of the city we descried two figures on horseback coming towards us and quickly perceived that one was a gentleman the other his black servant they were riding at a more rapid pace than the day warranted but the gentleman reined in his sweating horse as he drew near to us eyed us with a curiosity tempered by courtesy bowed gravely and put his horse to a canter again  phew said nick twisting in his saddle i thought that all creoles were lazy  we have met the exception perhaps i answered did you take in that man  his looks were a little remarkable come to think of it answered nick settling down into his saddle again  indeed the mans face had struck me so forcibly that i was surprised out of an inquiry which i had meant to make of him namely how far we were from the saintgre plantation we pursued our way slowly from time to time catching a glimpse of a dwelling almost hid in the distant foliage until at length we came to a place a little more pretentious than those which we had seen from the road a graceful flight of wooden steps climbed the levee and descended on the far side to a boat landing and a straight vista cut through the grove lined by wild orange trees disclosed the white pillars and galleries of a faraway plantation house the grassy path leading through the vista was trimly kept and on either side of it in the moist green shade of the great trees flowers bloomed in a profusion of startling colorsin splotches of scarlet and white and royal purple  nick slipped from his horse  behold the mansion of mademoiselle de saintgre said he waving his hand up the vista  how do you know i asked  i am told by a part of me that never lies davy he answered laying his hand upon his heart and besides he added i should dislike devilishly to go too far on such a day and have to come back again  we will rest here i said laughing and send in benjy to find out  davy he answered with withering contempt you have no more romance in you than a turnip we will go ourselves and see what befalls  very well then i answered falling in with his humor we will go ourselves  he brushed his face with his handkerchief gave himself a pull here and a pat there and led the way down the alley but we had not gone far before he turned into a path that entered the grove on the right and to this likewise i made no protest we soon found ourselves in a heavenly spotsheltered from the suns rays by a dense verdureand no one who has not visited these southern country places can know the teeming fragrance there one shrub how well i recall it was like unto the perfume of all the flowers and all the fruits the very essence of the delicious languor of the place that made our steps to falter a bird shot a bright flame of color through the checkered light ahead of us suddenly a sound brought us to a halt and we stood in a tense and wondering silence the words of a song sung carelessly in a clear girlish voice came to us from beyond            je voudrais bien me marier           je voudrais bien me marier           mais jai qrand peur de me tromper           mais jai grand peur de me tromper              ils sont si malhonnetes              ma luron ma lurette              ils sont si malhonnetes              ma luron ma lure  we have come at the very zenith of opportunity i whispered  hush he said            je ne veux pas dun avocat           je ne veux pas dun avocat           car ils aiment trop les ducats           car ils aiment trop les ducats              ils trompent les fillettes              ma luron ma lurette              ils trompent les fillettes              ma luron ma lure  eliminating mr ritchie i believe said nick turning on me with a grimace but hark again            je voudrais bien dun officier           je voudrais bien dun officier           je marcherais a pas carres           je marcherais a pas carres              dans ma joli chambrette              ma luron ma lurette              dans ma joli chambrette              ma luron ma lure  the song ceased with a sound that was half laughter half sigh before i realized what he was doing nick instead of retracing his steps towards the house started forward the path led through a dense thicket which became a casino hedge and suddenly i found myself peering over his shoulder into a little garden bewildering in color in the centre of the garden a great liveoak spread its sheltering branches around the gnarled trunk was a seat and on the seather sewing fallen into her lap her lips parted her eyes staring wide sat the young lady whom we had seen on the levee the evening before and nick was making a bow in his grandest manner  helas mademoiselle he said je ne suis pas officier mais on peut arranger tout cela sans doute  my breath was taken away by this unheardof audacity and i braced myself against screams flight and other feminine demonstrations of terror the young lady did nothing of the kind she turned her back to us leaned against the tree and to my astonishment i saw her slim shoulders shaken with laughter at length very slowly she looked around and in her face struggled curiosity and fear and merriment nick made another bow worthy of versailles and she gave a frightened little laugh  you are english messieursyes she ventured  we were once cried nick but we have changed mademoiselle  et quoi donc relapsing into her own language  americans said he allow me to introduce to you the honorable david ritchie whom you rejected a few moments ago  whom i rejected she exclaimed  alas said nick with a commiserating glance at me he has the misfortune to be a lawyer  mademoiselle shot at me the swiftest and shyest of glances and turned to us once more her quivering shoulders there was a brief silence  mademoiselle said nick taking a step on the garden path  monsieur she answered without so much as looking around  what now would you take this gentleman to be he asked with an insistence not to be denied  again she was shaken with laughter and suddenly to my surprise she turned and looked full at me  in english monsieur you call ita gallant  my face fairly tingled and i heard nick laughing with unseemly merriment  ah mademoiselle he cried you are a judge of character and you have read him perfectly  then i must leave you messieurs she answered with her eyes in her lap but she made no move to go  you need have no fear of mr ritchie mademoiselle answered nick instantly i am here to protect you against his gallantry  this time nick received the glance and quailed before it  and whopar exempleis to protect me againstyou monsieur she asked in the lowest of voices  you forget that i too am unprotectedand vulnerable mademoiselle he answered  her face was hidden again but not for long  how did you come she demanded presently  on air he answered for we saw you in new orleans yesterday  andwhy  need you ask mademoiselle said the rogue and then with more effrontery than ever he began to sing           je voudrais bien me marier           je voudrais bien me marier           mais jai grand peur de me tromper  she rose her sewing falling to the ground and took a few startled steps towards us  monsieur you will be heard she cried  and put out of the garden of eden said nick  i must leave you she said with the quaintest of english pronunciation  yet she stood irresolute in the garden path a picture against the dark green leaves and the flowers her age might have been seventeen her gown was of some soft and light material printed in buds of delicate color her slim arms bare above the elbow she had the ivory complexion of the province more delicate than i had yet seen and beyond that i shall not attempt to describe her save to add that she was such a strange mixture of innocence and ingenuousness and coquetry as i had not imagined presently her gaze was fixed seriously on me  do you think it very wrong monsieur she asked  i was more than taken aback by this tribute  oh cried nick the arbiter of etiquette  since i am here mademoiselle i answered with anything but readiness i am not a proper judge  her next question staggered me  you are wellborn she asked  mr ritchies grandfather was a scottish earl said nick immediately a piece of news that startled me into protest it is true davy though you may not know it he added  and you monsieur she said to nick  i am his cousinis it not honor enough said he  yet you do not resemble one another  mr ritchie has all the good looks in the family said nick  oh cried the young lady and this time she gave us her profile  come mademoiselle said nick since the fates have cast the die let us all sit down in the shade the place was made for us  monsieur she cried giving back i have never in my life been alone with gentlemen  but mr ritchie is a duenna to satisfy the most exacting said nick when you know him better you will believe me  she laughed softly and glanced at me by this time we were all three under the branches  monsieur you do not understand the french customs mon dieu if the good sister lorette could see me now  but she is safe in the convent said nick are they going to put glass on the walls  and why asked mademoiselle innocently  because said nick because a very bad man has come to new orleansone who is given to climbing walls  you  yes but when i found that a certain demoiselle had left the convent i was no longer anxious to climb them  and how did you know that i had left it  i was at a loss to know whether this were coquetry or innocence  because i saw you on the levee said nick  you saw me on the levee she repeated giving back  and i had a great fear the rogue persisted  a fear of what  a fear that you were married he said with a boldness that made me blush as for mademoiselle a color that vied with the june roses charged through her cheeks she stooped to pick up her sewing but nick was before her  and why did you think me married she asked in a voice so low that we scarcely heard  faith said nick because you seemed to be quarrelling with a man  she turned to him with an irresistible seriousness  and is that your idea of marriage monsieur  this time it was i who laughed for he had been hit very fairly  mademoiselle said he i did not for a moment think it could have been a love match  mademoiselle turned away and laughed  you are the very strangest man i have ever seen she said  shall i give you my notion of a love match mademoiselle said nick  i should think you might be well versed in the subject monsieur she answered speaking to the tree but here is scarcely the time and place she wound up her sewing and faced him i must really leave you she said  he took a step towards her and stood looking down into her face her eyes dropped  and am i never to see you again he asked  monsieur she cried softly i do not know who you are she made him a courtesy took a few steps in the opposite path and turned that depends upon your ingenuity she added you seem to have no lack of it monsieur  nick was transported  you must not go he cried  must not how dare you speak to me thus monsieur then she tempered it there is a lady here whom i love and who is ill i must not be long from her bedside  she is very ill said nick probably for want of something better  she is not really ill monsieur but depressedis not that the word she is a very dear friend and she has had troubleso much monsieurand my mother brought her here we love her as one of the family  this was certainly ingenuous and it was plain that the girl gave us this story through a certain nervousness for she twisted her sewing in her fingers as she spoke  mademoiselle said nick i would not keep you from such an errand of mercy  she gave him a grateful look more dangerous than any which had gone before  and besides he went on we have come to stay awhile with you mr ritchie and myself  you have come to stay awhile she said  i thought it time that the farce were ended  we have come with letters to your father monsieur de saintgre mademoiselle i said and i should like very much to see him if he is at leisure  mademoiselle stared at me in unfeigned astonishment  but did you not meet him monsieur she demanded he left an hour ago for new orleans you must have met a gentleman riding very fast  it was my turn to be astonished  but that was not your father i exclaimed  et pourquoi non she said  is not your father the stout gentleman whom i saw with you on the levee last evening i asked  she laughed  you have been observing monsieur she said that was my uncle monsieur de beausejour you saw me quarrelling with my brother auguste she went on a little excitedly oh i am very much ashamed of it i was so angry my cousin mademoiselle helene de saintgre has just sent me from france such a beautiful miniature and auguste fell in love with it  fell in love with it i exclaimed involuntarily  you should see it monsieur and i think you also would fall in love with it  i have not a doubt of it said nick  mademoiselle made the faintest of moues  auguste is very wild as you say she continued addressing me he is a great care to my father he intrigues you know he wishes louisiane to become french once moreas we all do but i should not say this monsieur she added in a startled tone you will not tell no i know you will not we do not like the spaniards they killed my grandfather when they came to take the province and once the governorgeneral miro sent for my father and declared he would put auguste in prison if he did not behave himself but i have forgotten the miniature when auguste saw that he fell in love with it and now he wishes to go to france and obtain a commission through our cousin the marquis of saintgre and marry mademoiselle helene  a comprehensive programme indeed said nick  my father has gone back to new orleans she said to get the miniature from auguste he took it from me monsieur she raised her head a little proudly if my brother had asked it i might have given it to him though i treasured it but auguste is soimpulsive my uncle told my father who is very angry he will punish auguste severely andi do not like to have him punished oh i wish i had the miniature  your wish is granted mademoiselle i answered drawing the case from my pocket and handing it to her  she took it staring at me with eyes wide with wonder and then she opened it mechanically  monsieur she said with great dignity do you mind telling me where you obtained this  i found it mademoiselle i answered and as i spoke i felt nicks fingers on my arm  you found it where how monsieur  at madame bouvets the house where we stayed  oh she said with a sigh of relief he must have dropped it it is there where he meets his associates where they talk of the french louisiane  again i felt nick pinching me and i gave a sigh of relief mademoiselle was about to continue but i interrupted her  how long will your father be in new orleans mademoiselle i asked  until he finds auguste she answered it may be days but he will stay for he is very angry but will you not come into the house messieurs and be presented to my mother she asked i have been veryinhospitable she added with a glance at nick  we followed her through winding paths bordered by shrubs and flowers and presently came to a low house surrounded by a wide cool gallery and shaded by spreading trees behind it were clustered the kitchens and quarters of the house servants mademoiselle picking up her dress ran up the steps ahead of us and turned to the left in the hall into a darkened parlor the floor was bare save for a few mats and in the corner was a massive escritoire of mahogany with carved feet and there were tables and chairs of a like pattern it was a room of more distinction than i had seen since i had been in charlestown and reflected the solidity of its owners  if you will be so kind as to wait here messieurs said mademoiselle i will call my mother  and she left us  i sat down rather uncomfortably but nick took a stand and stood staring down at me with folded arms  how i have undervalued you davy he said  i am not proud of it i answered shortly  what the deuce is to do now he asked  i cannot linger here i answered i have business with monsieur de saintgre and i must go back to new orleans at once  then i will wait for you said nick davy i have met my fate  i laughed in spite of myself  it seems to me that i have heard that remark before i answered  he had not time to protest for we heard footsteps in the hall and mademoiselle entered leading an older lady by the hand in the light of the doorway i saw that she was thin and small and yellow but her features had a regularity and her mien a dignity which made her impressing which would have convinced a stranger that she was a person of birth and breeding her hair tinged with gray was crowned by a lace cap  madame i said bowing and coming forward i am david ritchie from kentucky and this is my cousin mr temple of charlestown monsieur gratiot and colonel chouteau of st louis have been kind enough to give us letters to monsieur de saintgre and i handed her one of the letters which i had ready  you are very welcome messieurs she answered with the same delightful accent which her daughter had used and you are especially welcome from such a source the friends of colonel chouteau and of monsieur gratiot are our friends you will remain with us i hope messieurs she continued monsieur de saintgre will return in a few days at best  by your leave madame i will go to new orleans at once and try to find monsieur i said for i have business with him  you will return with him i hope said madame  i bowed  and mr temple will remain she asked with a questioning look at nick  with the greatest pleasure in the world madame he answered and there was no mistaking his sincerity as he spoke mademoiselle turned her back on him  i would not wait for dinner but pausing only for a sip of cool madeira and some other refreshment i made my farewells to the ladies as i started out of the door to find benjy who had been waiting for more than an hour mademoiselle gave me a neatly folded note  you will be so kind as to present that to my father monsieur she said    chapter xiii monsieur auguste entrapped  it may be well to declare here and now that i do not intend to burden this story with the business which had brought me to new orleans while in the city during the next few days i met a young gentleman named daniel clark a nephew of that mr clark of whom i have spoken many years after the time of which i write this mr daniel clark the younger who became a rich merchant and an able man of affairs published a book which sets forth with great clearness proofs of general wilkinsons duplicity and treason and these may be read by any who would satisfy himself further on the subject mr wharton had not believed nor had i flattered myself that i should be able to bring such a fox as general wilkinson to earth abundant circumstantial evidence i obtained wilkinsons intimacy with miro was well known and i likewise learned that a cipher existed between them the permit to trade given by miro to wilkinson was made no secret of in brief i may say that i discovered as much as could be discovered by any one without arousing suspicion and that the information with which i returned to kentucky was of some material value to my employers  i have to thank monsieur philippe de st gre for a great deal and i take this opportunity to set down the fact that i have rarely met a more remarkable man  as i rode back to town alone a whitish film was spread before the sun and ere i had come in sight of the fortifications the low forest on the western bank was a dark green blur against the sky the esplanade on the levee was deserted the willow trees had a mournful look while the bright tiles of yesterday seemed to have faded to a sombre tone i spied xavier on a bench smoking with some friends of his  he make much rain soon michie he cried you hev good time i hope michie  i waved my hand and rode on past the place darmes with its white diagonal bands strapping its green like a soldiers front and as i drew up before the gate of the house of the lions the warning taps of the storm were drumming on the magnolia leaves the same gardienne came to my knock and in answer to her shrill cry a negro lad appeared to hold my horse i was ushered into a brickpaved archway that ran under the latticed gallery toward a flowerfilled courtyard but ere we reached this the gardienne turned to the left up a flight of steps with a delicate balustrade which led to an open gallery above and there stood the gentleman whom we had met hurrying to town in the morning a gentleman he was every inch of him he was dressed in black silk his hair in a cue and drawn away from a face of remarkable features he had a highbridged nose a black eye that held an inquiring sternness a chin indented and a receding forehead his stature was indeterminable in brief he might have stood for one of those persons of birth and ability who become prime ministers of france  monsieur de st gre i said  he bowed gracefully but with a tinge of condescension i was awed and considering the relations which i had already had with his family i must admit that i was somewhat frightened  monsieur i said i bring letters to you from monsieur gratiot and colonel chouteau of st louis one of these i had the honor to deliver to madame de st gre and here is the other  ah he said with another keen glance i met you this morning did i not  you did monsieur  he broke the seal and going to the edge of the gallery held the letter to the light as he read a peal of thunder broke distantly the rain came down in a flood then he folded the paper carefully and turned to me again  you will make my house your home mr ritchie he said recommended from such a source i will do all i can to serve you but where is this mr temple of whom the letter speaks his family in charlestown is known to me by repute  by madame de st gres invitation he remained at les iles i answered speaking above the roar of the rain  i was just going to the table said monsieur de st gre we will talk as we eat  he led the way into the dining room and as i stood on the threshold a bolt of great brilliancy lighted its yellowwashed floor and walnut furniture of a staid pattern a deafening crash followed as we took our seats while monsieur de st gres man lighted four candles of green myrtleberry wax  monsieur gratiots letter speaks vaguely of politics mr ritchie began monsieur de st gre he spoke english perfectly save for an occasional harsh aspiration which i cannot imitate  directing his man to fetch a certain kind of madeira he turned to me with a look of polite inquiry which was scarcely reassuring and i reflected the caution with which i had been endowed coming uppermost that the man might have changed since monsieur gratiot had seen him he had moreover the air of a man who gives a forced attention which seemed to me the natural consequences of the recent actions of his son  i fear that i am intruding upon your affairs monsieur i answered  not at all sir he said politely i have met that charming gentleman mr wilkinson who came here to brush away the causes of dissension and cement a friendship between kentucky and louisiana  it was most fortunate that the note of irony did not escape me  where governments failed general wilkinson succeeded i answered dryly  monsieur de st gre glanced at me and an enigmatical smile spread over his face i knew then that the ice was cracked between us yet he was too much a man of the world not to make one more tentative remark  a union between kentucky and louisiana would be a resistless force in the world mr ritchie he said  it was nebuchadnezzar who dreamed of a composite image monsieur i answered and mr wilkinson forgets one thingthat kentucky is a part of the united states  at that monsieur st gre laughed outright he became a different man though he lost none of his dignity  i should have had more faith in my old friend gratiot he said but you will pardon me if i did not recognize at once the statesman he had sent me mr ritchie  it was my turn to laugh  monsieur he went on returning to that dignity of mien which marked him my political opinions are too well known that i should make a mystery of them to you i was born a frenchman i shall die a frenchman and i shall never be happy until louisiana is french once more my greatgrandfather a brother of the marquis de st gre of that time and a wild blade enough came out with diberville his son my grandfather was the commissarygeneral of the colony under the marquis de vaudreuil he sent me to france for my education where i was introduced at court by my kinsman the old marquis who took a fancy to me and begged me to remain it was my fathers wish that i should return and i did not disobey him i had scarcely come back monsieur when that abominable secret bargain of louis the fifteenth became known ceding louisiana to spain you may have heard of the revolution which followed here it was a mild affair and the remembrance of it makes me smile to this day though with bitterness i was five and twenty hotheaded and french que voulezvous and monsieur de st gre shrugged his shoulders oreilly the famous spanish general came with his menofwar well i remember the days we waited with leaden hearts for the menofwar to come up from the english turn and i can see now the cannon frowning from the ports the grim spars the high poops crowded with officers the great anchors splashing the yellow water i can hear the chains running the ships were in line of battle before the town their flying bridges swung to the levee and they loomed above us like towering fortresses it was dark monsieur such as this afternoon and we poor french colonists stood huddled in the open space below waiting for we knew not what  he paused and i started for the picture he drew had carried me out of myself  on the 18th of august 1769well i remember the day monsieur de st gre continued the spanish troops landed late in the afternoon twentysix hundred strong the artillery rumbling over the bridges the horses wheeling and rearing and they drew up as in line of battle in the place darmesdragoons fusileros de montanas light and heavy infantry where were our white cockades then fifty guns shook the town the great oreilly limped ashore through the smoke and louisiana was lost to france we had a cowardly governor monsieur whose name is written in the annals of the province in letters of shame he betrayed monsieur de st gre and others into oreillys hands and when my father was cast into prison he was seized with such a fit of anger that he died  monsieur de st gre was silent without under the eaves of the gallery a white rain fell and a steaming moisture arose from the courtyard  what i have told you monsieur is common knowledge louisiana has been spanish for twenty years i no longer wear the white cockade for i am older now he smiled strange things are happening in france and the old order to which i belong he straightened perceptibly seems to be tottering i have ceased to intrigue but thank god i have not ceased to pray perhapswho knowsperhaps i may live to see again the lily of france stirred by the river breeze  he fell into a revery his fine head bent a little but presently aroused himself and eyed me curiously i need not say that i felt a strange liking for monsieur de st gre  and now mr ritchie he said will you tell me who you are and how i can serve you  the servant had put the coffee on the table and left the room monsieur de st gre himself poured me a cup from the dainty quaintly wrought louis quinze coffeepot graven with the coat of arms of his family as we sat talking my admiration for my host increased for i found that he was familiar not only with the situation in kentucky but that he also knew far more than i of the principles and personnel of the new government of which general washington was president that he had little sympathy with government by the people was natural for he was a creole and behind that a member of an order which detested republics when we were got beyond these topics the rain had ceased the night had fallen the green candles had burned low and suddenly as he spoke of les isles i remembered the note mademoiselle had given me for him and i apologized for my forgetfulness he read it and dropped it with an exclamation  my daughter tells me that you have returned to her a miniature which she lost monsieur he said  i had that pleasure i answered  and thatyou found this miniature at madame bouvets was this the case and he stared hard at me  i nodded but for the life of me i could not speak it seemed an outrage to lie to such a man he did not answer but sat lost in thought drumming with his fingers on the tables until the noise of the slamming of a door aroused him to a listening posture the sound of subdued voices came from the archway below us and one of these from an occasional excited and feminine note i thought to be the gardiennes monsieur de st gre thrust back his chair and in three strides was at the edge of the gallery  auguste he cried  silence  auguste come up to me at once he said in french  another silence then something that sounded like sapristi a groan from the gardienne and a step was heard on the stairway my own discomfort increased and i would have given much to be in any other place in the world auguste had arrived at the head of the steps but was apparently unable to get any farther  bon soir mon pere he said  like a dutiful son said monsieur de st gre you heard i was in town and called to pay your respects i am sure i am delighted to find you in fact i came to town for that purpose  lisette began auguste  thought that i did not wish to be disturbed no doubt said his father walk in auguste  monsieur augustes slim figure appeared in the doorway he caught sight of me halted backed and stood staring with widened eyes the candles threw their light across his shoulder on the face of the elder monsieur de st gre auguste was a replica of his father with the features minimized to regularity and the brow narrowed the complexion of the one was a clear saffron while the boys skin was mottled and he was not twenty  what is the matter said monsieur de st gre  youyou have a visitor stammered auguste with a tact that savored of practice yet there was a sorry difference between this and the haughty young patrician who had sold me the miniature  who brings me good news said monsieur de st gre in english mr ritchie allow me to introduce my son auguste  i felt monsieur de st gres eyes on me as i bowed and i began to think i was in near as great a predicament as auguste monsieur de st gre was managing the matter with infinite wisdom  sit down my son he said you have no doubt been staying with your uncle auguste sat down still staring  does your aunts health mend  she is better tonight father said the son in english which might have been improved  i am glad of it said monsieur de st gre taking a chair andre fill the glasses  the silent linenclad mulatto poured out the madeira shot a look at auguste and retired softly  there has been a heavy rain monsieur said monsieur de st gre to me but i think the air is not yet cleared i was about to say mr ritchie when my son called to pay his respects that the miniature of which we were speaking is one of the most remarkable paintings i have ever seen augustes thin fingers were clutching the chair i have never beheld mademoiselle helene de st gre for my cousin the marquis was not married when i left france he was a captain in a regiment of his majestys mousquetaires since abolished but i am sure that the likeness of mademoiselle must be a true one for it has the stamp of a remarkable personality though helene can be only eighteen women with us mature quickly monsieur and this portrait tallies with what i have heard of her character you no doubt observed the face monsieurthat of a true aristocrat but i was speaking of her character when she was twelve she said something to a cardinal for which her mother made her keep her room a whole day for mademoiselle would not retract and pardieu i believe his eminence was wrong the marquise is afraid of her and when first helene was presented formally she made such a witty retort to the queens sally that her majesty insisted upon her coming to court on every new years day i have always sent a present of coffee and perique to my cousin the marquis and it is mademoiselle who writes to thank us parole dhonneur her letters make me see again the people amongst whom she movesthe dukes and duchesses the cardinals bishops and generals she draws them to the life monsieur with a touch that makes them all ridiculous his majesty does not escape god forgive him he is indeed an amiable weak person for calling a states general and the queen a frivolous lady but true to those whom she loves and beginning now to realize the perils of the situation he paused is it any wonder that auguste has fallen in love with his cousin monsieur that he loses his head forgets that he is a gentleman and steals her portrait from his sister  had i not been so occupied with my own fate in the outcome of this inquisition i should have been sorry for auguste and yet this feeling could not have lasted for the young gentleman sprang to his feet cast a glance at me which was not without malignance and faced his father his lips twitching with anger and fear monsieur de st gre sat undisturbed  he is so much in love with the portrait monsieur that he loses it  loses it cried auguste  precisely said his father dryly for mr ritchie tells me he found itat madame bouvets was it not monsieur  auguste looked at me  mille diables he said and sat down again heavily  mr ritchie has returned it to your sister a service which puts him heavily in our debt said monsieur de st gre now sir he added to me rising you have had a tiresome day i will show you to your room and in the morning we will begin ourinvestigations  he clapped his hands the silent mulatto appeared with a new candle and i followed my host down the gallery to a room which he flung open at the far end a great fourposter bedstead was in one corner and a polished mahogany dresser in the other  we have saved some of our family furniture from the fire mr ritchie said monsieur de st gre that bed was brought from paris by my father forty years ago i hope you will rest well  he set the candle on the table and as he bowed there was a trace of an enigmatical smile about his mouth how much he knew of augustes transaction i could not fathom but the matter and the scarcely creditable part i had played in it kept me awake far into the night i was just falling into a troubled sleep when a footstep on the gallery startled me back to consciousness it was followed by a light tap on the door  monsieur reetchie said a voice  it was monsieur auguste he was not an imposing figure in his nightrail and by the light of the carefully shaded candle he held in his hand i saw that he had hitherto deceived me in the matter of his calves he stood peering at me as i lay under the mosquito bar  how is it i can thank you monsieur he exclaimed in a whisper  by saying nothing monsieur i answered  you are noble you are generous andand one day i will give you the money back he added with a burst of magniloquence you have behave very well monsieur and i mek you my friend behol auguste de st gre entirely at your service monsieur he made a sweeping bow that might have been impressive save for the nightrail and sought my hand which he grasped in a fold of the mosquito bar  i am overcome monsieur i said  monsieur reetchie you are my friend my intimate he put an aspirate on the word i go to tell you one leetle secret i find that i can repose confidence in you my father does not understan me you saw monsieur he does not appreciatethat is the engleesh mon dieu you saw it this night i who spik to you am made for a courtier a noble i have the gift la louisianeshe is not so big enough for me he lowered his voice still further and bent nearer to me monsieur i run away to france my cousin the marquis will help me you will hear of auguste de st gre at versailles at trianon at chantilly and peutetre  it is a worthy campaign monsieur i interrupted  a distant sound broke the stillness and auguste was near to dropping the candle on me  adieu monsieur he whispered milles tonneres i have done one extraordinaire foolish thing when i am come to this house tonight  and he disappeared shading his candle as he had come    chapter xiv retribution  during the next two days i had more evidence of monsieur de st gres ability and thanks to his conduct of my campaign not the least suspicion of my mission to new orleans got abroad certain gentlemen were asked to dine we called on others and met still others casually in their haunts of business or pleasure i was troubled because of the inconvenience and discomfort to which my host put himself for new orleans in the dogdays may be likened in climate to the under side of the lid of a steam kettle but at length on the second evening after we had supped on jambalaya and rice cakes and other dainties and the last guest had gone my host turned to me  the rest of the burrow is the same mr ritchie until it comes to the light again  and the fox has crawled out of the other end i said  precisely he answered laughing in short if you were to remain in new orleans until new years you would not learn a whit more tomorrow morning i have a little business of my own to transact and we shall get to les iles in time for dinner no dont thank me he protested theres a certain rough honesty and earnestness ingrained in you which i like and besides he added smiling you are poor indeed at thanking mr ritchie you could never do it gracefully but if ever i were in trouble i believe that i might safely call on you  the next day was a rare one for a wind from somewhere had blown the moisture away a little the shadows were clearer cut and by noon monsieur de st gre and i were walking our horses in the shady road behind the levee we were followed at a respectful distance by andre monsieurs mulatto bodyservant and as we rode my companion gave me stories of the owners of the different plantations we passed and spoke of many events of interest in the history of the colony presently he ceased to talk and rode in silence for many minutes and then he turned upon me suddenly  mr ritchie he said you have seen my son it may be that in him i am paying the price of my sins i have done everything to set him straight but in vain monsieur every son of the st gres has awakened sooner or later to a sense of what becomes him but auguste is a fool he cried bitterlya statement which i could not deny were it not for my daughter antoinette i should be a miserable man indeed  inasmuch as he was not a person of confidences i felt the more flattered that he should speak so plainly to me and i had a great sympathy for this strong man who could not help himself  you have observed antoinette mr ritchie he continued she is a strange mixture of wilfulness and caprice and selfsacrifice and she has at times a bit of that wit which has made our house for generations the intimatesi may sayof sovereigns  this peculiar pride of race would have amused me in another man i found myself listening to monsieur de st gre with gravity and i did not dare to reply that i had had evidence of mademoiselles aptness of retort  she has been my companion since she was a child monsieur she has disobeyed me flaunted me nursed me in illness championed me behind my back i have a little book which i have kept of her sayings and doings which may interest you monsieur i will show it you  this indeed was a new side of monsieur de st gre and i reflected rather ruefully upon the unvarnished truth of what mr wharton had told meay and what colonel clark had emphasized long before it was my fate never to be treated as a young man it struck me that monsieur de st gre had never even considered me in the light of a possible suitor for his daughters hand  i should be delighted to see them monsieur i answered  would you he exclaimed his face lighting up as he glanced at me alas madame de st gre and i have promised to go to our neighbors monsieur and madame bertrands for tonight but tomorrow if you have leisure we shall look at it together and not a word of this to my daughter monsieur he added apprehensively she would never forgive me she dislikes my talking of her but at times i cannot help it it was only last year that she was very angry with me and would not speak to me for days because i boasted of her having watched at the bedside of a poor gentleman who came here and got the fever you will not tell her  indeed i shall not monsieur i answered  it is strange he said abruptly it is strange that this gentleman and his wife should likewise have had letters to us from monsieur gratiot they came from st louis and they were on their way to paris  to paris i cried what was their name  he looked at me in surprise  clive he said  clive i cried leaning towards him in my saddle clive and what became of them  this time he gave me one of his searching looks and it was not unmixed with astonishment  why do you ask monsieur he demanded did you know them  i must have shown that i was strangely agitated for the moment i could not answer  monsieur gratiot himself spoke of them to me i said after a little he said they were an interesting couple  pardieu exclaimed monsieur de st gre he put it mildly he gave me another look there was something about them monsieur which i could not fathom why were they drifting they were people of quality who had seen the world who were by no means paupers who had no cause to travel save a certain restlessness and while they were awaiting the sailing of the packet for france they came to our housethe old one in the rue bourbon that was burned i would not speak ill of the dead but mr clive i did not like he fell sick of the fever in my house and it was there that antoinette and madame de st gre took turns with his wife in watching at his bedside i could do nothing with antoinette monsieur and she would not listen to my entreaties my prayers my commands we buried the poor fellow in the alien ground for he did not die in the church and after that my daughter clung to mrs clive she would not let her go and the packet sailed without her i have never seen such affection i may say he added quickly that madame de st gre and i share in it for mrs clive is a lovable woman and a strong character and into the great sorrow that lies behind her life we have never probed  and she is with you now monsieur i asked  she lives with us monsieur he answered simply and i hope for always no he said quickly it is not charityshe has something of her own we love her and she is the best of companions for my daughter for the rest monsieur she seems benumbed with no desire to go back or to go farther  an entrance drive to the plantation of les iles unknown to nick and me led off from the main road like a green tunnel arched out of the forest my feelings as we entered this may be imagined for i was suddenly confronted with the situation which i had dreaded since my meeting with nick at jonesboro i could scarcely allow myself even the faint hope that mrs clive might not prove to be mrs temple after all whilst i was in this agony of doubt and indecision the drive suddenly came out on a shaded lawn dotted with flowering bushes there was the house with its gallery its curved dormer roof and its belvedere and a white girlish figure flitted down the steps it was mademoiselle antoinette and no sooner had her father dismounted than she threw herself into his arms forgetful of my presence he stood murmuring in her ear like a lover and as i watched them my trouble slipped from my mind and gave place to a vaguer regret that i had been a wanderer throughout my life presently she turned up to him a face on which was written something which he could not understand his own stronger features reflected a vague disquiet  what is it ma cherie  what was it indeed something was in her eyes which bore a message and presentiment to me she dropped them fastening in the lapel of his coat a flaunting red flower set against a shining leaf and there was a gentle joyous subterfuge in her answer  thou pardoned auguste as i commanded she said they were speaking in the familiar french  ha diable is it that which disquiets thee said her father we will not speak of auguste dost thou know monsieur ritchie toinette  she disengaged herself and dropped me a courtesy her eyes seeking the ground but she said not a word at that instant madame de st gre herself appeared on the gallery followed by nick who came down the steps with a careless selfconfidence to greet the master indeed a stranger might have thought that mr temple was the host and i saw antoinette watching him furtively with a gleam of amusement in her eyes  i am delighted to see you at last monsieur said my cousin i am nicholas temple and i have been your guest for three days  had monsieur de st gre been other than the soul of hospitality it would have been impossible not to welcome such a guest our host had in common with his daughter a sense of humor there was a quizzical expression on his fine face as he replied with the barest glance at mademoiselle antoinette  i trust you have beenwell entertained mr temple my daughter has been accustomed only to the society of her brother and cousins  faith i should not have supposed it said nick instantly a remark which caused the color to flush deeply into mademoiselles face i looked to see monsieur de st gre angry he tried indeed to be grave but smiled irresistibly as he mounted the steps to greet his wife who stood demurely awaiting his caress and in this interval mademoiselle shot at nick a swift and withering look as she passed him he returned a grimace  messieurs said monsieur de st gre turning to us dinner will soon be readyif you will be so good as to pardon me until then  nick followed mademoiselle with his eyes until she had disappeared beyond the hall she did not so much as turn then he took me by the arm and led me to a bench under a magnolia a little distance away where he seated himself and looked up at me despairingly  behold said he what was once your friend and cousin your counsellor sage and guardian behold the clay which conducted you hither with the heart neatly but painfully extracted look upon a womans work davy and shun the sex i tell you it is better to go blindfold through life to havepardon meyour own blunt features than to be reduced to such a pitiable state was ever such a refinement of cruelty practised before never was there ever such beauty such archness such coquetrysuch damned elusiveness never if there is a cargo going up the river let me be salted and lie at the bottom of it ill warrant you ill not come to life  you appear to have suffered somewhat i said forgetting for the moment in my laughter the thing that weighed upon my mind  suffered he cried i have been tossed high in the azure that i might sink the farther into the depths i have been put in a grave the earth stamped down resurrected and flung into the dustheap i have been taken up to the gate of heaven and dropped a hundred and fifty years through darkness since i have seen you i have been the round of all the bright places and all the bottomless pits in the firmament  it seems to have made you literary i remarked judicially  i burn up twenty times a day he continued with a wave of the hand to express the completeness of the process there is nothing left i see her i speak to her and i burn up  have you had many teteatetes i asked  not one he retorted fiercely do you think there is any sense in the damnable french custom i am an honorable man and besides i am not equipped for an elopement no priest in louisiana would marry us i see her at dinner at supper sometimes we sew on the gallery he went on but i give you my oath that i have not had one word with her alone  an oath is not necessary i said but you seem to have made some progress nevertheless  do you call that progress he demanded  it is surely not retrogression  god knows what it is said nick helplessly but its got to stop i have sent her an ultimatum  a what  a summons her father and mother are going to the bertrands tonight and i have written her a note to meet me in the garden and you he cried rising and slapping me between the shoulders you are to keep watch like the dear careful canny sly rascal you are  andand has she accepted i inquired  thats the deuce of it said he she has not but i think shell come  i stood for a moment regarding him  and you really love mademoiselle antoinette i asked  have i not exhausted the language he answered if what i have been through is not love then may the lord shield me from the real disease  it may have been merely a light case oftropical enthusiasm let us say i have seen others a little milder because the air was more temperate  tropicalbalderdash he exploded if you are not the most exasperating unfeeling man alive  i merely wanted to know if you wished to marry mademoiselle de st gre i interrupted  he gave me a look of infinite tolerance  have i not made it plain that i cannot live without her he said if not i will go over it all again  that will not be necessary i said hastily  the trouble may be he continued that they have already made one of their matrimonial contracts with a granpre a beausejour a bernard  monsieur de st gre is a very sensible man i answered he loves his daughter and i doubt if he would force her to marry against her will tell me nick i asked laying my hand upon his shoulder do you love this girl so much that you would let nothing come between you and her  i tell you i do and again i tell you i do he replied he paused suddenly glancing at my face and added why do you ask davy  i stood irresolute now that the time had come not daring to give voice to my suspicions he had not spoken to me of his mother save that once and i had no means of knowing whether his feeling for the girl might not soften his anger against her i have never lacked the courage to come to the point but there was still the chance that i might be mistaken in this after all would it not be best to wait until i had ascertained in some way the identity of mrs clive and while i stood debating nick regarding me with a puzzled expression monsieur de st gre appeared on the gallery  come gentlemen he cried dinner awaits us  the dining room at les iles was at the corner of the house and its windows looked out on the gallery which was shaded at that place by dense foliage the room like others in the house seemed to reflect the decorous character of its owner two st gres indifferently painted but rigorous and respectable relieved the whiteness of the wall they were the commissarygeneral and his wife the lattices were closed on one side and in the deep amber light the family silver shone but dimly the dignity of our host the evident ceremony of the mealwhich was attended by three servantswould have awed into a modified silence at least a less irrepressible person than nicholas temple but nick was one to carry by storm a position which another might wait to reconnoitre the first sensation of our host was no doubt astonishment but he was soon laughing over a vivid account of our adventures on the keel boat nicks imitation of xavier and his description of benjys terrors after the storm were so perfect that i laughed quite as heartily and madame de st gre wiped her eyes and repeated continually quel drole monsieur it is thus he has entertained us since thou departed philippe  as for mademoiselle i began to think that nick was not far wrong in his diagnosis training may have had something to do with it she would not laugh not she but once or twice she raised her napkin to her face and coughed slightly for the rest she sat demurely with her eyes on her plate a model of propriety nicks sufferings became more comprehensible  to give the devil his due nick had an innate tact which told him when to stop and perhaps at this time mademoiselles superciliousness made him subside the more quickly after monsieur de st gre had explained to me the horrors of the indigo pest and the futility of sugar raising he turned to his daughter  toinette where is madame clive he asked the girl looked up startled into life and interest at once  oh papa she cried in french we are so worried about her mamma and i it was the day you went away the day these gentlemen came that we thought she would take an airing and suddenly she became worse  monsieur de st gre turned with concern to his wife  i do not know what it is philippe said that lady it seems to be mental the loss of her husband weighs upon her poor lady but this is worse than ever and she will lie for hours with her face turned to the wall and not even antoinette can arouse her  i have always been able to comfort her before said antoinette with a catch in her voice  i took little account of what was said after that my only notion being to think the problem out for myself and alone as i was going to my room nick stopped me  come into the garden davy he said  when i have had my siesta i answered  when you have had your siesta he cried since when did you begin to indulge in siestas  today i replied and left him staring after me  i reached my room bolted the door and lay down on my back to think little was needed to convince me now that mrs clive was mrs temple and thus the ladys relapse when she heard that her son was in the house was accounted for instead of forming a plan my thoughts drifted from that into pity for her and my memory ran back many years to the text of good mr masons sermon i have refined thee but not with silver i have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction what must sarah temple have suffered since those days i remembered her in her prime in her beauty in her selfishness in her cruelty to those whom she might have helped and i wondered the more at the change which must have come over the woman that she had won the affections of this family that she had gained the untiring devotion of mademoiselle antoinette her wit might not account for it for that had been cruel and something of the agony of the womans soul as she lay in torment facing the wall thinking of her son under the same roof of a life misspent and irrevocable i pictured  a stillness crept into the afternoon like the stillness of night the wide house was darkened and silent and without a sunlight washed with gold filtered through the leaves there was a drowsy hum of bees and in the distance the occasional languishing note of a bird singing what must have been a cradlesong my mind wandered and shirked the task that was set to it  could anything be gained by meddling i had begun to convince myself that nothing could when suddenly i came face to face with the consequences of a possible marriage between nick and mademoiselle antoinette in that event the disclosure of his mothers identity would be inevitable not only his happiness was involved but mademoiselles her fathers and her mothers and lastly that of this poor hunted woman herself who thought at last to have found a refuge  an hour passed and it became more and more evident to me that i must see and talk with mrs temple but how was i to communicate with her at last i took out my portfolio and wrote these words on a sheet  if mrs clive will consent to a meeting with mr david ritchie he will deem it a favor mr ritchie assures mrs clive that he makes this request in all friendliness  i lighted a candle folded the note and sealed it addressed it to mrs clive and opening the latticed door i stepped out walking along the gallery until i came to the rear part of the house which faced towards the outbuildings i spied three figures prone on the grass under a pecan tree that shaded the kitchen roof one of these figures was benjy and he was taking his siesta i descended quietly from the gallery and making my way to him touched him on the shoulder he awoke and stared at me with white eyes  marse dave he cried  hush i answered and follow me  he came after me wondering a little way into the grove where i stopped  benjy i said do you know any of the servants here  lawsy marse dave i reckon i knows emsome of em he answered with a grin  you talk to them  shucks no marse dave he replied with a fine scorn i aint no hand at dat ar nigger french but i knows some on em and right well too  how i demanded curiously  benjy looked down sheepishly at his feet he was standing pigeontoed  i done cressed some on em marse dave he said at length and there was a note of triumph in his voice  you did what i asked  i done kissed one of dem yaller gals marse dave yassr i done kissed mlisse  do you think melisse would do something for you if you asked her i inquired  benjy seemed hurt  marse dave he began reproachfully  very well then i interrupted taking the letter from my pocket there is a lady who is ill here mrs clive  i paused for a new look had come into benjys eyes he began that peculiar sympathetic laugh of the negro which catches and doubles on itself and i imagined that a new admiration for me dawned on his face  yassr yass marse dave i reckon mlisse ll git it to her thout any one tekin notice  i bit my lips  if mrs clive receives this within an hour melisse shall have one piastre and you another there is an answer  benjy took the note and departed nimbly to find melisse while i paced up and down in my uneasiness as to the outcome of the experiment a quarter of an hour passed half an hour and then i saw benjy coming through the trees he stood before me chuckling and drew from his pocket a folded piece of paper i gave him the two piastres warned him if his master or any one inquired for me that i was taking a walk and bade him begone then i opened the note  i will meet you at the bayou at seven this evening take the path that leads through the garden  i read it with a catch of the breath with a certainty that the happiness of many people depended upon what i should say at that meeting and to think of this and to compose myself a little i made my way to the garden in search of the path that i might know it when the time came entering a gap in the hedge i caught sight of the shaded seat under the tree which had been the scene of our first meeting with antoinette and i hurried past it as i crossed the garden there were two openings in the opposite hedge the one through which nick and i had come and another i took the second and with little difficulty found the path of which the note had spoken it led through a dense semitropical forest in the direction of the swamp beyond the way being well beaten but here and there jealously crowded by an undergrowth of brambles and the prickly spanish bayonet i know not how far i had walked my head bent in thought before i felt the ground teetering under my feet and there was the bayou it was a narrow lane of murky impenetrable water shaded now by the forest wall imaged on its amber surface were the twisted boughs of the cypresses of the swamp beyondboughs funereally draped as though to proclaim a warning of unknown perils in the dark places on that side where i stood ancient oaks thrust their gnarled roots into the water and these knees were bridged by treacherous platforms of moss as i sought for a safe restingplace a dull splash startled me the pinkandwhite water lilies danced on the ripples and a long black snout pushed its way to the centre of the bayou and floated there motionless  i sat down on a wide knee that seemed to be fashioned for the purpose and reflected it may have been about halfpast five and i made up my mind that rather than return and risk explanations i would wait where i was until mrs temple appeared i had much to think of and for the rest the weird beauty of the place with its changing colors as the sun fell held me in fascination when the blue vapor stole through the cypress swamp my trained ear caught the faintest of warning sounds mrs temple was coming  i could not repress the exclamation that rose to my lips when she stood before me  i have changed somewhat she began quite calmly i have changed since you were at temple bow  i stood staring at her at a loss to know whether by these words she sought to gain an advantage i knew not whether to pity or to be angry such a strange blending she seemed of former pride and arrogance and later suffering there were the features of the beauty still the eyes defiant the lips scornful sorrow had set its brand upon this protesting face in deep violet marks under the eyes in lines which no human power could erase sorrow had flecked with white the gold of the hair had proclaimed her a woman with a history for she had a new and remarkable beauty which puzzled and astonished mea beauty in which maternity had no place the figure gowned with an innate taste in black still kept the rounded lines of the young woman while about the shoulders and across the open throat a lace mantilla was thrown she stood facing me undaunted and i knew that she had come to fight for what was left her i knew further that she was no mean antagonist  will you kindly tell me to what circumstance i owe the honor of thissummons mr ritchie she asked you are a travelled person for one so young i might almost say she added with an indifferent laugh that there is some method and purpose in your travels  indeed you do me wrong madame i replied i am here by the merest chance  again she laughed lightly and stepping past me took her seat on the oak from which i had risen i marvelled that this woman with all her selfpossession could be the same as she who had held her room cowering these four days past admiration for her courage mingled with my other feelings and for the life of me i knew not where to begin my experience with women of the world was after all distinctly limited mrs temple knew apparently by intuition the advantage she had gained and she smiled  the ritchies were always skilled in dealing with sinners she began the first earl had the habit of hunting them like foxes so it is said i take it for granted that before my sentence is pronounced i shall have the pleasure of hearing my wrongdoings in detail i could not ask you to forego that satisfaction  you seem to know the characteristics of my family mrs temple i answered there is one trait of the ritchies concerning which i ask your honest opinion  and what is that she said carelessly  i have always understood that they have spoken the truth is it not so  she glanced at me curiously  i never knew your father to lie she answered but after all he had few chances he so seldom spoke  your intercourse with me at temple bow was quite as limited i said  ah she interrupted quickly you bear me that grudge it is another trait of the ritchies  i bear you no grudge madame i replied i asked you a question concerning the veracity of my family and i beg that you will believe what i say  and what is this momentous statement she asked  i had hard work to keep my temper but i knew that i must not lose it  i declare to you on my honor that my business in new orleans in no way concerns you and that i had not the slightest notion of finding you here will you believe that  and what then she asked  i also declare to you that since meeting your son my chief anxiety has been lest he should run across you  you are very considerate of others she said let us admit for the sake of argument that you come here by accident  it was the opening i had sought for but despaired of getting  then put yourself for a moment in my place madame and give me credit for a little kindliness of feeling and a sincere affection for your son  there was a new expression on her face and the light of a supreme effort in her eyes  i give you credit at least for a logical mind she answered in spite of myself you have put me at the bar and seem to be conducting my trial  i do not see why there should be any rancor between us i answered it is true that i hated you at temple bow when my father was killed and i was left a homeless orphan you had no pity for me though your husband was my mothers brother but you did me a good turn after all for you drove me out into a world where i learned to rely upon myself furthermore it was not in your nature to treat me well  not in my nature she repeated  you were seeking happiness as every one must in their own way that happiness lay apparently with mr riddle  ah she cried with a catch of her breath i thought you would be judging me  i am stating facts your son was a sufficient embarrassment in this matter and i should have been an additional one i blame you not mrs temple for anything you have done to me but i blame you for embittering nicks life  and he she said it seemed to me that i detected a faltering in her voice  i will hide nothing from you he blames you with what justice i leave you to decide  she did not answer this but turned her head away towards the bayou nor could i determine what was in her mind  and now i ask you whether i have acted as your friend in begging you to meet me  she turned to me swiftly at that  i am at a loss to see how there can be friendship between us mr ritchie she said  very good then madame i am sorry i answered i have done all that is in my power and now events will have to take their course  i had not gone two steps into the wood before i heard her voice calling my name she had risen and leaned with her hand against the oak  does nickknow that you are here she cried  no i answered shortly then i realized suddenly what i had failed to grasp beforeshe feared that i would pity her  david  i started violently at the sound of my name at the new note in her voice at the change in the woman as i turned and then before i realized what she had done she had come to me swiftly and laid her hand upon my arm  david does he hate me  all the hope remaining in her life was in that question was in her face as she searched mine with a terrible scrutiny and never had i known such an ordeal it seemed as if i could not answer and as i stood staring back at her a smile was forced to her lips  i will pay you one tribute my friend she said you are honest  but even as she spoke i saw her sway and though i could not be sure it were not a dizziness in me i caught her i shall always marvel at the courage there was in her for she straightened and drew away from me a little proudly albeit gently and sat down on the knee of the oak looking across the bayou towards the mist of the swamp there was the infinite calmness of resignation in her next speech  tell me about him she said  she was changed indeed were it not so i should have heard of her own sufferings of her poor hunted life from place to place of countless nights made sleepless by the past pride indeed was left but the fire had burned away the last vestige of selfishness  i sat down beside her knowing full well that i should be judged by what i said she listened motionless though something of what that narrative cost her i knew by the current of sympathy that ran now between us unmarked the day faded a new light was spread over the waters the mist was spangled with silver points the spanish moss took on the whiteness of lace against the black forest swamp and on the yellow face of the moon the starshaped leaves of a gum were printed  at length i paused she neither spoke nor movedsave for the rising and falling of her shoulders the hardest thing i had to say i saved for the last and i was near lacking the courage to continue  there is mademoiselle antoinette i began and stoppedshe turned on me so quickly and laid a hand on mine  nick loves her she cried  you know it i exclaimed wondering  ah david she answered brokenly i foresaw it from the first i too love the girl no human being has ever given me such care and such affection sheshe is all that i have left must i give her up have i not paid the price of my sins  i did not answer knowing that she saw the full cruelty of the predicament what happiness remained to her now of a battered life stood squarely in the way of her sons happiness that was the issue and no advice or aid of mine could change it there was another silence that seemed to me an eternity as i watched a helpless witness the struggle going on within her at last she got to her feet her face turned to the shadow  i will go david she said her voice was low and she spoke with a steadiness that alarmed me i will go  torn with pity i thought again but i could see no alternative and then suddenly she was clinging to me her courage gone her breast shaken with sobs where shall i go she cried god help me are there no remote places where he will not seek me out i have tried them all david and quite as suddenly she disengaged herself and looked at me strangely you are well revenged for temple bow she said  hush i answered and held her fearing i knew not what you have not lacked courage it is not so bad as you believe i will devise a plan and help you have you money  yes she answered with a remnant of her former pride and i have an annuity paid now to mr clark  then listen to what i say i answered tonight i will take you to new orleans and hide you safely and i swear to you whether it be right or wrong that i will use every endeavor to change nicks feelings towards you come i continued leading her gently into the path let us go while there is yet time  stop she said and i halted fearfully david ritchie you are a good man i can make no amends to youshe did not finish  feeling for the path in the blackness of the wood i led her by the hand and she followed me as trustfully as a child at last after an age of groping the heavy scents of shrubs and flowers stole to us on the night air and we came out at the hedge into what seemed a blaze of light that flooded the rows of color here we paused breathless and looked the bench under the great tree was vacant and the garden was empty  it was she who led the way through the hedge who halted in the garden path at the sound of voices she turned but there was no time to flee for the tall figure of a man came through the opposite hedge followed by a lady one was nicholas temple the other mademoiselle de st gre mrs temples face alone was in the shadow and as i felt her hand trembling on my arm i summoned all my resources it was nick who spoke first  it is davy he cried oh the sly rascal and this is the promenade of which he left us word the solitary meditation speak up man you are forgiven for deserting us  he turned laughing to mademoiselle but she stood with her lips parted and her hands dropped staring at my companion then she took two steps forward and stopped with a cry  mrs clive  the woman beside me turned and with a supreme courage raised her head and faced the girl  yes antoinette it is i she answered  and then my eyes sought nick for mrs temple had faced her son with a movement that was a challenge yet with a look that questioned yearned appealed he too stared the laughter fading from his eyes first astonishment and then anger growing in them slowly surely i shall never forget him as he stood there for what seemed an age recalling one by one the wrongs this woman had done him she herself had taught him to brook no restraint to follow impetuously his loves and hates and endurance in these things was moulded in every line of his finely cut features and when he spoke it was not to her but to the girl at his side  do you know who this is he said tell me do you know this woman  mademoiselle de st gre did not answer him she drew near gently to mrs temple whose head was bowed whose agony i could only guess  mrs clive she said softly though her voice was shaken by a prescience wont you tell me what has happened wont you speak to meantoinette  the poor lady lifted up her arms as though to embrace the girl dropped them despairingly and turned away  antoinette she murmured antoinette  for nick had seized antoinette by the hand restraining her  you do not know what you are doing he cried angrily listen  i had stood bereft of speech watching the scene breathlessly and now i would have spoken had not mademoiselle astonished me by taking the lead i have thought since that i might have pieced together this much of her character her glance at nick surprised him momentarily into silence  i know that she is my dearest friend she said that she came to us in misfortune and that we love her and trust her i do not know why she is here with mr ritchie but i am sure it is for some good reason she laid a hand on mrs temples shoulder mrs clive wont you speak to me  my god antoinette listen cried nick mrs clive is not her name i know her david knows her she is anadventuress  mrs temple gave a cry and the girl shot at him a frightened bewildered glance in which a newborn love struggled with an older affection  an adventuress she repeated her hand dropping oh i do not believe it i cannot believe it  you shall believe it said nick fiercely her name is not clive ask david what her name is  antoinettes lips moved but she shirked the question and nick seized me roughly  tell her he said tell her my god how can i do it tell her david  for the life of me i could not frame the speech at once my pity and a newfound and surprising respect for her making it doubly hard to pronounce her sentence suddenly she raised her head not proudly but with a dignity seemingly conferred by years of sorrow and of suffering her tones were even bereft of every vestige of hope  antoinette i have deceived you though as god is my witness i thought no harm could come of it i deluded myself into believing that i had found friends and a refuge at last i am mrs temple  mrs temple the girl repeated the name sorrowfully but perplexedly not grasping its full significance  she is my mother said nick with a bitterness i had not thought in him she is my mother or i would curse her for she has ruined my life and brought shame on a good name  he paused his breath catching for very anger mrs temple hid her face in her hands while the girl shrank back in terror i grasped him by the arm  have you no compassion i cried but mrs temple interrupted me  he has the right she faltered it is my just punishment  he tore himself away and took a step to her  where is riddle he cried as god lives i will kill him without mercy  his mother lifted her head again  god has judged him she said quietly he is beyond your vengeancehe is dead a sob shook her but she conquered it with a marvellous courage harry riddle loved me he was kind to me and he was a better man than john temple  nick recoiled the fierceness of his anger seemed to go leaving a more dangerous humor  then i have been blessed with parents he said  at that she swayed but when i would have caught her she motioned me away and turned to antoinette twice mrs temple tried to speak  i was going away tonight she said at length and you would never have seen or heard of me more my nephew davidmr ritchiewhom i treated cruelly as a boy had pity on me he is a good man and he was to have taken me awayi do not attempt to defend myself my dear but i pray that you who have so much charity will some day think a little kindly of one who has sinned deeply of one who will love and bless you and yours to her dying day  she faltered and nick would have spoken had not antoinette herself stayed him with a gesture  i wishmy son to know the little there is on my side it is not much yet god may not spare him the sorrow that brings pity ii loved harry riddle as a girl my father was ruined and i was forced into marriage with john temple for his possessions he was selfish overbearing cruelunfaithful during the years i lived with him he never once spoke kindly to me i too grew wicked and selfish and heedless my head was turned by admiration mr temple escaped to england in a manofwar he left me without a line of warning of farewell ii have wandered over the earth haunted by remorse and i knew no moment of peace of happiness until you brought me here and sheltered and loved me and even here i have had many sleepless hours a hundred times i have summoned my courage to tell youi could not i am justly punished antoinette she moved a little timidly towards the girl who stood motionless dazed by what she heard she held out a hand appealingly and dropped it goodby my dear god will bless you for your kindness to an unfortunate outcast  she glanced with a kind of terror in her eyes from the girl to nick and what she meant to say concerning their love i know not for the flood held back so long burst upon her she wept as i have never seen a woman weep and then before nick or i knew what had happened antoinette had taken her swiftly in her arms and was murmuring in her ear  you shall not go you shall not you will live with me always  presently the sobs ceased and mrs temple raised her face slowly wonderingly as if she had not heard aright and she tried gently to push the girl away  no antoinette she said i have done you harm enough  but the girl clung to her strongly passionately i do not care what you have done she cried you are good now i know that you are good now i will not cast you out i will not  i stood looking at them bewildered and astonished by mademoiselles loyalty she seemed to have forgotten nick as had i and then as i turned to him he came towards them almost roughly he took antoinette by the arm  you do not know what you are saying he cried come away antoinette you do not know what she has doneyou cannot realize what she is  antoinette shrank away from him still clinging to mrs temple there was a fearless directness in her look which might have warned him  she is your mother she said quietly  my mother he repeated yes i will tell you what a mother she has been to me  nick  it passes my power to write down the pity of that appeal the hopelessness of it the yearning in it freeing herself from the girl mrs temple took one step towards him her arms held up i had not thought that his hatred of her was deep enough to resist it it was antoinette whose intuition divined this ere he had turned away  you have chosen between me and her he said and before we could get the poor lady to the seat under the oak he had left the garden in my perturbation i glanced at antoinette but there was no other sign in her face save of tenderness for mrs temple  mrs temple had mercifully fainted as i crossed the lawn i saw two figures in the deep shadow beside the gallery and i heard nicks voice giving orders to benjy to pack and saddle when i reached the garden again the girl had loosed mrs temples gown and was bending over her murmuring in her ear                   many hours later when the moon was waning towards the horizon fearful of surprise by the coming day i was riding slowly under the trees on the road to new orleans beside me veiled in black her head bowed was mrs temple and no word had escaped her since she had withdrawn herself gently from the arms of antoinette on the gallery at les iles nick had gone long before the hardest task had been to convince the girl that mrs temple might not stay after that antoinette had busied herself with a silent fortitude i had not thought was in her making ready for the ladys departure i shall never forget her as she stood a slender figure of sorrow looking down at us the tears glistening on her cheeks and i could not resist the impulse to mount the steps once more  you were right antoinette i whispered whatever happens you will remember that i am your friend and i will bring him back to you if i can  she pressed my hand and turned and went slowly into the house       book iii louisiana   chapter i the rights of man  were these things which follow to my thinking not extraordinary i should not write them down here nor should i have presumed to skip nearly five years of time for indeed almost five years had gone by since the warm summer night when i rode into new orleans with mrs temple and in all that time i had not so much as laid eyes on my cousin and dearest friend her son i searched new orleans for him in vain and learned too late that he had taken passage on a packet which had dropped down the river the next morning bound for charleston and new york  i have an instinct that this is not the place to relate in detail what occurred to me before leaving new orleans suffice it to say that i made my way back through the swamps the forests the canebrakes of the indian country along the natchez trail to nashville across the barrens to harrodstown in kentucky where i spent a week in that cabin which had so long been for me a haven of refuge dear polly ann she hugged me as though i were still the waif whom she had mothered and wept over the little presents which i had brought the children harrodstown was changed new cabins and new faces met me at every turn and tom more disgruntled than ever had gone ahunting with mr boone far into the wilderness  i went back to louisville to take up once more the struggle for practice and i do not intend to charge so much as a page with what may be called the even tenor of my life i was not a man to get into trouble on my own account louisville grew amazingly white frame houses were built and even brick ones and ere kentucky became a state in 1792 i had gone as delegate to more than one of the danville conventions  among the nations as you know a storm raged and the great swells from that conflict threatened to set adrift and wreck the little republic but newly launched the noise of the tramping of great armies across the old world shook the new and men in whom the love of fierce fighting was born were stirred to quarrel among themselves the rights of man how many wrongs have been done under that clause the bastille stormed the swiss guard slaughtered the reign of terror with its daily procession of tumbrels through the streets of paris the murder of that amiable and wellmeaning gentleman who did his best to atone for the sins of his ancestors the fearful months of waiting suffered by his queen before she too went to her death often as i lighted my candle of an evening in my little room to read of these things so far away i would drop my kentucky gazette to think of a woman whose face i remembered to wonder sadly whether helene de st gre were among the lists in her i was sure was personified that courage for which her order will go down eternally through the pages of history and in my darker moments i pictured her standing beside the guillotine with a smile that haunted me  the hideous image of that strife was reflected amongst our own people budget after budget was hurried by the winds across the sea and swift couriers carried the news over the blue wall by the wilderness trail widened now and thundered through the little villages of the blue grass country to the falls what interest you will say could the pioneer lawyers and storekeepers and planters have in the french revolution the rights of man down with kings general washington and mr adams and mr hamilton might sigh for them but they were not for the freeborn pioneers of the west citizen was the proper term nowcitizen general wilkinson when that magnate came to town resplendent in his brigadiers uniform it was thought that mr wilkinson would plot less were he in the army under the watchful eye of his superiors little they knew him thus the republic had a reward for adroitness for treachery and treason but what reward had it for the lonely embittered stricken man whose genius and courage had gained for it the great northwest territory what reward had the republic for him who sat brooding in his house above the fallsfor citizen general clark  in those days you were not a federalist or a democrat you were an aristocrat or a jacobin the french parties were our parties the french issue our issue under the patronage of that saint of american jacobinism thomas jefferson a jacobin society was organized in philadelphiaspecial guardians of liberty and flying on the march winds over the mountains the seed fell on the black soil of kentucky lexington had its jacobin society danville and louisville likewise their patrons and protectors of the rights of mankind federalists were not guillotined in kentucky in the summer of 1793 but i might mention more than one who was shot  in spite of the federalists louisville prospered and incidentally i prospered in a mild way mr crede behind whose store i still lived was getting rich and happened to have an affair of some importance in philadelphia mr wharton was kind enough to recommend a young lawyer who had the following virtues he was neither handsome nor brilliant and he wore snuffcolored clothes mr wharton also did me the honor to say that i was cautious and painstaking and had a habit of tiring out my adversary therefore in the early summer of 1793 i went to philadelphia at that time travellers embarking on such a journey were prayed over as though they were going to tartary i was absent from louisville near a year and there is a diary of what i saw and felt and heard on this trip for the omission of which i will be thanked the great news of that day which concerns the worldand incidentally this storywas that citizen genet had landed at charleston  citizen genet ambassador of the great republic of france to the little republic of america landed at charleston acclaimed by thousands and lost no time scarcely had he left that city ere american privateers had slipped out of charleston harbor to prey upon the commerce of the hated mistress of the sea was there ever such a march of triumph as that of the citizen ambassador northward to the capital everywhere toasted and feasted monsieur genet did not neglect the rights of man for without doubt the united states was to declare war on britain within a fortnight nay the citizen ambassador would go into the halls of congress and declare war himself if that faltering mr washington refused his duty citizen genet organized his legions as he went along and threw tricolored cockades from the windows of his carriage and at his glorious entry into philadelphia where i afterwards saw the great man with my own eyes mr washington and his federalaristocrats trembled in their boots  it was late in april 1794 when i reached pittsburg on my homeward journey and took passage down the ohio with a certain captain wendell of the army in a kentucky boat i had known the captain in louisville for he had been stationed at fort finney the army post across the ohio from that town and he had come to pittsburg with a sergeant to fetch down the river some dozen recruits this was a most fortunate circumstance for me and in more ways than one although the captain was a gruff and blunt man grizzled and weatherbeaten a womanhater he could be a delightful companion when once his confidence was gained and as we drifted in the mild spring weather through the long reaches between the passes he talked of trenton and brandywine and yorktown there was more than one bond of sympathy between us for he worshipped washington detested the french party and had a hatred for filthy democrats second to none i have ever encountered  we stopped for a few days at fort harmar where the muskingum pays its tribute to the ohio built by the federal government to hold the territory which clark had won and leaving that hospitable place we took up our journey once more in the very miracletime of the spring the sunlight was like ambercrystal the tall cottonwoods growing by the waterside flaunted a proud glory of green the hills behind them that formed the first great swells of the sea of the wilderness were clothed in a thousand sheens and shaded by the purple budding of the oaks and walnuts on the northern slopes on the yellow sandbars flocks of geese sat pluming in the sun or rose at our approach to cast fleeting shadows on the water their honkhonks echoing from the hills here and there a hawk swooped down from the azure to break the surface and bear off a wriggling fish that gleamed like silver and at eventide we would see at the brink an elk or doe with head poised watching us as we drifted we passed here and there a lonely cabin to set my thoughts wandering backwards to my youth and here and there in the dimples of the hills little clusters of white and brown houses one day to become marts of the republic  my joy at coming back at this golden season to a country i loved was tempered by news i had heard from captain wendell and which i had discussed with the officers at fort harmar the captain himself had broached the subject one cool evening early in the journey as we sat over the fire in our little cabin he had been telling me about brandywine but suddenly he turned to me with a kind of fierce gesture that was natural to the man  ritchie he said you were in the revolution yourself you helped clark to capture that country and he waved his hand towards the northern shore why the devil dont you tell me about it  you never asked me i answered  he looked at me curiously  well he said i ask you now  i began lamely enough but presently my remembrance of the young man who conquered all obstacles who compelled all men he met to follow and obey him carried me strongly into the narrative i remembered him quiet selfcontained resourceful a natural leader at twentyfive a bulwark for the sorely harried settlers of kentucky the man whose clear vision alone had perceived the value of the country north of the ohio to the republic who had compelled the governor and council of virginia to see it likewise who had guarded his secret from all men who in the face of fierce opposition and intrigue had raised a little army to follow himthey knew not where who had surprised kaskaskia cowed the tribes of the north in his own person and by sheer force of will drew after him and kept alive a motley crowd of men across the floods and through the ice to vincennes  we sat far into the night the captain listening as i had never seen a man listen and when at length i had finished he was for a long time silent and then he sprang to his feet with an oath that woke the sleeping soldiers forward and glared at me  my god he cried it is enough to make a man curse his uniform to think that such a man as wilkinson wears it while clark is left to rot to drink himself under the table from disappointment to plot with the damned jacobins  to plot i cried starting violently in my turn  the captain looked at me in astonishment  how long have you been away from louisville he asked  it will be a year i answered  ah said the captain i will tell you it is more than a year since clark wrote genet since the ambassador bestowed on him a generals commission in the army of the french republic  a generals commission i exclaimed and he is going to france the nation which had driven john paul jones from its service was now to lose george rogers clark  to france laughed the captain no this is become france enough he is raising in kentucky and in the cumberland country an army with a cursed highsounding name some of his old illinois scoutsmcchesney whom you mentioned for onehave been collecting bears meat and venison hams all winter they are going to march on louisiana and conquer it for the french republic for liberty equalitythe rights of man anything you like  on louisiana i repeated what has the federal government been doing  the captain winked at me and sat down  the federal government is supine a laughingstockso our friends the jacobins say who have been shouting at mr eastons tavern all winter nay they declare that all this country west of the mountains too will be broken off and set up into a republic and allied with that most glorious of all republics france believe me the jacobins have not been idle and there have been strangelooking birds of french plumage dodging between the generals house at clarksville and the bear grass  i was silent the tears almost forcing themselves to my eyes at the pathetic sordidness of what i had heard  it can come to nothing continued the captain in a changed voice general clarks mind is unhinged bydisappointment mad anthony1 is not a man to be caught sleeping and he has already attended to a little expedition from the cumberland mad anthony loves the general as we all do and the federal government is wiser than the jacobins think it may not be necessary to do anything captain wendell paused and looked at me fixedly ritchie general clark likes you and you have never offended him why not go to his little house in clarksville when you get to louisville and talk to him plainly as i know you can perhaps you might have some influence   1 general wayne of revolutionary fame was then in command of that district    i shook my head sadly  i intend to go i answered but i will have no influence    chapter ii the house above the falls  it was mayday and shortly after dawn we slipped into the quiet water which is banked up for many miles above the falls the captain and i sat forward on the deck breathing deeply the sharp odor which comes from the wet forest in the early morning listening to the soft splash of the oars and watching the green form of eighteen mile island as it gently drew nearer and nearer and ere the sun had risen greatly we had passed twelve mile island and emerging from the narrow channel which divides six mile island from the northern shore we beheld on its terrace above the bear grass louisville shining white in the morning sun majestic in its mile of width calm as though gathering courage the river seemed to straighten for the ordeal to come and the sound of its waters crying over the rocks far below came faintly to my ear and awoke memories of a day gone by fearful of the suck we crept along the indian shore until we counted the boats moored in the bear grass and presently above the trees on our right we saw the stars and stripes floating from the log bastion of fort finney and below the fort on the gentle sunny slope to the rivers brink was spread the green garden of the garrison with its sprouting vegetables and fruit trees blooming pink and white  we were greeted by a company of buff and blue officers at the landing and i was bidden to breakfast at their mess captain wendell promising to take me over to louisville afterwards he had business in the town and about eight of the clock we crossed the wide river in one of the barges of the fort and made fast at the landing in the bear grass but no sooner had we entered the town than we met a number of country people on horseback with their wives and daughtersay and sweetheartsperched up behind them the men mostly in butternut linsey hunting shirts and trousers slouch hats and red handkerchiefs stuck into their bosoms the women marvellously pretty and fresh in stiff cotton gowns and quaker hats and some in crimped caps with ribbons neatly tied under the chin before mr eastons tavern joe handy the fiddler was reeling off a few bars of hey betty martin to the familiar crowd of loungers under the big poplar  its davy ritchie shouted joe breaking off in the middle of the tune welcome home davy yere jest in time for the barbecue on the island  and cap wendell howdy cap drawled another a huge longhaired sallow dirty fellow but the captain only glared  damn him he said after i had spoken to joe and we had passed on he ought to be barbecued he nearly bit off ensign barrys nose a couple of months ago barry tried to stop the beast in a gouging fight  the bright morning the shady streets the homelike frame and log houses the oldtime fragrant odor of cornpone wafted out of the open doorways the warm greetingsall made me happy to be back again mr crede rushed out and escorted us into his cool store and while he waited on his country customers bade his negro brew a bowl of toddy at the mention of which mr bill whalen chief habitue roused himself from a stupor on a tobacco barrel presently the customers having indulged in the toddy departed for the barbecue the captain went to the fort and mr crede and myself were left alone to talk over the business which had sent me to philadelphia  at four oclock having finished my report and dined with my client i set out for clarksville for mr crede had told me among other things that the general was there louisville was deserted the tavern porch vacant but tacked on the logs beside the door was a printed bill which drew my curiosity i stopped caught by a familiar name in large type at the head of it     george r clark esquire majorgeneral in the armies of france    and commanderinchief of the french revolutionary legion on the    mississippi river               proposals  for raising volunteers for the reduction of the spanish posts on the mississippi for opening the trade of the said river and giving freedom to all its inhabitants  i had got so far when i heard a noise of footsteps within and mr easton himself came out in his shirtsleeves  by cricky davy said he im right glad ter see ye agin readin the generals bill are ye tarnation i reckon washington and all his european fellers east of the mountains wont be able ter hold us back this time i reckon well gallop over louisiany in the face of all the spaniards ever created ive got some new whiskey i low will sink tallow come in davy  as he took me by the arm a laughter and shouting came from the back room  its some of them frenchy fellers come over from knob licks theyre in it and he pointed his thumb over his shoulder to the proclamation and thars one young american among em whos a tarer come in  i drank a glass of mr eastons whiskey and asked about the general  he stays over thar to clarksville pretty much said mr easton thar aint quite so much walkin araound ter do he added significantly  i made my way down to the waterside where jake landrasse sat alone on the gunwale of a kentucky boat smoking a clay pipe as he fished i had to exercise persuasion to induce jake to paddle me across which he finally agreed to do on the score of old friendship and he declared that the only reason he was not at the barbecue was because he was waiting to take a few gentlemen to see general clark i agreed to pay the damages if he were late in returning for these gentlemen and soon he was shooting me with pulsing strokes across the lakelike expanse towards the landing at fort finney louisville and the fort were just above the head of the falls and the little town of clarksville which clark had founded at the foot of them i landed took the road that led parallel with the river through the tender green of the woods and as i walked the mighty song which the falls had sung for ages to the wilderness rose higher and higher and the faint spray seemed to be wafted through the forest and to hang in the air like the odor of a summer rain  it was mayday the sweet caressing note of the thrush mingled with the music of the water the dogwood and the wild plum were in festal array but my heart was heavy with thinking of a great man who had cheapened himself at length i came out upon a clearing where fifteen log houses marked the grant of the federal government to clarks regiment perched on a treedotted knoll above the last spasm of the waters in their twomile race for peace was a twostoried log house with a little square porch in front of the door as i rounded the corner of the house and came in sight of the porch i haltedby no will of my ownat the sight of a figure sunken in a wooden chair it was that of my old colonel his hands were folded in front of him his eyes were fixed but dimly on the forests of the kentucky shore across the water his hair uncared for fell on the shoulders of his faded blue coat and the stained buff waistcoat was unbuttoned for he still wore unconsciously the colors of the army of the american republic  general i said  he started got to his feet and stared at me  oh itsits davy he said ii was expectingsome friendsdavy whatwhats the matter davy  i have been away i am glad to see you again general  citizen general sir majorgeneral in the army of the french republic and commanderinchief of the french revolutionary legion on the mississippi  you will always be colonel clark to me sir i answered  youyou were the drummer boy i remember and strutted in front of the regiment as if you were the colonel egad i remember how you fooled the kaskaskians when you told them we were going away he looked at me but his eyes were still fixed on the point beyond you were always older than i davy are you married  in spite of myself i laughed as i answered this question  you are as canny as ever he said putting his hand on my shoulder liberty equality fraternitythey are only possible for the bachelor hearing a noise he glanced nervously in the direction of the woods only to perceive his negro carrying a pail of water ii was expecting some friends he said sit down davy  i hope i am not intruding general i said not daring to look at him  no no my son he answered you are always welcome did we not campaign together did we notshoot these very falls together on our way to kaskaskia he had to raise his voice above the roar of the water faith well i remember the day and you saved it davyyou a little gamecock a little worldlywise hopomythumb eh hamiltons scalp hanging by a lock egadand they frightened out of their five wits because it was growing dark he laughed and suddenly became solemn again there comes a time in every mans life when it grows dark davy and then the cowards are afraid they have no friends whose hands they can reach out and feel but you are my friend you remember that you said you would always be my friend itit was in the fort at vincennes  i remember general  he rose from the steps buttoned his waistcoat and straightened himself with an effort he looked at me impressively  you have been a good friend indeed davy a faithful friend he said you came to me when i was sick you lent me moneyhe waved aside my protest i am happy to say that i shall soon be in a position to repay you to reward you my evil days are over and i spurn that government which spurned me for the honor and glory of which i founded that cityhe pointed in the direction of louisvillefor the power and wealth of which i conquered this northwest territory listen i am now in the service of a republic where the people have rights i am commanderinchief of the french revolutionary legion on the mississippi despite the supineness of washington the american nation will soon be at war with spain but my friendsand thank god they are manywill follow methey will follow me to natchez and new orleansay even to santa fe and mexico if i give the word the west is with me and for the west i shall win the freedom of the mississippi for france and liberty i shall win back again louisiana and then i shall be a marechal de camp  i could not help thinking of a man who had not been wont to speak of his intentions who had kept his counsel for a year before kaskaskia  i need my drummer boy davy he said his face lighting up but he will not be a drummer boy now he will be a trusted officer of high rank mind you come he cried seizing me by the arm i will write the commission this instant but hold you read frenchi remember the day father gibault gave you your first lesson he fumbled in his pocket drew out a letter and handed it to me this is from citizen michaux the famous naturalist the political agent of the french republic read what he has written me  i read i fear in a faltering voice  citoyen general  un homme qui a donne des preuves de son amour pour la liberte et de sa haine pour le despotisme ne devait pas sadresser en vain au ministre de la republique francaise general il est temps que les americains libres de louest soient debarasses dun ennemie aussi injuste que meprisable  when i had finished i glanced at the general but he seemed not to be heeding me the sun was setting above the ragged line of forest and a blue veil was spreading over the tumbling waters he took me by the arm and led me into the house into a bare room that was all awry maps hung on the wall beside them the generals new commission rudely framed among the littered papers on the table were two whiskey bottles and several glasses and strewn about were a number of chairs the arms of which had been whittled by the generals guests across the rough mantelshelf was draped the french tricolor and before the fireplace on the puncheons lay a huge bearskin which undoubtedly had not been shaken for a year picking up a bottle the general poured out generous helpings in two of the glasses and handed one to me  the mists are bad davy said he ii cannot afford to get the fever now let us drink success to the army of the glorious republic france  let us drink first general i said to the old friendship between us  good he cried tossing off his liquor he set down the glass and began what seemed a fruitless search among the thousand papers on the table but at length with a grunt of satisfaction he produced a form and held it under my eyes at the top of the sheet was that muchabused and calumniated lady the goddess of liberty  now he said drawing up a chair and dipping his quill into an almost depleted inkpot i have decided to make you david ritchie with full confidence in your ability and loyalty to the rights of liberty and mankind a captain in the legion on the mississippi  i crossed the room swiftly and as he put his pen to paper i laid my hand on his arm  general i cannot i said i had seen from the first the futility of trying to dissuade him from the expedition and i knew now that it would never come off i was willing to make almost any sacrifice rather than offend him but this i could not allow the general drew himself up in his chair and stared at me with a flash of his old look  you cannot he repeated you have affairs to attend to i take it  i tried to speak but he rode me down  there is money to be made in that prosperous town of louisville he did not understand the pain which his words caused me he rose and laid his hands affectionately on my shoulders ah davy commerce makes a man timid do you forget the old days when i was the father and you the son come i will make you a fortune undreamed of and you shall be my fianancier once more  i had not thought of the money general i answered and i have always been ready to leave my business to serve a friend  there there said the general soothingly i know it i would not offend you you shall have the commission and you may come when it pleases you  he sat down again to write but i restrained him  i cannot go general i said  thunder and fury cried the general a man might think you were a weakkneed federalist he stared at me and stared again and rose and recoiled a step my god he said you cannot be a federalist you cant have marched to kaskaskia and vincennes you cant have been a friend of mine and have seen how the government of the united states has treated me and be a federalist  it was an argument and an appeal which i had foreseen yet which i knew not how to answer suddenly there came unbidden his own counsel which he had given me long ago serve the people as all true men should in a republic but do not rely upon their gratitude this man had bidden me remember that  general i said trying to speak steadily it was you who gave me my first love for the republic i remember you as you stood on the heights above kaskaskia waiting for the sun to go down and you reminded me that it was the nations birthday and you said that our nation was to be a refuge of the oppressed of this earth a nation made of all peoples out of all time and you said that the lands beyond and i pointed to the west as he had done should belong to it until the sun sets on the sea again  i glanced at him for he was silent and in my life i can recall no sadder moment than this the general heard but the man who had spoken these words was gone forever the eyes of this man before me were fixed as it were upon space he heard but he did not respond for the spirit was gone what i looked upon was the tortured body from which the geniusthe spirit i had worshippedhad fled i turned away only to turn back in anger  what do you know of this france for which you are to fight i cried have you heard of the thousands of innocents who are slaughtered of the women and children who are butchered in the streets in the name of liberty what have those bloodstained adventurers to do with liberty what have the fishwives who love the sight of blood to do with you that would fight for them you warned me that this people and this government to which you have given so much would be ungratefulwill the butchers and fishwives be more grateful  he caught only the word grateful and he rose to his feet with something of the old straightness and of the old power and by evil chance his eye and mine fell upon a sword hanging on the farther wall well i remembered when he had received it well i knew the inscription on its blade presented by the state of virginia to her beloved son george rogers clark who by the conquest of illinois and st vincennes extended her empire and aided in the defence of her liberties by evil chance i say his eye lighted on that sword in three steps he crossed the room to where it hung snatched it from its scabbard and ere i could prevent him he had snapped it across his knee and flung the pieces in a corner  so much for the gratitude of my country he said                   i had gone out on the little porch and stood gazing over the expanse of forest and waters lighted by the afterglow then i felt a hand upon my shoulder i heard a familiar voice calling me by an old name  yes general i turned wonderingly  you are a good lad davy i trust you he said ii was expecting some friends  he lifted a hand that was not too steady to his brow and scanned the road leading to the fort even as he spoke four figures emerged from the woodsundoubtedly the gentlemen who had held the council at the inn that afternoon we watched them in silence as they drew nearer and then something in the walk and appearance of the foremost began to bother me he wore a long doublebreasted claretcolored redingote that fitted his slim figure to perfection and his gait was the easy gait of a man who goes through the world careless of its pitfalls so intently did i stare that i gave no thought to those who followed him suddenly when he was within fifty paces a cry escaped mei should have known that smiling sallow weakly handsome face anywhere in the world  the gentleman was none other than monsieur auguste de st gre at the foot of the steps he halted and swept his hand to his hat with a military salute  citizen general he said gracefully we come and pay our respecs to you and mek our report and ver happy to see you look well citoyens vive la republiquehail to the citizen general  vive la republique vive le general cried the three citizens behind him  citizens you are very welcome answered the general gravely as he descended the steps and took each of them by the hand citizens allow me to introduce to you my old friend citizen david ritchie  milles diables cried the citizen st gre seizing me by the hand cest mon cher ami monsieur reetchie ver happy you have this honor monsieur and snatching his widebrimmed military cocked hat from his head he made me a smiling sweeping bow  what cried the general to me you know the sieur de st gre davy  he is my guest once in louisiane mon general monsieur auguste explained my family knows him  you know the sieur de st gre davy said the general again  yes i know him i answered i fear with some brevity  podden me said auguste i am now citizen captain de st gre and you are also embark in the glorious causeah i am happy he added embracing me with a winning glance  i was relieved from the embarrassment of denying the impeachment by reason of being introduced to the other notables to citizen captain sullivan who wore an undress uniform consisting of a cotton butternut hunting shirt he had charge on the bear grass of building the boats for the expedition and was likewise a prominent member of that august body the jacobin society of lexington next came citizen quartermaster depeau now of knob licks kentucky sometime of new orleans the citizen quartermaster wore his hair long in the backwoods fashion he had a keen pale face and sunken eyes  ver glad mek you known to me citizen reetchie  the fourth gentleman was likewise french and called gignoux the citizen gignoux made some sort of an impression on me which i did not stop to analyze he was a small man with a little round hand that wriggled out of my grasp he had a big french nose bright eyes that popped a little and gave him the habit of looking sidewise and grizzled chestnut eyebrows over them he had a thinlipped mouth and a round chin  citizen reetchie is it i laik to know citizens name glorified by gran cause reetchie  will you enter citizens said the general  i do not know why i followed them unless it were to satisfy a devilprompted curiosity as to how auguste de st gre had got there we went into the room where the generals slovenly negro was already lighting the candles and the general proceeded to collect and fill six of the glasses on the table it was citizen captain sullivan who gave the toast  citizens he cried i give you the health of the foremost apostle of liberty in the western world the general who tamed the savage tribes who braved the elements who brought to their knees the minions of a despot king a slight suspicion of a hiccough filled this gap cast aside by an ungrateful government he is still unfaltering in his allegiance to the people may he lead our legion victorious through the spanish dominions  vive la republique they shouted draining their glasses vive le citoyen general clark  louisiana shouted citizen sullivan warming louisiana groaning under oppression and tyranny is imploring us with uplifted hands to those remaining veteran patriots whose footsteps we followed to this distant desert and who by their blood and toil have converted it into a smiling country we now look under your guidance citizen general we fought we bled  how far the citizen captain would have gone is problematical i had noticed a look of disgust slowly creeping into the citizen quartermasters eyes and at this juncture he seized the citizen captain and thrust him into a chair  sacre vent he exclaimed it is the proclamationhe recites the proclamation i see he have participate in those handbill poof the world is to conquerlet us not spik so much  i give you one toast said the little citizen gignoux slyly we all bring back one wife from nouvelle orleans  ha exclaimed the sieur de st gre laughing the citizen captain depeauhe has already one wife in nouvelle orleans1   1 it is unnecessary for the editor to remind the reader that these are not mr ritchies words but those of an adventurer mr depeau was an honest and worthy gentleman earnest enough in a cause which was more to his credit than to an americans according to contemporary evidence madame depeau was in new orleans   the citizen quartermaster was angry at this and it did not require any great perspicacity on my part to discover that he did not love the citizen de st gre  he is call in his country gumbo de st gre said citizen depeau it is a deesh in that country but to beesness citizenswe embark on glorious enterprise the king and queen of france she pay for her treason with their haids and we must be prepare for do the sem  ha exclaimed the sieur de st gre the citizen quartermaster will lose his provision before his haid  the inference was plain and the citizen quartermaster was quick to take it up  we are all among friens said he why i call you gumbo de st gre when i come first settle in louisiane you was wild manyes drink tafia fight duel spend family money aristocrat then no i not hold my tongue you go france and monsieur le marquis de st gre he get you in gardes du corps of the king yes i tell him you tell the citizen general how come you jacobin now and we see if he mek you captain  a murmur of surprise escaped from several of the company and they all stared at the sieur de st gre but general clark brought down his fist on the table with something of his oldtime vigor and the glasses rattled  gentlemen i will have no quarrelling in my presence he cried and i beg to inform citizen depeau that i bestow my commissions where it pleases me  auguste de st gre rose flushing to his feet citizens he said with a fluency that was easy for him i never mek secret of my historyno it is true my relation monsieur le marquis de st gre bought me a pair of colors in the kings gardes du corps  and is it not truth you tremple the coackade what i hear from philadelphe cried depeau  monsieur auguste smiled with a patient tolerance  if you hev pains to mek inquiry said he you must learn that i join le marquis de la fayette and the national guard that i have since fight for the revolution that i am come now home to fight for louisiane as monsieur genet will tell you whom i saw in philadelphe  the citizen capitainehe spiks true  all eyes were turned towards gignoux who had been sitting back in his chair very quiet  it is true what he say he repeated i have it by monsieur genet himself  gentlemen said general clark this is beside the question and i will not have these petty quarrels i may as well say to you now that i have chosen the citizen captain to go at once to new orleans and organize a regiment among the citizens there faithful to france on account of his family and supposed royalist tendencies he will not be suspected i fear that a month at least has yet to elapse before our expedition can move  it is one wise choice put in monsieur gignoux  monsieur le general and gentlemen said the sieur de st gre gracefully i thank you ver much for the confidence i leave by first flatboat and will have all things stir up when you come the citizens of louisiane await you if necessair we have hole in levee ready to cut  citizens interrupted general clark sitting down before the inkpot let us hear the quartermasters report of the supplies at knob licks and citizen sullivans account of the boats but hold he cried glancing around him where is captain temple i heard that he had come to louisville from the cumberland today is he not going with you to new orleans st gre  i took up the name involuntarily  captain temple i repeated while they stared at me nicholas temple  it was auguste de st gre who replied  the sem he said i recall he was along with you in nouvelle orleans he is at ze tavern and he has had one gran fight and he is veri am sorryintoxicate  i know not how i made my way through the black woods to fort finney where i discovered jake landrasse and his canoe the road was long and yet short for my brain whirled with the expectation of seeing nick again and the thought of this poor pathetic ludicrous expedition compared to the sublime one i had known  george rogers clark had come to this    chapter iii louisville celebrates  they have gran time in louisville tonight davy said jake landrasse as he paddled me towards the kentucky shore you hear  i should be stone deaf if i didnt i answered for the shouting which came from the town filled me with forebodings  they come back from the barbecue full of whiskey said jake and a young man at the tavern come out on the porch and he say get ready you all to go to louisiana you been hole back long enough by tyranny sam barker come along and say he a federalist they done have a gran fight he and the young feller and sam got licked he went at sam just like a harricane  and then i demanded  them four wanted to leave said jake taking no trouble to disguise his disgust and i had to fetch em over ive got to go back and wait for em now and he swore with sincere disappointment i reckon there aint been such a jamboree in town for years  jake had not exaggerated gentlemen from moores settlement from sullivans station on the bear grassto be brief the entire male population of the county seemed to have moved upon louisville after the barbecue and i paused involuntarily at the sight which met my eyes as i came into the street a score of sputtering smoking pineknots threw a lurid light on as many hilarious groups and revealed fantastically enough the boles and lower branches of the big shade trees above them navigation for the individual difficult enough lower down in front of the tavern became positively dangerous there was a human eddynay a maelstrom would better describe it fights began but ended abortively by reason of the inability of the combatants to keep their feet one man whose face i knew passed me with his hat afire followed by several companions in gusts of laughter for the torchbearers were careless and burned the ears of their friends in their enthusiasm another person whom i recognized lacked a large portion of the front of his attire and seemed sublimely unconscious of the fact his face was badly scratched several other friends of mine were indulging in brief intervals of rest on the ground and i barely avoided stepping on them still other gentlemen were delivering themselves of the first impressive periods of orations only to be drowned by the cheers of their auditors these were the snatches which i heard as i picked my way onward with exaggerated fear  gentlemen the mississippi is ours let the tyrants who forbid its use beware to hell with the federal government i tell you sirs this land is ours we have conquered it with our blood and i reckon no spaniard is goin to stop us we aint come this far to stand still we settled kaintuck fit off the redskins and well march across the mississippi and on and on to louisiany they shouted and the whole crowd would take it up to louisiany open the river  so absorbed was i in my own safety and progress that i did not pause to think as i have often thought since of the full meaning of this though i had marked it for many years the support given to wilkinsons plots to clarks expedition was merely the outward and visible sign of the onward sweep of a resistless race in spite of untold privations and hardships of cruel warfare and massacre these people had toiled over the mountains into this land and impatient of check or hindrance would even as clark had predicted when their numbers were sufficient leap the mississippi night or day drunk or sober they spoke of this thing with an ever increasing vehemence and no man of reflection who had read their history could say that they would be thwarted one day louisiana would be theirs and their childrens for the generations to come one day louisiana would be american  that i was alive and unscratched when i got as far as the tavern is a marvel amongst all the passionlit faces which surrounded me i could get no sight of nicks and i managed to make my way to a momentarily quiet corner of the porch as i leaned against the wall there trying to think what i should do there came a great cheering from a little way up the street and then i straightened in astonishment above the cheering came the sound of a drum beaten in marching time and above that there burst upon the night what purported to be the marseillaise taken up and bawled by a hundred drunken throats and without words those around me who were sufficiently nimble began to run towards the noise and i ran after them and there marching down the middle of the street at the head of a ragged and most indecorous column of twos in the centre of a circle of light cast by a pineknot which joe handy held was mr nicholas temple his bearing if a trifle unsteady was proud andif i could believe my eyesaround his neck was slung the thing which i prized above all my possessionsthe drum which i had carried to kaskaskia and vincennes he had taken it from the peg in my room  i shrink from putting on paper the sentimental side of my nature and indeed i could give no adequate idea of my affection for that drum and then there was nick who had been lost to me for five years my impulse was to charge the procession seize nick and the drum together and drag them back to my room but the futility and danger of such a course were apparent and the caution for which i am noted prevented my undertaking it the procession augmented by all those to whom sufficient power of motion remained cheered by the helpless but willing ones on the ground swept on down the street and through the town even at this late day i shame to write it behold me david ritchie federalist execrably sober at the head of the column behind the leader was it twenty minutes or an hour that we paraded this i know that we slighted no street in the little town of louisville what was my bearingwhether proud or angry or carelessly indifferenti know not the glare of joe handys torch fell on my face joe handys arm and that of another gentleman the worse for liquor were linked in mine and they saw fit to applaud at every step my conversion to the cause of liberty we passed time and time again the respectable dooryards of my federalist friends and i felt their eyes upon me with that look which the angels have for the fallen once in front of mr whartons house mr handy burned my hair apologized staggered and i took the torch and i used it to good advantage in saving the drum from capture for mr temple with all the will in the world had begun to stagger at length after marching seemingly half the night they halted by common consent before the house of a prominent democrat who shall be nameless and after some minutes of vain importuning nick with a tattoo on the drum marched boldly up to the gate and into the yard a desperate cunning came to my aid i flung away the torch leaving the head of the column in darkness broke from mr handys embrace and seizing nick by the arm led him onward through the premises he drumming with great docility followed by a few stragglers only some of whom went down in contact with the trees of the orchard we came to a gate at the back which i knew well which led directly into the little yard that fronted my own rooms behind mr credes store pulling nick through the gate i slammed it and he was only beginning to protest when i had him safe within my door and the bolt slipped behind him as i struck a light something fell to the floor with a crash an odor of alcohol filled the air and as the candle caught the flame i saw a shattered whiskey bottle at my feet and a room which had been given over to carousing in spite of my feelings i could not but laugh at the perfectly irresistible figure my cousin made as he stood before me with the drum slung in front of him his hat was gone his dustcovered clothes awry but he smiled at me benignly and without a trace of surprise  sho youve come back at lasht davy he said youreyoure veryirregular youll loselaw bishness yyoure worsen andy jacksonhes always fightin  i relieved him unprotesting of the drum thanking my stars there was so much as a stick left of it he watched me with a silent and exaggerated interest as i laid it on the table from a distance without came the shouts of the survivors making for the tavern  sfortunate you had the drum davy he said gravely rwed had no procession  it is fortunate i have it now i answered looking ruefully at the battered rim where nick had missed the skin in his ardor  davy said he funny thingi didnt know you wash a jacobite shou hear he added relevantly th andy jackson was married  no i answered having no great interest in mr jackson where have you been seeing him again  nashville on cumberland jacksonsh county sholicitordevil of a man ill tell you davy he continued laying an uncertain hand on my shoulder and speaking with great earnestness i had chicashaw horsejacksond virginia thoroughbredhad a racen jackson wanted to shoot me n i wanted to shoot jackson n then we all went to the red heifer  what the deuce is the red heifer i asked  ndishtillery over a shpring n they blow a horn when the liquor runsh n then we had supper in major lewishs tavern major lewis came in with roast pig on platter you know roast pig davy n jackson pulls outs hunting knife nwaves it very mashestic you know how mashestic jackson is when hewantshtobe he let go my shoulder brushed back his hair in a fiery manner and seizing a knife which unhappily lay on the table gave me a graphic illustration of mr jackson about to carve the pig i retreating and he coming on n when he stuck the pig davy  he poised the knife for an instant in the air and then before i could interpose he brought it down deftly through the head of my precious drum and such a frightful agonized squeal filled the room that even i shivered involuntarily and for an instant i had a vivid vision of a pig struggling in the hands of a butcher i laughed in spite of myself but nick regarded me soberly  funny thing davy he said they all left the room for a moment he appeared to be ruminating on this singular phenomenon then he continued n jackson was back firsht n he was damned impolite n he shook his fist in my face here nick illustrated mr jacksons gesture n he said great god sir y have a fine talent but if y ever do that again illill kill you thatsh what he said davy  how long have you been in nashville nick i asked  a year he said lookin after property i won rattleanshnapyou remember  and why didnt you let me know you were in nashville i asked though i realized the futility of the question  thought you wasmad at me he answered but you aint davy youve been very goodnatured t let me have your drum he straightened i am ver much obliged  and where were you before you went to nashville i said  charleston napolis philadelphia everywhere he answered  now said he mgoin t bed  i applauded this determination but doubted whether he meant to carry it out however i conducted him to the back room where he sat himself down on the edge of my fourposter and after conversing a little longer on the subject of mr jackson who seemed to have gotten upon his brain he toppled over and instantly fell asleep with his clothes on for a while i stood over him the old affection welling up so strongly within me that my eyes were dimmed as i looked upon his face spare and handsome it was and boyish still the weaker lines emphasized in its relaxation would that relentless spirit with which he had been born make him too a wanderer forever and was it not the strangest of fates which had impelled him to join this madcap expedition of this other man i loved george rogers clark  i went out closed the door and lighting another candle took from my portfolio a packet of letters two of them i had not read having found them only on my return from philadelphia that morning they were all signed simply sarah temple they were dated at a certain number in the rue bourbon new orleans and each was a tragedy in that which it had left unsaid there was no suspicion of heroics there was no railing at fate the letters breathed but the one hopethat her son might come again to that happiness of which she had robbed him there were in all but twelve and they were brief for some affliction had nearly deprived the lady of the use of her right hand i read them twice over and then despite the lateness of the hour i sat staring at the candles reflecting upon my own helplessness i was startled from this revery by a knock rising hastily i closed the door of my bedroom thinking i had to do with some drunken reveller who might be noisy the knock was repeated i slipped back the bolt and peered out into the night  i saw dat light said a voice which i recognized i think i come in to say good night  i opened the door and he walked in  you are one night owl monsieur reetchie he said  and you seem to prefer the small hours for your visits monsieur de st gre i could not refrain from replying  he swept the room with a glance and i thought a shade of disappointment passed over his face i wondered whether he were looking for nick he sat himself down in my chair stretched out his legs and regarded me with something less than his usual complacency  i have much laik for you monsieur reetchie he began and waved aside my bow of acknowledgment before i go away from louisville i want to spik with youthis is a risson why i am here you listen to what dat depeau he saydat is not truth my family knows you i laik to have you hear de truth  he paused and while i wondered what revelations he was about to make i could not repress my impatience at the preamble  you are my frien you have prove it he continued you remember las time we meet i smiled involuntarily you was in bed but you not need be ashame for me two days after i went to france and i not in new orleans since  two days after you saw me i repeated  yaas i run away that was the mont of august 1789 and we have not then heard in new orleans that the bastille is attack i lan at la havreit is the en of septembre i go to the chateau de st gregreat iron gates long avenue of poplarbig house all round a court and monsieur le marquis is at versailles i borrow three louis from the concierge and i go to versailles to the hotel of monsieur le marquis there is all dat trouble what you read about going on and monsieur le marquis he not so glad to see me for dat risson mon cher auguste he cry you want to be of officier in gardes de corps you are not afred auguste stiffened i am a st gre monsieur le marquis i am afred of nothings i answered he tek me to the king i am made lieutenant the mob come and the king and queen are carry off to paris the king is prisoner monsieur le marquis goes back to the chateau de st gre france is a republic monsieurque voulezvous the sieur de st gre shrugged his shoulders i too become republican i become officier in the national guardone must move with the time is it not so monsieur i deman of you if you ever expec to see a st gre a republican  i expressed my astonishment  i give up my right my principle my family i come to americai go to new orleans where i have influence and i stir up revolution for france for liberty is it not noble cause  i had it on the tip of my tongue to ask monsieur auguste why he left france but the uselessness of it was apparent  you see monsieur i am justify before you before my friensthat is all i care and he gave another shrug in defiance of the world at large what i have done i have done for principle if i remain royalist i might have marry my cousin mademoiselle de st gre ha monsieur you rememberthe miniature you were so kin as to borrow me four hundred livres  i remember i said  it is because i have much confidence in you monsieur he said it is because i gopeutetreto dangere to death that i come here and ask you to do me a favor  you honor me too much monsieur i answered though i could scarce refrain from smiling  it is because of your charactair monsieur auguste was good enough to say you are to be repose in you are to be rely on sometime i think you ver ole man and this is why and sence you laik objects of art that i bring this and ask you keep it while i am in dangere  i was mystified he thrust his hand into his coat and drew forth an oval object wrapped in dirty paper and then disclosed to my astonished eyes the miniature of mademoiselle de st grethe miniature i say for the gold back and setting were lacking auguste had retained only the ivorywhether from sentiment or necessity i will not venture the sight of it gave me a strange sensation and i can scarcely write of the anger and disgust which surged over me of the longing to snatch it from his trembling fingers suddenly i forgot auguste in the lady herself there was something emblematical in the misfortune which had bereft the picture of its setting even so the revolution had taken from her a brilliant life a king and queen home and friends yet the spirit remained unquenchable set above its mean surroundingsay and untouched by them i was filled with a painful curiosity to know what had become of her which i repressed augustes voice aroused me  ah monsieur is it not a face to love to adore  it is a face to obey i answered with some heat and with more truth than i knew  mon dieu monsieur it is so it is that mek me loveyou know not how you know not what love is monsieur reetchie you never love laik me you have not sem risson monsieur he continued leaning forward and putting his hand on my knee i think she love mei am not sure i should not be surprise but monsieur le marquis her father he trit me ver bad monsieur le marquis is guillotine now i mus not spik evil of him but he marry her to one ol garcon le vicomte divryletour  so mademoiselle is married i said after a pause  oui she is madame la vicomtesse now i fall at her feet jus the sem i hear of her once at bel oeil the chateau of monsieur le prince de ligne in flander after that they go i know not where they are exilelos to me he sighed and held out the miniature to me monsieur i esk you favor will you be as kin and keep it for me again  i have wondered many times since why i did not refuse suffice it to say that i took it and augustes face lighted up  i am a thousan times gretful he cried and added as though with an afterthought monsieur would you be so kin as to borrow me fif dollars    chapter iv of a sudden resolution  it was nearly morning when i fell asleep in my chair from sheer exhaustion for the day before had been a hard one even for me i awoke with a start and sat for some minutes trying to collect my scattered senses the sun streamed in at my open door the birds hopped on the lawn and the various sounds of the bustling life of the little town came to me from beyond suddenly with a glimmering of the mad events of the night i stood up walked uncertainly into the back room and stared at the bed  it was empty i went back into the outer room my eye wandered from the shattered whiskey bottle which was still on the floor to the table littered with mrs temples letters and there in the midst of them lay a note addressed with my name in a big unformed hand i opened it mechanically     dear davyso it rani have gone away i cannot tell you where    some day i will come back and you will forgive me god bless you                     nick  he had gone away to new orleans i had long ceased trying to account for nicks actions but the more i reflected the more incredible it seemed to me that he should have gone there of all places and yet i had had it from clarks own lips indiscreet enough now that nick and st gre were to prepare the way for an insurrection there my thoughts ran on to other possibilities would he see his mother but he had no reason to know that mrs temple was still in new orleans then my glance fell on her letters lying open on the table had he read them i put this down as improbable for he was a man who held strictly to a point of honor  and then there was antoinette de st gre i ceased to conjecture here dashed some water in my eyes pulled myself together and seizing my hat hurried out into the street i made a sufficiently indecorous figure as i ran towards the waterside barely nodding to my acquaintances on the way it was a fresh morning a river breeze stirred the waters of the bear grass and as i stood scanning the line of boats there i heard footsteps behind me i turned to confront a little man with grizzled chestnut eyebrows he was none other than the citizen gignoux  you tek ze air monsieur reetchie said he you look for some one yes you git up too late see him off  i made a swift resolve never to quibble with this man  so mr temple has gone to new orleans with the sieur de st gre i said  citizen gignoux laid a fat finger on one side of his great nose the nose was red and shiny i remember and glistened in the sunlight  ah said he tis no use tryin hide from you however monsieur reetchie you are the ver soul of honor and then your frien i know you not betray the sieur de st gre he is ver fon of you  betray i exclaimed there is no question of betrayal as far as i can see your plans are carried on openly with a fine contempt for the federal government  he shrugged his shoulders  tis not my doin he said but i amwhat you call ita cipher sicrecy is what i believe but drink too much talk too muchis it not so monsieur and if monsieur le baron de carondelet ze governor hear they are in new orleans i think they go to havana or brazil he smiled but perhaps the expression of my face caused him to sober abruptly it is necessair for the cause we must have good revolution in louisiane  a suspicion of this man came over me for a childlike simplicity characterized the other ringleaders in this expedition clark had had acumen once and lost it st gre was a fool nick temple was leading purposely a reckless life the citizens sullivan and depeau had to say the least a limited knowledge of affairs all of these were responding more or less sincerely to the cry of the people of kentucky every day more passionate that something be done about louisiana but gignoux seemed of a different feather moreover he had been too shrewd to deny what colonel clark would have denied in a soberer momentthat st gre and nick had gone to new orleans  you not spik monsieur you not think they have success you are not federalist no for i hear you march las night with your frieni hear you wave torch  you make it your business to hear a great deal monsieur gignoux i retorted my temper slipping a little  he hastened to apologize  mille pardons monsieur he said i see you are federalistbut drunk is it not so monsieur you tink this ver silly thingthis expedition  whatever i think monsieur i answered i am a friend of general clarks  an enemy of ze cause he put in  monsieur i said if president washington and general wayne do not think it worth while to interfere with your plans neither do i  i left him abruptly and went back to my longdelayed affairs with a heavy heart the more i thought the more criminally foolish nicks journey seemed to me however puerile the undertaking de lemos at natchez and carondelet at new orleans had not the reputation of sleeping at their posts and their hatred for americans was well known i sought general clark but he had gone to knob licks and in my anxiety i lay awake at nights tossing in my bed  one evening perhaps four days after nicks departure i went into the common room of the tavern and there i was surprised to see an old friend his square saffron face was just the same his little jet eyes snapped as brightly as ever his hairwhich was swept high above his forehead and tied in an eelskin behindwas as black as when i had seen it at kaskaskia i had met monsieur vigo many times since for he was a familiar figure amongst the towns of the ohio and the mississippi and from vincennes to anse a la graisse and even to new orleans his reputation as a financier was greater than ever he was talking to my friend mr marshall but he rose when he saw me with a beaming smile  ha it is davy he cried but not the sem lil drummer boy who would not come into my store reech lawyer nowi hear you make much money now davy  congress money i said  monsieur vigo threw out his hands and laughed exactly as he had done in his log store at kaskaskia  congress have never repay me one sou said monsieur vigo making a face i have tryi have talki have representit is no good davy it is your fault you tell me tek dat money you call dat finance  david said mr marshall sharply what the devil is this i hear of your carrying a torch in a jacobin procession  you may put it down to liquor mr marshall i answered  then you must have had a cask egad said mr marshall for i never saw you drunk  i laughed  i shall not attempt to explain it sir i answered  you must not allow your drum to drag you into bad company again said he and resumed his conversation as i suspected it was a vigorous condemnation of general clark and his new expedition i expressed my belief that the government did not regard it seriously and would forbid the enterprise at the proper time  you are right sir said mr marshall bringing down his fist on the table i have private advices from philadelphia that the presidents consideration for governor shelby is worn out and that he will issue a proclamation within the next few days warning all citizens at their peril from any connection with the pirates  i laughed  as a matter of fact mr marshall said i citizen genet has been liberal with nothing except commissions and they have neither money nor men  the rascals have all left town said mr marshall citizen quartermaster depeau their local financier has gone back to his store at knob licks the sieur de st gre and a mr temple as doubtless you know have gone to new orleans and the most mysterious and therefore the most dangerous of the lot citizen gignoux has vanished like an evil spirit it is commonly supposed that he too has gone down the river you may see him vigo said mr marshall turning to the trader he is a little man with a big nose and grizzled chestnut eyebrows  ah i know a lil bout him said monsieur vigo he was on my boat two days ago asking me questions  the devil he was said mr marshall  i had another disquieting night and by the morning i had made up my mind the sun was glinting on the placid waters of the river when i made my way down to the bank to a great tenoared keel boat that lay on the bear grass with its square sail furled an awning was stretched over the deck and at a walnut table covered with papers sat monsieur vigo smoking his morning pipe  davy said he you have come a la bonne heure at ten i depart for new orleans he sighed it is so long voyage he added and so lonely one sometime i have the good fortune to pick up a companion but not today  do you want me to go with you i said  he looked at me incredulously  i should be delighted he said but you mek a jest  i was never more serious in my life i answered for i have business in new orleans i shall be ready  ha cried monsieur vigo hospitably i shall be enchant we will talk philosophe beaumarchais voltaire rousseau  for monsieur vigo was a great reader and we had often indulged in conversation which we flattered ourselves had a literary turn  i spent the remaining hours arranging with a young lawyer of my acquaintance to look after my business and at ten oclock i was aboard the keel boat with my small baggage at eleven monsieur vigo and i were talking philosophe over a wonderful breakfast under the awning as we dropped down between the forestlined shores of the ohio my host travelled in luxury and we ate the creole dishes which his cook prepared with silver forks which he kept in a great chest in the cabin  you who read this may feel something of my impatience to get to new orleans and hence i shall not give a long account of the journey what a contrast it was to that which nick and i had taken five years before in monsieur gratiots fur boat like all successful creole traders monsieur vigo had a wonderful knack of getting on with the indians and often when we tied up of a night the chief men of a tribe would come down to greet him we slipped southward on the great yellow river which parted the wilderness with its sucks and eddies and green islands every one of which monsieur knew and i saw again the flocks of waterfowl and herons in procession and hawks and vultures wheeling in their search sometimes a favorable wind sprang up and we hoisted the sail we passed the walnut hills the nogales the moans of the alligators broke our sleep by night and at length we came to natchez ruled over now by that watchdog of the spanish king gayoso de lemos thanks to monsieur vigo his manners were charming and his hospitality gracious and there was no trouble whatever about my passport  our progress was slow when we came at last to the belvedered plantation houses amongst the orange groves and as we sat on the wide galleries in the summer nights we heard all the latest gossip of the capital of louisiana the river was low there was an ominous quality in the heat which had its effect indeed upon me and made the old creoles shake their heads and mutter a word with a terrible meaning new orleans was a cesspool said the enlightened the baron de carondelet indefatigable man aimed at digging a canal to relieve the city of its filth but this would be the year when it was most needed and it was not dug yes monsieur le baron was energy itself that other feverthe political onehe had scotched ca ira and la marseillaise had been sung in the theatres but not often for the baron had sent the alcaldes to shut them up certain gentlemen of french ancestry had gone to languish in the morro at havana yes monsieur de carondelet though fat was on horseback before dawn new orleans was fortified as it never had been before the militia organized real cannon were on the ramparts which could shoot at a pinch  sub rosa i found much sympathy among the planters with the rights of man what had become they asked of the expedition of citizen general clark preparing in the north they may have sighed secretly when i painted it in its true colors but they loved peace these planters strangely enough the name of auguste de st gre never crossed their lips and i got no trace of him or nick at any of these places was it possible that they might not have come to new orleans after all  through the days when the sun beat upon the awning with a tropical fierceness when monsieur vigo abandoned himself to his siestas i thought it was perhaps characteristic of me that i waited nearly three weeks to confide in my old friend the purpose of my journey to new orleans it was not because i could not trust him that i held my tongue but because i sought some way of separating the more intimate story of nicks mother and his affair with antoinette de st gre from the rest of the story but monsieur vigo was a man of importance in louisiana and i reflected that a time might come when i should need his help one evening when we were tied up under the oaks of a bayou i told him there emanated from monsieur vigo a sympathy which few men possess and this i felt strongly as he listened breaking his silence only at long intervals to ask a question it was a still night i remember of great beauty with a wisp of a moon hanging over the forest line the air heavy with odors and vibrant with a thousand insect tones  and what you do davy he said at length  i must find my cousin and st gre before they have a chance to get into much mischief i answered if they have already made a noise i thought of going to the baron de carondelet and telling him what i know of the expedition he will understand what st gre is and i will explain that mr temples reckless love of adventure is at the bottom of his share in the matter  bon davy said my host if you go i go with you but i believe ze baron think morro good place for them jus the sem ze baron has been make miserable with jacobins but i go with you if you go  he discoursed for some time upon the quality of the st gres their public services and before he went to sleep he made the very just remark that there was a flaw in every string of beads as for me i went down into the cabin surreptitiously lighted a candle and drew from my pocket that piece of ivory which had so strangely come into my possession once more the face upon it had haunted me since i had first beheld it the miniature was wrapped now in a silk handkerchief which polly ann had bought for me in lexington shall i confess iti had carefully rubbed off the discolorations on the ivory at the back and the picture lacked now only the gold setting as for the face i had a kind of consolation from it i seemed to draw of its strength when i was tired of its courage when i faltered and during those four days of indecision in louisville it seemed to say to me in words that i could not evade or forget go to new orleans it was a sentimentfoolish if you pleasewhich could not resist nay which i did not try to resist for i had little enough of it in my life what did it matter i should never see madame la vicomtesse divryletour  she was helene to me and the artist had caught the strength of her soul in her clearcut face in the eyes that flashed with wit and courageeyes that seemed to look with scorn upon what was mean in the world and untrue with pity on the weak here was one who might have governed a province and still have been a woman one who had taken into exile the best of safeguards against misfortunehumor and an indomitable spirit    chapter v the house of the honeycombed tiles  as long as i live i shall never forget that sunday morning of my second arrival at new orleans a saffron heathaze hung over the river and the city robbed alike from the yellow waters of the one and the pestilent moisture of the other it would have been strange indeed if this capital of louisiana brought hither to a swamp from the sands of biloxi many years ago by the energetic bienville were not visited from time to time by the scourge  again i saw the green villas on the outskirts the verduredotted expanse of roofs of the city behind the levee bank the line of kentucky boats keel boats and barges which brought our own resistless commerce hither in the teeth of royal mandates farther out and tugging fretfully in the yellow current were the aliens of the blue seas highhulled their tracery of masts and spars shimmering in the heat a fullrigged ocean packet from spain a barque and brigantine from the west indies a rakish slaver from africa with her waterline dry discharged but yesterday of a teeming horror of freight i looked again upon the familiar rows of trees which shaded the gravelled promenades where nick had first seen antoinette then we were under it for the river was low and the dingyuniformed officer was bowing over our passports beneath the awning we walked ashore monsieur vigo and i and we joined a staring group of keel boatmen and rivermen under the willows  below us the white shell walks of the place darmes were thronged with gayly dressed people over their heads rose the fine new cathedral built by the munificence of don andreas almonaster and beside that the manywindowed heavyarched cabildo nearly finished which will stand for all time a monument to spanish builders  it is corpus christi day said monsieur vigo let us go and see the procession  here once more were the brightturbaned negresses the gay creole gowns and scarfs the linenjacketed broadhatted merchants with those of soberer and more conventional dress laughing and chatting the children playing despite the heat many of these people greeted monsieur vigo there were the saturnine longcloaked spaniards too and a greater number than i had believed of my own keenfaced countrymen lounging about mildly amused by the scene we crossed the square and with the courtesy of their race the people made way for us in the press and we were no sooner placed ere the procession came out of the church flaming soldiers of the governors guard two by two sober sandalled friars in brown priests in their robesanother batch of color crosses shimmering tapers emerging from the cool darkness within to pale by the light of day then down on their knees to him who sits high above the yellow haze fell the thousands in the place darmes for here was the host itself flowerdecked in white and crimson its goldtasselled canopy upheld by four tonsured priests a sheen of purple under itthe bishop of louisiana in his robes  the governor whispered monsieur vigo and the word was passed from mouth to mouth as the people rose from their knees francois louis hector baron de carondelet resplendent in his uniform of colonel in the royal army of spain his orders glittering on his breastpillar of royalty and enemy to the rights of man his eye was stern his carriage erect but i seemed to read in his careworn face the trials of three years in this moist capital after the governor one by one the waiting associations fell in line each with its own distinguishing sash so the procession moved off into the narrow streets of the city the people in the place dispersed to new vantage points and monsieur vigo signed me to follow him  i have a frien la veuve gravois who lives ver quiet she have one room and i ask her tek you in davy he led the way through the empty rue chartres turned to the right at the rue bienville and stopped before an unpretentious house some three doors from the corner madame gravois elderly wizened primp in a starched cotton gown opened the door herself fell upon monsieur vigo in the creole fashion and within a quarter of an hour i was installed in her best room which gave out on a little court behind monsieur vigo promised to send his servant with my baggage told me his address bade me call on him for what i wanted and took his leave  first there was madame gravois story to listen to as she bustled about giving orders to a kinkyhaired negro girl concerning my dinner then came the dinner excellentif i could have eaten it the virtues of the former monsieur gravois were legion he had come to louisiana from toulon planted indigo fought a duel and madame was a widow so i condense two hours into two lines happily madame was not proof against the habits of the climate and she retired for her siesta i sought my room almost suffocated by a heat which defies my pen to describe a heat reeking with moisture sucked from the foul kennels of the city i had felt nothing like it in my former visit to new orleans it seemed to bear down upon my brain to clog the power of thought to make me vacillating hitherto my reasoning had led me to seek monsieur de st gre to count upon that gentlemans common sense and his former friendship but now that the time had come for it i shrank from such a meeting i remembered his passionate affection for antoinette i imagined that he would not listen calmly to one who was in some sort connected with her unhappiness so a kind of cowardice drove me first to mrs temple she might know much that would save me useless trouble and blundering  the shadows of treetop thatch and wall were lengthening as i walked along the rue bourbon heedless of what the morrow might bring forth the street was given over to festivity merry groups were gathered on the corners songs and laughter mingled in the courtyards billiard balls clicked in the cabarets a fat jolly little frenchman surrounded by tripping children sat in his doorway on the edge of the banquette fiddling with all his might pausing only to wipe the beads of perspiration from his face  madame clive mais oui monsieur l petite maison en face smiling benignly at the children he began to fiddle once more  the little house opposite mrs temple mistress of temple bow had come to this it was a strange little home indeed spanish onestory its dormers hidden by a honeycombed screen of terracotta tiles this screen was set on the extreme edge of the roof which overhung the banquette and shaded the yellow adobe wall of the house low unpretentious the latticed shutters of its two windows giving it but a scant air of privacyindeed they were scarred by the raps of careless passersby on the sidewalk the two little battened doors one step up were closed i rapped waited and rapped again the musician across the street stopped his fiddling glanced at me smiled knowingly at the children and they paused in their dance to stare then one of the doors was pushed open a scant four inches a scarlet madras handkerchief appeared in the crack above a yellow face there was a long moment of silence during which i felt the scrutiny of a pair of sharp black eyes  what yo want marse  the womans voice astonished me for she spoke the dialect of the american tidewater  i should like to see mrs clive i answered  the door closed a shade  mistis sick she aint see nobody said the woman she closed the door a little more and i felt tempted to put my foot in the crack  tell her that mr david ritchie is here i said  there was an instants silence then an exclamation  lan sakes is you marse dave she opened the doorfurtively i thoughtjust wide enough for me to pass through i found myself in a lowceiled darkened room opposite a trim negress who stood with her arms akimbo and stared at me  marse dave you doan reclect me ise lindy ise breeds daughter i reclect you when you was at temple bow marse dave how youse done growed yassir when i heerd from miss sally i done comed here to tek cyar ob her  how is your mistress i asked  she poly marse dave said lindy and paused for adequate words i took note

to her lips dars de mistis  the door into the back room opened and mrs temple stood on the threshold staring with uncertain eyes into the semidarkness  lindy she said what have you done  miss sally lindy began and looked at me but i could not speak for looking at the lady in the doorway  who is it she said again and her hand sought the doorpost tremblingly who is it  then i went to her at my first step she gave a little cry and swayed and had i not taken her in my arms i believe she would have fallen  david she said david is it you ii cannot see very well why did you not speak she looked at lindy and smiled it is because i am an old woman lindy and she lifted her hand to her forehead see my hair is whitei shock you david  leaning on my shoulder she led me through a little bedroom in the rear into a tiny garden court beyond a court teeming with lavish colors and redolent with the scent of flowers a white shell walk divided the garden and ended at the door of a low outbuilding from the chimney of which blue smoke curled upward in the evening air mrs temple drew me almost fiercely towards a bench against the adobe wall  where is he she said where is he david  the suddenness of the question staggered me i hesitated  i do not know i answered  i could not look into her face and say it the years of torment and suffering were written there in characters not to be mistaken sarah temple the beauty was dead indeed the hope which threatened to light again the dead fires in the womans eyes frightened me  ah she said sharply you are deceiving me it is not like you david you are deceiving me tell me tell me for the love of god who has brought me to bear chastisement and she gripped my arm with a strength i had not thought in her  listen i said trying to calm myself as well as her listen mrs temple i could not bring myself to call her otherwise  you are keeping him away from me she cried why are you keeping him away have i not suffered enough david i cannot live long i do not dare to dieuntil he has forgiven me  i forced her gently as i might to sit on the bench and i seated myself beside her  listen i said with a sternness that hid my feelings and perforce her expression changed again to a sad yearning you must hear me and you must trust me for i have never pretended you shall see him if it is in my power  she looked at me so piteously that i was near to being unmanned  i will trust you she whispered  i have seen him i said she started violently but i laid my hand on hers and by some selfmastery that was still in her she was silent i saw him in louisville a month ago when i returned from a years visit to philadelphia  i could not equivocate with this woman i could no more lie to her sorrow than to the judgment why had i not foreseen her question  and he hates me she spoke with a calmness now that frightened me more than her agitation had done  i do not know i answered when i would have spoken to him he was gone  he was drunk she said i stared at her in frightened wonderment he was drunkit is better than if he had cursed me he did not mention me or any one  he did not i answered  she turned her face away  go on i will listen to you she said and sat immovable through the whole of my story though her hand trembled in mine and while i live i hope never to have such a thing to go through with again truth held me to the full ludicrous tragedy of the tale to the cheap character of my old colonels undertaking to the incident of the drum to the conversation in my room likewise truth forbade me to rekindle her hope i did not tell her that nick had come with st gre to new orleans for of this my own knowledge was as yet not positive for a long time after i had finished she was silent  and you think the expedition will not get here she asked finally in a dead voice  i am positive of it i answered and for the sake of those who are engaged in it it is mercifully best that it should not the day may come i added for the sake of leading her away when kentucky will be strong enough to overrun louisiana but not now  she turned to me with a trace of her former fierceness  why are you in new orleans she demanded  a sudden resolution came to me then  to bring you back with me to kentucky i answered she shook her head sadly but i continued i have more to say i am convinced that neither nick nor you will be happy until you are mother and son again you have both been wanderers long enough  once more she turned away and fell into a revery over the housetop from across the street came the gay music of the fiddler mrs temple laid her hand gently on my shoulder  my dear she said smiling i could not live for the journey  you must live for it i answered you have the will you must live for it for his sake  she shook her head and smiled at me with a courage which was the crown of her sufferings  you are talking nonsense david she said it is not like you come she said rising with something of her old manner i must show you what i have been doing all these years you must admire my garden  i followed her marvelling along the shell path and there came unbidden to my mind the garden at temple bow where she had once been wont to sit tormenting mr mason or bending to the tale of harry riddles love little she cared for flowers in those days and now they had become her life with such thoughts in my mind i listened unheeding to her talk the place was formerly occupied by a shiftless fellow a tailor and the court now a paradise had been a rubbish heap that orange tree which shaded the uneven doorway of the kitchen she had found here figs pomegranates magnolias the camellias dazzling in their purity the bloodred oleanders the pink roses that hid the crumbling adobe and climbed even to the sloping tilesall these had been set out and cared for with her own hands ay and the fragrant bed of yellow jasmine over which she lingeredantoinettes favorite flower  antoinettes flowers that she wore in her hair in her letters mrs temple had never mentioned antoinette and now she read the question perchance purposely put there in my eyes her voice faltered sadly scarce a week had she been in the house before antoinette had found her  ii sent the girl away david she came without monsieur de st gres knowledge without his consent it is natural that he thinks mei will not say what i sent antoinette away she clung to me she would not go and i had to becruel it is one of the things which make the nights longso long my sins have made her life unhappy  and you hear of her she is not married i asked  no she is not married said mrs temple stooping over the jasmines then she straightened and faced me her voice shaken with earnestness david do you think that nick still loves her  alas i could not answer that she bent over the jasmines again  there were five years that i knew nothing she continued i did not dare ask mr clark who comes to me on business as you know it was mr clark who brought back lindy on one of his trips to charleston and then one day in march of this year madame de montmery came  madame de montmery i repeated  it is a strange story said mrs temple lindy had never admitted any one save mr clark one day early in the spring when i was trimming my roses by the wall there the girl ran to me and said that a lady wished to see me why had she let her in lindy did not know she could not refuse her had the lady demanded admittance lindy thought that i would like to see her david it was a providential weakness or curiosity that prompted me to go into the front room and then i saw why lindy had opened the door to her who she is or what she is i do not know to this day who am i now that i should inquire i know that she is a lady that she has exquisite manners that i feel now that i cannot live without her she comes every week sometimes twice she brings me little delicacies new seeds for my garden but best of all she brings me herself and i am always counting the days until she comes again yes and i always fear that she too will be taken away from me  i had not heard the sound of voices but mrs temple turned startled and looked towards the house i followed her glance and suddenly i knew that my heart was beating    chapter vi madame la vicomtesse  hesitating on the step a lady stood in the vinecovered doorway a study in black and white in a frame of pink roses the sash at her waist the lace mantilla that clung about her throat the deftly coiled hair with its sheen of the night watersthese in black the simple gowna tribute to the art of her countrywomenin white  mrs temple had gone forward to meet her but i stood staring marvelling forgetful in the path they were talking they were coming towards me and i heard mrs temple pronounce my name and hersmadame de montmery i bowed she courtesied there was a baffling light in the ladys brown eyes when i dared to glance at them and a smile playing around her mouth was there no word in the two languages to find its way to my lips mrs temple laid her hand on my arm  david is not what one might call a ladies man madame she said  the lady laughed  isnt he she said  i am sure you will frighten him with your wit answered mrs temple smiling he is worth sparing  he is worth frightening then said the lady in exquisite english and she looked at me again  you and david should like each other said mrs temple you are both capable persons friends of the friendless and towers of strength to the weak  the ladys face became serious but still there was the expression i could not make out in an instant she seemed to have scrutinized me with a precision from which there could be no appeal  i seem to know mr ritchie she said and added quickly mrs clive has talked a great deal about you she has made you out a very wonderful person  my dear said mrs temple the wonderful people of this world are those who find time to comfort and help the unfortunate that is why you and david are wonderful no one knows better than i how easy it is to be selfish  i have brought you an english novel said madame de montomery turning abruptly to mrs temple but you must not read it at night lindy is not to let you have it until tomorrow  there said mrs temple gayly to me madame is not happy unless she is controlling some one and i am a rebellious subject  you have not been taking care of yourself said madame she glanced at me and bit her lips as though guessing the emotion which my visit had caused listen she said the vesper bells you must go into the house and mr ritchie and i must leave you  she took mrs temple by the arm and led her unresisting along the path i followed a thousand thoughts and conjectures spinning in my brain they reached the bench under the little tree beside the door and stood talking for a moment of the routine of mrs temples life madame it seemed had prescribed a regimen and meant to have it followed suddenly i saw mrs temple take the ladys arm and sink down upon the bench then we were both beside her bending over her she sitting upright and smiling at us  it is nothing she said i am so easily tired  her lips were ashen and her breath came quickly madame acted with that instant promptness which i expected of her  you must carry her in mr ritchie she said quietly  no it is only momentary david said mrs temple i remember how pitifully frail and light she was as i picked her up and followed madame through the doorway into the little bedroom i laid mrs temple on the bed  send lindy here said madame  lindy was in the front room with the negress whom madame had brought with her they were not talking i supposed then this was because lindy did not speak french i did not know that madame de montmerys maid was a mute both of them went into the bedroom and i was left alone the door and windows were closed and a green myrtleberry candle was burning on the table i looked about me with astonishment but for the low ceiling and the wide cypress puncheons of the floor the room might have been a boudoir in a manorhouse on the slenderlegged polished mahogany table lay books in tasteful bindings a diamondpaned bookcase stood in the corner a fauteuil and various other chairs which might have come from the hands of an adam were ranged about tall silver candlesticks graced each end of the little mantelshelf and between them were two lowestoft vases having the temple coat of arms  it might have been half an hour that i waited now pacing the floor now throwing myself into the armchair by the fireplace anxiety for mrs temple problems that lost themselves in a dozen conjectures all idlethese agitated me almost beyond my power of selfcontrol once i felt for the miniature took it out and put it back without looking at it at last i was startled to my feet by the opening of the door and madame de montmery came in she closed the door softly behind her with the deft quickness and decision of movement which a sixth sense had told me she possessed crossed the room swiftly and stood confronting me  she is easy again now she said simply it is one of her attacks i wish you might have seen me before you told her what you had to say to her  i wish indeed that i had known you were here  she ignored this whether intentionally i know not  it is her heart poor lady i am afraid she cannot live long she seated herself in one of the straight chairs sit down mr ritchie she said i am glad you waited i wanted to talk with you  i thought that you might madame la vicomtesse i answered  she made no gesture either of surprise or displeasure  so you knew she said quietly  i knew you the moment you appeared in the doorway i replied it was not just what i meant to say  there flashed over her face that expression of the miniature the mouth repressing the laughter in the brown eyes  montmery is one of my husbands places she said when antoinette asked me to come here and watch over mrs temple i chose the name  and mrs temple has never suspected you  i think not she thinks i came at mr clarks request and being a lady she does not ask questions she accepts me for what i appear to be  it seemed so strange to me to be talking here in new orleans in this little spanish house with a french vicomtesse brought up near the court of the unfortunate marie antoinette nay with helene de st gre whose portrait had twice come into my life by a kind of strange fatality and was at that moment in my pocket that i could scarce maintain my selfpossession in her presence i had given the portrait too attributes and a character and i found myself watching the lady with a breathless interest lest she should fail in any of these in the intimacy of the little room i felt as if i had known her always and again that she was as distant from me and my life as the court from which she had come i found myself glancing continually at her face on which the candlelight shone the vicomtesse might have been four and twenty save for the soberer gown she wore she seemed scarce older than the young girl in the miniature who had the presence of a woman of the world suddenly i discovered with a flush that she was looking at me intently without embarrassment but with an expression that seemed to hint of humor in the situation to my astonishment she laughed a little  you are a very odd person mr ritchie she said i have heard so much of you from mrs temple from antoinette that i know something of your strange life after all she added with a trace of sadness it has been no stranger than my own first i will answer your questions and then i shall ask some  but i have asked no questions madame la vicomtesse i said  and you are a very simple person mr ritchie continued madame la vicomtesse smiling it is what i had been led to suppose a serious person as the friend of mr nicholas temple as the relation and may i say benefactor of this poor lady here it is fitting that you should know certain things i will not weary you with the reasons and events which led to my coming from europe to new orleans except to say that i like all of my class who have escaped the horrors of the revolution am a wanderer and grateful to monsieur de st gre for the shelter he gives me his letter reached me in england and i arrived three months ago  she hesitatednay i should rather say paused for there was little hesitation in what she did she paused as though weighing what she was to say next  when i came to les iles i saw that there was a sorrow weighing upon the family and it took no great astuteness on my part mr ritchie to discover that antoinette was the cause of it one has only to see antoinette to love her i wondered why she had not married and yet i saw that there had been an affair it seemed very strange to me mr ritchie for with us you understand marriages are arranged antoinette really has beauty she is the daughter of a man of importance in the colony her strength of character saves her from being listless i found a girl with originality of expression with a sense of the fitness of things devoted to charitable works who had not taken the veil that was on her fathers account as you know they are inseparable monsieur philippe de st gre is a remarkable man with certain vigorous ideas not in accordance with the customs of his neighbors it was he who first confided in me that he would not force antoinette to marry it was she at length who told me the story of nicholas temple and his mother she paused again and reading between the lines i perceived that madame la vicomtesse had become essential to the household at les iles philippe de st gre was not a man to misplace a confidence  it was then that i first heard of you mr ritchie and of the part which you played in that affair it was then i had my first real insight into antoinettes character her affection for mrs temple astonished me bewildered me the woman had deceived her and her family and yet antoinette gave up her lover because he would not take his mother back had mrs temple been willing to return to les iles after you had providentially taken her away they would have received her philippe de st gre is not a man to listen to criticism as it was antoinette did not rest until she found where mrs temple had hidden herself and then she came here to her it is not for us to judge any of them in sending antoinette away the poor lady denied herself the only consolation that was left to her antoinette understood every week she has had news of mrs temple from mr clark and when i came and learned her trouble antoinette begged me to come here and be mrs temples friend mr ritchie she is a very ill woman and a very sad womanthe saddest woman i have ever known and i have seen many  and mademoiselle de st gre i asked  tell me about this man for whom antoinette has ruined her life said madame la vicomtesse brusquely is he worth it no no man is worth what she has suffered what has become of him where is he did you not tell her that you would bring him back  i said that i would bring him back if i could i answered and i meant it madame  madame la vicomtesse bit her lip had she known me better she might have smiled as for me i was wholly puzzled to account for these fleeting changes in her humor  you have taken a great deal upon your shoulders mr ritchie she said they are from all accounts broad ones there i was wrong to be indignant in your presenceyou who seem to have spent your life in trying to get others out of difficulties mercy she said with a quick gesture at my protest there are few men with whom one might talk thus in so short an acquaintance i love the girl and i cannot help being angry with mr temple i suppose there is something to be said on his side let us hear iti dare say he could not have a better advocate she finished with an indefinable smile  i began at the wrong end of my narrative and it was some time before i had my facts arranged in proper sequence i could not forget that madame la vicomtesse was looking at me fixedly i reviewed nicks neglected childhood painted as well as i might his temperament and characterhis generosity and fearlessness his recklessness and improvidence his loyalty to those he loved his detestation of those he hated i told how under these conditions the sins and vagaries of his parents had gone far to wreck his life at the beginning of it i told how i had found him again with sevier how he had come to new orleans with me the first time how he had loved antoinette and how he had disappeared after the dreadful scene in the garden at les iles how i had not seen him again for five years here i hesitated little knowing how to tell the vicomtesse of that affair in louisville though i had a sense that i could not keep the truth from so discerning a person i was startled to find this to be so  yes yes i understand she said quickly and in the morning he had flown with that most worthy of my relatives auguste de st gre  i looked at her finding no words to express my astonishment at this perspicacity  and now what do you intend to do she asked find him in new orleans if you can of course but how she rose quickly went to the fireplace and stood for a moment with her back to me suddenly she turned it ought not to be difficult after all auguste de st gre is a fool and he confirms what you say of the expedition he is indeed a pretty person to choose for an intrigue of this kind and your cousinwhat shall we call him  to say the least secrecy is not nicks forte i answered catching her mood  she was silent awhile  it would be a blessing if monsieur le baron could hang auguste privately as for your cousin he may be worth saving after all i know monsieur de carondelet and he has no patience with conspirators of this sort i think he would not hesitate to make examples of them however we will try to save them  we i repeated unwittingly  madame la vicomtesse looked at me and laughed out right  yes she said you will do some things i others there are the gaming clubs with their ridiculous names lamour la mignonne la desiree she counted them reflectively on her fingers both of our gentlemen might be tempted into one of these you will drop into them mr ritchie then there is madame bouvets  auguste would scarcely go there i objected  ah said madame la vicomtesse but madame bouvet will know the names of some of augustes intimates this bouvet is evidently a good person perhaps she will do more for you i understand that she has a weak spot in her heart for auguste  madame la vicomtesse turned her back again had she heard how madame bouvet had begged me to buy the miniature  have you any other suggestions to make she said putting a foot on the fender  they have all been yours so far i answered  and yet you are a man of action of expedients she murmured without turning where are your wits mr ritchie have you any plan  i have been so used to rely on myself madame i replied  that you do not like to have your affairs meddled with by a woman she said into the fireplace  i give you the credit to believe that you are too clever to misunderstand me madame i said you must know that your help is most welcome  at that she swung around and regarded me strangely mirth lurking in her eyes she seemed about to retort and then to conquer the impulse the effect of this was to make me anything but selfcomplacent she sat down in the chair and for a little while she was silent  suppose we do find them she said suddenly what shall we do with them she looked up at me questioningly seriously is it likely that your mr temple will be reconciled with his mother is it likely that he is still in love with antoinette  i think it is likely that he is still in love with mademoiselle de st gre i answered though i have no reason for saying so  you are very honest mr ritchie we must look at this problem from all sides if he is not reconciled with his mother antoinette will not receive him and if he is we have the question to consider whether he is still worthy of her the agents of providence must not be heedless she added with a smile  i am sure that nick would alter his life if it became worth living i said i will answer for that much  then he must be reconciled with his mother she replied with decision mrs temple has suffered enough and he must be found before he gets sufficiently into the bad graces of the baron de carondeletthese two things are clear she rose come here tomorrow evening at the same time  she started quickly for the bedroom door but something troubled me still  madame i said  yes she answered turning quickly  i did not know how to begin there were many things i wished to say to know but she was a woman whose mind seemed to leap the chasms whose words touched only upon those points which might not be understood she regarded me with seeming patience  i should think that mrs temple might have recognized you i said for want of a better opening  from the miniature she said  i flushed furiously and it seemed to burn me through the lining of my pocket  that was my salvation she said mrs temple has never seen the miniature i have heard how you rescued it mr ritchie she added with a curious smile monsieur philippe de st gre told me  then he knew i stammered  she laughed  i have told you that you are a very simple person she said even you are not given to intrigues i thank you for rescuing me  i flushed more hotly than before  i never expected to see you i said  it must have been a shock she said  i was dumb i had my hand in my coat i fully intended to give her the miniature it was my plain duty and suddenly overwhelmed i remembered that it was wrapped in polly anns silk handkerchief  madame la vicomtesse remained for a moment where she was  do not do anything until the morning she said you must go back to your lodgings at once  that would be to lose time i answered  you must think of yourself a little she said do as i say i have heard that two cases of the yellow fever have broken out this afternoon and you who are not used to the climate must not be out after dark  and you i said  i am used to it she replied i have been here three months lest anything should happen it might be well for you to give me your address  i am with madame gravois in the rue bienville  madame gravois in the rue bienville she repeated i shall remember a demain monsieur she courtesied and went swiftly into mrs temples room seizing my hat i opened the door and found myself in the dark street    chapter vii the disposal of the sieur de st gre  i had met helene de st gre at last and what a fool she must think me as i hurried along the dark banquettes this thought filled my brain for a time to the exclusion of all others so strongly is vanity ingrained in us after all what did it matter what she thoughtmadame la vicomtesse divryletour i had never shone and it was rather late to begin but i possessed at least average common sense and i had given no proof even of this  i wandered on not heeding the command which she had given meto go home the scent of camellias and magnolias floated on the heavy air of the night from the courtyards reminding me of her laughter and soft voices came from the galleries despite the terror despite the faubourg saintantoine despite the rights of man and the wars and suffering arising therefrom despite the scourge which might come tomorrow life went gayly on the cabarets echoed and behind the tight blinds lines of light showed where the creole gentry gamed at their tables perchance in the very clubs madame la vicomtesse had mentioned  the moon in her first quarter floated in a haze washed by her light the quaintly wrought balconies and heavytiled roofs of the spanish buildings risen from the charred embers took on a touch of romance i paused once with a twinge of remembrance before the long line of the ursuline convent with its latticed belfry against the sky there was the lodge with its iron gates shut and the wall which nick had threatened to climb as i passed the great square of the new barracks a sereno so the night watchmen were called was crying the hour i came to the rambling marketstalls casting black shadows on the river roadempty now to be filled in the morning with shouting marchands the promenade under the willows was deserted the great river stretched away under the moon towards the forest line of the farther shore filmy and indistinct a black wisp of smoke rose from the gunwale of a flatboat and i stopped to listen to the weird song of a negro which i have heard many times since  caroline  in de tois caroline qui ci ca ye comme ca ma chere in de tois caroline quo fair tapes crie ma chere mo laime toe conne ca cest to moule cest to mo prend mo laime toe to conne caa cest to moule cest to mo prend    gaining the promenade i came presently to the new hotel which had been built for the governor with its balconied windows looking across the riverthe mansion of monsieur le baron de carondelet even as i sat on the bench in the shadow of the willows watching the sentry who paced before the arched entrance i caught sight of a man stealing along the banquette on the other side of the road twice he paused to look behind him and when he reached the corner of the street he stopped for some time to survey the governors house opposite  suddenly i was on my feet every sense alert staring in the moonlight made milky by the haze he was indistinct and yet i could have taken oath that the square diminutive figure with the head set forward on the shoulders was gignouxs if this man were not gignoux then the lord had cast two in a strange mould  and what was gignoux doing in new orleans as if in answer to the question two men emerged from the dark archway of the governors house passed the sentry and stood for an instant on the edge of the shadow one wore a long spanish cloak and the other a uniform that i could not make out a word was spoken and then my man was ambling across to meet them and the three walked away up toulouse street  i was in a fire of conjecture i did not dare to pass the sentry and follow them so i made round as fast as i could by the rue st pierre which borders the place darmes and then crossed to toulouse again by chartres the three were nowhere to be seen i paused on the corner for thought and at length came to a reluctant but prudent conclusion that i had best go back to my lodging and seek monsieur early in the morning  madame gravois was awaiting me was monsieur mad to remain out at night had monsieur not heard of the yellow fever madame gravois even had prepared some concoction which she poured out of a bottle and which i took with the docility of a child monsieur vigo had called and there was a note a note it was a small note i glanced stupidly at the seal recognized the swan of the st gre crest broke it and read  mr ritchie will confer a favor upon la vicomtesse divryletour if he will come to monsieur de st gres house at eight tomorrow morning  i bade the reluctant madame gravois good night gained my room threw off my clothes and covered myself with the mosquito bar there was no question of sleep for the events of the day and surmises for the morrow tortured me as i tossed in the heat had the man been gignoux if so he was in league with carondelets police i believed him fully capable of this and if he knew nicks whereabouts and st gres they would both be behind the iron gateway of the calabozo in the morning monsieur vigo had pointed out to me that day the gloomy heavywalled prison in the rear of the cabildoay and he had spoken of its instruments of torture  what could the vicomtesse want truly i thought with remorse she had been more industrious than i  i fell at length into a fevered sleep and awoke athirst with the light trickling through my lattices contrary to madame gravoiss orders i had opened the glass of my window glancing at my watchwhich i had bought in philadelphiai saw that the hands pointed to half after seven i had scarcely finished my toilet before there was a knock at the door and madame gravois entered with a steaming cup of coffee in one hand and her bottle of medicine in the other  i did not wake monsieur she said for he was tired  she gave me another dose of the medicine made me drink two cups of coffee and then i started out with all despatch for the house of the lions as i turned into the rue chartres i saw ahead of me four horses with their bridles bunched and held by a negro lad waiting in the street yes they were in front of the house there it was with its solid green gates between the lions its yellow walls with the fringe of peeping magnolias and oranges with its greenlatticed gallery from which monsieur auguste had let himself down after stealing the miniature i knocked at the wicket the same gardienne answered the call smiled led me through the cool paved archway which held in its frame the green of the court beyond and up the stairs with the quaint balustrade which i had mounted five years before to meet philippe de st gre as i reached the gallery madame la vicomtesse gowned in brown linen for riding rose quickly from her chair and came forward to meet me  you have news i asked as i took her hand  i have the kind of news i expected she answered a smile tempering the gravity of her face auguste is as usual in need of money  then you have found them i answered my voice betraying my admiration for the feat  madame la vicomtesse shrugged her shoulders slightly  i did nothing she said from what you told me i suspected that as soon as auguste reached louisiana he would have a strong desire to go away again this is undoubtedly what has happened in any event i knew that he would want money and that he would apply to a source which has hitherto never failed him  mademoiselle antoinette i said  precisely answered madame la vicomtesse when i reached home last night i questioned antoinette and i discovered that by a singular chance a message from auguste had already reached her  where is he i demanded  i do not know she replied but he will be behind the hedge of the garden at les iles at eleven oclockunless he has lost before then his love of money  which is to say  he will be there unless he is dead that is why i sent for you monsieur she glanced at me sometimes it is convenient to have a man  i was astounded then i smiled the affair was so ridiculously simple  and monsieur de st gre i asked  has been gone for a week with madame to visit the estimable monsieur poydras at pointe coupee madame la vicomtesse who had better use for her words than to waste them at such a time left me went to the balcony and began to give the gardienne in the court below swift directions in french then she turned to me again  are you prepared to ride with antoinette and me to les iles monsieur she asked  i am i answered  it must have been my readiness that made her smile then her eyes rested on mine  you look tired mr ritchie she said you did not obey me and go home last night  how did you know that i asked with a thrill at her interest  because madame gravois told my messenger that you were out  i was silent  you must take care of yourself she said briefly come there are some things which i wish to say to you before antoinette is ready  she led me toward the end of the gallery where a bright screen of morningglories shaded us from the sun but we had scarce reached the place ere the sound of steps made us turn and there was mademoiselle antoinette herself facing us i went forward a few steps hesitated and bowed she courtesied my name faltering on her lips yes it was antoinette not the lighthearted girl whom we had heard singing ma luron in the garden but a woman now with a strange beauty that astonished me hers was the dignity that comes from unselfish service the calm that is far from resignation though the black veil caught up on her chapeau de paille gave her the air of a sister of mercy antoinette had inherited the energies as well as the features of the st gres yet there was a painful moment as she stood there striving to put down the agitation the sight of me gave her as for me i was bereft of speech not knowing what to say or how far to go my last thought was of the remarkable quality in this woman before me which had held her true to mrs temple and which sent her so courageously to her duty now  madame la vicomtesse as i had hoped relieved the situation she knew how to broach a dreaded subject  mr ritchie is going with us antoinette she said  it is perhaps best to explain everything to him before we start i was about to tell you mr ritchie she continued turning to me that auguste has given no hint in his note of mr temples presence in louisiana and yet you told me that they were to have come here together  yes i answered and i have no reason to think they have separated  i was merely going to suggest said the vicomtesse firmly i was merely going to suggest the possibility of our meeting mr temple with auguste  it was antoinette who answered with a force that revealed a new side of her character  mr temple will not be there she said flashing a glance upon us do you think he would come to me  helene laid her hand upon the girls arm  my dear i think nothing she said quietly but it is best for us to be prepared against any surprise remember that i do not know mr temple and that you have not seen him for five years  it is not like him you know it is not like him exclaimed antoinette looking at me  i know it is not like him mademoiselle i replied  madame la vicomtesse from behind the girl gave me a significant look  this occurred to me she went on in an undisturbed tone that mr temple might come with auguste to protest against the proceedingor even to defend himself against the imputation that he was to make use of this money in any way i wish you to realize antoinette before you decide to go that you may meet mr temple would it not be better to let mr ritchie go alone i am sure that we could find no better emissary  auguste is here said antoinette i must see him her voice caught i may never see him again he may be ill he may be starvingand i know that he is in trouble whether her voice caught whether mr temple is with him or not i mean to go  then it would be well to start said the vicomtesse  deftly dropping her veil she picked up a riding whip that lay on the railing and descended the stairs to the courtyard antoinette and i followed as we came through the archway i saw andre monsieur de st gres mulatto holding open the wicket for us to pass he helped the ladies to mount the ponies lengthened my own stirrups for me swung into the saddle himself and then the four of us were picking our way down the rue chartres at an easy amble turning to the right beyond the cool garden of the ursulines past the yellow barracks we came to the river front beside the fortifications a score of negroes were sweating there in the sun swinging into position the long logs for the palisades nearly completed they were like those of kaskaskia and our own frontier forts in kentucky with a fortyfoot ditch in front of them seated on a horse talking to the overseer was a fat little man in white linen who pulled off his hat and bowed profoundly to the ladies his face gave me a start and then i remembered that i had seen him only the day before resplendent coming out of church he was the baron de carondelet  there was a sentry standing under a crapemyrtle where the royal road ran through the gateway behind him was a diminutive fivesided brick fort with a dozen little cannon on top of it the sentry came forward brought his musket to a salute and halted before my horse  you will have to show your passport murmured madame la vicomtesse  i drew the document from my pocket it was signed by de lemos and duly countersigned by the officer of the port the man bowed and i passed on  it was a strange silent ride through the stinging heat to les iles the brown dust hanging behind us like a cloud to settle slowly on the wayside shrubbery across the levee bank the river was low listless giving off hot breath like a monster in distress the forest pools were cracked and dry the spanish moss was a haggard gray and under the sun was the haze which covered the land like a saffron mantle at times a listlessness came over me such as i had never known to make me forget the presence of the women at my side the very errand on which we rode from time to time i was roused into admiration of the horsemanship of madame la vicomtesse for the restive texas pony which she rode was stung to madness by the flies as for antoinette she glanced neither right nor left through her veil but rode unmindful of the way heedless of heat and discomfort erect motionless save for the easy gait of her horse at length we turned into the avenue through the forest lined by wild orange trees came in sight of the low belvedered plantation house and drew rein at the foot of the steps antoinette was the first to dismount and passed in silence through the group of surprised house servants gathering at the door i assisted the vicomtesse who paused to bid the negroes disperse and we lingered for a moment on the gallery together  poor antoinette she said i wish we might have saved her this she looked up at me how she defended him she exclaimed  she loves him i answered  madame la vicomtesse sighed  i suppose there is no help for it she said but it is very difficult not to be angry with mr temple the girl cared for his mother gave her a home clung to her when he and the world would have cast her off sacrificed her happiness for them both if i see him i believe i shall shake him and if he doesnt fall down on his knees to her i shall ask the baron to hang him we must bring him to his senses mr ritchie he must not leave louisiana until he sees her then he will marry her she paused scrutinized me in her quick way and added you see that i take your estimation of his character you ought to be flattered  i am flattered by any confidence you repose in me madame la vicomtesse  she laughed i was not flattered then but cursed myself for the quaint awkwardness in my speech that amused her and she was astonishingly quick to perceive my moods  there dont be angry you will never be a courtier my honest friend and you may thank god for it how sweet the shrubs are your chief business in life seems to be getting people out of trouble and i am going to help you with this case  it was my turn to laugh  you are going to help i exclaimed my services have been heavy so far  you should not walk around at night she replied irrelevantly  suddenly i remembered gignoux but even as i was about to tell her of the incident antoinette appeared in the doorway she was very pale but her lips were set with excitement and her eyes shone strangely she was still in her riding gown in her hand she carried a leather bag and behind her stood andre with a bundle  quick she said we are wasting time and he may be gone  checking an exclamation which could hardly have been complimentary to auguste the vicomtesse crossed quickly to her and put her arm about her  we will follow you mignonne she said in french  must you come said antoinette appealingly he may not appear if he sees any one  we shall have to risk that said the vicomtesse dryly with a glance at me you shall not go alone but we will wait a few moments at the hedge  we took the wellremembered way through the golden green light under the trees antoinette leading and the sight of the garden brought back to me poignantly the scene in the moonlight with mrs temple there was no sound save the languid morning notes of the birds and the humming of the bees among the flowers as antoinette went tremblingly down the path and paused listening under the branches of that oak where i had first beheld her then with a little cry we saw her run forwardinto the arms of auguste de st gre it was a pitiful thing to look upon  antoinette had led her brother to the seat under the oak how long we waited i know not but at length we heard their voices raised and without more ado madame la vicomtesse beckoning me passed quickly through the gap in the hedge and went towards them i followed with andre auguste rose with an oath and then stood facing his cousin like a man struck dumb his hands dropped he was a sorry sight indeed unshaven unkempt dark circles under his eyes clothes torn  helene you herein america he cried in french staring at her  yes auguste she replied quite simply i am here he would have come towards her but there was a note in her voice which arrested him  and monsieur le vicomtehenri he said i found myself listening tensely for the answer  henri is in austria fighting for his king i hope said madame la vicomtesse  so madame la vicomtesse is a refugee he said with a bow and a smile that made me very angry  and monsieur de st gre i asked  at the sound of my voice he started and gave back for he had not perceived me he recovered his balance such as it was instantly  monsieur seems to take an extraordinary interest in my affairs he said jauntily  only when they are to the detriment of other persons who are my friends i said  monsieur has intruded in a family matter said auguste grandly still in french  by invitation of those most concerned monsieur i answered for i could have throttled him  auguste had developed he had learned well that effrontery is often the best weapon of an adventurer he turned from me disdainfully petulantly and addressed the vicomtesse once more  i wish to be alone with antoinette he said  no doubt said the vicomtesse  i demand it said auguste  the demand is not granted said the vicomtesse that is why we have come your sister has already made enough sacrifices for you i know you monsieur auguste de st gre she continued with quiet contempt it is not for love of antoinette that you have sought this meeting it is because she said riding down a torrent of words which began to escape from him it is because you are in a predicament as usual and you need money  it was antoinette who spoke she had risen and was standing behind auguste she still held the leather bag in her hand  perhaps the sum is not enough she said he has to get to france perhaps we could borrow more until my father comes home she looked questioningly at us  madame la vicomtesse was truly a woman of decision without more ado she took the bag from antoinettes unresisting hands and put it into mine i was no less astonished than the rest of them  mr ritchie will keep this until the negotiations are finished said the vicomtesse  negotiations cried auguste beside himself this is insolence madame  be careful sir i said  auguste cried antoinette putting her hand on his arm  why did you tell them he demanded turning on her  because i trust them auguste antoinette answered she spoke without anger as one whose sorrow has put her beyond it her speech had a dignity and force which might have awed a worthier man his disappointment and chagrin brought him beyond bounds  you trust them he cried you trust them when they tell you to give your brother who is starving and in peril of his life eight hundred livres eight hundred livres pardieu and your brother  it is all i have auguste said his sister sadly  ha he said dramatically i see they seek my destruction this manpointing at meis a federalist and madame la vicomtessehe bowed ironicallyis a royalist  pish said the vicomtesse impatiently it would be an easy matter to have you sent to the morroa word to monsieur de carondelet auguste do you believe for a moment that in your fathers absence i would have allowed antoinette to come here alone and it was a happy circumstance that i could call on such a man as mr ritchie to come with us  it seems to me that mr ritchie and his friends have already brought sufficient misfortune on the family  it was a villanous speech antoinette turned away her shoulders quivering and i took a step towards him but madame la vicomtesse made a swift gesture and i stopped i know not why she gave an exclamation so sharp that he flinched physically as though he had been struck but it was characteristic of her that when she began to speak her words cut rather than lashed  auguste de st gre she said i know you the tribunal is merciful compared to you there is no one on earth whom you would not torture for your selfish ends no one whom you would not sell without compunction for your pleasure there are things that a woman should not mention and yet i would tell them without shame to your face were it not for your sister if it were not for her i would not have you in my presence shall i speak of your career in france there is valenciennes for example  she stopped abruptly the man was gray but not on his account did the vicomtesse stay her speech she forgot him as though he did not exist and by one of those swift transitions which thrilled me had gone to the sobbing antoinette and taken her in her arms murmuring endearments of which our language is not capable i too forgot auguste but no rebuke however stinging could make him forget himself and before we realized it he was talking again he had changed his tactics  this is my home he said where i might expect shelter and comfort you make me an outcast  antoinette disengaged herself from helene with a cry but he turned away from her and shrugged  a stranger would have fared better perhaps you will have more consideration for a stranger there is a french ship at the terre aux boeufs in the english turn which sails tonight i appeal to you mr ritchiehe was still talking in frenchi appeal to you who are a man of affairsand he swept me a bowif a captain would risk taking a fugitive to france for eight hundred livres pardieu i could get no farther than the balize for that monsieur he added meaningly you have an interest in this there are two of us to go  the amazing effrontery of this move made me gasp yet it was neither the vicomtesse nor myself who answered him we turned by common impulse to antoinette and she was changed her breath came quickly her eyes flashed her anger made her magnificent  it is not true she cried you know it is not true  he lifted his shoulders and smiled  you are my brother and i am ashamed to acknowledge you i was willing to give my last sou to sell my belongings to take from the poor to help youuntil you defamed a good man you cannot make me believe she cried unheeding the color that surged into her cheeks you cannot make me believe that he would use this money you cannot make me believe it  let us do him the credit of thinking that he means to repay it said auguste  antoinettes eyes filled with tearstears of pride of humiliation ay and of an anger of which i had not thought her capable she was indeed a superb creature then a personage i had not imagined gathering up her gown she passed auguste and turned on him swiftly  if you were to bring that to him she said pointing to the bag in my hand he would not so much as touch it tomorrow i shall go to the ursulines and i thank god i shall never see you again i thank god i shall no longer be your sister give monsieur the bundle she said to the frightened andre who still stood by the hedge he may need food and clothes for his journey  she left us we stood watching her until her gown had disappeared amongst the foliage andre came forward and held out the bundle to auguste who took it mechanically then madame la vicomtesse motioned to andre to leave and gave me a glance and it was part of the deep understanding of her i had that i took its meaning i had my forebodings at what this last conversation with auguste might bring forth and i wished heartily that we were rid of him  monsieur de st gre i said i understood you to say that a ship is lying at the english turn some five leagues below us on which you are to take passage at once  he turned and glared at me some devilish retort on his lips which he held back suddenly he became suave  i shall want two thousand livres monsieur it was the sum i asked for  it is not a question of what you asked for i answered  since when did monsieur assume this intimate position in my family he said glancing at the vicomtesse  monsieur de st gre i replied with difficulty you will confine yourself to the matter in hand you are in no situation to demand terms you must take or leave what is offered you last night the man called gignoux who was of your party was at the governors house  at this he started perceptibly  ha i thought he was a traitor he cried strangely enough he did not doubt my word in this  i am surprised that your fathers house has not been searched this morning i continued astonished at my own moderation the sentiments of the baron de carondelet are no doubt known to you and you are aware that your family or your friends cannot save you if you are arrested you may have this money on two conditions the first is that you leave the province immediately the second that you reveal the whereabouts of mr nicholas temple  monsieur is very kind he replied and added the taunt and well versed in the conduct of affairs of money  does monsieur de st gre accept i asked  he threw out his hands with a gesture of resignation  who am i to accept he said a fugitive an outcast and i should like to remind monsieur that time passes  it is a sensible observation said i meaning that it was the first his sudden docility made me suspicious what preparations have you made to go  they are not elaborate monsieur but they are complete when i leave you i step into a pirogue which is tied to the river bank  ah i replied and mr temple  madame la vicomtesse smiled for auguste was fairly caught he had not the astuteness to be a rogue oddly he had the sense to know that he could fool us no longer  temple is at lamarques he answered sullenly  i glanced questioningly at the vicomtesse  lamarque is an old pensioner of monsieur de st gres said she he has a house and an arpent of land not far below here  exactly said auguste and if mr ritchie believes that he will save money by keeping mr temple in louisiana instead of giving him this opportunity to escape it is no concern of mine  i reflected a moment on this for it was another sensible remark  it is indeed no concern of yours said madame la vicomtesse  he shrugged his shoulders  and now he said i take it that there are no further conscientious scruples against my receiving this paltry sum  i will go with you to your pirogue i answered when you embark you shall have it  i too will go said madame la vicomtesse  you overwhelm me with civility madame said the sieur de st gre bowing low  lead the way monsieur i said  he took his bundle and started off down the garden path with a grand air i looked at the vicomtesse inquiringly and there was laughter in her eyes  i must show you the way to lamarques and then she whispered you have done well mr ritchie  i did not return her look but waited until she took the path ahead of me in silence we followed auguste through the depths of the woods turning here and there to avoid a fallen tree or a sinkhole where the water still remained at length we came out in the glare of the sun and crossed the dusty road to the levee bank some forty yards below us was the canoe and we walked to it still in silence auguste flung in his bundle and turned to us  perhaps monsieur is satisfied he said  i handed him the bag and he took it with an elaborate air of thankfulness nay the rascal opened it as if to assure himself that he was not tricked at the last at the sight of the gold and silver which antoinette had hastily collected he turned to madame la vicomtesse  should i have the good fortune to meet monsieur le vicomte in france i shall assure him that madame is in good hands he swept an exultant look at me and enjoying herself  i could have flung him into the river moneybag and all but madame la vicomtesse made him a courtesy there on the levee bank and said sweetly  that is very good of you auguste  as for you monsieur he said and now his voice shook with uncontrolled rage i am in no condition to repay your kindnesses but i have no doubt that you will not object to keeping the miniature a while longer  i was speechless with anger and shame and though i felt the eyes of the vicomtesse upon me i dared not look at her i heard auguste but indistinctly as he continued  should you need the frame monsieur you will doubtless find it still with monsieur isadore the jew in the rue toulouse with that he leaped into his boat seized the paddle and laughed as he headed into the current how long i stood watching him as he drifted lazily in the sun i know not but at length the voice of madame la vicomtesse aroused me  he is a pleasant person she said    chapter viii at lamarques  until then it seemed as if the sun had gotten into my brain and set it on fire her words had the strange effect of clearing my head though i was still in as sad a predicament as ever i found myself there was the thing in my pocket still wrapped in polly anns handkerchief i glanced at the vicomtesse shyly and turned away again her face was all repressed laughter the expression i knew so well  i think we should feel better in the shade mr ritchie she said in english and leaping lightly down from the bank crossed the road again i followed her perforce  i will show you the way to lamarques she said  madame la vicomtesse i cried  had she no curiosity was she going to let pass what auguste had hinted lifting up her skirts she swung round and faced me in her eyes was a calmness more baffling than the light i had seen there but a moment since how to begin i knew not and yet i was launched  madame la vicomtesse there was once a certain miniature painted of you  by boze monsieur she answered readily enough the embarrassment was all on my side we spoke of it last evening i remember well when it was taken it was the costume i wore at chantilly and monsieur le prince complimented me and the next day the painter himself came to our hotel in the rue de bretagne and asked the honor of painting me she sighed ah those were happy days her majesty was very angry with me  and why i asked forgetful of my predicament  for sending it to louisiana to antoinette  and why did you send it  a whim said the vicomtesse i had always written twice a year either to monsieur de st gre or antoinette and although i had never seen them i loved them perhaps it was because they had the patience to read my letters and the manners to say they liked them  surely not madame i said monsieur de st gre spoke often to me of the wonderful pictures you drew of the personages at court  madame la vicomtesse had an answer on the tip of her tongue i know now that she spared me  and what of this miniature monsieur she asked what became of it after you restored it to its rightful owner  i flushed furiously and fumbled in my pocket  i obtained it again madame i said  you obtained it she cried i am not sure to this day whether in consternation or jest in passing it was not just what i wanted to say  i meant to give it you last night i said  and why did you not she demanded severely  i felt her eyes on me and it seemed to me as if she were looking into my very soul even had it been otherwise i could not have told her how i had lived with this picture night and day how i had dreamed of it how it had been my inspiration and counsel i drew it from my pocket wrapped as it was in the handkerchief and uncovered it with a reverence which she must have marked for she turned away to pick a yellow flower by the roadside i thank heaven that she did not laugh indeed she seemed to be far from laughter  you have taken good care of it monsieur she said i thank you  it was not mine madame i answered  and if it had been she asked  it was a strange prompting  if it had been i could have taken no better care of it i answered and i held it towards her  she took it simply  and the handkerchief she said  the handkerchief was polly anns i answered  she stopped to pick a second flower that had grown by the first  who is polly ann she said  when i was eleven years of age and ran away from temple bow after my father died polly ann found me in the hills when she married tom mcchesney they took me across the mountains into kentucky with them polly ann has been more than a mother to me  oh said madame la vicomtesse then she looked at me with a stranger expression than i had yet seen in her face she thrust the miniature in her gown turned and walked in silence awhile then she said  so auguste sold it again  yes i said  he seems to have found a ready market only in you said the vicomtesse without turning her head here we are at lamarques  what i saw was a low weatherbeaten cabin on the edge of a clearing and behind it stretched away in prim rows the vegetables which the old frenchman had planted there was a little flower garden too and an orchard a path of beaten earth led to the door which was open there we paused seated at a rude table was lamarque himself his hoary head bent over the cards he held in his hand opposite him was mr nicholas temple in the act of playing the ace of spades i think that it was the laughter of madame la vicomtesse that first disturbed them and even then she had time to turn to me  i like your cousin she whispered  is that you st gre said nick i wish to the devil you would learn not to sneak you frighten me where the deuce did you go to  but lamarque had seen the lady stared at her wildly for a moment and rose dropping his cards on the floor he bowed humbly not without trepidation  madame la vicomtesse he said  by this time nick had risen and he too was staring at her how he managed to appear so well dressed was a puzzle to me  madame he said bowing i beg your pardon i thought you were thati beg your pardon  i understand your feelings sir answered the vicomtesse as she courtesied  egad said nick and looked at her again egad ill be hanged if its not  it was the first time i had seen the vicomtesse in confusion and indeed if it were confusion she recovered instantly  you will probably be hanged sir if you do not mend your company she said do you not think so mr ritchie  davy he cried and catching sight of me in the doorway over her shoulder has he followed me here too running past the vicomtesse he seized me in his impulsive way and searched my face so you have followed me here old faithful madame he added turning to the vicomtesse there is some excuse for my getting into trouble  what excuse monsieur she asked she was smiling yet looking at us with shining eyes  the pleasure of having mr ritchie get me out he answered he has never failed me  you are far from being out of this i said if the baron de carondelet does not hang you or put you in the morro you will not have me to thank it will be madame la vicomtesse divryletour  madame la vicomtesse exclaimed nick puzzled  may i present to you madame mr nicholas temple i asked  nick bowed and she courtesied again  so monsieur le baron is really after us said nick he opened his eyes slapped his knee and laughed that may account for the citizen captain de st gres absence he said by the way davy you havent happened by any chance to meet him  the vicomtesse and i exchanged a look of understanding relief was plain on her face it was she who answered  we have met himby chance monsieur he has just left for terre aux boeufs  terre aux boeufs what the devi beg your pardon madame la vicomtesse but you give me something of a surprise is there another conspiracy at terre aux boeufs ordoes somebody live there who has never before lent auguste money  madame la vicomtesse laughed then she grew serious again  you did not know where he had gone she said  i did not even know he had gone said nick citizen lamarque and i were having a little game of piquetfor vegetables eh citizen  madame la vicomtesse laughed again and once more the shade of sadness came into her eyes  they are the same the world over she saidnot to me nor yet to any one there and i knew that she was thinking of her own kind in france who faced the guillotine without sense of danger she turned to nick you may be interested to know mr temple she added that auguste is on his way to the english turn to take ship for france  nick regarded her for a moment and then his face lighted up with that smile which won every one he met which inevitably made them smile back at him  the news is certainly unexpected madame he said but then after one has travelled much with auguste it is difficult to take a great deal of interest in him am i to be sent to france too he asked  not if it can be helped replied the vicomtesse seriously mr ritchie will tell you however that you are in no small danger doubtless you know it monsieur le baron de carondelet considers that the intrigues of the french revolutionists in louisiana have already robbed him of several years of his life he is not disposed to be lenient towards persons connected with that cause  what have you been doing since you arrived here on this ridiculous mission i demanded impatiently  my cousin is a narrow man madame la vicomtesse said nick we enjoy ourselves in different ways i thought there might be some excitement in this matter and i was sadly mistaken  it is not over yet said the vicomtesse  and davy continued nick bowing to me gets his pleasures and excitement by extracting me from my various entanglements well there is not much to tell st gre and i were joined above natchez by that little pig citizen gignoux and we shot past de lemos in the night since then we have been permitted to sleepno moreat various plantations we have been waked up at barbarous hours in the morning and handed on as it were they were all fond of us but likewise they were all afraid of the baron what day is today monday then it was on saturday that we lost gignoux  i have reason to think that he has already sold out to the baron i put in  eh  i saw him in communication with the police at the governors hotel last night i answered  nick was silent for a moment  well he said that may make some excitement then he laughed i wonder why auguste didnt think of doing that he said and now what  how did you get to this house i said  we came down on saturday night after we had lost gignoux above the city  do you know where you are i asked  not i said nick i have been playing piquet with lamarque most of the time since i arrived he is one of the pleasantest men i have met in louisiana although a little taciturn as you perceive and more than a little deaf i think he does not like auguste he seems to have known him in his youth  madame la vicomtesse looked at him with interest  you are at les iles nick i said you are on monsieur de st gres plantation and within a quarter of a mile of his house  his face became grave all at once he seized me by both shoulders and looked into my face  you say that we are at les iles he repeated slowly  i nodded seeing the deception which auguste had evidently practised in order to get him here then nick dropped his arms went to the door and stood for a long time with his back turned to us looking out over the fields when finally he spoke it was in the tone he used in anger  if i had him now i think i would kill him he said  auguste had deluded him in other things had run away and deserted him in a strange land but this matter of bringing him to les iles was past pardon it was another face he turned to the vicomtesse a stronger face a face ennobled by a just anger  madame la vicomtesse he said i have a vague notion that you are related to monsieur de st gre i give you my word of honor as a gentleman that i had no thought of trespassing upon him in any way  mr temple we were so sure of thatmr ritchie and ithat we should not have sought for you here otherwise she replied quickly then she glanced at me as though seeking my approval for her next move it was characteristic of her that she did not now shirk a task imposed by her sense of duty we have little time mr temple and much to say perhaps you will excuse us lamarque she added graciously in french  madame la vicomtesse said the old man and with the tact of his race he bowed and retired the vicomtesse seated herself on one of the rude chairs and looked at nick curiously there was no such thing as embarrassment in her manner no trace of misgiving that she would not move properly in the affair knowing nick as i did the difficulty of the task appalled me for no man was likelier than he to fly off at a misplaced word  her beginning was so bold that i held my breath knowing full well as i did that she had chosen the very note  sit down mr temple she said i wish to speak to you about your mother  he stopped like a man who had been struck straightened and stared at her as though he had not taken her meaning then he swung on me  your mother is in new orleans i said i would have told you in louisville had you given me the chance  it is an interesting piece of news david he answered which you might have spared me mrs temple did not think herself necessary to my welfare when i was young and now i have learned to live without her  is there no such thing as expiation monsieur said the vicomtesse  madame he said she made me what i am and when i might have redeemed myself she came between me and happiness  monsieur said the vicomtesse have you ever considered her sufferings  he looked at the vicomtesse with a new interest she was not so far beyond his experience as mine  her sufferings he repeated and smiled  madame la vicomtesse should know them i interrupted and without heeding her glance of protest i continued it is she who has cared for mrs temple  you madame he exclaimed  do not deny your own share in it mr ritchie she answered as for me monsieur she went on turning to nick i have done nothing that was not selfish i have been in the world i have lived my life misfortunes have come upon me too my visits to your mother have been to me a comfort a pleasurefor she is a rare person  i have never found her so madame he said briefly  i am sure it is your misfortune rather than your fault mr temple it is because you do not know her now  again he looked at me puzzled uneasy like a man who would run if he could but by a kind of fascination his eyes went back to this woman who dared a subject sore to the touchwho pressed it gently but with determination never doubting her powers yet with a kindness and sympathy of tone which few women of the world possess the vicomtesse began to speak again evenly gently  mr temple said she i am merely going to tell you some things which i am sure you do not know and when i have finished i shall not appeal to you it would be useless for me to try to influence you and from what mr ritchie and others have told me of your character i am sure that no influence will be necessary and she added with a smile it would be much more comfortable for us both if you sat down  he obeyed her without a word no wonder madame la vicomtesse had had an influence at court  there she said if any reference i am about to make gives you pain i am sorry she paused briefly after mr ritchie took your mother from here to new orleans some five years ago she rented a little house in the rue bourbon with a screen of yellow and red tiles at the edge of the roof it is on the south side next to the corner of the rue st philippe there she lives absolutely alone except for a servant mr clark who has charge of her affairs was the only person she allowed to visit her for her pride however misplaced and for her spirit we must all admire her the friend who discovered where she was who went to her and implored mrs temple to let her stay she refused  the friend he repeated in a low tone i scarcely dared to glance at the vicomtesse  yes it was antoinette she answered he did not reply but his eyes fell antoinette went to her would have comforted her would have cared for her but your mother sent her away for five years she has lived there mr temple alone with her past alone with her sorrow and remorse you must draw the picture for yourself if the world has a more terrible punishment i have not heard of it and when some months ago i came and antoinette sent me to her  sent you to her he said raising his head quickly  under another name than my own helene continued apparently taking no notice of his interruption she leaned toward him and her voice faltered i found your mother dying  he said nothing but got to his feet and walked slowly to the door where he stood looking out again i felt for him i would have gone to him then had it not been for the sense in me that helene did not wish it as for helene she sat waiting for him to turn back to her and at length he did  yes he said  it is her heart mr temple that we fear the most last night i thought the end had come it cannot be very far away now sorrow and remorse have killed her monsieur the one thing that she has prayed for through the long nights is that she might see you once again and obtain your forgiveness god himself does not withhold forgiveness mr temple said the vicomtesse gently shall any of us presume to  a spasm of pain crossed his face and then his expression hardened  i might have been a useful man he said she ruined my life  and you will allow her to ruin the rest of it asked the vicomtesse  he stared at her  if you do not go to her and forgive her you will remember it until you die she said  he sank down on the chair opposite to her his head bowed into his hands his elbows on the table among the cards at length i went and laid my hands upon his shoulder and at my touch he started then he did a singular thing an impulsive thing characteristic of the old nick i had known he reached across the table and seized the hand of madame la vicomtesse she did not resist and her smile i shall always remember it was the smile of a woman who has suffered and understands  i will go to her madame he said springing to his feet i will go to her ii was wrong  she rose too he still clinging to her hand she still unresisting his eye fell upon me  where is my hat davy he asked  the vicomtesse withdrew her hand and looked at me  alas it is not quite so simple as that mr temple she said monsieur de carondelet has first to be reckoned with  she is dying you say then i will go to her after that monsieur de carondelet may throw me into prison may hang me may do anything he chooses but i will go to her  i glanced anxiously at the vicomtesse well knowing how wilful he was when aroused admiration was in her eyes seeing that he was heedless of his own danger  you would not get through the gates of the city monsieur le baron requires passports now she said  at that he began to pace the little room his hands clenched  i could use your passport davy he cried let me have it  pardon me mr temple i do not think you could said the vicomtesse i flushed i suppose the remark was not to be resisted  then i will go tonight he said with determination it will be no trouble to steal into the city you say the house has yellow and red tiles and is near the rue st philippe  helene laid her fingers on his arm  listen monsieur there is a better way she said monsieur le baron is doubtless very angry with you and i am sure that this is chiefly because he does not know you for instance if some one were to tell him that you are a straightforward courageous young man a gentleman with an unquenchable taste for danger that you are not a lowborn adventurer and intriguer that you have nothing in particular against his government he might not be quite so angry pardon me if i say that he is not disposed to take your expedition any more seriously than is your own federal government the little baron is irascible choleric stern or else goodnatured goodhearted and charitable just as one happens to take him as we say in france it is not well to strike flint and steel in his presence he might blow up and destroy one suppose some one were to go to monsieur de carondelet and tell him what a really estimable person you are and assure him that you will go quietly out of his province at the first opportunity and be good so far as he is concerned forever after mark me i merely say suppose i do not know how far things have gone or what he may have heard but suppose a person whom i have reason to believe he likes and trusts and respects a person who understands his vagaries should go to him on such an errand  and where is such a person to be found said nick amused in spite of himself  madame la vicomtesse courtesied  monsieur she is before you she said  egad he cried do you mean to say madame that you will go to the baron on my behalf  as soon as i ever get to town she said he will have to be waked from his siesta and he does not like that  but he will forgive you said nick quick as a flash  i have reason to believe he will said madame la vicomtesse  faith cried nick he would not be flesh and blood if he didnt  at that the vicomtesse laughed and her eye rested judicially on me i was standing rather glumly i fear in the corner  are you going to take him with you said nick  i was thinking of it said the vicomtesse mr ritchie knows you and he is such a reliable and reputable person  nick bowed  you should have seen him marching in a jacobin procession madame he said  he follows his friends into strange places she retorted  and now mr temple she added may we trust you to stay here with lamarque until you have word from us  you know i cannot stay here he cried  and why not monsieur  if i were captured here i should get monsieur de st gre into trouble and besides he said with a touch of coldness i cannot be beholden to monsieur de st gre i cannot remain on his land  as for getting monsieur de st gre into trouble his own son could not involve him with the baron answered madame la vicomtesse and it seems to me monsieur that you are already so far beholden to monsieur de st gre that you cannot quibble about going a little more into his debt come mr temple how has monsieur de st gre ever offended you  madame he began  monsieur she said with an air not to be denied i believe i can discern a point of honor as well as you i fail to see that you have a case  he was indeed no match for her he turned to me appealingly his brows bent but i had no mind to meddle he swung back to her  but madame he cried  she was arranging the cards neatly on the table  monsieur you are tiresome she said what is it now  he took a step toward her speaking in a low tone his voice shaking but true to himself he spoke plainly as for me i looked on frightenedas though watching a contestalmost agape to see what a clever woman could do  there ismademoiselle de st gre  yes there is mademoiselle de st gre repeated the vicomtesse toying with the cards  his face lighted though his lips twitched with pain  she is still  she is still mademoiselle de st gre monsieur if that is what you mean  and what will she think if i stay here  ah do you care what she thinks mr temple said the vicomtesse raising her head quickly from what i have heard i should not have thought you could  god help me he answered simply i do care  helenes eyes softened as she looked at him and my pride in him was never greater than at that moment  mr temple she said gently remain where you are and have faith in us i begin to see now why you are so fortunate in your friends her glance rested for a brief instant on me mr ritchie and i will go to new orleans talk to the baron and send andre at once with a message if it is in our power you shall see your mother very soon  she held out her hand to him and he bent and kissed it reverently with an ease i envied he followed us to the door and when the vicomtesse had gone a little way down the path she looked at him over her shoulder  do not despair mr temple she said  it was an answer to a yearning in his face he gripped me by the shoulders  god bless you davy he whispered and added god bless you both  i overtook her where the path ran into the forests shade and for a long while i walked after her not breaking her silence my eyes upon her a strange throbbing in my forehead which i did not heed at last when the perfumes of the flowers told us we were nearing the garden she turned to me  i like mr temple she said again  he is an honest gentleman i answered  one meets very few of them she said speaking in a low voice you and i will go to the governor and after that have you any idea where you will go  no i replied troubled by her regard  then i will tell you i intend to send you to madame gravoiss and she will compel you to go to bed and rest i do not mean to allow you to kill yourself    chapter ix monsieur le baron  the sun beat down mercilessly on thatch and terrace the yellow walls flung back the quivering heat as madame la vicomtesse and i walked through the empty streets towards the governors house we were followed by andre and madames maid the sleepy orderly started up from under the archway at our approach bowed profoundly to madame looked askance at me and declared with a thousand regrets that monsieur le baron was having his siesta  then you will wake him said madame la vicomtesse  wake monsieur le baron bueno dios did madame understand what it meant to wake his excellency his excellency would at first be angry no doubt angry as an andalusian bull madame once when his excellency had first come to the province he the orderly had presumed to awake him  assez said madame so suddenly that the man straightened and looked at her again you will wake monsieur le baron and tell him that madame la vicomtesse divryletour has something of importance to say to him  madame had the air and a title carried with a spanish soldier in new orleans in those days the orderly fairly swept the ground and led us through a court where the sun drew bewildering hot odors from the fruits and flowers into a darkened room which was the barons cabinet i remember it vaguely for my head was hot and throbbing from my exertions in such a climate it was a new roomthe hotel being newly builtwith white walls a picture of his catholic majesty and the royal arms of spain a map of louisiana another of new orleans fortified some walnut chairs a desk with ink and sand and a seal and a window the closed lattice shutters of which showed streaks of light green light these doubtless opened on the royal road and looked across the levee esplanade on the waters of the mississippi madame la vicomtesse seated herself and with a gesture which was an order bade me do likewise  he will be angry the dear baron she said he is harassed to death with republics no offence mr ritchie he is up at dawn looking to the forts and palisades to guard against such foolish enterprises as this of mr temples and to be waked out of a wellearned siestato save a gentleman who has come here to make things unpleasant for himis carrying a joke a little far maisque voulezvous  she gave a little shrug to her slim shoulders as she smiled at me and she seemed not a whit disturbed concerning the conversation with his excellency i wondered whether this were birth or training or both or a natural ability to cope with affairs the women of her order had long been used to intercede with sovereigns to play a part in matters of state suddenly i became aware that she was looking at me  what are you thinking of she demanded and continued without waiting for a reply you strange man  i was thinking how odd it was i replied that i should have known you all these years by a portrait that we should finally be thrown together and that you should be so exactly like the person i had supposed you to be  she lowered her eyes but she did not seem to take offence i meant none  and you she answered are continually reminding me of an englishman i knew when i was a girl he was a very queer person to be attached to the embassynot a courtier but a serious literal person like you mr ritchie and he resembled you very much i was very fond of him  andwhat became of him i asked other questions rose to my lips but i put them down  i will tell you she answered bending forward a little he did something which i believe you might have done a certain marquis spoke lightly of a lady an englishwoman at our court and my englishman ran him through one morning at versailles  she paused and i saw that her breath was coming more quickly at the remembrance  and then  he fled to england he was a younger son and poor but his king heard of the affair had it investigated and restored him to the service i have never seen him since she said but i have often thought of him there she added after a silence with a lightness which seemed assumed i have given you a romance how long the baron takes to dress  at that moment there were footsteps in the courtyard and the orderly appeared at the door saluting and speaking in spanish  his excellency the governor  we rose and madame was courtesying and i was bowing to the little man he was in uniform his face perspiring in the creases his plump calves stretching his white stockings to the full madame extended her hand and he kissed it albeit he did not bend easily he spoke in french and his voice betrayed the fact that his temper was near slipping its leash the baron was a native of flanders  to what happy circumstance do i owe the honor of this visit madame la vicomtesse he asked  to a womans whim monsieur le baron she answered for a man would not have dared to disturb you may i present to your excellency mr david ritchie of kentucky  his excellency bowed stiffly looked at me with no pretence of pleasure and i had had sufficient dealings with men to divine that in the coming conversation the overflow of his temper would be poured upon me his first sensation was surprise  an american he said in a tone that implied reproach to madame la vicomtesse for having fallen into such company ah he cried breathing hard in the manner of stout people i remember you came down with monsieur vigo monsieur did you not  it was my turn to be surprised if the baron took a like cognizance of all my countrymen who came to new orleans he was a busy man indeed  yes your excellency i answered  and you are a federalist he said though petulantly  i am your excellency  is your nation to overrun the earth said the baron every morning when i ride through the streets it seems to me that more americans have come pardieu i declare every day that if it were not for the americans i should have ten years more of life ahead of me i could not resist the temptation to glance at madame la vicomtesse her eyes half closed betrayed an amusement that was scarce repressed  come monsieur le baron she said you and i have like beliefs upon most matters we have both suffered at the hands of people who have mistaken a fiend for a lady  you would have me believe madame the baron put in with a wit i had not thought in him that mr ritchie knows a lady when he sees one i can readily believe it  madame laughed  he at least has a negative knowledge she replied and he has brought into new orleans no coins boxes or clocks against your excellencys orders with the image and superscription of the goddess in whose name all things are done he has not sung ca ira at the theatres and he detests the tricolored cockades as much as you do  the baron laughed in spite of himself and began to thaw there was a little more friendliness in his next glance at me  what images have you brought in mr ritchie he asked we all worship the sex in some form however misplaced our notions of it  there is not the least doubt that for the sake of the vicomtesse he was trying to be genial and that his remark was a purely random one but the roots of my hair seemed to have taken fire i saw the baron as in a glass darkly but i kept my head principally because the situation had elements of danger  the image of madame la vicomtesse monsieur i said  dame exclaimed his excellency eying me with a new interest i did not suspect you of being a courtier  no more he is monsieur le baron said the vicomtesse for he speaks the truth  his excellency looked blank as for me i held my breath wondering what coup madame was meditating  mr ritchie brought down from kentucky a miniature of me by boze that was painted in a costume i once wore at chantilly  comment diable exclaimed the baron and how did such a thing get into kentucky madame  you have brought me to the point she replied which is no small triumph for your excellency mr ritchie bought the miniature from that most estimable of my relations monsieur auguste de st gre  the baron sat down and began to fan himself he even grew a little purple he looked at madame sputtered and i began to think that if he didnt relieve himself his head might blow off as for the vicomtesse she wore an ingenuous air of detachment and seemed supremely unconscious of the volcano by her side  so madame cried the governor at length after i know not what repressions you have come here in behalf of thatof auguste de st gre  so far as i am concerned monsieur answered the vicomtesse calmly you may hang auguste put him in prison drown him or do anything you like with him  god help me said the poor man searching for his handkerchief and utterly confounded why is it you have come to me then why did you wake me up he added so far forgetting himself  i came in behalf of the gentleman who had the indiscretion to accompany auguste to louisiana she continued in behalf of mr nicholas temple who is a cousin of mr ritchie  the baron started abruptly from his chair  i have heard of him he cried madame knows where he is  i know where he is it is that which i came to tell your excellency  hein said his excellency again nonplussed you came to tell me where he is and where thethe other one is  parfaitement said madame but before i tell you where they are i wish to tell you something about mr temple  madame i know something of him already said the baron impatiently  ah said she from gignoux and what do you hear from gignoux  this was another shock under which the baron fairly staggered  diable is madame la vicomtesse in the plot he cried what does madame know of gignoux  madames manner suddenly froze  i am likely to be in the plot monsieur she said i am likely to be in a plot which has for its furtherance that abominable anarchy which deprived me of my home and estates of my relatives and friends and my sovereign  a thousand pardons madame la vicomtesse said the baron more at sea than ever i have had much to do these last years and the heat and the republicans have got on my temper will madame la vicomtesse pray explain  i was about to do so when your excellency interrupted said madame you see before you mr ritchie barrister of louisville kentucky whose character of sobriety dependence and ability there was a little gleam in her eye as she gave me this array of virtues can be perfectly established when he came to new orleans some years ago he brought letters to monsieur de st gre from monsieur gratiot and colonel chouteau of st louis and he is known to mr clark and to monsieur vigo he is a federalist as you know and has no sympathy with the jacobins  eh bien mr ritchie said the baron getting his breath you are fortunate in your advocate madame la vicomtesse neglected to say that she was your friend the greatest of all recommendations in my eyes  you are delightful monsieur le baron said the vicomtesse  perhaps mr ritchie can tell me something of this expedition said the baron his eyes growing smaller as he looked at me  willingly i answered although i know that your excellency is well informed and that monsieur vigo has doubtless given you many of the details that i know  he interrupted me with a grunt  you americans are clever people monsieur he said you contrive to combine shrewdness with frankness  if i had anything to hide from your excellency i should not be here i answered the expedition as you know has been as much of a farce as citizen genets commissions but it has been a sad farce to me inasmuch as it involves the honor of my old friend and colonel general clark and the safety of my cousin mr temple  so you were with clark in illinois said the baron craftily pardon me mr ritchie but i should have said that you are too young  monsieur vigo will tell you that i was the drummer boy of the regiment and a sort of ward of the colonels i used to clean his guns and cook his food  and you did not see fit to follow your colonel to louisiana said his excellency for he had been trained in a service of suspicion  general clark is not what he was i replied chafing a little at his manner your excellency knows that and i put loyalty to my government before friendship and i might remind your excellency that i am neither an adventurer nor a fool  the little baron surprised me by laughing his irritability and his good nature ran in streaks  there is no occasion to mr ritchie he answered i have seen something of men in my time in which category do you place your cousin mr temple  if a love of travel and excitement and danger constitutes an adventurer mr temple is such i said fortunately the main spur of the adventurers character is lacking in his case i refer to the desire for money mr temple has an annuity from his fathers estate in charleston which puts him beyond the pale of the fortuneseeker and i firmly believe that if your excellency sees fit to allow him to leave the province and if certain disquieting elements can be removed from his life i glanced at the vicomtesse he will settle down and become a useful citizen of the united states as much as i dislike to submit to a stranger private details in the life of a member of my family i feel that i must tell your excellency something of mr temples career in order that you may know that restlessness and the thirst for adventure were the only motives that led him into this foolish undertaking  pray proceed mr ritchie said the baron  i was surprised not to find him more restless and in addition the glance of approbation which the vicomtesse gave me spurred me on however distasteful i had the sense to see that i must hold nothing back of which his excellency might at any time become cognizant and therefore i told him as briefly as possible nicks story leaving out only the episode with antoinette when i came to the relation of the affairs which occurred at les iles five years before and told his excellency that mrs temple had since been living in the rue bourbon as mrs clive unknown to her son the baron broke in upon me  so the mystery of that woman is cleared at last he said and turned to the vicomtesse i have learned that you have been a frequent visitor madame  not a sparrow falls to the ground in louisiana that your excellency does not hear of it she answered  and gignoux he said speaking to me again  as i told you monsieur le baron i answered i have come to new orleans at a personal sacrifice to induce my cousin to abandon this matter and i went out last evening to try to get word of him this was not strictly true i saw monsieur gignoux in conference with some of your officers who came out of this hotel  you have sharp eyes monsieur he remarked  i suspected the man when i met him in kentucky i continued not heeding this monsieur vigo himself distrusted him to say that gignoux were deep in the councils of the expedition that he held a commission from citizen genet i realize will have no weight with your excellencyprovided the man is in the secret service of his majesty the king of spain  mr ritchie said the baron you are a young man and i an old one if i tell you that i have a great respect for your astuteness and ability do not put it down to flattery i wish that your countrymen who are coming down the river like driftwood more resembled you as for citizen gignoux he went on smiling and wiping his face let not your heart be troubled his majestys minister at philadelphia has written me letters on the subject i am contemplating for monsieur gignoux a sea voyage to havana and he is at present partaking of my hospitality in the calabozo  in the calabozo i cried overwhelmed at this example of spanish justice and omniscience  precisely said the baron drumming with his fingers on his fat knee and now he added perhaps madame la vicomtesse is ready to tell me of the whereabouts of mr temple and her estimable cousin auguste it may interest her to know why i have allowed them their liberty so long  a point on which i have been consumed with curiositysince i have begun to tremble at the amazing thoroughness of your excellencys system said the vicomtesse  his excellency scarcely looked the tyrant as he sat before us with his calves crossed and his hands folded on his waistcoat and his little black eyes twinkling  it is because he said there are many french planters in the province bitten with the three horrors he meant liberty equality and fraternity i sent six to havana and if monsieur etienne de bore had not in the nick of time for him discovered how to make sugar he would have gone too i had an idea that the sieur de st gre and mr temple might act as a bait to reveal the disease in some others ha i am cleverer than you thought mr ritchie you are surprised  i was surprised and showed it  come he said you are astute why did you think i left them at liberty  i thought your excellency believed them to be harmless as they are i replied  he turned again to the vicomtesse you have picked up a diplomat madame i must confess that i misjudged him when you introduced him to me and again where are mr temple and your estimable cousin shall i tell you they are at old lamarques on the plantation of philippe de st gre  they were your excellency said the vicomtesse  eh exclaimed the baron jumping  mademoiselle de st gre has given her brother eight hundred livres and he is probably by this time on board a french ship at the english turn he is very badly frightened i will give your excellency one more surprise  madame la vicomtesse said the baron i have heard that but for your coolness and adroitness monsieur le vicomte your husband and several other noblemen and their ladies and some of her majestys letters and jewels would never have gotten out of france i take this opportunity of saying that i have the greatest respect for your intelligence now what is the surprise  that your excellency intended that both mr temple and auguste de st gre were to escape on that ship  mille tonneres exclaimed the baron staring at her and straightway he fell into a fit of laughter that left him coughing and choking and perspiring as only a man in his condition of flesh can perspire to say that i was bewildered by this last evidence of the insight of the woman beside me would be to put it mildly the vicomtesse sat quietly watching him the wonted look of repressed laughter on her face and by degrees his excellency grew calm again  mon dieu said he i always like to cross swords with you madame la vicomtesse yet this encounter has been more pleasurable than any i have had since i came to louisiana but diable he cried just as i was congratulating myself that i was to have one american the less you come and tell me that he has refused to flee out of consideration for the character and services of monsieur philippe de st gre i was willing to let them both escape but now  mr temple is not known in new orleans except to the st gre family said the vicomtesse he is a man of honor suppose mr ritchie were to bring him to your excellency and he were to give you his word that he would leave the province at the first opportunity he now wishes to see his mother before she dies and it was as much as we could do this morning to persuade him from going to her openly in the face of arrest  but the baron was old in a service which did not do things hastily  he is well enough where he is for today said his excellency resuming his official manner tonight after dark i will send down an officer and have him brought before me he will not then be seen in custody by any one and provided i am satisfied with him he may go to the rue bourbon  the little baron rose and bowed to the vicomtesse to signify that the audience was ended and he added as he kissed her hand madame la vicomtesse it is a pleasure to be able to serve such a woman as you    chapter x the scourge  as we went through the court i felt as though i had been tied to a string suspended in the air and spun this was undoubtedly due to the heat and after the astonishing conversation from which we had come my admiration for the lady beside me was magnified to a veritable awe we reached the archway madame la vicomtesse held me lightly by the edge of my coat and i stood looking down at her  wait a minute mr ritchie she said glancing at the few figures hurrying across the place darmes those are only americans and they are too busy to see us standing here what do you propose to do now  we must get word to nick as we promised that he may know what to expect i replied suppose we go to monsieur de st gres house and write him a letter  no said the vicomtesse with decision i am going to mrs temples i shall write the letter from there and send it by andre and you will go direct to madame gravoiss  her glance rested anxiously upon my face and there came an expression in her eyes which disturbed me strangely i had not known it since the days when polly ann used to mother me but i did not mean to give up  i am not tired madame la vicomtesse i answered and i will go with you to mrs temples  give me your hand she said and smiled andre and my maid are used to my vagaries and your own countrymen will not mind give me your hand mr ritchie  i gave it willingly enough with a thrill as she took it between her own the same anxious look was in her eyes and not the least embarrassment  there it is hot and dry as i feared she said and you seem flushed she dropped my hand and there was a touch of irritation in her voice as she continued you seemed fairly sensible when i first met you last night mr ritchie are you losing your sanity do you not realize that you cannot take liberties with this climate do as i say and go to madame gravoiss at once  it is my pleasure to obey you madame la vicomtesse i answered but i mean to go with you as far as mrs temples to see how she fares she may beworse  that is no reason why you should kill yourself said madame coldly will you not do as i say  i think that i should go to mrs temples i answered  she did not reply to that letting down her veil impatiently with a deftness that characterized all her movements without so much as asking me to come after her she reached the banquette and i walked by her side through the streets silent and troubled by her displeasure my pride forbade me to do as she wished it was the hottest part of a burning day and the dome of the sky was like a brazen bell above us we passed the calabozo with its iron gates and tiny grilled windows pierced in the massive walls behind which gignoux languished and i could not repress a smile as i thought of him even the spaniards sometimes happened upon justice in the rue bourbon the little shops were empty the doorstep where my merry fiddler had played vacant and the very air seemed to simmer above the honeycombed tiles i knocked at the door once twice there was no answer i looked at madame la vicomtesse and knocked again so loudly that the little tailor across the street his shirt opened at the neck flung out his shutter suddenly there was a noise within the door was opened and lindy stood before us in the darkened room with terror in her eyes  oh marse dave she cried as we entered oh madame ise so glad youse come ise so glad youse come  she burst into a flood of tears and madame la vicomtesse raising her veil seized the girl by the arm  what is it she said what is the matter lindy  madames touch seemed to steady her  miss sally she moaned miss sally done got de yaller fever  there was a moments silence for we were both too appalled by the news to speak  lindy are you sure said the vicomtesse  yassm yassm lindy sobbed i reckon ise done seed nuf of it mistis and she went into a hysterical fit of weeping  the vicomtesse turned to her own frightened servants in the doorway bade andre in french to run for dr perrin and herself closed the battened doors there was a moment when her face as i saw it was graven on my memory reflecting a knowledge of the evils of this world a spirit above and untouched by them a power to accept what life may bring with no outward sign of pleasure or dismay doubtless thus she had made king and cardinal laugh doubtless thus ministering to those who crossed her path she had met her own calamities strangest of all was the effect she had upon lindy for the girl ceased crying as she watched her  madame la vicomtesse turned to me  you must go at once she said when you get to madame gravoiss write to mr temple i will send andre to you there  she started for the bedroom door lindy making way for her i scarcely knew what i did as i sprang forward and took the vicomtesse by the arm  where are you going i cried you cannot go in there you cannot go in there  it did not seem strange that she turned to me without anger that she did not seek to release her arm it did not seem strange that her look had in it a gentleness as she spoke  i must she said  i cannot let you risk your life i cried wholly forgetting myself there are others who will do this  others she said  i will go ii have nursed people before this and there is lindy  a smile quivered on her lipsor was it a smile  you will do as i say and go to madame gravoissat once she murmured striving for the first time to free herself  if you stay i stay i answered and if you die i die  she looked up into my eyes for a fleeting instant  write to mr temple she said  dazed i watched her open the bedroom doors motion to lindy to pass through and then she had closed them again and i was alone in the darkened parlor  the throbbing in my head was gone and a great clearness had come with a great fear i stood i know not how long listening to the groans that came through the wall for mrs temple was in agony at intervals i heard helenes voice and then the groans seemed to stop ten times i went to the bedroom door and as many times drew away again my heart leaping within me at the peril which she faced if i had had the right i believe i would have carried her away by force  but i had not the right i sat down heavily by the table to think and it might have been a cry of agony sharper than the rest that reminded me once more of the tragedy of the poor lady in torture my eye fell upon the table and there as though prepared for what i was to do lay pen and paper ink and sand my hand shook as i took the quill and tried to compose a letter to my cousin i scarcely saw the words which i put on the sheet and i may be forgiven for the unwisdom of that which i wrote  the baron de carondelet will send an officer for you tonight so that you may escape observation in custody his excellency knew of your hidingplace but is inclined to be lenient will allow you tomorrow to go to the rue bourbon and will without doubt permit you to leave the province your mother is ill and madame la vicomtesse and myself are with her  david   in the state i was it took me a long time to compose this much and i had barely finished it when there was a knock at the outer door there was andre he had the immobility of face which sometimes goes with the mulatto and always with the trained servant as he informed me that monsieur le medecin was not at home but that he had left word there was an epidemic monsieur so andre feared i gave him the note and his directions and ten minutes after he had gone i would have given much to have called him back how about antoinette alone at les iles why had i not thought of her we had told her nothing that morning madame la vicomtesse and i after our conference with nick for the girl had shut herself in her room and madame had thought it best not to disturb her at such a stage but would she not be alarmed when helene failed to return that night had circumstances been different i myself would have ridden to les iles but no inducement now could make me desert the post i had chosen after many years i dislike to recall to memory that long afternoon which i spent helpless in the rue bourbon now i was on my feet pacing restlessly the short breadth of the room trying to shut out from my mind the horrors of which my ears gave testimony again in the intervals of quiet i sat with my elbows on the table and my head in my hands striving to allay the throbbing in my temples pains came and went and at times i felt like a fagot flung into the firei who had never known a sick day at times my throat pained me an odd symptom in a warm climate troubled as i was in mind and body the thought of helenes quiet heroism upheld me through it all more than once i had my hand raised to knock at the bedroom door and ask if i could help but i dared not at length the sun having done its worst and spent its fury i began to hear steps along the banquette and voices almost at my elbow beyond the little window at every noise i peered out hoping for the doctor but he did not come and then as i fell back into the fauteuil there was borne on my consciousness a sound i had heard before it was the music of the fiddler it was a tune i knew and the voices of the children were singing the refrain            ne sait quand reviendra           ne sait quand reviendra  i rose opened the door and slipped out of it and i must have made a strange hatless figure as i came upon the fiddler and his children from across the street  stop that noise i cried in french angered beyond all reason at the thought of music at such a time idiots there is yellow fever there  the little man stopped with his bow raised for a moment they all stared at me transfixed it was a little elf in blue indienne who jumped first and ran down the street crying the news in a shrill voice the others following the fiddler gazing stupidly after them suddenly he scrambled up moaning as if the scourge itself had fastened on him backed into the house and slammed the door in my face i returned with slow steps to shut myself in the darkened room again and i recall feeling something of triumph over the consternation i had caused no sounds came from the bedroom and after that the street was quiet as death save for an occasional frightened hurrying footfall i was tired  all at once the bedroom door opened softly and helene was standing there looking at me at first i saw her dimly as in a vision then clearly i leaped to my feet and went and stood beside her  the doctor has not come i said where does he live i will go for him  she shook her head  he can do no good lindy has procured all the remedies such as they are they can only serve to alleviate she answered she cannot withstand this poor lady there were tears on helenes lashes her sufferings have been frightfulfrightful  cannot i help i said thickly cannot i do something  she shook her head she raised her hand timidly to the lapel of my coat and suddenly i felt her palm cool and firm upon my forehead it rested there but an instant  you ought not to be here she said her voice vibrant with earnestness and concern you ought not to be here will you not goif i ask it  i cannot i said you know i cannot if you stay  she did not answer that our eyes met and in that instant for me there was neither joy nor sorrow sickness nor death nor time nor space nor universe it was she who turned away  have you written him she asked in a low voice  yes i answered  she would not have known him said helene after all these years of waiting she would not have known him her punishment has been great  a sound came from the bedroom and helene was gone silently as she had come                   i must have been dozing in the fauteuil for suddenly i found myself sitting up listening to an unwonted noise i knew from the count of the hoofbeats which came from down the street that a horse was galloping in long stridesa spent horse for the timing was irregular then he was pulled up into a trot then to a walk as i ran to the door and opened it and beheld nicholas temple flinging himself from a pony white with lather and he was alone he caught sight of me as soon as his foot touched the banquette  what are you doing here i cried what are you doing here  he halted on the edge of the banquette as a hurrying man runs into a wall he had been all excitement all fury as he jumped from his horse and now as he looked at me he seemed to lose his bearings to be all bewilderment he cried out my name and stood looking at me like a fool  what the devil do you mean by coming here i cried did i not write you to stay where you were how did you get here i stepped down on the banquette and seized him by the shoulders did you receive my letter  yes he said yes for a moment that was as far as he got and he glanced down the street and then at the heaving beast he had ridden which stood with head drooping to the kennel then he laid hold of me davy is it true that she has yellow fever is it true  who told you i demanded angrily  andre he answered andre said that the lady here had yellow fever is it true  yes i said almost inaudibly  he let his hand fall from my shoulder and he shivered  may god forgive me for what i have done he said where is she  for what you have done i cried you have done an insensate thing to come here suddenly i remembered the sentry at the gate of fort st charles how did you get into the city i said were you mad to defy the baron and his police  damn the baron and his police he answered striving to pass me let me in let me see her  even as he spoke i caught sight of men coming into the street perhaps at the corner of the rue st pierre and then more men and as we went into the house i saw that they were running i closed the doors there were cries in the street now but he did not seem to heed them he stood listening heartstricken to the sounds that came through the bedroom wall and a spasm crossed his face then he turned like a man not to be denied to the bedroom door i was before him but madame la vicomtesse opened it and i remember feeling astonishment that she did not show surprise or alarm  what are you doing here mr temple she said  my mother madame my mother i must go to her  he pushed past her into the bedroom and i followed perforce i shall never forget the scene though i had but the one glimpse of itthe raving yellowed woman in the bed not a spectre nor yet even a semblance of the beauty of temple bow but she was his mother upon whom god had brought such a retribution as he alone can bestow lindy faithful servant to the end held the wasted hands of her mistress against the violence they would have done lindy held them her own body rocking with grief her lips murmuring endearments prayers supplications  miss sally honey doan you know lindy gawdll let you git well miss sally gawdll let you git well honey ter see marse nickter seemarsenick  the words died on lindys lips the ravings of the frenzied woman ceased the yellowed hands fell limply to the sheet the shrunken form stiffened the eyes of the mother looked upon the son and in them at first was the terror of one who sees the infinite then they softened until they became again the only feature that was left of sarah temple now as she looked at him who was her pride her honor for one sight of whom she had prayeday and even blasphemedher eyes were all tenderness then she spoke  harry she said softly be good to me dear you are all i have now  she spoke of harry riddle  but the long years of penance had not been in vain nick had forgiven her we saw him kneeling at the bedside we saw him with her hand in his and helene was drawing me gently out of the room and closing the door behind her she did not look at me nor i at her  we stood for a moment close together and suddenly the cries in the street brought us back from the drama in the lowceiled reeking room we had left  ici ici voici le cheval  there was a loud rapping at the outer door and a voice demanding admittance in spanish in the name of his excellency the governor  open it said helene there was neither excitement in her voice nor yet resignation in those two words was told the philosophy of her life  i opened the door there on the step was an officer perspiring uniformed and plumed and behind him a crowd of eager faces white and black that seemed to fill the street he took a step into the room his hand on the hilt of his sword and poured out at me a torrent of spanish of which i understood nothing all at once his eye fell upon helene who was standing behind me and he stopped in the middle of his speech and pulled off his hat and bowed profoundly  madame la vicomtesse he stammered i was no little surprised that she should be so well known  you will please to speak french monsieur she said this gentleman does not understand spanish what is it you desire  a thousand pardons madame la vicomtesse he said i am the alcalde de barrio and a wild americano has passed the sentry at st charless gate without heeding his excellencys authority and command i saw the man with my own eyes i should know him again in a hundred we have traced him here to this house madame la vicomtesse behold the horse which he rode the alcalde turned and pointed at the beast behold the horse which he rode madame la vicomtesse the animal will die  probably answered the vicomtesse in an even tone  but the man cried the alcalde the man is here madame la vicomtesse here in this house  yes she said he is here  sancta maria madame he exclaimed ii who speak to you have come to get him he has defied his excellencys commands where is he  he is in that room said the vicomtesse pointing at the bedroom door  the alcalde took a step forward she stopped him by a quick gesture  he is in that room with his mother she said and his mother has the yellow fever come we will go to him and she put her hand upon the door  yellow fever cried the alcalde and his voice was thick with terror there was a moments silence as he stood rooted to the floor i did not wonder then but i have since thought it remarkable that the words spoken low by both of them should have been caught up on the banquette and passed into the street impassive i heard it echoed from a score of throats i saw men and women stampeding like frightened sheep i heard their footfalls and their cries as they ran a tawdry constable who held with a trembling hand the bridle of the tired horse alone remained  yellow fever the alcalde repeated  the vicomtesse inclined her head  he was silent again for a while uncertain and then without comprehending i saw the mans eyes grow smaller and a smile play about his mouth he looked at the vicomtesse with a new admiration to which she paid no heed  i am sorry madame la vicomtesse he began but  but you do not believe that i speak the truth she replied quietly  he winced  will you follow me she said turning again  he had started plainly in an agony of fear when a sound came from beyond the wall that brought a cry to his lips  her manner changed to one of stinging scorn  you are a coward she said i will bring the gentleman to you if he can be got to leave the bedside  no said the alcalde no ii will go to him madame la vicomtesse  but she did not open the door  listen she said in a tone of authority i myself have been to his excellency today concerning this gentleman  you madame la vicomtesse  i will open the door she continued impatient at the interruption and you will see him then i shall write a letter which you will take to the governor the gentleman will not try to escape for his mother is dying besides he could not get out of the city you may leave your constable where he is or the man may come in and stand at this door in sight of the gentleman while you are goneif he pleases  and then said the alcalde  it is my belief that his excellency will allow the gentleman to remain here and that you will be relieved from the necessity of running any further risk  as she spoke she opened the door softly the room was still now still as death and the alcalde went forward on tiptoe i saw him peering in i saw him backing away again like a man in mortal fear  yes it is heit is the man he stammered he put his hand to his brow  the vicomtesse closed the door and without a glance at him went quickly to the table and began to write she had no thought of consulting the man again of asking his permission although she wrote rapidly five minutes must have gone by before the note was finished and folded and sealed she held it out to him  take this to his excellency she said and bring me his answer the alcalde bowed murmured her title and went lamely out of the house he was plainly in an agony of uncertainty as to his duty but he glanced at the vicomtesseand went flipping the note nervously with his finger nail he paused for a few lowspoken words with the tawdry constable who sat down on the banquette after his chief had gone still clinging to the bridle the vicomtesse went to the doorway looked at him and closed the battened doors the constable did not protest the day was fading without and the room was almost in darkness as she crossed over to the little mantel and stood with her head laid upon her arm  i did not disturb her the minutes passed the light waned until i could see her no longer and yet i knew that she had not moved the strange sympathy between us kept me silent until i heard her voice calling my name  yes i answered   the candle  i drew out my tinderbox and lighted the wick she had turned and was facing me even as she had faced me the night before the night before the greatest part of my life seemed to have passed since then i remember wondering that she did not look tired her face was sad her voice was sad and it had an ineffable sweet quality at such times that was all its own  the alcalde should be coming back she said  yes i answered  these were our words yet we scarce heeded their meaning between us was drawn a subtler communion than speech and we daredneither of usto risk speech she searched my face but her lips were closed she did not take my hand again as in the afternoon she turned away i knew what she would have said  there was a knock at the door we went together to open it and the alcalde stood on the step he held in his hand a long letter on which the red seal caught the light and he gave the letter to the vicomtesse with a bow  from his excellency madame la vicomtesse  she broke the seal went to the table and read then she looked up at me  it is the governors permit for mr temple to remain in this house thank you she said to the alcalde you may go  with my respectful wishes for the continued good health of madame la vicomtesse said the alcalde    chapter xi in the midst of life  the alcalde had stopped on the step with an exclamation at something in the darkness outside and he backed bowing into the room again to make way for some one a lady slim gowned and veiled in black and followed by a negress swept past him the lady lifted her veil and stood before us  antoinette exclaimed the vicomtesse going to her  the girl did not answer at once her suffering seemed to have brought upon her a certain acceptance of misfortune as inevitable her face framed in the black veil was never more beautiful than on that night  what is the alcalde doing here she said  the officer himself answered the question  i am leaving mademoiselle said he he reached out his hands toward her appealingly do you not remember me mademoiselle you brought the good sister to see my wife  i remember you said antoinette  do not stay here mademoiselle he cried there isthere is yellow fever  so that is it said antoinette unheeding him and looking at her cousin she has yellow fever then  i beg you to come away mademoiselle the man entreated  please go she said to him he looked at her and went out silently closing the doors after him why was he here she asked again  he came to get mr temple my dear said the vicomtesse the girls lips framed his name but did not speak it  where is he she asked slowly  the vicomtesse pointed towards the bedroom  in there she answered with his mother  he came to her antoinette asked quite simply  the vicomtesse glanced at me and drew the veil gently from the girls shoulders she led her unresisting to a chair i looked at them the difference in their ages was not so great both had suffered cruelly one had seen the world the other had not and yet the contrast lay not here both had followed the gospel of helpfulness to others but one as a religieuse innocent of the sin around her though poignant of the sorrow it caused the other knowing evil with an insight that went far beyond intuition fought with that too  i will tell you antoinette began the vicomtesse it was as you said mr ritchie and i found him at lamarques he had not taken your money he did not even know that auguste had gone to see you he did not even know she said bending over the girl that he was on your fathers plantation when we told him that he would have left it at once  yes she said  he did not know that his mother was still in new orleans and when we told him how ill she was he would have come to her then it was as much as we could do to persuade him to wait until we had seen monsieur de carondelet mr ritchie and i came directly to town and saw his excellency  it was characteristic of the vicomtesse that she told this almost with a mans brevity that she omitted the stress and trouble and pain of it all these things were done the tact and skill and character of her who had accomplished them were not spoken of the girl listened immovable her lips parted and her eyes far away suddenly with an awakening she turned to helene  you did this she cried  mr ritchie and i together said the vicomtesse  her next exclamation was an odd one showing how the mind works at such a time  but his excellency was having his siesta said antoinette  again helene glanced at me but i cannot be sure that she smiled  we thought the matter of sufficient importance to awake his excellency said helene  and his excellency asked antoinette in that moment all three of us seemed to have forgotten the tragedy behind the wall  his excellency thought so too when we had explained it sufficiently helene answered  the girl seemed suddenly to throw off the weight of her grief she seized the hand of the vicomtesse in both of her own  the baron pardoned him she cried tell me what his excellency said why are you keeping it from me  hush my dear said the vicomtesse yes he pardoned him mr temple was to have come to the city tonight with an officer mr ritchie and i came to this house together and we found  yes yes said antoinette  mr ritchie wrote to mr temple that his excellency was to send for him tonight but andre told him of the fever and he came here in the face of danger to see her before she died he galloped past the sentry at the gate and the alcalde followed him from there  and came here to arrest him cried antoinette before the vicomtesse could prevent her she sprang from her chair ran to the door and was peering out into the darkness is the alcalde waiting  no no said the vicomtesse gently bringing her back i wrote to his excellency and we have his permission for mr temple to remain here  suddenly antoinette stopped in the middle of the floor facing the candle her hands clasped her eyes wide with fear we started helene and i as we looked at her  what is it my dear said the vicomtesse laying a hand on her arm  he will take it she said he will take the fever  a strange thing happened many many times have i thought of it since and i did not know its meaning then i had looked to see the vicomtesse comfort her but helene took a step towards me my eyes met hers and in them reflected was the terror i had seen in antoinettes at that instant i too forgot the girl and we turned to see that she had sunk down weeping in the chair then we both went to her i through some instinct i did not fathom  helenes hand resting on antoinettes shoulder trembled there it may well have been my own weakness which made me think her body swayed which made me reach out as if to catch her however marvellous her strength and fortitude these could not last forever andheaven help memy own were fast failing once the room had seemed to me all in darkness then i saw the vicomtesse leaning tenderly over her cousin and whispering in her ear and antoinette rising clinging to her  i will go she faltered i will go he must not know i have been here youyou will not tell him  no i shall not tell him answered the vicomtesse  andyou will send word to me helene  yes dear  antoinette kissed her and began to adjust her veil mechanically i looked on bewildered by the workings of the feminine mind why was she going the vicomtesse gave me no hint but suddenly the girls arms fell to her sides and she stood staring not so much as a cry escaping her the bedroom doors had been opened and between them was the tall figure of nicholas temple so they met again after many years and she who had parted them had brought them together once more he came a step into the room as though her eyes had drawn him so far even then he did not speak her name  go he said go you must not stay here go  she bowed her head  i was going she answered ii am going  but you must go at once he cried excitedly do you know what is in there and he pointed towards the bedroom  yes yes i know she said i know  then go he cried as it is you have risked too much  she lifted up her head and looked at him there was a newborn note in her voice a tremulous note of joy in the midst of sorrow it was of her he was thinking  and you she said you have come and remained  she is my mother he answered god knows it was the least i could have done  twice she had changed before our eyes and now we beheld a new and yet more startling transformation when she spoke there was no reproach in her voice but triumph antoinette undid her veil  yes she is your mother she answered but for many years she has been my friend i will go to her she cannot forbid me now helene has been with her she said turning to where the vicomtesse stood watching her intently helene has been with her and shall i who have longed to see her these many years leave her now  but you were going he cried beside himself with apprehension at this new turning you told me that you were going  truly man is born without perception  yes i told you that she replied almost defiantly  and why were you going he demanded then i had a sudden desire to shake him  antoinette was mute  you yourself must find the answer to that question mr temple said the vicomtesse quietly  he turned and stared at helene and she seemed to smile then as his eyes went back irresistibly to the other a light that was wonderful to see dawned and grew in them i shall never forget him as he stood handsome and fearless a gentleman still despite his years of wandering and adventure and in this supreme moment unselfish the wilful masterful boy had become a man at last  he started forward stopped trembling with a shock of remembrance and gave back again  you cannot come he said i cannot let you take this risk tell her she cannot come madame he said to helene for the love of god send her home again  but there were forces which even helene could not stem he had turned to go back he had seized the door but antoinette was before him custom does not weigh at such a time had she not read his avowal she had his hand in hers heedless of us who watched at first he sought to free himself but she clung to it with all the strength of her loveyet she did not look up at him  i will come with you she said in a low voice i will come with you nick  how quaintly she spoke his name and gently and timidlyay and with a supreme courage true to him through all those numb years of waiting this was a little thingthat they should face death together a little thing and yet the greatest joy that god can bestow upon a good woman he looked down at her with a great tenderness he spoke her name and i knew that he had taken her at last into his arms  come he said  they went in together and the doors closed behind them                   antoinettes maid was on the step and the vicomtesse and i were alone once more in the little parlor i remember well the sense of unreality i had and how it troubled me i remember how what i had seen and heard was turning turning in my mind nick had come back to antoinette they were together in that room and mrs temple was dyingdying no it could not be so again i was in the garden at les iles on a night that was all perfume and i saw the flowers all ghostly white under the moon and then suddenly i was watching the green candle sputter and out of the stillness came a crythe sereno calling the hour of the night how my head throbbed it was keeping time to some rhythm i knew not what yes it was the song my father used to sing         ive faught on land ive faught at sea         at hume ive faught my aunty o  but new orleans was hot burning hot and this could not be cold i felt ah i had it the water was cold going to vincennes so cold  a voice called me no matter where i had gone i think i would have come back at the sound of it i listened intently that i might lose no word of what it said i knew the voice had it not called to me many times in my life before but now there was fear in it and fear gave it a vibrant sweetness fear gave it a quality that made it minemine  you are shivering  that was all it said and it called from across the sea and the sea was coldcold and green under the gray light if she who called to me would only come with the warmth of her love the sea faded the light fell and i was in the eternal cold of space between the whirling worlds if she could but find me was not that her hand in mine did i not feel her near me touching me i wondered that i should hear myself as i answered her  i am not ill i said speak to me again  she was pressing my hand now i saw her bending over me i felt her hair as it brushed my face she spoke again there was a tremor in her voice and to that alone i listened the words were decisive of command and with them some sense as of a haven near came to me another voice answered in a strange tongue saying seemingly  oui madamemale couribon djemale couri  i heard the doors close and the sound of footsteps running and dying along the banquette and after that my shoulders were raised and something wrapped about them then stillness again the stillness that comes between waking and sleeping between pain and calm and at times when i felt her hand fall into mine or press against my brow the pain seemed more endurable after that i recall being lifted being borne along i opened my eyes once and saw above a tilecrowned wall the moon all yellow and distorted in the sky then a gate clicked dungeon blackness halflight again ascent oblivion    chapter xii visions and an awakening  i have still sharp memories of the tortures of that illness though it befell so long ago at times when my mind was gone from me i cried out i know not what of jargon of sentiment of the horrors i had beheld in my life i lived again the pleasant scenes warped and burlesqued almost beyond cognizance and the tragedies were magnified a hundred fold thus it would be on the low white ceiling five cracks came together and that was a device and the device would take on color redbronze like the sumach in the autumn and streaks of vermilion and two glowing coals that were eyes and above them eagles feathers and the cracks became bramble bushes i was behind the log and at times i started and knew that it was a hideous dream and again polly ann was clutching me and praying me to hold back and i broke from her and splashed over the slippery limestone bed of the creek to fight singlehanded through all the fearful struggle i heard her calling me piteously to come back to her when the brute got me under water i could not hear her but her voice came back suddenly as when a door opens and it was like the wind singing in the poplars was it polly anns voice  again i sat with nick under the trees on the lawn at temple bow and the world was dark with the coming storm i knew and he knew that the storm was brewing that i might be thrust out into it and then in the blackness when the air was filled with all the fair things of the earth torn asunder a beautiful woman came through the noise and the fury and we ran to her and clung to her skirts thinking we had found safety but she thrust us forth into the blackness with a smile as though she were flinging papers out of the window she too grew out of the design in the cracks of the ceiling and a greater fear seized me at sight of her features than when the red face came out of the brambles  my constant torment was thirst i was in the prairie and it was scorched and brown to the horizon i searched and prayed pitifully for waterfor only a sip of the brown water with the specks in it that was in the swamp there were no swamps i was on the bed in the cabin looking at the shifts and hunting shirts on the pegs and polly ann would bring a gourdful of clear water from the spring as far as the door nay once i got it to my lips and it was gone sometimes a young man in a hunting shirt squareshouldered cleareyed his face tanned and his fair hair bleached by the sun would bring the water he was the hero of my boyhood and part of him indeed was in me and i would have followed him again to vincennes despite the tortures of the damned but when i spoke his name he grew stouter before me and his eyes lost their lustre and his hair turned gray and his hand shook as he held out the gourd and spilled its contents ere i could reach them  sometimes another brought the water and at sight of her i would tremble and grow faint and i had not the strength to reach for it she would look at me with eyes that laughed despite the resolution of the mouth then the eyes would grow pitiful at my helplessness and she would murmur my name there was some reason which i never fathomed why she could not give me the water and her own suffering seemed greater than mine because of it so great did it seem that i forgot my own and sought to comfort her then she would go away very slowly and i would hear her calling to me in the wind from the stars to which i looked up from the prairie it was she i thought who ordered the world who when women were lost and men cried out in distress came to them calmly ministered to them deftly  onceperhaps a score of times i cannot tellwas limned on the ceiling where the cracks were her miniature and i knew what was coming and shuddered and cried aloud because i could not stop it i saw the narrow street of a strange city deep down between high houseshouses with gratings on the lowest windows with studded evillooking doors with upper stories that toppled over to shut out the light of the sky with slated roofs that slanted and twisted this way and that and dormers peeping from them down in the street instead of the kings white soldiers was a foul unkempt rabble creeping out of its damp places jesting cursing singing and in the midst of the rabble a lady sat in a cart high above it unmoved she was the lady of the miniature a window in one of the jutting houses was flung open a little man leaned out excitedly and i knew him too he was jean baptiste lenoir and he cried out in a shrill voice  you must take off her ruff citizens you must take off her ruff  there came a blessed day when my thirst was gone when i looked up at the cracks in the ceiling and wondered why they did not change into horrors i watched them a long long time and it seemed incredible that they should still remain cracks beyond that i would not go into speculation i dared not venture they remained cracks and i went to sleep thanking god when i awoke a breeze came in cool fitful gusts and on it the scent of camellias i thought of turning my head and i remember wondering for a long time over the expediency of this move what would happen if i did perhaps the visions would come back perhaps my head would come off finally i decided to risk it and the first thing that i beheld was a palmleaf fan moving slowly that fact gave me food for thought and contented me for a while then i hit upon the idea that there must be something behind the fan i was distinctly pleased by this astuteness and i spent more time in speculation whatever it was it had a tantalizing elusiveness keeping the fan between it and me this was not fair  i had an inspiration if i feigned to be asleep perhaps the thing behind the fan would come out i shut my eyes the breeze continued steadily surely no human being could fan as long as that without being tired i opened my eyes twice but the thing was inscrutable then i heard a sound that i knew to be a footstep upon boards a voice whispered  the delirium has left him  another voice a mans voice answered  thank god let me fan him you are tired  i am not tired answered the first voice  i do not see how you have stood it said the mans voice you will kill yourself madame la vicomtesse the danger is past now  i hope so mr temple said the first voice please go away you may come back in half an hour  i heard the footsteps retreating then i said i am not asleep  the fan stopped for a brief instant and then went on vibrating inexorably i was entranced at the thought of what i had done i had spoken though indeed it seemed to have had no effect could it be that i hadnt spoken i began to be frightened at this when gradually something crept into my mind and drove the fear out i did not grasp what this was at first it was like the first staining of wine on the eastern sky to one who sees a sunrise and then the thought grew even as the light grows tinged by prismatic colors until at length a memory struck into my soul like a shaft of light i spoke her name unblushingly aloud  helene  the fan stopped there was a silence that seemed an eternity as the palm leaf trembled in her hand there was an answer that strove tenderly to command  hush you must not talk she said  never i believe came such supreme happiness with obedience i felt her hand upon my brow and the fan moved again i fell asleep once more from sheer weariness of joy she was there beside me she had been there beside me through it all and it was her touch which had brought me back to life  i dreamed of her when i awoke again her image was in my mind and i let it rest there in contemplation but presently i thought of the fan turned my head and it was not there a great fear seized me i looked out of the open door where the morning sun threw the checkered shadows of the honeysuckle on the floor of the gallery and over the railing to the treetops in the courtyard the place struck a chord in my memory then my eyes wandered back into the room there was a polished dresser a crucifix and a priedieu in the corner a fauteuil and another chair at my bed the floor was rubbed to an immaculate cleanliness stained yellow and on it lay clean woven mats the room was empty  i cried out a yellow and red turban shot across the window and i beheld in the door the spare countenance of the faithful lindy  marse dave she cried is you feelin well honey  where am i lindy i asked  lindy like many of her race knew well how to assume airs of importance lindy had me down and she knew it  marse dave she said doan yo know bettern dat yo know yo aint ter talk lawsy i reckon i wouldnt be wuth pizen if she was to hear i let yo talk  lindy implied that there was tyranny somewhere  she i asked whos she  now yo hush marse dave said lindy in a shrill whisper i aint ergwine ter git mixed up in no disputation ef she was ter hear me erdisputin wid yo marse dave i reckon id done git such er tonguelashin lindy looked at me suspiciously yoer allus was powerful cute marse dave  lindy set her lips with a mighty resolve to be silent i heard some one coming along the gallery and then i saw nicks tall figure looming up behind her  davy he cried  lindy braced herself up doggedly  yo aint ergwine to git in thar nohow marse nick she said  nonsense lindy he answered ive been in there as much as you have and he took hold of her thin arm and pulled her back  marse nick she cried terrorstricken shell done fin out dat youve been ertalkin  pish said nick with a fine air whos afraid of her  lindys face took on an expression of intense amusement  yo is for one marse nick she answered with the familiarity of an old servant i done seed yo skedaddle when she comed  tut said nick grandly i run from no woman eh davy he pushed past the protesting lindy into the room and took my hand  egad you have been near the devils precipice my son a threebottle man would have gone over in his eyes was all the strange affection he had had for me ever since ave had been boys at temple bow together davy i reckon life wouldnt have been worth much if youd gone  i did not answer i could only stare at him mutely grateful for such an affection in all his wild life he had been true to me and he had clung to me stanchly in this my greatest peril thankful that he was here i searched his handsome person with my eyes he was dressed as usual with care and fashion in linen breeches and a light gray coat and a filmy ruffle at his neck but i thought there had come a change into his face the reckless quality seemed to have gone out of it yet the spirit and daring remained and with these all the sweetness that was once in his smile there were lines under his eyes that spoke of vigils  you have been sitting up with me i said  of course he answered patting my shoulder of course i have what did you think i would be doing  what was the matter with me i asked  nothing much he said lightly a touch of the sun and a great deal of overwork in behalf of your friends now keep still or i will be getting peppered  i was silent for a while turning over this answer in my mind then i said  i had yellow fever  he started  it is no use to lie to you he replied youre too shrewd  i was silent again for a while  nick i said you had no right to stay here you haveother responsibilities now  he laughed it was the old buoyant boyish laugh of sheer happiness and i felt the better for hearing it  if you begin to preach parson ill go i vow ill have no more sermonizing davy he cried isnt she just the dearest sweetest most beautiful person in the world  where is she i asked temporizing nick was not a subtle person and i was ready to follow him at great length in the praise of antoinette i hope she is not here  we made her go to les iles said he  and you risked your life and stayed here without her i said  as for risking life that kind of criticism doesnt come well from you and as for antoinette he added with a smile i expect to see something of her later on  well i answered with a sigh of supreme content you have been a fool all your life and i hope that she will make you sensible  you never could make me so said nick and besides i dont think youve been so damned sensible yourself  we were silent again for a space  davy he asked do you remember what i said when you had that miniature here  you said a great many things i believe  i told you to consider carefully the masterful features of that lady and to thank god you hadnt married her i vow i never thought shed turn up upon my oath i never thought i should be such a blind slave as i have been for the last fortnight faith monsieur de st gre is a strong man but he was no more than a puppet in his own house when he came back here for a day that lady could govern a provinceno a kingdom but i warrant you there would be no climbing of balconies in her dominions i have never been so generalled in my life  i had no answer for these comments  the deuce of it is the way she does it he continued plainly bent on relieving himself theres no noise no fuss but you must obey you dont know why and yet you may flay me if i dont love her  love her i repeated  she saved your life said nick i dont believe any other woman could have done it she hadnt any thought of her own she has been here in this room almost constantly night and day and she never let you go the little french doctor gave you upnot she she held on cursed if i see why she did it  nor i i answered  well he said apologetically of course i would have done it but you werent anything to her yes egad you were something to be savedthat was all that was necessary she had you brought back herewe are in monsieur de st gres house by the wayin a litter and she took command as though she had nursed yellow fever cases all her life no flurry i said that you were in love with her once davy when i saw you looking at the portrait i take it back of course a man could be very fond of her he said but a king ought to have married her as for that poor vicomte shes tied up to i reckon i know the reason why he didnt come to america an ordinary man would have no chance at all god bless her he cried with a sudden burst of feeling i would die for her myself she got me out of a barrel of trouble with his excellency she cared for my mother a lonely outcast and braved death herself to go to her when she was dying of the fever god bless her  lindy was standing in the doorway  lan sakes marse nick yo gotter go she said  he rose and pressed my fingers ill go he said and left me lindy seated herself in the chair she held in her hand a bowl of beef broth from this she fed me in silence and when she left she commanded me to sleep informing me that she would be on the gallery within call  but i did not sleep at once nicks words had brought back a fact which my returning consciousness had hitherto ignored the birds sang in the courtyard and when the breeze stirred it was ever laden with a new scent i had been snatched from the jaws of death my life was before me but the happiness which had thrilled me was gone and in my weakness the weight of the sadness which had come upon me was almost unbearable if i had had the strength i would have risen then and there from my bed i would have fled from the city at the first opportunity as it was i lay in a torture of thought living over again every part of my life which she had touched i remembered the first long yearning look i had given the miniature at madame bouvets i had not loved her then my feeling rather had been a mysterious sympathy with and admiration for this brilliant lady whose sphere was so far removed from mine this was sufficiently strange again in the years of my struggle for livelihood which followed i dreamed of her i pictured her often in the midst of the darkness of the revolution then i had the miniature again which had travelled to her as it were and come back to me even then it was not love i felt but an unnamed sentiment for one whom i clothed with gifts and attributes i admired constancy an ability to suffer and to hide decision wit refuge for the weak scorn for the false so i named them at random and cherished them knowing that these things were not what other men longed for in women nay there was another quality which i believed was therewhich i knew was therea supreme tenderness that was hidden like a treasure too sacred to be seen  i did not seek to explain the mystery which had brought her across the sea into that little garden of mrs temples and into my heart there she was now enthroned deified that she would always be there i accepted that i would never say or do anything not in consonance with her standards i knew that i would suffer much i was sure but the lees of that suffering i should hoard because they came from her  what might have been i tried to put away there was the moment i thought when our souls had met in the little parlor in the rue bourbon i should never know this i knewthat we had labored together to bring happiness into other lives  then came another thought to appall me unmindful of her own safety she had nursed me back to life through all the horrors of the fever the doctor had despaired and i knew that by the very force that was in her she had saved me she was here now in this house and presently she would be coming back to my bedside painfully i turned my face to the wall in a torment of humiliationi had called her by her name i would see her again but i knew not whence the strength for that ordeal was to come    chapter xiii a mystery  i knew by the light that it was evening when i awoke so prisoners mark the passing of the days by a bar of sun light and as i looked at the green trees in the courtyard vaguely troubled by i knew not what some one came and stood in the doorway it was nick  you dont seem very cheerful said he a man ought to be who has been snatched out of the fire  you seem to be rather too sure of my future i said trying to smile  thats more like you said nick egad you ought to be happywe all ought to be happyshes gone  she i cried whos gone  madame la vicomtesse he replied rubbing his hands as he stood over me but shes left instructions with me for lindy as long as monsieur de carondelets bando de buen gobierno you are not to do this and you are not to do that you are to eat such and such things you are to be made to sleep at such and such times she came in here about an hour ago and took a long look at you before she left  she was not ill i said faintly  faith i dont know why she was not he said she has done enough to tire out an army but she seems well and fairly happy she had her joke at my expense as she went through the courtyard and she reminded me that we were to send a report by andre every day  chagrin depression relief bewilderment all were struggling within me  where did she go i asked at last  to les iles he said you are to be brought there as soon as you are strong enough  do you happen to know why she went i said  now how the deuce should i know he answered ive done everything with blind servility since i came into this house i never asked for any reasonit never would have done any good i suppose she thought that you were well on the road to recovery and she knew that lindy was an old hand and then the doctor is to come in  why didnt you go i demanded with a sudden remembrance that he was staying away from happiness  it was because i longed for another taste of liberty davy he laughed you and i will have an oldfashioned time here togethera deal of talk and perhaps a little piquetwho knows  my strength came back bit by bit and listening to his happiness did much to ease the soreness of my heartwhile the light lasted it was in the night watches that my struggles camethough often some unwitting speech of his would bring back the pain he took delight in telling me for example how for hours at a time i had been in a fearful delirium  the lord knows what foolishness you talked davy said he it would have done me good to hear you had you been in your right mind  but you did hear me i said full of apprehensions  some of it said he you were after wilkinson once in a burrow i believe and you swore dreadfully because he got out of the other end i cant remember all the things you said oh yes once you were talking to auguste de st gre about money  money i repeated in a sinking voice  oh a lot of jargon the vicomtesse pushed me out of the room and after that i was never allowed to be there when you had those flights curse the mosquitoes he seized a fan and began to ply it vigorously i remember you were giving auguste a lecture then i had to go  these and other reminiscences gave me sufficient food for reflection and many a shudder over the possibilities of my ravings she had put him out no wonder  after a while i was carried to the gallery and there i would talk to the little doctor about the yellow fever which had swept the city monsieur perrin was not much of a doctor to be sure and he had a heartier dread of the american invasion than of the scourge he worshipped the vicomtesse and was so devoid of professional pride as to give her freely all credit for my recovery he too clothed her with the qualities of statesmanship  ha monsieur he said if that lady had been king of france do you think there would have been any states general any red bonnets any jacobins or cordeliers parbleu she would have swept the vicemongers and traitors out of the palais royal itself there would have been a housecleaning there i who speak to you know it  every day nick wrote a bulletin to be sent to the vicomtesse and he took a fiendish delight in the composition of these he would come out on the gallery with ink and a blank sheet of paper and try to enlist my help he would insert the most ridiculous statements as for instance davy is worse today having bribed lindy to give him a pint of madeira against my orders or davy feigns to be sinking rapidly because he wishes to have you back indeed i was always in a torture of doubt to know what the rascal had sent  his company was most agreeable when he was recounting the many adventures he had had during the five years after he had left new orleans and been lost to me these would fill a book and a most readable book it would be if written in his own speech his love for the excitement of the frontier had finally drawn him back to the cumberland country near nashville and he had actually gone so far as to raise a house and till some of the land which he had won from darnley it was perhaps characteristic of him that he had named the place rattleandsnap in honor of the game which had put him in possession of it and rattleandsnap it remains to this day he was going back there with antoinette so he said to build a brick mansion and to live a respectable life the rest of his days  there was one question which had been in my mind to ask him concerning the attitude of monsieur de st gre that gentleman with madame had hurried back from pointe coupee at a message from the vicomtesse and had gone first to les iles to see antoinette then he had come in spite of the fever to his own house in new orleans to see nick himself what their talk had been i never knew for the subject was too painful to be dwelt upon and the conversation had been marked by frankness on both sides monsieur de st gre was a just man his love for his daughter was his chief passion and despite all that had happened he liked nick i believe he could not wholly blame the younger man and he forgave him  mrs temple poor lady had died on that first night of my illness and it was her punishment that she had not known her son or her sons happiness whatever sins she had committed in her wayward life were atoned for and by her death i firmly believe that she redeemed him she lies now among the temples in charleston and on the stone which marks her grave is cut no line that hints of the story of these pages  one bright morning when nick and i were playing cards we heard some one mounting the stairs and to my surprise and embarrassment i beheld monsieur de st gre emerging on the gallery he was in white linen and wore a broad hat which he took from his head as he advanced he had aged somewhat his hair was a little gray but otherwise he was the firm dignified personage i had admired on this same gallery five years before  good morning gentlemen he said in english ha do not rise sir to me he patted nicks shoulder kindly but not familiarly as he passed him and extended his hand  mr ritchie it gives me more pleasure than i can express to see you so much recovered  i am again thrown on your hospitality sir i said flushing with pleasure at this friendliness for i admired and respected the man greatly and i fear i have been a burden and trouble to you and your family  he took my hand and pressed it characteristically he did not answer this and i remembered he was always careful not to say anything which might smack of insincerity  i had a glimpse of you some weeks ago he said thus making light of the risk he had run you are a different man now you may thank your scotch blood and your strong constitution  his good habits have done him some good after all put in my irrepressible cousin  monsieur de st gre smiled  nick he said he pronounced the name quaintly like antoinette his good habits have turned out to be some advantage to you mr ritchie you have a faithful friend at least he patted nicks shoulder again and he has promised me to settle down  i have every inducement sir said nick  monsieur de st gre became grave  you have indeed monsieur he answered  i have just come from dr perrins davidhe added may i call you so well then i have just come from dr perrins and he says you may be moved to les iles this very afternoon why upon my word he exclaimed staring at me you dont look pleased one would think you were going to the calabozo  ah said nick slyly i know he has tasted freedom monsieur and madame la vicomtesse will be in command again  i flushed nick could be very exasperating  you must not mind him monsieur i said  i do not mind him answered monsieur de st gre laughing in spite of himself he is a sad rogue as for helene  i shall not know how to thank the vicomtesse i said she has done me the greatest service one person can do another  helene is a good woman answered monsieur de st gre simply she is more than that she is a wonderful woman i remember telling you of her once i little thought then that she would ever come to us  he turned to me dr perrin will be here this afternoon david and he will have you dressed between five and six if all goes well we shall start for les iles and in the meantime gentlemen he added with a stateliness that was natural to him i have business which takes me today to my brotherinlaws monsieur de beausejours  nick leaned over the gallery and watched meditatively his prospective fatherinlaw leaving the courtyard  he got me out of a devilish bad scrape he said  how was that i asked listlessly  that fat little baron the governor was for deporting me for running past the sentry and giving him all the trouble i did it seems that the vicomtesse promised to explain matters in a note which she wrote and never did explain she was here with you and a lot she cared about anything else lucky that monsieur de st gre came back now his excellency graciously allows me to stay here if i behave myself until i get married  i do not know how i spent the rest of the day it passed somehow if i had had the strength then i believe i should have fled i was to see her again to feel her near me to hear her voice during the weeks that had gone by i had schooled myself in a sense to the inevitable i had not let my mind dwell upon my visit to les iles and now i was face to face with the struggle for which i felt i had not the strength i had fought one battlei knew that a fiercer battle was to come  in due time the doctor arrived and while he prepared me for my departure the little man sought with misplaced kindness to raise my spirits was not monsieur going to the country to a paradise monsieurso dr perrin had noticedhad a turn for philosophy could two more able and brilliant conversationalists be found than philippe de st gre and madame la vicomtesse and there was the happiness of that strange but lovable young man monsieur temple to contemplate he was in luck ce beau garcon for he was getting an angel for his wife did monsieur know that mademoiselle antoinette was an angel  at last i was ready arrayed in my best on the gallery when monsieur de st gre came andre and another servant carried me down into the court and there stood a painted sedanchair with the st gre arms on the panels  my father imported it david said monsieur de st gre it has not been used for many years you are to be carried in it to the levee and there i have a boat for you  overwhelmed by this kindness i could not find words to thank him as i got into the chair my legs were too long for it i remember i had a quaint feeling of unreality as i sank back on the red satin cushions and was borne out of the gate between the lions monsieur de st gre and nick walked in front the faithful lindy followed and people paused to stare at us as we passed we crossed the place darmes the royal road gained the willowbordered promenade on the levees crown and a wide barge was waiting manned by six negro oarsmen they lifted me into its stern under the awning the barge was cast off the oars dipped and we were gliding silently past the line of keel boats on the swift current of the mississippi the spars of the shipping were inky black and the setting sun had struck a red band across the waters for a while the three of us sat gazing at the green shore each wrapped in his own reflectionsphilippe de st gre thinking perchance of the wayward son he had lost nick of the woman who awaited him and i of one whom fate had set beyond me it was monsieur de st gre who broke the silence at last  you feel no ill effects from your moving david he asked with an anxious glance at me  none sir i said  the country air will do you good he said kindly  and madame la vicomtesse will put him on a diet added nick rousing himself  helene will take care of him answered monsieur de st gre  he fell to musing again madame la vicomtesse has seen more in seven years than most of us see in a lifetime he said she has beheld the glory of france and the dishonor and pollution of her country had the old order lasted her salon would have been famous and she would have been a power in politics  i have thought that the vicomtesse must have had a queer marriage nick remarked  monsieur de st gre smiled  such marriages were the rule amongst our nobility he said it was arranged while helene was still in the convent though it was not celebrated until three years after she had been in the world there was a romantic affair i believe with a young gentleman of the english embassy though i do not know the details he is said to be the only man she ever cared for he was a younger son of an impoverished earl  i started remembering what the vicomtesse had said but monsieur de st gre did not appear to see my perturbation  be that as it may if helene suffered she never gave a sign of it the marriage was celebrated with great pomp and the world could only conjecture what she thought of the vicomte it was deemed on both sides a brilliant match he had inherited vast estates ivryletour montmery les saillantes i know not what else she was heiress to the chateau de st gre with its wide lands to the chateau and lands of the cote rouge in normandy to the hotel st gre in paris monsieur le vicomte was between forty and fifty at his marriage and from what i have heard of him he had many of the virtues and many of the faults of his order he was a bachelor which does not mean that he had lacked consolations he was reserved with his equals and distant with others he had served in the guards and did not lack courage he dressed exquisitely was inclined to the polignac party took his ease everywhere had a knowledge of cards and courts and little else he was cheated by his stewards refused to believe that the revolution was serious and would undoubtedly have been guillotined had the vicomtesse not contrived to get him out of france in spite of himself they went first to the duke de ligne at bel oeil and thence to coblentz he accepted a commission in the austrian service which is much to his credit and helene went with some friends to england there my letter reached her and rather than be beholden to strangers or accept my money there she came to us that is her story in brief messieurs as for monsieur le vicomte he admired his wife as well he might respected her for the way she served the gallants but he made no pretence of loving her one affaira girl in the village of montmeryhad lasted helene was destined for higher things than may be found in louisiana said monsieur de st gre turning to nick but now that you are to carry away my treasure monsieur i do not know what i should have done without her  and has there been any news of the vicomte of late  it was nick who asked the question after a little monsieur de st gre looked at him in surprise  eh mon dieu have you not heard he said cest vrai you have been with david did not the vicomtesse mention it but why should she monsieur le vicomte died in vienna he had lived too well  the vicomte is dead i said  they both looked at me indeed i should not have recognized my own voice what my face betrayed what my feelings were i cannot say my heart beat no faster there was no tumult in my brain and yetmy breath caught strangely something grew within me which is beyond the measure of speech and so it was meant to be  i did not know this myself until helene returned to les iles monsieur de st gre was saying to me the letter came to her the day after you were taken ill it was from the baron von seckenbruck at whose house the vicomte died she took it very calmly for helene is not a woman to pretend how much better after all if she had married her englishman for love and she is much troubled now because as she declares she is dependent upon my bounty that is my happiness my consolation the good man added simply and her father the marquis was kind to me when i was a young provincial and a stranger god rest his soul  we were drawing near to les iles the rains had come during my illness and in the level evening light the forest of the shore was the tender green of spring at length we saw the white wooden steps in the levee at the landing and near them were three figures waiting we glided nearer one was madame de st gre another was antoinettethese i saw indeed the other was helene and it seemed to me that her eyes met mine across the waters and drew them then we were at the landing i heard madame de st gres voice and antoinettes in welcomei listened for another i saw nick running up the steps in the impetuosity of his love he had seized antoinettes hand in his and she was the color of a red rose creole decorum forbade further advances andre and another lifted me out and they gathered around methese kind people and devoted friendsantoinette calling me with exquisite shyness by name madame de st gre giving me a grave but gentle welcome and asking anxiously how i stood the journey another took my hand held it for the briefest space that has been marked out of time and for that instant i looked into her eyes life flowed back into me and strength and a joy not to be fathomed i could have walked but they bore me through the wellremembered vista and the white gallery at the end of it was like the sight of home the evening air was laden with the scent of the sweetest of all shrubs and flowers    chapter xiv to unpathed waters undreamed shores  monsieur and madame de st gre themselves came with me to my chamber off the gallery where everything was prepared for my arrival with the most loving caremonsieur de st gre supplying many things from his wardrobe which i lacked and when i tried to thank them for their kindness he laid his hand upon my shoulder  tenez mon ami he said you got your illness by doing things for other people it is time other people did something for you  lindy brought me the daintiest of suppers and i was left to my meditations nick looked in at the door and hinted darkly that i had to thank a certain tyrant for my abandonment i called to him but he paid no heed and i heard him chuckling as he retreated along the gallery the journey the excitement into which i had been plunged by the news i had heard brought on a languor and i was between sleeping and waking half the night i slept to dream of her of the vicomte her husband walking in his park or playing cards amidst a brilliant company in a great candlelit room like the drawingroom at temple bow doubt grew and sleep left me she was free now indeed but was she any nearer to me hope grew againwhy had she left me in new orleans she had received a letter and if she had cared she would not have remained but there was a detestable argument to fit that likewise and in the light of this argument it was most natural that she should return to les iles and who was i david ritchie a lawyer of the little town of louisville to aspire to the love of such a creature was it likely that helene vicomtesse divryletour would think twice of me the powers of the world were making ready to crush the presumptuous france of the jacobins and the france of king and aristocracy would be restored chateaux and lands would be hers again and she would go back again to that brilliant life among the great to which she was born for which nature had fitted her last of all was the thought of the englishman whom i resembled she would go back to him  nick was the first in my room the next morning he had risen early so he ingenuously informed me because antoinette had a habit of getting up with the birds and as i drank my coffee he was emphatic in his denunciations of the customs of the country  it is a wonderful day davy he cried you must hurry and get out monsieur de st gre sends his compliments and wishes to know if you will pardon his absence this morning he is going to escort antoinette and me over to see some of my prospective cousins the bertrands he made a face and bent nearer to my ear i swear to you i have not had one moment alone with her we have been for a walk but madame la vicomtesse must needs intrude herself upon us egad i told her plainly what i thought of her tyranny  and what did she say i asked trying to smile  she laughed and said that i belonged to a young nation which had done much harm in the world to everybody but themselves faith if i wasnt in love with antoinette i believe id be in love with her  i have no doubt of it i answered  the vicomtesse is as handsome as a queen this morning he continued paying no heed to this remark she has on a linen dress that puzzles me it was made to walk among the trees and flowers it is as simple as you please and yet it has a distinction that makes you stare  you seem to have stared i answered since when did you take such interest in gowns  bless you it was antoinette i never should have known said he antoinette had never before seen the gown and she asked the vicomtesse where she got the pattern the vicomtesse said that the gown had been made by leonard a court dressmaker and it was of the fashion the queen had set to wear in the gardens of the trianon when simplicity became the craze antoinette is to have it copied so she says  which proved that antoinette was human after all and happy once more  hang it said nick she paid more attention to that gown than to me goodby davy obey thethe colonel  isis not the vicomtesse going with you i asked  no im sorry for you he called back from the gallery  he had need to be for i fell into as great a fright as ever i had had in my life monsieur de st gre knocked at the door and startled me out of my wits hearing that i was awake he had come in person to make his excuses for leaving me that morning  bon dieu he said looking at me the country has done you good already behold a marvel au revoir david  i heard the horses being brought around and laughter and voices how easily i distinguished hers then i heard the hoofbeats on the soft dirt of the drive then silencethe silence of a summer morning which is all myriad sweet sounds then lindy appeared starched and turbaned  marse dave how you feel dis mawnin yo pears mighty peart sholy marse dave yo chair is sot on de gallery is you ready ill fotch dat yaller nigger andre  you neednt fetch andre i said i can walk  lan sakes marse dave but you is bumptious  i rose and walked out on the gallery with surprising steadiness a great cushioned chair had been placed there and beside it a table with books and another chair i sat down lindy looked at me sharply but i did not heed her and presently she retired the day still in its early golden glory seemed big with prescience above the saffron haze was lifted and there was the blue sky the breeze held its breath the fragrance of grass and fruit and flowers of the shrub that vied with all languished on the air out of these things she came  i knew that she was coming but i saw her first at the gallerys end the roses she held red against the white linen of her gown then i felt a great yearning and a great dread i have seen many of her kind since and none reflected so truly as she the life of the old regime her dress her carriage her air all suggested it and she might as nick said have been walking in the gardens of the trianon titles i cared nothing for hers alone seemed real to put her far above me had all who bore them been as worthy titles would have meant much to mankind  she was coming swiftly i rose to my feet before her i believe i should have risen in death and then she was standing beside me looking up into my face  you must not do that she said or i will go away  i sat down again she went to the door and called i following her with my eyes lindy came with a bowl of water  put it on the table said the vicomtesse  lindy put the bowl on the table gave us a glance and departed silently the vicomtesse began to arrange the flowers in the bowl and i watched her fascinated by her movements she did everything quickly deftly but this matter took an unconscionable time she did not so much as glance at me she seemed to have forgotten my presence  there she said at last giving them a final touch you are less talkative if anything than usual this morning mr ritchie you have not said good morning you have not told me how you wereyou have not even thanked me for the roses one might almost believe that you are sorry to come to les iles  one might believe anything who didnt know madame la vicomtesse  she put her hand to the flowers again  it seems a pity to pick them even in a good cause she said  she was so near me that i could have touched her a weakness seized me and speech was farther away than ever she moved she sat down and looked at me and the kind of mocking smile came into her eyes that i knew was the forerunner of raillery  there is a statue in the gardens of versailles which seems always about to speak and then to think better of it you remind me of that statue mr ritchie it is the statue of wisdom  what did she mean  wisdom knows the limitations of its own worth madame i replied  it is the one particular in which i should have thought wisdom was lacking she said you have a tongue if you will deign to use it or shall i read to you she added quickly picking up a book i have read to the queen when madame campan was tired her majesty poor dear lady did me the honor to say she liked my english  you have done everything madame i said  i have read to a queen to a kings sister but never yetto a king she said opening the book and giving me the briefest of glances you are all kings in america are you not what shall i read  i would rather have you talk to me  very well i will tell you how the queen spoke english no i will not do that she said a swift expression of sadness passing over her face i will never mock her again she was a good sovereign and a brave woman and i loved her she was silent a moment and i thought there was a great weariness in her voice when she spoke again i have every reason to thank god when i think of the terrors i escaped of the friends i have found and yet i am an unhappy woman mr ritchie  you are unhappy when you are not doing things for others madame i suggested  i am a discontented woman she said i always have been and i am unhappy when i think of all those who were dear to me and whom i loved many are dead and many are scattered and homeless  i have often thought of your sorrows madame i said  which reminds me that i should not burden you with them my good friend when you are recovering do you know that you have been very near to death  i know madame i faltered i know that had it not been for you i should not be alive today i know that you risked your life to save my own  she did not answer at once and when i looked at her she was gazing out over the flowers on the lawn  my life did not matter she said let us not talk of that  i might have answered but i dared not speak for fear of saying what was in my heart and while i trembled with the repression of it she was changed she turned her face towards me and smiled a little  if you had obeyed me you would not have been so ill she said  then i am glad that i did not obey you  your cousin the irrepressible mr temple says i am a tyrant come now do you think me a tyrant  he has also said other things of you  what other things  i blushed at my own boldness  he said that if he were not in love with antoinette he would be in love with you  a very safe compliment said the vicomtesse indeed it sounds too cautious for mr temple you must have tampered with it mr ritchie she flashed mr temple is a boy he needs discipline he will have too easy a time with antoinette  he is not the sort of man you should marry i said and sat amazed at it  she looked at me strangely  no he is not she answered he is more or less the sort of man i have been thrown with all my life they toil not neither do they spin i know you will not misunderstand me for i am very fond of him mr temple is honest fearless lovable and of good instincts one cannot say as much for the rest of his type they go through life fighting gaming horseracing riding to houndsi have often thought that it was no wonder our privileges came to an end so many of us were steeped in selfishness and vice were a burden on the world the early nobles with all their crimes were men who carved their way of such were the lords of the marches we toyed with politics with simplicity we wasted the land we played cards as our coaches passed through faminestricken villages the reckoning came our punishment was not given into the hands of the bourgeois who would have dealt justly but to the scum the canaille the demons of the earth had our king had our nobility been men with the old fire they would not have stood it they were worn out with centuries of catering to themselves give me a man who will shape his life and live it with all his strength i am tired of sham and pretence of cynical wit of mocking at the real things of life of pride vainglory and hypocrisy give me a man whose existence means something  was she thinking of the englishman of whom she had spoken delicacy forbade my asking the question he had been a man according to her own testimony where was he now her voice had a ring of earnestness in it i had never heard before and this arraignment of her own life and of her old friends surprised me now she seemed lost in a revery from which i forebore to arouse her  i have often tried to picture your life i said at last  you she answered turning her head quickly  ever since i first saw the miniature i said monsieur de st gre told me some things and afterwards i read le mariage de figaro and some novels and some memoirs of the old courts which i got in philadelphia last winter i used to think of you as i rode over the mountains as i sat reading in my room of an evening i used to picture you in the palaces amusing the queen and making the cardinals laugh and then i used to wonderwhat became of youand whether i hesitated overwhelmed by a sudden confusion for she was gazing at me fixedly with a look i did not understand  you used to think of that she said  i never thought to see you i answered  laughter came into her eyes and i knew that i had not vexed her but i had spoken stupidly and i reddened  i had a quick tongue she said as though to cover my confusion i have it yet in those days misfortune had not curbed it i had not learned to be charitable when i was a child i used to ride with my father to the hunts at st gre and i was too ready to pick out the weaknesses of his guests if one of the company had a trick or a mannerism i never failed to catch it people used to ask me what i thought of such and such a person and that was bad for me i saw their failings and pretensions but i ignored my own it was the same at abbaye aux bois the convent where i was taught when i was presented to her majesty i saw why people hated her they did not understand her she was a woman with a large heart with charity some did not suspect this others forgot it because they beheld a brilliant personage with keen perceptions who would not submit to being bored her majesty made many enemies at court of persons who believed she was making fun of them there was a dressmaker at the french court called mademoiselle bertin who became ridiculously pretentious because the queen allowed the woman to dress her hair in private bertin used to put on airs with the nobility when they came to order gowns and she was very rude to me when i went for my court dress there was a ball at versailles the day i was presented and my father told me that her majesty wished to speak with me i was very much frightened the queen was standing with her back to the mirror the duchesse de polignac and some other ladies beside her when my father brought me up and her majesty was smiling  what did you say to bertin mademoiselle she asked  i was more frightened than ever but the remembrance of the womans impudence got the better of me  i told her that in dressing your majestys hair she had acquired all the court accomplishments but one  ill warrant that bertin was curious said the queen  she was your majesty  what is the accomplishment she lacks the queen demanded i should like to know it myself  it is discrimination your majesty i told the woman there were some people she could be rude to with impunity i was not one of them  shell never be rude to you again mademoiselle said the queen  i am sure of it your majesty i said  the queen laughed and bade the duchesse de polignac invite me to supper that evening my father was delightedi was more frightened than ever but the party was small her majesty was very gracious and spoke to me often and i saw that above all things she liked to be amused poor lady it was a year after that terrible affair of the necklace and she wished to be distracted from thinking of the calumnies which were being heaped upon her she used to send for me often during the years that followed and i might have had a place at court near her person but my father was sensible enough to advise me not to acceptif i could refuse without offending her majesty the queen was not offended she was good enough to say that i was wise in my request she had indeed abolished most of the ridiculous etiquette of the court she would not eat in public she would not be followed around the palace by ladies in court gowns she would not have her ladies in the room when she was dressing if she wished a mirror she would not wait for it to be passed through half a dozen hands and handed her by a princess of the blood sometimes she used to summon me to amuse her and walk with me by the water in the beautiful gardens of the petit triano i used to imitate the people she disliked i disliked them too i have seen her laugh until the tears came into her eyes when i talked of monsieur necker as the dark days drew nearer i loved more and more to be in the seclusion of the country at montmery at the st gre of my girlhood i can see st gre now said the vicomtesse the thatched houses of the little village on either side of the highroad the honest redfaced peasants courtesying in their doorways at our berline the brick wall of the park the iron gates beside the lodge the long avenue of poplars the deer feeding in the beechwood the bridge over the shining stream and the long weatherbeaten chateau beyond it paris and the muttering of the storm were far away the mornings on the sunny terrace looking across the valley to the blue hills the walks in the village grew very dear to me we do not know the value of things mr ritchie until we are about to lose them  you did not go back to court i asked  she sighed  yes i went back i thought it my duty i was at versailles that terrible summer when the states general met when the national assembly grew out of it when the bastille was stormed when the king was throwing away his prerogatives like confetti never did the gardens of the trianon seem more beautiful or more sad sometimes the queen would laugh even then when i mimicked bailly des moulins mirabeau i was with her majesty in the gardens on that dark rainy day when the fishwomen came to versailles the memory of that night will haunt me as long as i live the wind howled the rain lashed with fury against the windows the mob tore through the streets of the town sacked the wineshops built great fires at the corners before the day dawned again the furies had broken into the palace and murdered what was left of the guard you have heard how they carried off the king and queen to parishow they bore the heads of the soldiers on their pikes i saw it from a window and i shall never forget it  her voice faltered and there were tears on her lashes some quality in her narration brought before me so vividly the scenes of which she spoke that i started when she had finished there was much more i would have known but i could not press her to speak longer on a subject that gave her pain at that moment she seemed more distant to me than ever before she rose went into the house and left me thinking of the presumptions of the hopes i had dared to entertain left me picturing sadly the existence of which she had spoken why had she told me of it perchance she had thought to do me a kindness  she came back to mei had not thought she would she sat down with her embroidery in her lap and for some moments busied herself with it in silence then she said without looking up  i do not know why i have tired you with this why i have saddened myself it is past and gone  i was not tired madame it is very difficult to live in the present when the past has been so brilliant i answered  so brilliant she sighed so thoughtlessi think that is the sharpest regret i watched her fingers as they stitched wondering how they could work so rapidly at last she said in a low voice antoinette and mr temple have told me something of your life mr ritchie  i laughed  it has been very humble i replied  what i heard wasinteresting to me she said turning over her frame will you not tell me something of it  gladly madame if that is the case i answered  well then she said why dont you  i do not know which part you would like madame shall i tell you about colonel clark i do not know when to begin  she dropped her sewing in her lap and looked up at me quickly  i told you that you were a strange man she said i almost lose patience with you no dont tell me about colonel clarkat least not until you come to him begin at the beginning at the cabin in the mountains  you want the whole of it i exclaimed  she picked up her embroidery again and bent over it with a smile  yes i want the whole of it  so i began at the cabin in the mountains i cannot say that i ever forgot she was listening but i lost myself in the narrative it presented to me for the first time many aspects that i had not thought of for instance that i should be here now in louisiana telling it to one who had been the companion and friend of the queen of france once in a while the vicomtesse would look up at me swiftly when i paused and then go on with her work again i told her of temple bow and how i had run away of polly ann and tom of the wilderness trail and how i shot cutcheon of the fight at crab orchard of the life in kentucky of clark and his campaign of my doings since how i had found nick and how he had come to new orleans with me of my life as a lawyer in louisville of the conventions i had been to the morning wore on to midday and i told her more than i believed it possible to tell any one when at last i had finished a fear grew upon me that i had told her too much her fingers still stitched her head was bent and i could not see her faceonly the knot of her hair coiled with an art that struck me suddenly then she spoke and her voice was very low  i love polly ann she said i should like to know her  i wish that you could know her i answered quickening  she raised her head and looked at me with an expression that was not a smile i could not say what it was or what it meant  i do not think you are stupid she said in the same tone but i do not believe you know how remarkable your life has been i can scarcely realize that you have seen all this have done all this have felt all this you are a lawyer a man of affairs and yet you could guide me over the hidden paths of half a continent you know the mountain ranges the passes the rivers the fords the forest trails the towns and the men who made them she picked up her sewing and bent over it once more and yet you did not think that this would interest me  perchance it was a subtle summons in her voice i heard that bade me open the floodgates of my hearti know not i know only that no power on earth could have held me silent then  helene i said and stopped my heart beat so wildly that i could hear it i do not know why i should dare to think of you to look up to youhelene i love you i shall love you till i die i love you with all the strength that is in me with all my soul you know it and if you did not i could hide it no more as long as i live there will never be another woman in the world for me i love you you will forgive me because of the torture i have suffered because of the pain i shall suffer when i think of you in the years to come  her sewing dropped to her lapto the floor she looked at me and the light which i saw in her eyes flooded my soul with a joy beyond my belief i trembled with a wonder that benumbed me i would have got to my feet had she not come to me swiftly that i might not rise she stood above me i lifted up my arms she bent to me with a movement that conferred a priceless thing  david she said could you not tell that i loved you that you were he who has been in my mind for so many years and in my heart since i saw you  i could not tell i said i dared not think it ii thought there was another  she was seated on the arm of my chair she drew back her head with a smile trembling on her lips with a lustre burning in her eyes like a vigila vigil for me  he reminded me of you she answered  i was lost in sheer bewildering happiness and she who created it who herself was that happiness roused me from it  what are you thinking she asked  i was thinking that a star has fallenthat i may have a jewel beyond other men i said  and a star has risen for me she said that i may have a guide beyond other women  then it is you who have raised it helene i was silent a moment trying again to bring the matter within my grasp do you mean that you love me that you will marry me that you will come back to kentucky with me and will be contentyou who have been the companion of a queen  there came an archness into her look that inflamed me the more  i who have been the companion of a queen love you will marry you will go back to kentucky with you and be content she repeated and yet not i david but another womana happy woman you shall be my refuge my strength my guide you will lead me over the mountains and through the wilderness by the paths you know you will bring me to polly ann that i may thank her for the gift of youabove all other gifts in the world  i was silent again  helene i said at last will you give me the miniature  on one condition she replied  yes i said yes and again yes what is it  that you will obey mesometimes  it is a privilege i long for i answered  you did not begin with promise she said  i released her hand and she drew the ivory from her gown and gave it me i kissed it  i will go to monsieur isadores and get the frame i said  when i give you permission said helene gently  i have written this story for her eyes    chapter xv an episode in the life of a man  out of the blood and ashes of france a man had arisen who moved real kings and queens on his chessboardwhich was a large part of the world the man was napoleon buonaparte at present for lack of a better name first consul of the french republic the mans eye sweeping the world for a new plaything had rested upon one which had excited the fancy of lesser adventurers of one john law for instance it was a large unwieldy plaything indeed and remote it was nothing less than that vast and mysterious country which lay beyond the monster yellow river of the wilderness the country bordered on the south by the gulf swamps on the north by no man knew what forestsas dark as those the romans found in gaulon the west by a line which other generations might be left to settle  this land was louisiana  a future king of france while an emigre had been to louisiana this is merely an interesting fact worth noting it was not interesting to napoleon  napoleon by dint of certain screws which he tightened on his catholic majesty king charles of spain in the treaty of san ildefonso on the 1st of october 1800 got his plaything louisiana was french againwhatever french was in those days the treaty was a profound secret but secrets leak out even the profoundest and this was wafted across the english channel to the ears of mr rufus king american minister at london who wrote of it to one thomas jefferson president of the united states mr jefferson was interested not to say alarmed  mr robert livingston was about to depart on his mission from the little republic of america to the great republic of france mr livingston was told not to make himself disagreeable but to protest if spain was to give up the plaything the youngest child among the nations ought to have it it lay at her doors it was necessary for her growth  mr livingston arrived in france to find that louisiana was a mere pawn on the chessboard the republic he represented little more he protested and the great talleyrand shrugged his shoulders what was monsieur talking about a treaty what treaty a treaty with spain ceding back louisiana to france after forty years who said there was such a treaty did monsieur take snuff would monsieur call again when the minister was less busy  monsieur did call again taking care not to make himself disagreeable he was offered snuff he called again pleasantly he was offered snuff he called again the great talleyrand laughed he was always so happy to see monsieur when he talleyrand was not busy he would give monsieur a certificate of importunity he had quite forgotten what monsieur was talking about on former occasions oh yes a treaty well suppose there was such a treaty what then  what then mr livingston the agreeable but importunate went home and wrote a memorial and was presently assured that the inaccessible man who was called first consul had read it with interestgreat interest mr livingston did not cease to indulge in his enjoyable visits to talleyrandnot he but in the intervals he sat down to think  what did the inaccessible man himself have in his mind  the man had been considering the anglosaxon race and in particular that portion of it which inhabited the western hemisphere he perceived that they were a quarrelsome people which possessed the lust for land and conquest like the rest of their blood he saw with astonishment something that had happened something that they had done unperceived by the world in five and twenty years they had swept across a thousand miles of mountain and forest wilderness in ever increasing thousands had beaten the fiercest of savage tribes before them stolidly unmindful of their dead they had come at length to the great yellow river and finding it closed had cried aloud in their anger what was beyond it to stop them spain with a handful of subjects inherited from the france of louis the fifteenth  could spain stop them no but he the man would stop them he would raise up in louisiana as a monument to himself a daughter of france to curb their ambition america should not be all anglosaxon  already the americans had compelled spain to open the river how long before they would overrun louisiana itself until a frenchman or a spaniard could scarce be found in the land  sadly in accordance with the treaty which monsieur talleyrand had known nothing about his catholic majesty instructed his intendant at new orleans to make ready to deliver louisiana to the french commission that was in july 1802 this was not exactly an order to close the river againin fact his majesty said nothing about closing the river mark the reasoning of the spanish mind the intendant closed the river as his plain duty and kentucky and tennessee wayward belligerent infants who had outgrown their swaddling clothes were heard from again the nation had learned to listen to them the nation was very angry mr hamilton and the federalists and many others would have gone to war and seized the floridas  mr jefferson said wait and see what his catholic majesty has to say mr jefferson was a man of great wisdom albeit he had mistaken jacobinism for something else when he was younger and he knew that napoleon could not play chess in the wind the wind was rising  mr livingston was a patriot able importunate but getting on in years and a little hard of hearing importunity without an army and a navy behind it is not effectiveespecially when there is no wind but mr jefferson heard the wind rising and he sent mr monroe to mr livingstons aid mr monroe was young witty lively popular with people he met he too heard the wind rising and so now did mr livingston  the ships containing the advance guard of the colonists destined for the new louisiana lay in the roads at dunkirk their anchors ready to weighthree thousand men three thousand horses for the man did things on a large scale the anchors were not weighed  his catholic majesty sent word from spain to mr jefferson that he was sorry his intendant had been so foolish the river was opened again  the treaty of amiens was a poor windshield it blew down and the chessmen began to totter one george of england noted for his frugal table and his quarrelsome disposition who had previously fought with france began to call the man names the man called george names and sat down to think quickly george could not be said to be on the best of terms with his american relations but the anglosaxon is unsentimental phlegmatic setting money and trade and lands above ideals george meant to go to war again napoleon also meant to go to war again but george meant to go to war again right away which was inconvenient and inconsiderate for napoleon had not finished his game of chess the obvious outcome of the situation was that george with his navy would get louisiana or else help his relations to get it in either case louisiana would become anglosaxon  this was the wind which mr jefferson had heard  the man being a genius who let go gracefully when he had to decided between two bad bargains he would sell louisiana to the americans as a favor they would be very very grateful and they would go on hating george moreover he would have all the more money with which to fight george  the inaccessible man suddenly became accessible nay he became gracious smiling full of lovingkindness charitable certain dickerings followed by a bargain passed between the american minister and monsieur barbemarbois then mr livingston and mr monroe dined with the hitherto inaccessible and the man after the manner of continental personages asked questions frederick the great has started this fashion and many have imitated it  louisiana became american at last whether by destiny or chance whether by the wisdom of jefferson or the necessity of napoleon who can say it seems to me david ritchie writing many years after the closing words of the last chapter were penned that it was ours inevitably for i have seen and known and loved the people with all their crudities and faults whose inheritance it was by right of toil and suffering and blood  and i david ritchie saw the flags of three nations waving over it in the space of two days and it came to pass in this wise  rumors of these things which i have told above had filled kentucky from time to time and in november of 1803 there came across the mountains the news that the senate of the united states had ratified the treaty between our ministers and napoleon  i will not mention here what my life had become what my fortune save to say that both had been far beyond my expectations in worldly goods and honors in the respect and esteem of my fellowmen i had been happy indeed but i had been blessed above other men by one whose power it was to lift me above the mean and sordid things of this world  many times in the pursuit of my affairs i journeyed over that country which i had known when it belonged to the indian and the deer and the elk and the wolf and the buffalo often did she ride by my side making light of the hardships which indeed were no hardships to her wondering at the settlements which had sprung up like magic in the wilderness which were the heralds of the greatness of the republicher country now  so in the bright and boisterous march weather of the year 1804 we found ourselves riding together along the way made memorable by the footsteps of clark and his backwoodsmen for i had an errand in st louis with colonel chouteau a subtle change had come upon kaskaskia with the new blood which was flowing into it we passed cahokia full of memories to the drummer boy whom she loved there was the church the garrison the stream and the little house where my colonel and i had lived together she must see them all she must hear the story from my lips again and the telling of it to her gave it a new fire and a new life  at evening when the march wind had torn the cotton clouds to shreds we stood on the mississippis bank gazing at the western shore at louisiana the low forestclad hills made a black band against the sky and above the band hung the sun a red ball he was setting and man might look upon his face without fear the sight of the waters of that river stirred me to think of many things what had god in store for the vast land out of which the waters flowed had he indeed saved it for a people a people to be drawn from all nations from all classes was the principle of the republic to prevail and spread and change the complexion of the world or were the lusts of greed and power to increase until in the end they had swallowed the leaven who could say what man of those who soberly had put his hand to the paper which declared the opportunities of generations to come could measure the force which he had helped to set in motion  we crossed the river to the village where i had been so kindly received many years agoto st louis the place was little changed the wind was stilled the blue wood smoke curled lazily from the wide stone chimneys of the houses nestling against the hill the afterglow was fading into night lights twinkled in the windows followed by our servants we climbed the bank helene and i and walked the quiet streets bordered by palings the evening was chill we passed a bright cabaret from which came the sound of many voices in the blacksmiths shop another group was gathered and we saw faces eager in the red light they were talking of the cession  we passed that place where nick had stopped suzanne in the cart and laughed at the remembrance we came to monsieur gratiots for he had bidden us to stay with him and with madame he gave us a welcome to warm our hearts after our journey  david he said i have seen many strange things happen in my life but the strangest of all is that clarks drummer boy should have married a vicomtesse of the old regime  and she was ever madame la vicomtesse to our good friends in st louis for she was a woman to whom a title came as by natures right  and you are about to behold another strange thing david monsieur gratiot continued today you are on french territory  french territory i exclaimed  today upper louisiana is french he answered tomorrow it will be american forever this morning captain stoddard of the united states army empowered to act as a commissioner of the french republic arrived with captain lewis and a guard of american troops today at noon the flag of spain was lowered from the staff at the headquarters tonight a guard of honor watches with the french tricolor and we are french for the last time tomorrow we shall be americans  i saw that simple ceremony the little company of soldiers was drawn up before the low stone headquarters the villagers with heads uncovered gathered round about i saw the stars and stripes rising the tricolor setting they met midway on the staff hung together for a space and a salute to the two nations echoed among the hills across the waters of the great river that rolled impassive by    afterword  this book has been named the crossing because i have tried to express in it the beginnings of that great movement across the mountains which swept resistless over the continent until at last it saw the pacific itself the crossing was the first instinctive reaching out of an infant nation which was one day to become a giant no annals in the worlds history are more wonderful than the story of the conquest of kentucky and tennessee by the pioneers  this name the crossing is likewise typical in another sense the political faith of our forefathers of which the constitution is the creed was made to fit a more or less homogeneous body of people who proved that they knew the meaning of the word liberty by liberty our forefathers meant the duty as well as the right of man to govern himself the constitution amply attests the greatness of its authors but it was a compromise it was an attempt to satisfy thirteen colonies each of which clung tenaciously to its identity it suited the eighteenthcentury conditions of a little englishspeaking confederacy along the seaboard far removed from the worlds strife and jealousy it scarcely contemplated that the harassed millions of europe would flock to its fold and it did not foresee that in less than a hundred years its own citizens would sweep across the three thousand miles of forest and plain and mountain to the western ocean absorb french and spanish louisiana spanish texas mexico and california fill this land with broad farmsteads and populous cities cover it with a network of railroads  would the constitution made to meet the needs of the little confederacy of the seaboard stretch over a continent and an empire  we are fighting out that question today but the crossing was in daniel boones time in george rogers clarks would the constitution stand the strain and will it stand the strain now that the once remote haven of the oppressed has become a worldpower  it was a difficult task in a novel to gather the elements necessary to picture this movement the territory was vast the types bewildering the lonely mountain cabin the seigniorial life of the tidewater the foothills and mountains which the scotchirish have marked for their own to this day the wilderness trail the wonderland of kentucky and the cruel fighting in the border forts there against the most relentless of foes george rogers clark and his momentous campaign which gave to the republic ohio indiana and illinois the transition periodthe coming of the settler after the pioneer louisiana st louis and new orleansto cover this ground to picture the passions and politics of the time to bring the counter influence of the french revolution as near as possible to reality has been a three years task the autobiography of david ritchie is as near as i can get to its solution and i have a great sense of its incompleteness  i had hoped when i planned the series to bring down this novel through the stirring period which ended by a chance when a steamboat brought supplies to jacksons army in new orleansthe beginning of the era of steam commerce on our western waters this work will have to be reserved for a future time  i have tried to give a true history of clarks campaign as seen by an eyewitness trammelled as little as possible by romance elsewhere as i look back through these pages i feel as though the soil had only been scraped what principality in the world has the story to rival that of john sevier and the state of franklin i have tried to tell the truth as i went along general jackson was a boy at the waxhaws and dug his toes in the red mud he was a man at jonesboro and tradition says that he fought with a fencerail sevier was captured as narrated monsieur gratiot monsieur vigo and father gibault lost the money which they gave to clark and their country monsieur vigo actually travelled in the state which davy describes when he went down the river with him monsieur gratiot and colonel auguste chouteau and madame chouteau are names so well known in st louis that it is superfluous to say that such persons existed and were the foremost citizens of the community  among the many to whom my apologies and thanks are due is mr pierre chouteau of st louis whose unremitting labors have preserved and perpetuated the history and traditions of the country of his ancestors i would that i had been better able to picture the character the courage the ability and patriotism of the french who settled louisiana the republic owes them much and their descendants are today among the stanchest preservers of her ideals   winston churchill
