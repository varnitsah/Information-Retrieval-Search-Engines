58531056	warlord of mars   by  edgar rice burroughs      contents    on the river iss   under the mountains   the temple of the sun   the secret tower   on the kaolian road   a hero in kaol   new allies   through the carrion caves   with the yellow men   in durance   the pity of plenty   follow the rope   the magnet switch   the tide of battle   rewards   the new ruler      on the river iss   in the shadows of the forest that flanks the crimson plain by the side of the lost sea of korus in the valley dor beneath the hurtling moons of mars speeding their meteoric way close above the bosom of the dying planet i crept stealthily along the trail of a shadowy form that hugged the darker places with a persistency that proclaimed the sinister nature of its errand  for six long martian months i had haunted the vicinity of the hateful temple of the sun within whose slowrevolving shaft far beneath the surface of mars my princess lay entombedbut whether alive or dead i knew not  had phaidors slim blade found that beloved heart  time only would reveal the truth  six hundred and eightyseven martian days must come and go before the cells door would again come opposite the tunnels end where last i had seen my everbeautiful dejah thoris  half of them had passed or would on the morrow yet vivid in my memory obliterating every event that had come before or after there remained the last scene before the gust of smoke blinded my eyes and the narrow slit that had given me sight of the interior of her cell closed between me and the princess of helium for a long martian year  as if it were yesterday i still saw the beautiful face of phaidor daughter of matai shang distorted with jealous rage and hatred as she sprang forward with raised dagger upon the woman i loved  i saw the red girl thuvia of ptarth leap forward to prevent the hideous deed  the smoke from the burning temple had come then to blot out the tragedy but in my ears rang the single shriek as the knife fell then silence and when the smoke had cleared the revolving temple had shut off all sight or sound from the chamber in which the three beautiful women were imprisoned  much there had been to occupy my attention since that terrible moment but never for an instant had the memory of the thing faded and all the time that i could spare from the numerous duties that had devolved upon me in the reconstruction of the government of the first born since our victorious fleet and land forces had overwhelmed them had been spent close to the grim shaft that held the mother of my boy carthoris of helium  the race of blacks that for ages had worshiped issus the false deity of mars had been left in a state of chaos by my revealment of her as naught more than a wicked old woman  in their rage they had torn her to pieces  from the high pinnacle of their egotism the first born had been plunged to the depths of humiliation  their deity was gone and with her the whole false fabric of their religion  their vaunted navy had fallen in defeat before the superior ships and fighting men of the red men of helium  fierce green warriors from the ocher sea bottoms of outer mars had ridden their wild thoats across the sacred gardens of the temple of issus and tars tarkas jeddak of thark fiercest of them all had sat upon the throne of issus and ruled the first born while the allies were deciding the conquered nations fate  almost unanimous was the request that i ascend the ancient throne of the black men even the first born themselves concurring in it but i would have none of it  my heart could never be with the race that had heaped indignities upon my princess and my son  at my suggestion xodar became jeddak of the first born  he had been a dator or prince until issus had degraded him so that his fitness for the high office bestowed was unquestioned  the peace of the valley dor thus assured the green warriors dispersed to their desolate sea bottoms while we of helium returned to our own country  here again was a throne offered me since no word had been received from the missing jeddak of helium tardos mors grandfather of dejah thoris or his son mors kajak jed of helium her father  over a year had elapsed since they had set out to explore the northern hemisphere in search of carthoris and at last their disheartened people had accepted as truth the vague rumors of their death that had filtered in from the frozen region of the pole  once again i refused a throne for i would not believe that the mighty tardos mors or his no less redoubtable son was dead  let one of their own blood rule you until they return i said to the assembled nobles of helium as i addressed them from the pedestal of truth beside the throne of righteousness in the temple of reward from the very spot where i had stood a year before when zat arras pronounced the sentence of death upon me  as i spoke i stepped forward and laid my hand upon the shoulder of carthoris where he stood in the front rank of the circle of nobles about me  as one the nobles and the people lifted their voices in a long cheer of approbation  ten thousand swords sprang on high from as many scabbards and the glorious fighting men of ancient helium hailed carthoris jeddak of helium  his tenure of office was to be for life or until his greatgrandfather or grandfather should return  having thus satisfactorily arranged this important duty for helium i started the following day for the valley dor that i might remain close to the temple of the sun until the fateful day that should see the opening of the prison cell where my lost love lay buried  hor vastus and kantos kan with my other noble lieutenants i left with carthoris at helium that he might have the benefit of their wisdom bravery and loyalty in the performance of the arduous duties which had devolved upon him  only woola my martian hound accompanied me  at my heels tonight the faithful beast moved softly in my tracks as large as a shetland pony with hideous head and frightful fangs he was indeed an awesome spectacle as he crept after me on his ten short muscular legs but to me he was the embodiment of love and loyalty  the figure ahead was that of the black dator of the first born thurid whose undying enmity i had earned that time i laid him low with my bare hands in the courtyard of the temple of issus and bound him with his own harness before the noble men and women who had but a moment before been extolling his prowess  like many of his fellows he had apparently accepted the new order of things with good grace and had sworn fealty to xodar his new ruler but i knew that he hated me and i was sure that in his heart he envied and hated xodar so i had kept a watch upon his comings and goings to the end that of late i had become convinced that he was occupied with some manner of intrigue  several times i had observed him leaving the walled city of the first born after dark taking his way out into the cruel and horrible valley dor where no honest business could lead any man  tonight he moved quickly along the edge of the forest until well beyond sight or sound of the city then he turned across the crimson sward toward the shore of the lost sea of korus  the rays of the nearer moon swinging low across the valley touched his jewelincrusted harness with a thousand changing lights and glanced from the glossy ebony of his smooth hide  twice he turned his head back toward the forest after the manner of one who is upon an evil errand though he must have felt quite safe from pursuit  i did not dare follow him there beneath the moonlight since it best suited my plans not to interrupt hisi wished him to reach his destination unsuspecting that i might learn just where that destination lay and the business that awaited the night prowler there  so it was that i remained hidden until after thurid had disappeared over the edge of the steep bank beside the sea a quarter of a mile away  then with woola following i hastened across the open after the black dator  the quiet of the tomb lay upon the mysterious valley of death crouching deep in its warm nest within the sunken area at the south pole of the dying planet  in the far distance the golden cliffs raised their mighty barrier faces far into the starlit heavens the precious metals and scintillating jewels that composed them sparkling in the brilliant light of marss two gorgeous moons  at my back was the forest pruned and trimmed like the sward to parklike symmetry by the browsing of the ghoulish plant men  before me lay the lost sea of korus while farther on i caught the shimmering ribbon of iss the river of mystery where it wound out from beneath the golden cliffs to empty into korus to which for countless ages had been borne the deluded and unhappy martians of the outer world upon the voluntary pilgrimage to this false heaven  the plant men with their bloodsucking hands and the monstrous white apes that make dor hideous by day were hidden in their lairs for the night  there was no longer a holy thern upon the balcony in the golden cliffs above the iss to summon them with weird cry to the victims floating down to their maws upon the cold broad bosom of ancient iss  the navies of helium and the first born had cleared the fortresses and the temples of the therns when they had refused to surrender and accept the new order of things that had swept their false religion from longsuffering mars  in a few isolated countries they still retained their ageold power but matai shang their hekkador father of therns had been driven from his temple  strenuous had been our endeavors to capture him but with a few of the faithful he had escaped and was in hidingwhere we knew not  as i came cautiously to the edge of the low cliff overlooking the lost sea of korus i saw thurid pushing out upon the bosom of the shimmering water in a small skiffone of those strangely wrought craft of unthinkable age which the holy therns with their organization of priests and lesser therns were wont to distribute along the banks of the iss that the long journey of their victims might be facilitated  drawn up on the beach below me were a score of similar boats each with its long pole at one end of which was a pike at the other a paddle  thurid was hugging the shore and as he passed out of sight round a nearby promontory i shoved one of the boats into the water and calling woola into it pushed out from shore  the pursuit of thurid carried me along the edge of the sea toward the mouth of the iss  the farther moon lay close to the horizon casting a dense shadow beneath the cliffs that fringed the water thuria the nearer moon had set nor would it rise again for near four hours so that i was ensured concealing darkness for that length of time at least  on and on went the black warrior  now he was opposite the mouth of the iss  without an instants hesitation he turned up the grim river paddling hard against the strong current  after him came woola and i closer now for the man was too intent upon forcing his craft up the river to have any eyes for what might be transpiring behind him  he hugged the shore where the current was less strong  presently he came to the dark cavernous portal in the face of the golden cliffs through which the river poured  on into the stygian darkness beyond he urged his craft  it seemed hopeless to attempt to follow him here where i could not see my hand before my face and i was almost on the point of giving up the pursuit and drifting back to the mouth of the river there to await his return when a sudden bend showed a faint luminosity ahead  my quarry was plainly visible again and in the increasing light from the phosphorescent rock that lay embedded in great patches in the roughly arched roof of the cavern i had no difficulty in following him  it was my first trip upon the bosom of iss and the things i saw there will live forever in my memory  terrible as they were they could not have commenced to approximate the horrible conditions which must have obtained before tars tarkas the great green warrior xodar the black dator and i brought the light of truth to the outer world and stopped the mad rush of millions upon the voluntary pilgrimage to what they believed would end in a beautiful valley of peace and happiness and love  even now the low islands which dotted the broad stream were choked with the skeletons and half devoured carcasses of those who through fear or a sudden awakening to the truth had halted almost at the completion of their journey  in the awful stench of these frightful charnel isles haggard maniacs screamed and gibbered and fought among the torn remnants of their grisly feasts while on those which contained but cleanpicked bones they battled with one another the weaker furnishing sustenance for the stronger or with clawlike hands clutched at the bloated bodies that drifted down with the current  thurid paid not the slightest attention to the screaming things that either menaced or pleaded with him as the mood directed themevidently he was familiar with the horrid sights that surrounded him  he continued up the river for perhaps a mile and then crossing over to the left bank drew his craft up on a low ledge that lay almost on a level with the water  i dared not follow across the stream for he most surely would have seen me  instead i stopped close to the opposite wall beneath an overhanging mass of rock that cast a dense shadow beneath it  here i could watch thurid without danger of discovery  the black was standing upon the ledge beside his boat looking up the river as though he were awaiting one whom he expected from that direction  as i lay there beneath the dark rocks i noticed that a strong current seemed to flow directly toward the center of the river so that it was difficult to hold my craft in its position  i edged farther into the shadow that i might find a hold upon the bank but though i proceeded several yards i touched nothing and then finding that i would soon reach a point from where i could no longer see the black man i was compelled to remain where i was holding my position as best i could by paddling strongly against the current which flowed from beneath the rocky mass behind me  i could not imagine what might cause this strong lateral flow for the main channel of the river was plainly visible to me from where i sat and i could see the rippling junction of it and the mysterious current which had aroused my curiosity  while i was still speculating upon the phenomenon my attention was suddenly riveted upon thurid who had raised both palms forward above his head in the universal salute of martians and a moment later his kaor the barsoomian word of greeting came in low but distinct tones  i turned my eyes up the river in the direction that his were bent and presently there came within my limited range of vision a long boat in which were six men  five were at the paddles while the sixth sat in the seat of honor  the white skins the flowing yellow wigs which covered their bald pates and the gorgeous diadems set in circlets of gold about their heads marked them as holy therns  as they drew up beside the ledge upon which thurid awaited them he in the bow of the boat arose to step ashore and then i saw that it was none other than matai shang father of therns  the evident cordiality with which the two men exchanged greetings filled me with wonder for the black and white men of barsoom were hereditary enemiesnor ever before had i known of two meeting other than in battle  evidently the reverses that had recently overtaken both peoples had resulted in an alliance between these two individualsat least against the common enemyand now i saw why thurid had come so often out into the valley dor by night and that the nature of his conspiring might be such as to strike very close to me or to my friends  i wished that i might have found a point closer to the two men from which to have heard their conversation but it was out of the question now to attempt to cross the river and so i lay quietly watching them who would have given so much to have known how close i lay to them and how easily they might have overcome and killed me with their superior force  several times thurid pointed across the river in my direction but that his gestures had any reference to me i did not for a moment believe  presently he and matai shang entered the latters boat which turned out into the river and swinging round forged steadily across in my direction  as they advanced i moved my boat farther and farther in beneath the overhanging wall but at last it became evident that their craft was holding the same course  the five paddlers sent the larger boat ahead at a speed that taxed my energies to equal  every instant i expected to feel my prow crash against solid rock the light from the river was no longer visible but ahead i saw the faint tinge of a distant radiance and still the water before me was open  at last the truth dawned upon mei was following a subterranean river which emptied into the iss at the very point where i had hidden  the rowers were now quite close to me  the noise of their own paddles drowned the sound of mine but in another instant the growing light ahead would reveal me to them  there was no time to be lost  whatever action i was to take must be taken at once  swinging the prow of my boat toward the right i sought the rivers rocky side and there i lay while matai shang and thurid approached up the center of the stream which was much narrower than the iss  as they came nearer i heard the voices of thurid and the father of therns raised in argument  i tell you thern the black dator was saying that i wish only vengeance upon john carter prince of helium  i am leading you into no trap  what could i gain by betraying you to those who have ruined my nation and my house  let us stop here a moment that i may hear your plans replied the hekkador and then we may proceed with a better understanding of our duties and obligations  to the rowers he issued the command that brought their boat in toward the bank not a dozen paces beyond the spot where i lay  had they pulled in below me they must surely have seen me against the faint glow of light ahead but from where they finally came to rest i was as secure from detection as though miles separated us  the few words i had already overheard whetted my curiosity and i was anxious to learn what manner of vengeance thurid was planning against me  nor had i long to wait  i listened intently  there are no obligations father of therns continued the first born  thurid dator of issus has no price  when the thing has been accomplished i shall be glad if you will see to it that i am well received as is befitting my ancient lineage and noble rank at some court that is yet loyal to thy ancient faith for i cannot return to the valley dor or elsewhere within the power of the prince of helium but even that i do not demandit shall be as your own desire in the matter directs  it shall be as you wish dator replied matai shang nor is that allpower and riches shall be yours if you restore my daughter phaidor to me and place within my power dejah thoris princess of helium  ah he continued with a malicious snarl but the earth man shall suffer for the indignities he has put upon the holy of holies nor shall any vileness be too vile to inflict upon his princess  would that it were in my power to force him to witness the humiliation and degradation of the red woman  you shall have your way with her before another day has passed matai shang said thurid if you but say the word  i have heard of the temple of the sun dator replied matai shang but never have i heard that its prisoners could be released before the allotted year of their incarceration had elapsed  how then may you accomplish the impossible  access may be had to any cell of the temple at any time replied thurid  only issus knew this nor was it ever issus way to divulge more of her secrets than were necessary  by chance after her death i came upon an ancient plan of the temple and there i found plainly writ the most minute directions for reaching the cells at any time  and more i learnedthat many men had gone thither for issus in the past always on errands of death and torture to the prisoners but those who thus learned the secret way were wont to die mysteriously immediately they had returned and made their reports to cruel issus  let us proceed then said matai shang at last  i must trust you yet at the same time you must trust me for we are six to your one  i do not fear replied thurid nor need you  our hatred of the common enemy is sufficient bond to insure our loyalty to each other and after we have defiled the princess of helium there will be still greater reason for the maintenance of our allegianceunless i greatly mistake the temper of her lord  matai shang spoke to the paddlers  the boat moved on up the tributary  it was with difficulty that i restrained myself from rushing upon them and slaying the two vile plotters but quickly i saw the mad rashness of such an act which would cut down the only man who could lead the way to dejah thoris prison before the long martian year had swung its interminable circle  if he should lead matai shang to that hallowed spot then too should he lead john carter prince of helium  with silent paddle i swung slowly into the wake of the larger craft     under the mountains   as we advanced up the river which winds beneath the golden cliffs out of the bowels of the mountains of otz to mingle its dark waters with the grim and mysterious iss the faint glow which had appeared before us grew gradually into an allenveloping radiance  the river widened until it presented the aspect of a large lake whose vaulted dome lighted by glowing phosphorescent rock was splashed with the vivid rays of the diamond the sapphire the ruby and the countless nameless jewels of barsoom which lay incrusted in the virgin gold which forms the major portion of these magnificent cliffs  beyond the lighted chamber of the lake was darknesswhat lay behind the darkness i could not even guess  to have followed the thern boat across the gleaming water would have been to invite instant detection and so though i was loath to permit thurid to pass even for an instant beyond my sight i was forced to wait in the shadows until the other boat had passed from my sight at the far extremity of the lake  then i paddled out upon the brilliant surface in the direction they had taken  when after what seemed an eternity i reached the shadows at the upper end of the lake i found that the river issued from a low aperture to pass beneath which it was necessary that i compel woola to lie flat in the boat and i myself must need bend double before the low roof cleared my head  immediately the roof rose again upon the other side but no longer was the way brilliantly lighted  instead only a feeble glow emanated from small and scattered patches of phosphorescent rock in wall and roof  directly before me the river ran into this smaller chamber through three separate arched openings  thurid and the therns were nowhere to be seeninto which of the dark holes had they disappeared  there was no means by which i might know and so i chose the center opening as being as likely to lead me in the right direction as another  here the way was through utter darkness  the stream was narrowso narrow that in the blackness i was constantly bumping first one rock wall and then another as the river wound hither and thither along its flinty bed  far ahead i presently heard a deep and sullen roar which increased in volume as i advanced and then broke upon my ears with all the intensity of its mad fury as i swung round a sharp curve into a dimly lighted stretch of water  directly before me the river thundered down from above in a mighty waterfall that filled the narrow gorge from side to side rising far above me several hundred feetas magnificent a spectacle as i ever had seen  but the roarthe awful deafening roar of those tumbling waters penned in the rocky subterranean vault  had the fall not entirely blocked my further passage and shown me that i had followed the wrong course i believe that i should have fled anyway before the maddening tumult  thurid and the therns could not have come this way  by stumbling upon the wrong course i had lost the trail and they had gained so much ahead of me that now i might not be able to find them before it was too late if in fact i could find them at all  it had taken several hours to force my way up to the falls against the strong current and other hours would be required for the descent although the pace would be much swifter  with a sigh i turned the prow of my craft down stream and with mighty strokes hastened with reckless speed through the dark and tortuous channel until once again i came to the chamber into which flowed the three branches of the river  two unexplored channels still remained from which to choose nor was there any means by which i could judge which was the more likely to lead me to the plotters  never in my life that i can recall have i suffered such an agony of indecision  so much depended upon a correct choice so much depended upon haste  the hours that i had already lost might seal the fate of the incomparable dejah thoris were she not already deadto sacrifice other hours and maybe days in a fruitless exploration of another blind lead would unquestionably prove fatal  several times i essayed the righthand entrance only to turn back as though warned by some strange intuitive sense that this was not the way  at last convinced by the oftrecurring phenomenon i cast my all upon the lefthand archway yet it was with a lingering doubt that i turned a parting look at the sullen waters which rolled dark and forbidding from beneath the grim low archway on the right  and as i looked there came bobbing out upon the current from the stygian darkness of the interior the shell of one of the great succulent fruits of the sorapus tree  i could scarce restrain a shout of elation as this silent insensate messenger floated past me on toward the iss and korus for it told me that journeying martians were above me on that very stream  they had eaten of this marvelous fruit which nature concentrates within the hard shell of the sorapus nut and having eaten had cast the husk overboard  it could have come from no others than the party i sought  quickly i abandoned all thought of the lefthand passage and a moment later had turned into the right  the stream soon widened and recurring areas of phosphorescent rock lighted my way  i made good time but was convinced that i was nearly a day behind those i was tracking  neither woola nor i had eaten since the previous day but in so far as he was concerned it mattered but little since practically all the animals of the dead sea bottoms of mars are able to go for incredible periods without nourishment  nor did i suffer  the water of the river was sweet and cold for it was unpolluted by decaying bodieslike the issand as for food why the mere thought that i was nearing my beloved princess raised me above every material want  as i proceeded the river became narrower and the current swift and turbulentso swift in fact that it was with difficulty that i forced my craft upward at all  i could not have been making to exceed a hundred yards an hour when at a bend i was confronted by a series of rapids through which the river foamed and boiled at a terrific rate  my heart sank within me  the sorapus nutshell had proved a false prophet and after all my intuition had been correctit was the lefthand channel that i should have followed  had i been a woman i should have wept  at my right was a great slowmoving eddy that circled far beneath the cliffs overhanging side and to rest my tired muscles before turning back i let my boat drift into its embrace  i was almost prostrated by disappointment  it would mean another halfdays loss of time to retrace my way and take the only passage that yet remained unexplored  what hellish fate had led me to select from three possible avenues the two that were wrong  as the lazy current of the eddy carried me slowly about the periphery of the watery circle my boat twice touched the rocky side of the river in the dark recess beneath the cliff  a third time it struck gently as it had before but the contact resulted in a different soundthe sound of wood scraping upon wood  in an instant i was on the alert for there could be no wood within that buried river that had not been man brought  almost coincidentally with my first apprehension of the noise my hand shot out across the boats side and a second later i felt my fingers gripping the gunwale of another craft  as though turned to stone i sat in tense and rigid silence straining my eyes into the utter darkness before me in an effort to discover if the boat were occupied  it was entirely possible that there might be men on board it who were still ignorant of my presence for the boat was scraping gently against the rocks upon one side so that the gentle touch of my boat upon the other easily could have gone unnoticed  peer as i would i could not penetrate the darkness and then i listened intently for the sound of breathing near me but except for the noise of the rapids the soft scraping of the boats and the lapping of the water at their sides i could distinguish no sound as usual i thought rapidly  a rope lay coiled in the bottom of my own craft  very softly i gathered it up and making one end fast to the bronze ring in the prow i stepped gingerly into the boat beside me  in one hand i grasped the rope in the other my keen longsword  for a full minute perhaps i stood motionless after entering the strange craft  it had rocked a trifle beneath my weight but it had been the scraping of its side against the side of my own boat that had seemed most likely to alarm its occupants if there were any  but there was no answering sound and a moment later i had felt from stem to stern and found the boat deserted  groping with my hands along the face of the rocks to which the craft was moored i discovered a narrow ledge which i knew must be the avenue taken by those who had come before me  that they could be none other than thurid and his party i was convinced by the size and build of the boat i had found  calling to woola to follow me i stepped out upon the ledge  the great savage brute agile as a cat crept after me  as he passed through the boat that had been occupied by thurid and the therns he emitted a single low growl and when he came beside me upon the ledge and my hand rested upon his neck i felt his short mane bristling with anger  i think he sensed telepathically the recent presence of an enemy for i had made no effort to impart to him the nature of our quest or the status of those we tracked  this omission i now made haste to correct and after the manner of green martians with their beasts i let him know partially by the weird and uncanny telepathy of barsoom and partly by word of mouth that we were upon the trail of those who had recently occupied the boat through which we had just passed  a soft purr like that of a great cat indicated that woola understood and then with a word to him to follow i turned to the right along the ledge but scarcely had i done so than i felt his mighty fangs tugging at my leathern harness  as i turned to discover the cause of his act he continued to pull me steadily in the opposite direction nor would he desist until i had turned about and indicated that i would follow him voluntarily  never had i known him to be in error in a matter of tracking so it was with a feeling of entire security that i moved cautiously in the huge beasts wake  through cimmerian darkness he moved along the narrow ledge beside the boiling rapids  as we advanced the way led from beneath the overhanging cliffs out into a dim light and then it was that i saw that the trail had been cut from the living rock and that it ran up along the rivers side beyond the rapids  for hours we followed the dark and gloomy river farther and farther into the bowels of mars  from the direction and distance i knew that we must be well beneath the valley dor and possibly beneath the sea of omean as wellit could not be much farther now to the temple of the sun  even as my mind framed the thought woola halted suddenly before a narrow arched doorway in the cliff by the trails side  quickly he crouched back away from the entrance at the same time turning his eyes toward me  words could not have more plainly told me that danger of some sort lay near by and so i pressed quietly forward to his side and passing him looked into the aperture at our right  before me was a fairsized chamber that from its appointments i knew must have at one time been a guardroom  there were racks for weapons and slightly raised platforms for the sleeping silks and furs of the warriors but now its only occupants were two of the therns who had been of the party with thurid and matai shang  the men were in earnest conversation and from their tones it was apparent that they were entirely unaware that they had listeners  i tell you one of them was saying i do not trust the black one  there was no necessity for leaving us here to guard the way against what pray should we guard this longforgotten abysmal path  it was but a ruse to divide our numbers  he will have matai shang leave others elsewhere on some pretext or other and then at last he will fall upon us with his confederates and slay us all  i believe you lakor replied the other there can never be aught else than deadly hatred between thern and first born  and what think you of the ridiculous matter of the light  let the light shine with the intensity of three radium units for fifty tals and for one xat let it shine with the intensity of one radium unit and then for twentyfive tals with nine units  those were his very words and to think that wise old matai shang should listen to such foolishness  indeed it is silly replied lakor  it will open nothing other than the way to a quick death for us all  he had to make some answer when matai shang asked him flatly what he should do when he came to the temple of the sun and so he made his answer quickly from his imaginationi would wager a hekkadors diadem that he could not now repeat it himself  let us not remain here longer lakor spoke the other thern perchance if we hasten after them we may come in time to rescue matai shang and wreak our own vengeance upon the black dator what say you  never in a long life answered lakor have i disobeyed a single command of the father of therns  i shall stay here until i rot if he does not return to bid me elsewhere  lakors companion shook his head  you are my superior he said i cannot do other than you sanction though i still believe that we are foolish to remain  i too thought that they were foolish to remain for i saw from woolas actions that the trail led through the room where the two therns held guard  i had no reason to harbor any considerable love for this race of selfdeified demons yet i would have passed them by were it possible without molesting them  it was worth trying anyway for a fight might delay us considerably or even put an end entirely to my searchbetter men than i have gone down before fighters of meaner ability than that possessed by the fierce thern warriors  signaling woola to heel i stepped suddenly into the room before the two men  at sight of me their longswords flashed from the harness at their sides but i raised my hand in a gesture of restraint  i seek thurid the black dator i said  my quarrel is with him not with you  let me pass then in peace for if i mistake not he is as much your enemy as mine and you can have no cause to protect him  they lowered their swords and lakor spoke  i know not whom you may be with the white skin of a thern and the black hair of a red man but were it only thurid whose safety were at stake you might pass and welcome in so far as we be concerned  tell us who you be and what mission calls you to this unknown world beneath the valley dor then maybe we can see our way to let you pass upon the errand which we should like to undertake would our orders permit  i was surprised that neither of them had recognized me for i thought that i was quite sufficiently well known either by personal experience or reputation to every thern upon barsoom as to make my identity immediately apparent in any part of the planet  in fact i was the only white man upon mars whose hair was black and whose eyes were gray with the exception of my son carthoris  to reveal my identity might be to precipitate an attack for every thern upon barsoom knew that to me they owed the fall of their ageold spiritual supremacy  on the other hand my reputation as a fighting man might be sufficient to pass me by these two were their livers not of the right complexion to welcome a battle to the death  to be quite candid i did not attempt to delude myself with any such sophistry since i knew well that upon warlike mars there are few cowards and that every man whether prince priest or peasant glories in deadly strife  and so i gripped my longsword the tighter as i replied to lakor  i believe that you will see the wisdom of permitting me to pass unmolested i said for it would avail you nothing to die uselessly in the rocky bowels of barsoom merely to protect a hereditary enemy such as thurid dator of the first born  that you shall die should you elect to oppose me is evidenced by the moldering corpses of all the many great barsoomian warriors who have gone down beneath this bladei am john carter prince of helium  for a moment that name seemed to paralyze the two men but only for a moment and then the younger of them with a vile name upon his lips rushed toward me with ready sword  he had been standing a little behind his companion lakor during our parley and now ere he could engage me the older man grasped his harness and drew him back  hold commanded lakor  there will be plenty of time to fight if we find it wise to fight at all  there be good reasons why every thern upon barsoom should yearn to spill the blood of the blasphemer the sacrilegist but let us mix wisdom with our righteous hate the prince of helium is bound upon an errand which we ourselves but a moment since were wishing that we might undertake  let him go then and slay the black  when he returns we shall still be here to bar his way to the outer world and thus we shall have rid ourselves of two enemies nor have incurred the displeasure of the father of therns  as he spoke i could not but note the crafty glint in his evil eyes and while i saw the apparent logic of his reasoning i felt subconsciously perhaps that his words did but veil some sinister intent  the other thern turned toward him in evident surprise but when lakor had whispered a few brief words into his ear he too drew back and nodded acquiescence to his superiors suggestion  proceed john carter said lakor but know that if thurid does not lay you low there will be those awaiting your return who will see that you never pass again into the sunlight of the upper world go  during our conversation woola had been growling and bristling close to my side  occasionally he would look up into my face with a low pleading whine as though begging for the word that would send him headlong at the bare throats before him  he too sensed the villainy behind the smooth words  beyond the therns several doorways opened off the guardroom and toward the one upon the extreme right lakor motioned  that way leads to thurid he said  but when i would have called woola to follow me there the beast whined and held back and at last ran quickly to the first opening at the left where he stood emitting his coughing bark as though urging me to follow him upon the right way  i turned a questioning look upon lakor  the brute is seldom wrong i said and while i do not doubt your superior knowledge thern i think that i shall do well to listen to the voice of instinct that is backed by love and loyalty  as i spoke i smiled grimly that he might know without words that i distrusted him  as you will the fellow replied with a shrug  in the end it shall be all the same  i turned and followed woola into the lefthand passage and though my back was toward my enemies my ears were on the alert yet i heard no sound of pursuit  the passageway was dimly lighted by occasional radium bulbs the universal lighting medium of barsoom  these same lamps may have been doing continuous duty in these subterranean chambers for ages since they require no attention and are so compounded that they give off but the minutest of their substance in the generation of years of luminosity  we had proceeded for but a short distance when we commenced to pass the mouths of diverging corridors but not once did woola hesitate it was at the opening to one of these corridors upon my right that i presently heard a sound that spoke more plainly to john carter fighting man than could the words of my mother tongueit was the clank of metalthe metal of a warriors harnessand it came from a little distance up the corridor upon my right  woola heard it too and like a flash he had wheeled and stood facing the threatened danger his mane all abristle and all his rows of glistening fangs bared by snarling backdrawn lips  with a gesture i silenced him and together we drew aside into another corridor a few paces farther on  here we waited nor did we have long to wait for presently we saw the shadows of two men fall upon the floor of the main corridor athwart the doorway of our hiding place  very cautiously they were moving nowthe accidental clank that had alarmed me was not repeated  presently they came opposite our station nor was i surprised to see that the two were lakor and his companion of the guardroom  they walked very softly and in the right hand of each gleamed a keen longsword  they halted quite close to the entrance of our retreat whispering to each other  can it be that we have distanced them already said lakor  either that or the beast has led the man upon a wrong trail replied the other for the way which we took is by far the shorter to this pointfor him who knows it  john carter would have found it a short road to death had he taken it as you suggested to him  yes said lakor no amount of fighting ability would have saved him from the pivoted flagstone  he surely would have stepped upon it and by now if the pit beneath it has a bottom which thurid denies he should have been rapidly approaching it  curses on that calot of his that warned him toward the safer avenue  there be other dangers ahead of him though spoke lakors fellow which he may not so easily escapeshould he succeed in escaping our two good swords  consider for example what chance he will have coming unexpectedly into the chamber of  i would have given much to have heard the balance of that conversation that i might have been warned of the perils that lay ahead but fate intervened and just at the very instant of all other instants that i would not have elected to do it i sneezed     the temple of the sun   there was nothing for it now other than to fight nor did i have any advantage as i sprang sword in hand into the corridor before the two therns for my untimely sneeze had warned them of my presence and they were ready for me  there were no words for they would have been a waste of breath the very presence of the two proclaimed their treachery  that they were following to fall upon me unawares was all too plain and they of course must have known that i understood their plan  in an instant i was engaged with both and though i loathe the very name of thern i must in all fairness admit that they are mighty swordsmen and these two were no exception unless it were that they were even more skilled and fearless than the average among their race  while it lasted it was indeed as joyous a conflict as i ever had experienced  twice at least i saved my breast from the mortal thrust of piercing steel only by the wondrous agility with which my earthly muscles endow me under the conditions of lesser gravity and air pressure upon mars  yet even so i came near to tasting death that day in the gloomy corridor beneath marss southern pole for lakor played a trick upon me that in all my experience of fighting upon two planets i never before had witnessed the like of  the other thern was engaging me at the time and i was forcing him backtouching him here and there with my point until he was bleeding from a dozen wounds yet not being able to penetrate his marvelous guard to reach a vulnerable spot for the brief instant that would have been sufficient to send him to his ancestors  it was then that lakor quickly unslung a belt from his harness and as i stepped back to parry a wicked thrust he lashed one end of it about my left ankle so that it wound there for an instant while he jerked suddenly upon the other end throwing me heavily upon my back  then like leaping panthers they were upon me but they had reckoned without woola and before ever a blade touched me a roaring embodiment of a thousand demons hurtled above my prostrate form and my loyal martian calot was upon them  imagine if you can a huge grizzly with ten legs armed with mighty talons and an enormous froglike mouth splitting his head from ear to ear exposing three rows of long white tusks  then endow this creature of your imagination with the agility and ferocity of a halfstarved bengal tiger and the strength of a span of bulls and you will have some faint conception of woola in action  before i could call him off he had crushed lakor into a jelly with a single blow of one mighty paw and had literally torn the other thern to ribbons yet when i spoke to him sharply he cowed sheepishly as though he had done a thing to deserve censure and chastisement  never had i had the heart to punish woola during the long years that had passed since that first day upon mars when the green jed of the tharks had placed him on guard over me and i had won his love and loyalty from the cruel and loveless masters of his former life yet i believe he would have submitted to any cruelty that i might have inflicted upon him so wondrous was his affection for me  the diadem in the center of the circlet of gold upon the brow of lakor proclaimed him a holy thern while his companion not thus adorned was a lesser thern though from his harness i gleaned that he had reached the ninth cycle which is but one below that of the holy therns  as i stood for a moment looking at the gruesome havoc woola had wrought there recurred to me the memory of that other occasion upon which i had masqueraded in the wig diadem and harness of sator throg the holy thern whom thuvia of ptarth had slain and now it occurred to me that it might prove of worth to utilize lakors trappings for the same purpose  a moment later i had torn his yellow wig from his bald pate and transferred it and the circlet as well as all his harness to my own person  woola did not approve of the metamorphosis  he sniffed at me and growled ominously but when i spoke to him and patted his huge head he at length became reconciled to the change and at my command trotted off along the corridor in the direction we had been going when our progress had been interrupted by the therns  we moved cautiously now warned by the fragment of conversation i had overheard  i kept abreast of woola that we might have the benefit of all our eyes for what might appear suddenly ahead to menace us and well it was that we were forewarned  at the bottom of a flight of narrow steps the corridor turned sharply back upon itself immediately making another turn in the original direction so that at that point it formed a perfect letter s the top leg of which debouched suddenly into a large chamber illy lighted and the floor of which was completely covered by venomous snakes and loathsome reptiles  to have attempted to cross that floor would have been to court instant death and for a moment i was almost completely discouraged then it occurred to me that thurid and matai shang with their party must have crossed it and so there was a way  had it not been for the fortunate accident by which i overheard even so small a portion of the therns conversation we should have blundered at least a step or two into that wriggling mass of destruction and a single step would have been allsufficient to have sealed our doom  these were the only reptiles i had ever seen upon barsoom but i knew from their similarity to the fossilized remains of supposedly extinct species i had seen in the museums of helium that they comprised many of the known prehistoric reptilian genera as well as others undiscovered  a more hideous aggregation of monsters had never before assailed my vision  it would be futile to attempt to describe them to earth men since substance is the only thing which they possess in common with any creature of the past or present with which you are familiareven their venom is of an unearthly virulence that by comparison would make the cobra de capello seem quite as harmless as an angleworm  as they spied me there was a concerted rush by those nearest the entrance where we stood but a line of radium bulbs inset along the threshold of their chamber brought them to a sudden haltevidently they dared not cross that line of light  i had been quite sure that they would not venture beyond the room in which i had discovered them though i had not guessed at what deterred them  the simple fact that we had found no reptiles in the corridor through which we had just come was sufficient assurance that they did not venture there  i drew woola out of harms way and then began a careful survey of as much of the chamber of reptiles as i could see from where i stood  as my eyes became accustomed to the dim light of its interior i gradually made out a low gallery at the far end of the apartment from which opened several exits  coming as close to the threshold as i dared i followed this gallery with my eyes discovering that it circled the room as far as i could see  then i glanced above me along the upper edge of the entrance to which we had come and there to my delight i saw an end of the gallery not a foot above my head  in an instant i had leaped to it and called woola after me  here there were no reptilesthe way was clear to the opposite side of the hideous chamberand a moment later woola and i dropped down to safety in the corridor beyond  not ten minutes later we came into a vast circular apartment of white marble the walls of which were inlaid with gold in the strange hieroglyphics of the first born  from the high dome of this mighty apartment a huge circular column extended to the floor and as i watched i saw that it slowly revolved  i had reached the base of the temple of the sun  somewhere above me lay dejah thoris and with her were phaidor daughter of matai shang and thuvia of ptarth  but how to reach them now that i had found the only vulnerable spot in their mighty prison was still a baffling riddle  slowly i circled the great shaft looking for a means of ingress part way around i found a tiny radium flash torch and as i examined it in mild curiosity as to its presence there in this almost inaccessible and unknown spot i came suddenly upon the insignia of the house of thurid jewelinset in its metal case  i am upon the right trail i thought as i slipped the bauble into the pocketpouch which hung from my harness  then i continued my search for the entrance which i knew must be somewhere about nor had i long to search for almost immediately thereafter i came upon a small door so cunningly inlaid in the shafts base that it might have passed unnoticed by a less keen or careful observer  there was the door that would lead me within the prison but where was the means to open it  no button or lock were visible  again and again i went carefully over every square inch of its surface but the most that i could find was a tiny pinhole a little above and to the right of the doors centera pinhole that seemed only an accident of manufacture or an imperfection of material  into this minute aperture i attempted to peer but whether it was but a fraction of an inch deep or passed completely through the door i could not tellat least no light showed beyond it  i put my ear to it next and listened but again my efforts brought negligible results  during these experiments woola had been standing at my side gazing intently at the door and as my glance fell upon him it occurred to me to test the correctness of my hypothesis that this portal had been the means of ingress to the temple used by thurid the black dator and matai shang father of therns  turning away abruptly i called to him to follow me  for a moment he hesitated and then leaped after me whining and tugging at my harness to draw me back  i walked on however some distance from the door before i let him have his way that i might see precisely what he would do  then i permitted him to lead me wherever he would  straight back to that baffling portal he dragged me again taking up his position facing the blank stone gazing straight at its shining surface  for an hour i worked to solve the mystery of the combination that would open the way before me  carefully i recalled every circumstance of my pursuit of thurid and my conclusion was identical with my original beliefthat thurid had come this way without other assistance than his own knowledge and passed through the door that barred my progress unaided from within  but how had he accomplished it  i recalled the incident of the chamber of mystery in the golden cliffs that time i had freed thuvia of ptarth from the dungeon of the therns and she had taken a slender needlelike key from the keyring of her dead jailer to open the door leading back into the chamber of mystery where tars tarkas fought for his life with the great banths  such a tiny keyhole as now defied me had opened the way to the intricate lock in that other door  hastily i dumped the contents of my pocketpouch upon the ground before me  could i but find a slender bit of steel i might yet fashion a key that would give me ingress to the temple prison  as i examined the heterogeneous collection of odds and ends that is always to be found in the pocketpouch of a martian warrior my hand fell upon the emblazoned radium flash torch of the black dator  as i was about to lay the thing aside as of no value in my present predicament my eyes chanced upon a few strange characters roughly and freshly scratched upon the soft gold of the case  casual curiosity prompted me to decipher them but what i read carried no immediate meaning to my mind  there were three sets of characters one below another                           3  50 t                          1   1 x                          9  25 t   for only an instant my curiosity was piqued and then i replaced the torch in my pocketpouch but my fingers had not unclasped from it when there rushed to my memory the recollection of the conversation between lakor and his companion when the lesser thern had quoted the words of thurid and scoffed at them  and what think you of the ridiculous matter of the light  let the light shine with the intensity of three radium units for fifty talsah there was the first line of characters upon the torchs metal case350 t and for one xat let it shine with the intensity of one radium unitthere was the second line and then for twentyfive tals with nine units  the formula was complete butwhat did it mean  i thought i knew and seizing a powerful magnifying glass from the litter of my pocketpouch i applied myself to a careful examination of the marble immediately about the pinhole in the door  i could have cried aloud in exultation when my scrutiny disclosed the almost invisible incrustation of particles of carbonized electrons which are thrown off by these martian torches  it was evident that for countless ages radium torches had been applied to this pinhole and for what purpose there could be but a single answerthe mechanism of the lock was actuated by light rays and i john carter prince of helium held the combination in my handscratched by the hand of my enemy upon his own torch case  in a cylindrical bracelet of gold about my wrist was my barsoomian chronometera delicate instrument that records the tals and xats and zodes of martian time presenting them to view beneath a strong crystal much after the manner of an earthly odometer  timing my operations carefully i held the torch to the small aperture in the door regulating the intensity of the light by means of the thumblever upon the side of the case  for fifty tals i let three units of light shine full in the pinhole then one unit for one xat and for twentyfive tals nine units those last twentyfive tals were the longest twentyfive seconds of my life  would the lock click at the end of those seemingly interminable intervals of time  twentythree  twentyfour  twentyfive  i shut off the light with a snap  for seven tals i waitedthere had been no appreciable effect upon the locks mechanism  could it be that my theory was entirely wrong  hold  had the nervous strain resulted in a hallucination or did the door really move  slowly the solid stone sank noiselessly back into the wallthere was no hallucination here  back and back it slid for ten feet until it had disclosed at its right a narrow doorway leading into a dark and narrow corridor that paralleled the outer wall  scarcely was the entrance uncovered than woola and i had leaped throughthen the door slipped quietly back into place  down the corridor at some distance i saw the faint reflection of a light and toward this we made our way  at the point where the light shone was a sharp turn and a little distance beyond this a brilliantly lighted chamber  here we discovered a spiral stairway leading up from the center of the circular room  immediately i knew that we had reached the center of the base of the temple of the sunthe spiral runway led upward past the inner walls of the prison cells  somewhere above me was dejah thoris unless thurid and matai shang had already succeeded in stealing her  we had scarcely started up the runway when woola suddenly displayed the wildest excitement  he leaped back and forth snapping at my legs and harness until i thought that he was mad and finally when i pushed him from me and started once more to ascend he grasped my sword arm between his jaws and dragged me back  no amount of scolding or cuffing would suffice to make him release me and i was entirely at the mercy of his brute strength unless i cared to use my dagger upon him with my left hand but mad or no i had not the heart to run the sharp blade into that faithful body  down into the chamber he dragged me and across it to the side opposite that at which we had entered  here was another doorway leading into a corridor which ran directly down a steep incline without a moments hesitation woola jerked me along this rocky passage  presently he stopped and released me standing between me and the way we had come looking up into my face as though to ask if i would now follow him voluntarily or if he must still resort to force  looking ruefully at the marks of his great teeth upon my bare arm i decided to do as he seemed to wish me to do  after all his strange instinct might be more dependable than my faulty human judgment  and well it was that i had been forced to follow him  but a short distance from the circular chamber we came suddenly into a brilliantly lighted labyrinth of crystal glass partitioned passages  at first i thought it was one vast unbroken chamber so clear and transparent were the walls of the winding corridors but after i had nearly brained myself a couple of times by attempting to pass through solid vitreous walls i went more carefully  we had proceeded but a few yards along the corridor that had given us entrance to this strange maze when woola gave mouth to a most frightful roar at the same time dashing against the clear partition at our left  the resounding echoes of that fearsome cry were still reverberating through the subterranean chambers when i saw the thing that had startled it from the faithful beast  far in the distance dimly through the many thicknesses of intervening crystal as in a haze that made them seem unreal and ghostly i discerned the figures of eight peoplethree females and five men  at the same instant evidently startled by woolas fierce cry they halted and looked about  then of a sudden one of them a woman held her arms out toward me and even at that great distance i could see that her lips movedit was dejah thoris my ever beautiful and ever youthful princess of helium  with her were thuvia of ptarth phaidor daughter of matai shang and thurid and the father of therns and the three lesser therns that had accompanied them  thurid shook his fist at me and then two of the therns grasped dejah thoris and thuvia roughly by their arms and hurried them on a moment later they had disappeared into a stone corridor beyond the labyrinth of glass  they say that love is blind but so great a love as that of dejah thoris that knew me even beneath the thern disguise i wore and across the misty vista of that crystal maze must indeed be far from blind     the secret tower   i have no stomach to narrate the monotonous events of the tedious days that woola and i spent ferreting our way across the labyrinth of glass through the dark and devious ways beyond that led beneath the valley dor and golden cliffs to emerge at last upon the flank of the otz mountains just above the valley of lost soulsthat pitiful purgatory peopled by the poor unfortunates who dare not continue their abandoned pilgrimage to dor or return to the various lands of the outer world from whence they came  here the trail of dejah thoris abductors led along the mountains base across steep and rugged ravines by the side of appalling precipices and sometimes out into the valley where we found fighting aplenty with the members of the various tribes that make up the population of this vale of hopelessness  but through it all we came at last to where the way led up a narrow gorge that grew steeper and more impracticable at every step until before us loomed a mighty fortress buried beneath the side of an overhanging cliff  here was the secret hiding place of matai shang father of therns here surrounded by a handful of the faithful the hekkador of the ancient faith who had once been served by millions of vassals and dependents dispensed the spiritual words among the half dozen nations of barsoom that still clung tenaciously to their false and discredited religion  darkness was just falling as we came in sight of the seemingly impregnable walls of this mountain stronghold and lest we be seen i drew back with woola behind a jutting granite promontory into a clump of the hardy purple scrub that thrives upon the barren sides of otz  here we lay until the quick transition from daylight to darkness had passed  then i crept out to approach the fortress walls in search of a way within  either through carelessness or overconfidence in the supposed inaccessibility of their hiding place the triplebarred gate stood ajar  beyond were a handful of guards laughing and talking over one of their incomprehensible barsoomian games  i saw that none of the guardsmen had been of the party that accompanied thurid and matai shang and so relying entirely upon my disguise i walked boldly through the gateway and up to the thern guard  the men stopped their game and looked up at me but there was no sign of suspicion  similarly they looked at woola growling at my heel  kaor i said in true martian greeting and the warriors arose and saluted me  i have but just found my way hither from the golden cliffs i continued and seek audience with the hekkador matai shang father of therns  where may he be found  follow me said one of the guard and turning led me across the outer courtyard toward a second buttressed wall  why the apparent ease with which i seemingly deceived them did not rouse my suspicions i know not unless it was that my mind was still so full of that fleeting glimpse of my beloved princess that there was room in it for naught else  be that as it may the fact is that i marched buoyantly behind my guide straight into the jaws of death  afterward i learned that thern spies had been aware of my coming for hours before i reached the hidden fortress  the gate had been purposely left ajar to tempt me on  the guards had been schooled well in their part of the conspiracy and i more like a schoolboy than a seasoned warrior ran headlong into the trap  at the far side of the outer court a narrow door let into the angle made by one of the buttresses with the wall  here my guide produced a key and opened the way within then stepping back he motioned me to enter  matai shang is in the temple court beyond he said and as woola and i passed through the fellow closed the door quickly upon us  the nasty laugh that came to my ears through the heavy planking of the door after the lock clicked was my first intimation that all was not as it should be  i found myself in a small circular chamber within the buttress before me a door opened presumably upon the inner court beyond for a moment i hesitated all my suspicions now suddenly though tardily aroused then with a shrug of my shoulders i opened the door and stepped out into the glare of torches that lighted the inner court  directly opposite me a massive tower rose to a height of three hundred feet  it was of the strangely beautiful modern barsoomian style of architecture its entire surface hand carved in bold relief with intricate and fanciful designs  thirty feet above the courtyard and overlooking it was a broad balcony and there indeed was matai shang and with him were thurid and phaidor thuvia and dejah thoristhe last two heavily ironed  a handful of thern warriors stood just behind the little party  as i entered the enclosure the eyes of those in the balcony were full upon me  an ugly smile distorted the cruel lips of matai shang  thurid hurled a taunt at me and placed a familiar hand upon the shoulder of my princess  like a tigress she turned upon him striking the beast a heavy blow with the manacles upon her wrist  he would have struck back had not matai shang interfered and then i saw that the two men were not overfriendly for the manner of the thern was arrogant and domineering as he made it plain to the first born that the princess of helium was the personal property of the father of therns  and thurids bearing toward the ancient hekkador savored not at all of liking or respect  when the altercation in the balcony had subsided matai shang turned again to me  earth man he cried you have earned a more ignoble death than now lies within our weakened power to inflict upon you but that the death you die tonight may be doubly bitter know you that when you have passed your widow becomes the wife of matai shang hekkador of the holy therns for a martian year  at the end of that time as you know she shall be discarded as is the law among us but not as is usual to lead a quiet and honored life as high priestess of some hallowed shrine  instead dejah thoris princess of helium shall become the plaything of my lieutenantsperhaps of thy most hated enemy thurid the black dator  as he ceased speaking he awaited in silence evidently for some outbreak of rage upon my partsomething that would have added to the spice of his revenge  but i did not give him the satisfaction that he craved  instead i did the one thing of all others that might rouse his anger and increase his hatred of me for i knew that if i died dejah thoris too would find a way to die before they could heap further tortures or indignities upon her  of all the holy of holies which the thern venerates and worships none is more revered than the yellow wig which covers his bald pate and next thereto comes the circlet of gold and the great diadem whose scintillant rays mark the attainment of the tenth cycle  and knowing this i removed the wig and circlet from my head tossing them carelessly upon the flagging of the court  then i wiped my feet upon the yellow tresses and as a groan of rage arose from the balcony i spat full upon the holy diadem  matai shang went livid with anger but upon the lips of thurid i could see a grim smile of amusement for to him these things were not holy so lest he should derive too much amusement from my act i cried  and thus did i with the holies of issus goddess of life eternal ere i threw issus herself to the mob that once had worshiped her to be torn to pieces in her own temple  that put an end to thurids grinning for he had been high in the favor of issus  let us have an end to this blaspheming he cried turning to the father of therns  matai shang rose and leaning over the edge of the balcony gave voice to the weird call that i had heard from the lips of the priests upon the tiny balcony upon the face of the golden cliffs overlooking the valley dor when in times past they called the fearsome white apes and the hideous plant men to the feast of victims floating down the broad bosom of the mysterious iss toward the silianinfested waters of the lost sea of korus  let loose the death he cried and immediately a dozen doors in the base of the tower swung open and a dozen grim and terrible banths sprang into the arena  this was not the first time that i had faced the ferocious barsoomian lion but never had i been pitted singlehanded against a full dozen of them  even with the assistance of the fierce woola there could be but a single outcome to so unequal a struggle  for a moment the beasts hesitated beneath the brilliant glare of the torches but presently their eyes becoming accustomed to the light fell upon woola and me and with bristling manes and deepthroated roars they advanced lashing their tawny sides with their powerful tails  in the brief interval of life that was left me i shot a last parting glance toward my dejah thoris  her beautiful face was set in an expression of horror and as my eyes met hers she extended both arms toward me as struggling with the guards who now held her she endeavored to cast herself from the balcony into the pit beneath that she might share my death with me  then as the banths were about to close upon me she turned and buried her dear face in her arms  suddenly my attention was drawn toward thuvia of ptarth  the beautiful girl was leaning far over the edge of the balcony her eyes bright with excitement  in another instant the banths would be upon me but i could not force my gaze from the features of the red girl for i knew that her expression meant anything but the enjoyment of the grim tragedy that would so soon be enacted below her there was some deeper hidden meaning which i sought to solve  for an instant i thought of relying on my earthly muscles and agility to escape the banths and reach the balcony which i could easily have done but i could not bring myself to desert the faithful woola and leave him to die alone beneath the cruel fangs of the hungry banths that is not the way upon barsoom nor was it ever the way of john carter  then the secret of thuvias excitement became apparent as from her lips there issued the purring sound i had heard once before that time that within the golden cliffs she called the fierce banths about her and led them as a shepherdess might lead her flock of meek and harmless sheep  at the first note of that soothing sound the banths halted in their tracks and every fierce head went high as the beasts sought the origin of the familiar call  presently they discovered the red girl in the balcony above them and turning roared out their recognition and their greeting  guards sprang to drag thuvia away but ere they had succeeded she had hurled a volley of commands at the listening brutes and as one they turned and marched back into their dens  you need not fear them now john carter cried thuvia before they could silence her  those banths will never harm you now nor woola either  it was all i cared to know  there was naught to keep me from that balcony now and with a long running leap i sprang far aloft until my hands grasped its lowest sill  in an instant all was wild confusion  matai shang shrank back thurid sprang forward with drawn sword to cut me down  again dejah thoris wielded her heavy irons and fought him back then matai shang grasped her about the waist and dragged her away through a door leading within the tower  for an instant thurid hesitated and then as though fearing that the father of therns would escape him with the princess of helium he too dashed from the balcony in their wake  phaidor alone retained her presence of mind  two of the guards she ordered to bear away thuvia of ptarth the others she commanded to remain and prevent me from following  then she turned toward me  john carter she cried for the last time i offer you the love of phaidor daughter of the holy hekkador  accept and your princess shall be returned to the court of her grandfather and you shall live in peace and happiness  refuse and the fate that my father has threatened shall fall upon dejah thoris  you cannot save her now for by this time they have reached a place where even you may not follow  refuse and naught can save you for though the way to the last stronghold of the holy therns was made easy for you the way hence hath been made impossible what say you  you knew my answer phaidor i replied before ever you spoke make way i cried to the guards for john carter prince of helium would pass  with that i leaped over the low baluster that surrounded the balcony and with drawn longsword faced my enemies  there were three of them but phaidor must have guessed what the outcome of the battle would be for she turned and fled from the balcony the moment she saw that i would have none of her proposition  the three guardsmen did not wait for my attack  instead they rushed methe three of them simultaneously and it was that which gave me an advantage for they fouled one another in the narrow precincts of the balcony so that the foremost of them stumbled full upon my blade at the first onslaught  the red stain upon my point roused to its full the old bloodlust of the fighting man that has ever been so strong within my breast so that my blade flew through the air with a swiftness and deadly accuracy that threw the two remaining therns into wild despair  when at last the sharp steel found the heart of one of them the other turned to flee and guessing that his steps would lead him along the way taken by those i sought i let him keep ever far enough ahead to think that he was safely escaping my sword  through several inner chambers he raced until he came to a spiral runway  up this he dashed i in close pursuit  at the upper end we came out into a small chamber the walls of which were blank except for a single window overlooking the slopes of otz and the valley of lost souls beyond  here the fellow tore frantically at what appeared to be but a piece of the blank wall opposite the single window  in an instant i guessed that it was a secret exit from the room and so i paused that he might have an opportunity to negotiate it for i cared nothing to take the life of this poor servitorall i craved was a clear road in pursuit of dejah thoris my longlost princess  but try as he would the panel would yield neither to cunning nor force so that eventually he gave it up and turned to face me  go thy way thern i said to him pointing toward the entrance to the runway up which we had but just come  i have no quarrel with you nor do i crave your life  go  for answer he sprang upon me with his sword and so suddenly at that that i was like to have gone down before his first rush  so there was nothing for it but to give him what he sought and that as quickly as might be that i might not be delayed too long in this chamber while matai shang and thurid made way with dejah thoris and thuvia of ptarth  the fellow was a clever swordsmanresourceful and extremely tricky  in fact he seemed never to have heard that there existed such a thing as a code of honor for he repeatedly outraged a dozen barsoomian fighting customs that an honorable man would rather die than ignore  he even went so far as to snatch his holy wig from his head and throw it in my face so as to blind me for a moment while he thrust at my unprotected breast  when he thrust however i was not there for i had fought with therns before and while none had ever resorted to precisely that same expedient i knew them to be the least honorable and most treacherous fighters upon mars and so was ever on the alert for some new and devilish subterfuge when i was engaged with one of their race  but at length he overdid the thing for drawing his shortsword he hurled it javelinwise at my body at the same instant rushing upon me with his longsword  a single sweeping circle of my own blade caught the flying weapon and hurled it clattering against the far wall and then as i sidestepped my antagonists impetuous rush i let him have my point full in the stomach as he hurtled by  clear to the hilt my weapon passed through his body and with a frightful shriek he sank to the floor dead  halting only for the brief instant that was required to wrench my sword from the carcass of my late antagonist i sprang across the chamber to the blank wall beyond through which the thern had attempted to pass  here i sought for the secret of its lock but all to no avail  in despair i tried to force the thing but the cold unyielding stone might well have laughed at my futile puny endeavors  in fact i could have sworn that i caught the faint suggestion of taunting laughter from beyond the baffling panel  in disgust i desisted from my useless efforts and stepped to the chambers single window  the slopes of otz and the distant valley of lost souls held nothing to compel my interest then but towering far above me the towers carved wall riveted my keenest attention  somewhere within that massive pile was dejah thoris  above me i could see windows  there possibly lay the only way by which i could reach her  the risk was great but not too great when the fate of a worlds most wondrous woman was at stake  i glanced below  a hundred feet beneath lay jagged granite boulders at the brink of a frightful chasm upon which the tower abutted and if not upon the boulders then at the chasms bottom lay death should a foot slip but once or clutching fingers loose their hold for the fraction of an instant  but there was no other way and with a shrug which i must admit was half shudder i stepped to the windows outer sill and began my perilous ascent  to my dismay i found that unlike the ornamentation upon most heliumetic structures the edges of the carvings were quite generally rounded so that at best my every hold was most precarious  fifty feet above me commenced a series of projecting cylindrical stones some six inches in diameter  these apparently circled the tower at sixfoot intervals in bands six feet apart and as each stone cylinder protruded some four or five inches beyond the surface of the other ornamentation they presented a comparatively easy mode of ascent could i but reach them  laboriously i climbed toward them by way of some windows which lay below them for i hoped that i might find ingress to the tower through one of these and thence an easier avenue along which to prosecute my search  at times so slight was my hold upon the rounded surfaces of the carvings edges that a sneeze a cough or even a slight gust of wind would have dislodged me and sent me hurtling to the depths below  but finally i reached a point where my fingers could just clutch the sill of the lowest window and i was on the point of breathing a sigh of relief when the sound of voices came to me from above through the open window  he can never solve the secret of that lock  the voice was matai shangs  let us proceed to the hangar above that we may be far to the south before he finds another wayshould that be possible  all things seem possible to that vile calot replied another voice which i recognized as thurids  then let us haste said matai shang  but to be doubly sure i will leave two who shall patrol this runway  later they may follow us upon another flierovertaking us at kaol  my upstretched fingers never reached the windows sill  at the first sound of the voices i drew back my hand and clung there to my perilous perch flattened against the perpendicular wall scarce daring to breathe  what a horrible position indeed in which to be discovered by thurid  he had but to lean from the window to push me with his swords point into eternity  presently the sound of the voices became fainter and once again i took up my hazardous ascent now more difficult since more circuitous for i must climb so as to avoid the windows  matai shangs reference to the hangar and the fliers indicated that my destination lay nothing short of the roof of the tower and toward this seemingly distant goal i set my face  the most difficult and dangerous part of the journey was accomplished at last and it was with relief that i felt my fingers close about the lowest of the stone cylinders  it is true that these projections were too far apart to make the balance of the ascent anything of a sinecure but i at least had always within my reach a point of safety to which i might cling in case of accident  some ten feet below the roof the wall inclined slightly inward possibly a foot in the last ten feet and here the climbing was indeed immeasurably easier so that my fingers soon clutched the eaves  as i drew my eyes above the level of the towers top i saw a flier all but ready to rise  upon her deck were matai shang phaidor dejah thoris thuvia of ptarth and a few thern warriors while near her was thurid in the act of clambering aboard  he was not ten paces from me facing in the opposite direction and what cruel freak of fate should have caused him to turn about just as my eyes topped the roofs edge i may not even guess  but turn he did and when his eyes met mine his wicked face lighted with a malignant smile as he leaped toward me where i was hastening to scramble to the secure footing of the roof  dejah thoris must have seen me at the same instant for she screamed a useless warning just as thurids foot swinging in a mighty kick landed full in my face  like a felled ox i reeled and tumbled backward over the towers side     on the kaolian road   if there be a fate that is sometimes cruel to me there surely is a kind and merciful providence which watches over me  as i toppled from the tower into the horrid abyss below i counted myself already dead and thurid must have done likewise for he evidently did not even trouble himself to look after me but must have turned and mounted the waiting flier at once  ten feet only i fell and then a loop of my tough leathern harness caught upon one of the cylindrical stone projections in the towers surfaceand held  even when i had ceased to fall i could not believe the miracle that had preserved me from instant death and for a moment i hung there cold sweat exuding from every pore of my body  but when at last i had worked myself back to a firm position i hesitated to ascend since i could not know that thurid was not still awaiting me above  presently however there came to my ears the whirring of the propellers of a flier and as each moment the sound grew fainter i realized that the party had proceeded toward the south without assuring themselves as to my fate  cautiously i retraced my way to the roof and i must admit that it was with no pleasant sensation that i raised my eyes once more above its edge but to my relief there was no one in sight and a moment later i stood safely upon its broad surface  to reach the hangar and drag forth the only other flier which it contained was the work of but an instant and just as the two thern warriors whom matai shang had left to prevent this very contingency emerged upon the roof from the towers interior i rose above them with a taunting laugh  then i dived rapidly to the inner court where i had last seen woola and to my immense relief found the faithful beast still there  the twelve great banths lay in the doorways of their lairs eyeing him and growling ominously but they had not disobeyed thuvias injunction and i thanked the fate that had made her their keeper within the golden cliffs and endowed her with the kind and sympathetic nature that had won the loyalty and affection of these fierce beasts for her  woola leaped in frantic joy when he discovered me and as the flier touched the pavement of the court for a brief instant he bounded to the deck beside me and in the bearlike manifestation of his exuberant happiness all but caused me to wreck the vessel against the courtyards rocky wall  amid the angry shouting of thern guardsmen we rose high above the last fortress of the holy therns and then raced straight toward the northeast and kaol the destination which i had heard from the lips of matai shang  far ahead a tiny speck in the distance i made out another flier late in the afternoon  it could be none other than that which bore my lost love and my enemies  i had gained considerably on the craft by night and then knowing that they must have sighted me and would show no lights after dark i set my destination compass upon herthat wonderful little martian mechanism which once attuned to the object of destination points away toward it irrespective of every change in its location  all that night we raced through the barsoomian void passing over low hills and dead sea bottoms above longdeserted cities and populous centers of red martian habitation upon the ribbonlike lines of cultivated land which border the globeencircling waterways which earth men call the canals of mars  dawn showed that i had gained appreciably upon the flier ahead of me  it was a larger craft than mine and not so swift but even so it had covered an immense distance since the flight began  the change in vegetation below showed me that we were rapidly nearing the equator  i was now near enough to my quarry to have used my bow gun but though i could see that dejah thoris was not on deck i feared to fire upon the craft which bore her  thurid was deterred by no such scruples and though it must have been difficult for him to believe that it was really i who followed them he could not very well doubt the witness of his own eyes and so he trained their stern gun upon me with his own hands and an instant later an explosive radium projectile whizzed perilously close above my deck  the blacks next shot was more accurate striking my flier full upon the prow and exploding with the instant of contact ripping wide open the bow buoyancy tanks and disabling the engine  so quickly did my bow drop after the shot that i scarce had time to lash woola to the deck and buckle my own harness to a gunwale ring before the craft was hanging stern up and making her last long drop to ground  her stern buoyancy tanks prevented her dropping with great rapidity but thurid was firing rapidly now in an attempt to burst these also that i might be dashed to death in the swift fall that would instantly follow a successful shot  shot after shot tore past or into us but by a miracle neither woola nor i was hit nor were the after tanks punctured  this good fortune could not last indefinitely and assured that thurid would not again leave me alive i awaited the bursting of the next shell that hit and then throwing my hands above my head i let go my hold and crumpled limp and inert dangling in my harness like a corpse  the ruse worked and thurid fired no more at us  presently i heard the diminishing sound of whirring propellers and realized that again i was safe  slowly the stricken flier sank to the ground and when i had freed myself and woola from the entangling wreckage i found that we were upon the verge of a natural forestso rare a thing upon the bosom of dying mars that outside of the forest in the valley dor beside the lost sea of korus i never before had seen its like upon the planet  from books and travelers i had learned something of the littleknown land of kaol which lies along the equator almost halfway round the planet to the east of helium  it comprises a sunken area of extreme tropical heat and is inhabited by a nation of red men varying but little in manners customs and appearance from the balance of the red men of barsoom  i knew that they were among those of the outer world who still clung tenaciously to the discredited religion of the holy therns and that matai shang would find a ready welcome and safe refuge among them while john carter could look for nothing better than an ignoble death at their hands  the isolation of the kaolians is rendered almost complete by the fact that no waterway connects their land with that of any other nation nor have they any need of a waterway since the low swampy land which comprises the entire area of their domain selfwaters their abundant tropical crops  for great distances in all directions rugged hills and arid stretches of dead sea bottom discourage intercourse with them and since there is practically no such thing as foreign commerce upon warlike barsoom where each nation is sufficient to itself really little has been known relative to the court of the jeddak of kaol and the numerous strange but interesting people over whom he rules  occasional hunting parties have traveled to this outoftheway corner of the globe but the hostility of the natives has usually brought disaster upon them so that even the sport of hunting the strange and savage creatures which haunt the jungle fastnesses of kaol has of later years proved insufficient lure even to the most intrepid warriors  it was upon the verge of the land of the kaols that i now knew myself to be but in what direction to search for dejah thoris or how far into the heart of the great forest i might have to penetrate i had not the faintest idea  but not so woola  scarcely had i disentangled him than he raised his head high in air and commenced circling about at the edge of the forest  presently he halted and turning to see if i were following set off straight into the maze of trees in the direction we had been going before thurids shot had put an end to our flier  as best i could i stumbled after him down a steep declivity beginning at the forests edge  immense trees reared their mighty heads far above us their broad fronds completely shutting off the slightest glimpse of the sky it was easy to see why the kaolians needed no navy their cities hidden in the midst of this towering forest must be entirely invisible from above nor could a landing be made by any but the smallest fliers and then only with the greatest risk of accident  how thurid and matai shang were to land i could not imagine though later i was to learn that to the level of the forest top there rises in each city of kaol a slender watchtower which guards the kaolians by day and by night against the secret approach of a hostile fleet to one of these the hekkador of the holy therns had no difficulty in approaching and by its means the party was safely lowered to the ground  as woola and i approached the bottom of the declivity the ground became soft and mushy so that it was with the greatest difficulty that we made any headway whatever  slender purple grasses topped with red and yellow fernlike fronds grew rankly all about us to the height of several feet above my head  myriad creepers hung festooned in graceful loops from tree to tree and among them were several varieties of the martian manflower whose blooms have eyes and hands with which to see and seize the insects which form their diet  the repulsive calot tree was too much in evidence  it is a carnivorous plant of about the bigness of a large sagebrush such as dots our western plains  each branch ends in a set of strong jaws which have been known to drag down and devour large and formidable beasts of prey  both woola and i had several narrow escapes from these greedy arboreous monsters  occasional areas of firm sod gave us intervals of rest from the arduous labor of traversing this gorgeous twilight swamp and it was upon one of these that i finally decided to make camp for the night which my chronometer warned me would soon be upon us  many varieties of fruit grew in abundance about us and as martian calots are omnivorous woola had no difficulty in making a square meal after i had brought down the viands for him  then having eaten too i lay down with my back to that of my faithful hound and dropped into a deep and dreamless sleep  the forest was shrouded in impenetrable darkness when a low growl from woola awakened me  all about us i could hear the stealthy movement of great padded feet and now and then the wicked gleam of green eyes upon us  arising i drew my longsword and waited  suddenly a deeptoned horrid roar burst from some savage throat almost at my side  what a fool i had been not to have found safer lodgings for myself and woola among the branches of one of the countless trees that surrounded us  by daylight it would have been comparatively easy to have hoisted woola aloft in one manner or another but now it was too late  there was nothing for it but to stand our ground and take our medicine though from the hideous racket which now assailed our ears and for which that first roar had seemed to be the signal i judged that we must be in the midst of hundreds perhaps thousands of the fierce maneating denizens of the kaolian jungle  all the balance of the night they kept up their infernal din but why they did not attack us i could not guess nor am i sure to this day unless it is that none of them ever venture upon the patches of scarlet sward which dot the swamp  when morning broke they were still there walking about as in a circle but always just beyond the edge of the sward  a more terrifying aggregation of fierce and bloodthirsty monsters it would be difficult to imagine  singly and in pairs they commenced wandering off into the jungle shortly after sunrise and when the last of them had departed woola and i resumed our journey  occasionally we caught glimpses of horrid beasts all during the day but fortunately we were never far from a sward island and when they saw us their pursuit always ended at the verge of the solid sod  toward noon we stumbled upon a wellconstructed road running in the general direction we had been pursuing  everything about this highway marked it as the work of skilled engineers and i was confident from the indications of antiquity which it bore as well as from the very evident signs of its being still in everyday use that it must lead to one of the principal cities of kaol  just as we entered it from one side a huge monster emerged from the jungle upon the other and at sight of us charged madly in our direction  imagine if you can a baldfaced hornet of your earthly experience grown to the size of a prize hereford bull and you will have some faint conception of the ferocious appearance and awesome formidability of the winged monster that bore down upon me  frightful jaws in front and mighty poisoned sting behind made my relatively puny longsword seem a pitiful weapon of defense indeed nor could i hope to escape the lightninglike movements or hide from those myriad facet eyes which covered threefourths of the hideous head permitting the creature to see in all directions at one and the same time  even my powerful and ferocious woola was as helpless as a kitten before that frightful thing  but to flee were useless even had it ever been to my liking to turn my back upon a danger so i stood my ground woola snarling at my side my only hope to die as i had always livedfighting  the creature was upon us now and at the instant there seemed to me a single slight chance for victory  if i could but remove the terrible menace of certain death hidden in the poison sacs that fed the sting the struggle would be less unequal  at the thought i called to woola to leap upon the creatures head and hang there and as his mighty jaws closed upon that fiendish face and glistening fangs buried themselves in the bone and cartilage and lower part of one of the huge eyes i dived beneath the great body as the creature rose dragging woola from the ground that it might bring its sting beneath and pierce the body of the thing hanging to its head  to put myself in the path of that poisonladen lance was to court instant death but it was the only way and as the thing shot lightninglike toward me i swung my longsword in a terrific cut that severed the deadly member close to the gorgeously marked body  then like a batteringram one of the powerful hind legs caught me full in the chest and hurled me half stunned and wholly winded clear across the broad highway and into the underbrush of the jungle that fringes it  fortunately i passed between the boles of trees had i struck one of them i should have been badly injured if not killed so swiftly had i been catapulted by that enormous hind leg  dazed though i was i stumbled to my feet and staggered back to woolas assistance to find his savage antagonist circling ten feet above the ground beating madly at the clinging calot with all six powerful legs  even during my sudden flight through the air i had not once released my grip upon my longsword and now i ran beneath the two battling monsters jabbing the winged terror repeatedly with its sharp point  the thing might easily have risen out of my reach but evidently it knew as little concerning retreat in the face of danger as either woola or i for it dropped quickly toward me and before i could escape had grasped my shoulder between its powerful jaws  time and again the now useless stub of its giant sting struck futilely against my body but the blows alone were almost as effective as the kick of a horse so that when i say futilely i refer only to the natural function of the disabled membereventually the thing would have hammered me to a pulp  nor was it far from accomplishing this when an interruption occurred that put an end forever to its hostilities  from where i hung a few feet above the road i could see along the highway a few hundred yards to where it turned toward the east and just as i had about given up all hope of escaping the perilous position in which i now was i saw a red warrior come into view from around the bend  he was mounted on a splendid thoat one of the smaller species used by red men and in his hand was a wondrous long light lance  his mount was walking sedately when i first perceived them but the instant that the red mans eyes fell upon us a word to the thoat brought the animal at full charge down upon us  the long lance of the warrior dipped toward us and as thoat and rider hurtled beneath the point passed through the body of our antagonist  with a convulsive shudder the thing stiffened the jaws relaxed dropping me to the ground and then careening once in mid air the creature plunged headforemost to the road full upon woola who still clung tenaciously to its gory head  by the time i had regained my feet the red man had turned and ridden back to us  woola finding his enemy inert and lifeless released his hold at my command and wriggled from beneath the body that had covered him and together we faced the warrior looking down upon us  i started to thank the stranger for his timely assistance but he cut me off peremptorily  who are you he asked who dare enter the land of kaol and hunt in the royal forest of the jeddak  then as he noted my white skin through the coating of grime and blood that covered me his eyes went wide and in an altered tone he whispered  can it be that you are a holy thern  i might have deceived the fellow for a time as i had deceived others but i had cast away the yellow wig and the holy diadem in the presence of matai shang and i knew that it would not be long ere my new acquaintance discovered that i was no thern at all  i am not a thern i replied and then flinging caution to the winds i said  i am john carter prince of helium whose name may not be entirely unknown to you  if his eyes had gone wide when he thought that i was a holy thern they fairly popped now that he knew that i was john carter  i grasped my longsword more firmly as i spoke the words which i was sure would precipitate an attack but to my surprise they precipitated nothing of the kind  john carter prince of helium he repeated slowly as though he could not quite grasp the truth of the statement  john carter the mightiest warrior of barsoom  and then he dismounted and placed his hand upon my shoulder after the manner of most friendly greeting upon mars  it is my duty and it should be my pleasure to kill you john carter he said but always in my heart of hearts have i admired your prowess and believed in your sincerity the while i have questioned and disbelieved the therns and their religion  it would mean my instant death were my heresy to be suspected in the court of kulan tith but if i may serve you prince you have but to command torkar bar dwar of the kaolian road  truth and honesty were writ large upon the warriors noble countenance so that i could not but have trusted him enemy though he should have been  his title of captain of the kaolian road explained his timely presence in the heart of the savage forest for every highway upon barsoom is patrolled by doughty warriors of the noble class nor is there any service more honorable than this lonely and dangerous duty in the less frequented sections of the domains of the red men of barsoom  torkar bar has already placed a great debt of gratitude upon my shoulders i replied pointing to the carcass of the creature from whose heart he was dragging his long spear  the red man smiled  it was fortunate that i came when i did he said  only this poisoned spear pricking the very heart of a sith can kill it quickly enough to save its prey  in this section of kaol we are all armed with a long sith spear whose point is smeared with the poison of the creature it is intended to kill no other virus acts so quickly upon the beast as its own  look he continued drawing his dagger and making an incision in the carcass a foot above the root of the sting from which he presently drew forth two sacs each of which held fully a gallon of the deadly liquid  thus we maintain our supply though were it not for certain commercial uses to which the virus is put it would scarcely be necessary to add to our present store since the sith is almost extinct  only occasionally do we now run upon one  of old however kaol was overrun with the frightful monsters that often came in herds of twenty or thirty darting down from above into our cities and carrying away women children and even warriors  as he spoke i had been wondering just how much i might safely tell this man of the mission which brought me to his land but his next words anticipated the broaching of the subject on my part and rendered me thankful that i had not spoken too soon  and now as to yourself john carter he said i shall not ask your business here nor do i wish to hear it  i have eyes and ears and ordinary intelligence and yesterday morning i saw the party that came to the city of kaol from the north in a small flier  but one thing i ask of you and that is the word of john carter that he contemplates no overt act against either the nation of kaol or its jeddak  you may have my word as to that torkar bar i replied  my way leads along the kaolian road away from the city of kaol he continued  i have seen no onejohn carter least of all  nor have you seen torkar bar nor ever heard of him  you understand  perfectly i replied  he laid his hand upon my shoulder  this road leads directly into the city of kaol he said  i wish you fortune and vaulting to the back of his thoat he trotted away without even a backward glance  it was after dark when woola and i spied through the mighty forest the great wall which surrounds the city of kaol  we had traversed the entire way without mishap or adventure and though the few we had met had eyed the great calot wonderingly none had pierced the red pigment with which i had smoothly smeared every square inch of my body  but to traverse the surrounding country and to enter the guarded city of kulan tith jeddak of kaol were two very different things no man enters a martian city without giving a very detailed and satisfactory account of himself nor did i delude myself with the belief that i could for a moment impose upon the acumen of the officers of the guard to whom i should be taken the moment i applied at any one of the gates  my only hope seemed to lie in entering the city surreptitiously under cover of the darkness and once in trust to my own wits to hide myself in some crowded quarter where detection would be less liable to occur  with this idea in view i circled the great wall keeping within the fringe of the forest which is cut away for a short distance from the wall all about the city that no enemy may utilize the trees as a means of ingress  several times i attempted to scale the barrier at different points but not even my earthly muscles could overcome that cleverly constructed rampart  to a height of thirty feet the face of the wall slanted outward and then for almost an equal distance it was perpendicular above which it slanted in again for some fifteen feet to the crest  and smooth  polished glass could not be more so  finally i had to admit that at last i had discovered a barsoomian fortification which i could not negotiate  discouraged i withdrew into the forest beside a broad highway which entered the city from the east and with woola beside me lay down to sleep     a hero in kaol   it was daylight when i was awakened by the sound of stealthy movement near by  as i opened my eyes woola too moved and coming up to his haunches stared through the intervening brush toward the road each hair upon his neck stiffly erect  at first i could see nothing but presently i caught a glimpse of a bit of smooth and glossy green moving among the scarlet and purple and yellow of the vegetation  motioning woola to remain quietly where he was i crept forward to investigate and from behind the bole of a great tree i saw a long line of the hideous green warriors of the dead sea bottoms hiding in the dense jungle beside the road  as far as i could see the silent line of destruction and death stretched away from the city of kaol  there could be but one explanation  the green men were expecting an exodus of a body of red troops from the nearest city gate and they were lying there in ambush to leap upon them  i owed no fealty to the jeddak of kaol but he was of the same race of noble red men as my own princess and i would not stand supinely by and see his warriors butchered by the cruel and heartless demons of the waste places of barsoom  cautiously i retraced my steps to where i had left woola and warning him to silence signaled him to follow me  making a considerable detour to avoid the chance of falling into the hands of the green men i came at last to the great wall  a hundred yards to my right was the gate from which the troops were evidently expected to issue but to reach it i must pass the flank of the green warriors within easy sight of them and fearing that my plan to warn the kaolians might thus be thwarted i decided upon hastening toward the left where another gate a mile away would give me ingress to the city  i knew that the word i brought would prove a splendid passport to kaol and i must admit that my caution was due more to my ardent desire to make my way into the city than to avoid a brush with the green men  as much as i enjoy a fight i cannot always indulge myself and just now i had more weighty matters to occupy my time than spilling the blood of strange warriors  could i but win beyond the citys wall there might be opportunity in the confusion and excitement which were sure to follow my announcement of an invading force of green warriors to find my way within the palace of the jeddak where i was sure matai shang and his party would be quartered  but scarcely had i taken a hundred steps in the direction of the farther gate when the sound of marching troops the clank of metal and the squealing of thoats just within the city apprised me of the fact that the kaolians were already moving toward the other gate  there was no time to be lost  in another moment the gate would be opened and the head of the column pass out upon the deathbordered highway  turning back toward the fateful gate i ran rapidly along the edge of the clearing taking the ground in the mighty leaps that had first made me famous upon barsoom  thirty fifty a hundred feet at a bound are nothing for the muscles of an athletic earth man upon mars  as i passed the flank of the waiting green men they saw my eyes turned upon them and in an instant knowing that all secrecy was at an end those nearest me sprang to their feet in an effort to cut me off before i could reach the gate  at the same instant the mighty portal swung wide and the head of the kaolian column emerged  a dozen green warriors had succeeded in reaching a point between me and the gate but they had but little idea who it was they had elected to detain  i did not slacken my speed an iota as i dashed among them and as they fell before my blade i could not but recall the happy memory of those other battles when tars tarkas jeddak of thark mightiest of martian green men had stood shoulder to shoulder with me through long hot martian days as together we hewed down our enemies until the pile of corpses about us rose higher than a tall mans head  when several pressed me too closely there before the carved gateway of kaol i leaped above their heads and fashioning my tactics after those of the hideous plant men of dor struck down upon my enemies heads as i passed above them  from the city the red warriors were rushing toward us and from the jungle the savage horde of green men were coming to meet them in a moment i was in the very center of as fierce and bloody a battle as i had ever passed through  these kaolians are most noble fighters nor are the green men of the equator one whit less warlike than their cold cruel cousins of the temperate zone  there were many times when either side might have withdrawn without dishonor and thus ended hostilities but from the mad abandon with which each invariably renewed hostilities i soon came to believe that what need not have been more than a trifling skirmish would end only with the complete extermination of one force or the other  with the joy of battle once roused within me i took keen delight in the fray and that my fighting was noted by the kaolians was often evidenced by the shouts of applause directed at me  if i sometimes seem to take too great pride in my fighting ability it must be remembered that fighting is my vocation  if your vocation be shoeing horses or painting pictures and you can do one or the other better than your fellows then you are a fool if you are not proud of your ability  and so i am very proud that upon two planets no greater fighter has ever lived than john carter prince of helium  and i outdid myself that day to impress the fact upon the natives of kaol for i wished to win a way into their heartsand their city  nor was i to be disappointed in my desire  all day we fought until the road was red with blood and clogged with corpses  back and forth along the slippery highway the tide of battle surged but never once was the gateway to kaol really in danger  there were breathing spells when i had a chance to converse with the red men beside whom i fought and once the jeddak kulan tith himself laid his hand upon my shoulder and asked my name  i am dotar sojat i replied recalling a name given me by the tharks many years before from the surnames of the first two of their warriors i had killed which is the custom among them  you are a mighty warrior dotar sojat he replied and when this day is done i shall speak with you again in the great audience chamber  and then the fight surged upon us once more and we were separated but my hearts desire was attained and it was with renewed vigor and a joyous soul that i laid about me with my longsword until the last of the green men had had enough and had withdrawn toward their distant sea bottom  not until the battle was over did i learn why the red troops had sallied forth that day  it seemed that kulan tith was expecting a visit from a mighty jeddak of the northa powerful and the only ally of the kaolians and it had been his wish to meet his guest a full days journey from kaol  but now the march of the welcoming host was delayed until the following morning when the troops again set out from kaol  i had not been bidden to the presence of kulan tith after the battle but he had sent an officer to find me and escort me to comfortable quarters in that part of the palace set aside for the officers of the royal guard  there with woola i had spent a comfortable night and rose much refreshed after the arduous labors of the past few days  woola had fought with me through the battle of the previous day true to the instincts and training of a martian war dog great numbers of which are often to be found with the savage green hordes of the dead sea bottoms  neither of us had come through the conflict unscathed but the marvelous healing salves of barsoom had sufficed overnight to make us as good as new  i breakfasted with a number of the kaolian officers whom i found as courteous and delightful hosts as even the nobles of helium who are renowned for their ease of manners and excellence of breeding the meal was scarcely concluded when a messenger arrived from kulan tith summoning me before him  as i entered the royal presence the jeddak rose and stepping from the dais which supported his magnificent throne came forward to meet mea mark of distinction that is seldom accorded to other than a visiting ruler  kaor dotar sojat he greeted me  i have summoned you to receive the grateful thanks of the people of kaol for had it not been for your heroic bravery in daring fate to warn us of the ambuscade we must surely have fallen into the welllaid trap  tell me more of yourselffrom what country you come and what errand brings you to the court of kulan tith  i am from hastor i said for in truth i had a small palace in that southern city which lies within the farflung dominions of the heliumetic nation  my presence in the land of kaol is partly due to accident my flier being wrecked upon the southern fringe of your great forest it was while seeking entrance to the city of kaol that i discovered the green horde lying in wait for your troops  if kulan tith wondered what business brought me in a flier to the very edge of his domain he was good enough not to press me further for an explanation which i should indeed have had difficulty in rendering  during my audience with the jeddak another party entered the chamber from behind me so that i did not see their faces until kulan tith stepped past me to greet them commanding me to follow and be presented  as i turned toward them it was with difficulty that i controlled my features for there listening to kulan tiths eulogistic words concerning me stood my archenemies matai shang and thurid  holy hekkador of the holy therns the jeddak was saying shower thy blessings upon dotar sojat the valorous stranger from distant hastor whose wondrous heroism and marvelous ferocity saved the day for kaol yesterday  matai shang stepped forward and laid his hand upon my shoulder no slightest indication that he recognized me showed upon his countenancemy disguise was evidently complete  he spoke kindly to me and then presented me to thurid  the black too was evidently entirely deceived  then kulan tith regaled them much to my amusement with details of my achievements upon the field of battle  the thing that seemed to have impressed him most was my remarkable agility and time and again he described the wondrous way in which i had leaped completely over an antagonist cleaving his skull wide open with my longsword as i passed above him  i thought that i saw thurids eyes widen a bit during the narrative and several times i surprised him gazing intently into my face through narrowed lids  was he commencing to suspect  and then kulan tith told of the savage calot that fought beside me and after that i saw suspicion in the eyes of matai shangor did i but imagine it  at the close of the audience kulan tith announced that he would have me accompany him upon the way to meet his royal guest and as i departed with an officer who was to procure proper trappings and a suitable mount for me both matai shang and thurid seemed most sincere in professing their pleasure at having had an opportunity to know me  it was with a sigh of relief that i quitted the chamber convinced that nothing more than a guilty conscience had prompted my belief that either of my enemies suspected my true identity  a halfhour later i rode out of the city gate with the column that accompanied kulan tith upon the way to meet his friend and ally though my eyes and ears had been wide open during my audience with the jeddak and my various passages through the palace i had seen or heard nothing of dejah thoris or thuvia of ptarth  that they must be somewhere within the great rambling edifice i was positive and i should have given much to have found a way to remain behind during kulan tiths absence that i might search for them  toward noon we came in touch with the head of the column we had set out to meet  it was a gorgeous train that accompanied the visiting jeddak and for miles it stretched along the wide white road to kaol  mounted troops their trappings of jewel and metalincrusted leather glistening in the sunlight formed the vanguard of the body and then came a thousand gorgeous chariots drawn by huge zitidars  these low commodious wagons moved two abreast and on either side of them marched solid ranks of mounted warriors for in the chariots were the women and children of the royal court  upon the back of each monster zitidar rode a martian youth and the whole scene carried me back to my first days upon barsoom now twentytwo years in the past when i had first beheld the gorgeous spectacle of a caravan of the green horde of tharks  never before today had i seen zitidars in the service of red men these brutes are huge mastodonian animals that tower to an immense height even beside the giant green men and their giant thoats but when compared to the relatively small red man and his breed of thoats they assume brobdingnagian proportions that are truly appalling  the beasts were hung with jeweled trappings and saddlepads of gay silk embroidered in fanciful designs with strings of diamonds pearls rubies emeralds and the countless unnamed jewels of mars while from each chariot rose a dozen standards from which streamers flags and pennons fluttered in the breeze  just in front of the chariots the visiting jeddak rode alone upon a pure white thoatanother unusual sight upon barsoomand after them came interminable ranks of mounted spearmen riflemen and swordsmen  it was indeed a most imposing sight  except for the clanking of accouterments and the occasional squeal of an angry thoat or the low guttural of a zitidar the passage of the cavalcade was almost noiseless for neither thoat nor zitidar is a hoofed animal and the broad tires of the chariots are of an elastic composition which gives forth no sound  now and then the gay laughter of a woman or the chatter of children could be heard for the red martians are a social pleasureloving peoplein direct antithesis to the cold and morbid race of green men  the forms and ceremonials connected with the meeting of the two jeddaks consumed an hour and then we turned and retraced our way toward the city of kaol which the head of the column reached just before dark though it must have been nearly morning before the rear guard passed through the gateway  fortunately i was well up toward the head of the column and after the great banquet which i attended with the officers of the royal guard i was free to seek repose  there was so much activity and bustle about the palace all during the night with the constant arrival of the noble officers of the visiting jeddaks retinue that i dared not attempt to prosecute a search for dejah thoris and so as soon as it was seemly for me to do so i returned to my quarters  as i passed along the corridors between the banquet hall and the apartments that had been allotted me i had a sudden feeling that i was under surveillance and turning quickly in my tracks caught a glimpse of a figure which darted into an open doorway the instant i wheeled about  though i ran quickly back to the spot where the shadower had disappeared i could find no trace of him yet in the brief glimpse that i had caught i could have sworn that i had seen a white face surmounted by a mass of yellow hair  the incident gave me considerable food for speculation since if i were right in the conclusion induced by the cursory glimpse i had had of the spy then matai shang and thurid must suspect my identity and if that were true not even the service i had rendered kulan tith could save me from his religious fanaticism  but never did vague conjecture or fruitless fears for the future lie with sufficient weight upon my mind to keep me from my rest and so tonight i threw myself upon my sleeping silks and furs and passed at once into dreamless slumber  calots are not permitted within the walls of the palace proper and so i had had to relegate poor woola to quarters in the stables where the royal thoats are kept  he had comfortable even luxurious apartments but i would have given much to have had him with me and if he had been the thing which happened that night would not have come to pass  i could not have slept over a quarter of an hour when i was suddenly awakened by the passing of some cold and clammy thing across my forehead  instantly i sprang to my feet clutching in the direction i thought the presence lay  for an instant my hand touched against human flesh and then as i lunged headforemost through the darkness to seize my nocturnal visitor my foot became entangled in my sleeping silks and i fell sprawling to the floor  by the time i had resumed my feet and found the button which controlled the light my caller had disappeared  careful search of the room revealed nothing to explain either the identity or business of the person who had thus secretly sought me in the dead of night  that the purpose might be theft i could not believe since thieves are practically unknown upon barsoom  assassination however is rampant but even this could not have been the motive of my stealthy friend for he might easily have killed me had he desired  i had about given up fruitless conjecture and was on the point of returning to sleep when a dozen kaolian guardsmen entered my apartment  the officer in charge was one of my genial hosts of the morning but now upon his face was no sign of friendship  kulan tith commands your presence before him he said  come     new allies   surrounded by guardsmen i marched back along the corridors of the palace of kulan tith jeddak of kaol to the great audience chamber in the center of the massive structure  as i entered the brilliantly lighted apartment filled with the nobles of kaol and the officers of the visiting jeddak all eyes were turned upon me  upon the great dais at the end of the chamber stood three thrones upon which sat kulan tith and his two guests matai shang and the visiting jeddak  up the broad center aisle we marched beneath deadly silence and at the foot of the thrones we halted  prefer thy charge said kulan tith turning to one who stood among the nobles at his right and then thurid the black dator of the first born stepped forward and faced me  most noble jeddak he said addressing kulan tith from the first i suspected this stranger within thy palace  your description of his fiendish prowess tallied with that of the archenemy of truth upon barsoom  but that there might be no mistake i despatched a priest of your own holy cult to make the test that should pierce his disguise and reveal the truth  behold the result and thurid pointed a rigid finger at my forehead  all eyes followed the direction of that accusing digiti alone seemed at a loss to guess what fatal sign rested upon my brow  the officer beside me guessed my perplexity and as the brows of kulan tith darkened in a menacing scowl as his eyes rested upon me the noble drew a small mirror from his pocketpouch and held it before my face  one glance at the reflection it gave back to me was sufficient  from my forehead the hand of the sneaking thern had reached out through the concealing darkness of my bedchamber and wiped away a patch of the disguising red pigment as broad as my palm  beneath showed the tanned texture of my own white skin  for a moment thurid ceased speaking to enhance i suspect the dramatic effect of his disclosure  then he resumed  here o kulan tith he cried is he who has desecrated the temples of the gods of mars who has violated the persons of the holy therns themselves and turned a world against its ageold religion  before you in your power jeddak of kaol defender of the holies stands john carter prince of helium  kulan tith looked toward matai shang as though for corroboration of these charges  the holy thern nodded his head  it is indeed the archblasphemer he said  even now he has followed me to the very heart of thy palace kulan tith for the sole purpose of assassinating me  he  he lies i cried  kulan tith listen that you may know the truth  listen while i tell you why john carter has followed matai shang to the heart of thy palace  listen to me as well as to them and then judge if my acts be not more in accord with true barsoomian chivalry and honor than those of these revengeful devotees of the spurious creeds from whose cruel bonds i have freed your planet  silence roared the jeddak leaping to his feet and laying his hand upon the hilt of his sword  silence blasphemer  kulan tith need not permit the air of his audience chamber to be defiled by the heresies that issue from your polluted throat to judge you  you stand already selfcondemned  it but remains to determine the manner of your death  even the service that you rendered the arms of kaol shall avail you naught it was but a base subterfuge whereby you might win your way into my favor and reach the side of this holy man whose life you craved  to the pits with him he concluded addressing the officer of my guard  here was a pretty pass indeed  what chance had i against a whole nation  what hope for me of mercy at the hands of the fanatical kulan tith with such advisers as matai shang and thurid  the black grinned malevolently in my face  you shall not escape this time earth man he taunted  the guards closed toward me  a red haze blurred my vision  the fighting blood of my virginian sires coursed hot through my veins the lust of battle in all its mad fury was upon me  with a leap i was beside thurid and ere the devilish smirk had faded from his handsome face i had caught him full upon the mouth with my clenched fist and as the good old american blow landed the black dator shot back a dozen feet to crumple in a heap at the foot of kulan tiths throne spitting blood and teeth from his hurt mouth  then i drew my sword and swung round on guard to face a nation  in an instant the guardsmen were upon me but before a blow had been struck a mighty voice rose above the din of shouting warriors and a giant figure leaped from the dais beside kulan tith and with drawn longsword threw himself between me and my adversaries  it was the visiting jeddak  hold he cried  if you value my friendship kulan tith and the ageold peace that has existed between our peoples call off your swordsmen for wherever or against whomsoever fights john carter prince of helium there beside him and to the death fights thuvan dihn jeddak of ptarth  the shouting ceased and the menacing points were lowered as a thousand eyes turned first toward thuvan dihn in surprise and then toward kulan tith in question  at first the jeddak of kaol went white in rage but before he spoke he had mastered himself so that his tone was calm and even as befitted intercourse between two great jeddaks  thuvan dihn he said slowly must have great provocation thus to desecrate the ancient customs which inspire the deportment of a guest within the palace of his host  lest i too should forget myself as has my royal friend i should prefer to remain silent until the jeddak of ptarth has won from me applause for his action by relating the causes which provoked it  i could see that the jeddak of ptarth was of half a mind to throw his metal in kulan tiths face but he controlled himself even as well as had his host  none knows better than thuvan dihn he said the laws which govern the acts of men in the domains of their neighbors but thuvan dihn owes allegiance to a higher law than thesethe law of gratitude nor to any man upon barsoom does he owe a greater debt of gratitude than to john carter prince of helium  years ago kulan tith he continued upon the occasion of your last visit to me you were greatly taken with the charms and graces of my only daughter thuvia  you saw how i adored her and later you learned that inspired by some unfathomable whim she had taken the last long voluntary pilgrimage upon the cold bosom of the mysterious iss leaving me desolate  some months ago i first heard of the expedition which john carter had led against issus and the holy therns  faint rumors of the atrocities reported to have been committed by the therns upon those who for countless ages have floated down the mighty iss came to my ears  i heard that thousands of prisoners had been released few of whom dared to return to their own countries owing to the mandate of terrible death which rests against all who return from the valley dor  for a time i could not believe the heresies which i heard and i prayed that my daughter thuvia might have died before she ever committed the sacrilege of returning to the outer world  but then my fathers love asserted itself and i vowed that i would prefer eternal damnation to further separation from her if she could be found  so i sent emissaries to helium and to the court of xodar jeddak of the first born and to him who now rules those of the thern nation that have renounced their religion and from each and all i heard the same story of unspeakable cruelties and atrocities perpetrated upon the poor defenseless victims of their religion by the holy therns  many there were who had seen or known my daughter and from therns who had been close to matai shang i learned of the indignities that he personally heaped upon her and i was glad when i came here to find that matai shang was also your guest for i should have sought him out had it taken a lifetime  more too i heard and that of the chivalrous kindness that john carter had accorded my daughter  they told me how he fought for her and rescued her and how he spurned escape from the savage warhoons of the south sending her to safety upon his own thoat and remaining upon foot to meet the green warriors  can you wonder kulan tith that i am willing to jeopardize my life the peace of my nation or even your friendship which i prize more than aught else to champion the prince of helium  for a moment kulan tith was silent  i could see by the expression of his face that he was sore perplexed  then he spoke  thuvan dihn he said and his tone was friendly though sad who am i to judge my fellowman  in my eyes the father of therns is still holy and the religion which he teaches the only true religion but were i faced by the same problem that has vexed you i doubt not that i should feel and act precisely as you have  in so far as the prince of helium is concerned i may act but between you and matai shang my only office can be one of conciliation  the prince of helium shall be escorted in safety to the boundary of my domain ere the sun has set again where he shall be free to go whither he will but upon pain of death must he never again enter the land of kaol  if there be a quarrel between you and the father of therns i need not ask that the settlement of it be deferred until both have passed beyond the limits of my power  are you satisfied thuvan dihn  the jeddak of ptarth nodded his assent but the ugly scowl that he bent upon matai shang harbored ill for that pastyfaced godling  the prince of helium is far from satisfied i cried breaking rudely in upon the beginnings of peace for i had no stomach for peace at the price that had been named  i have escaped death in a dozen forms to follow matai shang and overtake him and i do not intend to be led like a decrepit thoat to the slaughter from the goal that i have won by the prowess of my sword arm and the might of my muscles  nor will thuvan dihn jeddak of ptarth be satisfied when he has heard me through  do you know why i have followed matai shang and thurid the black dator from the forests of the valley dor across half a world through almost insurmountable difficulties  think you that john carter prince of helium would stoop to assassination  can kulan tith be such a fool as to believe that lie whispered in his ear by the holy thern or dator thurid  i do not follow matai shang to kill him though the god of mine own planet knows that my hands itch to be at his throat  i follow him thuvan dihn because with him are two prisonersmy wife dejah thoris princess of helium and your daughter thuvia of ptarth  now think you that i shall permit myself to be led beyond the walls of kaol unless the mother of my son accompanies me and thy daughter be restored  thuvan dihn turned upon kulan tith  rage flamed in his keen eyes but by the masterfulness of his selfcontrol he kept his tones level as he spoke  knew you this thing kulan tith he asked  knew you that my daughter lay a prisoner in your palace  he could not know it interrupted matai shang white with what i am sure was more fear than rage  he could not know it for it is a lie  i would have had his life for that upon the spot but even as i sprang toward him thuvan dihn laid a heavy hand upon my shoulder  wait he said to me and then to kulan tith  it is not a lie this much have i learned of the prince of heliumhe does not lie answer me kulan tithi have asked you a question  three women came with the father of therns replied kulan tith phaidor his daughter and two who were reported to be her slaves if these be thuvia of ptarth and dejah thoris of helium i did not know iti have seen neither  but if they be then shall they be returned to you on the morrow  as he spoke he looked straight at matai shang not as a devotee should look at a high priest but as a ruler of men looks at one to whom he issues a command  it must have been plain to the father of therns as it was to me that the recent disclosures of his true character had done much already to weaken the faith of kulan tith and that it would require but little more to turn the powerful jeddak into an avowed enemy but so strong are the seeds of superstition that even the great kaolian still hesitated to cut the final strand that bound him to his ancient religion  matai shang was wise enough to seem to accept the mandate of his follower and promised to bring the two slave women to the audience chamber on the morrow  it is almost morning now he said and i should dislike to break in upon the slumber of my daughter or i would have them fetched at once that you might see that the prince of helium is mistaken and he emphasized the last word in an effort to affront me so subtlely that i could not take open offense  i was about to object to any delay and demand that the princess of helium be brought to me forthwith when thuvan dihn made such insistence seem unnecessary  i should like to see my daughter at once he said but if kulan tith will give me his assurance that none will be permitted to leave the palace this night and that no harm shall befall either dejah thoris or thuvia of ptarth between now and the moment they are brought into our presence in this chamber at daylight i shall not insist  none shall leave the palace tonight replied the jeddak of kaol and matai shang will give us assurance that no harm will come to the two women  the thern assented with a nod  a few moments later kulan tith indicated that the audience was at an end and at thuvan dihns invitation i accompanied the jeddak of ptarth to his own apartments where we sat until daylight while he listened to the account of my experiences upon his planet and to all that had befallen his daughter during the time that we had been together  i found the father of thuvia a man after my own heart and that night saw the beginning of a friendship which has grown until it is second only to that which obtains between tars tarkas the green jeddak of thark and myself  the first burst of marss sudden dawn brought messengers from kulan tith summoning us to the audience chamber where thuvan dihn was to receive his daughter after years of separation and i was to be reunited with the glorious daughter of helium after an almost unbroken separation of twelve years  my heart pounded within my bosom until i looked about me in embarrassment so sure was i that all within the room must hear my arms ached to enfold once more the divine form of her whose eternal youth and undying beauty were but outward manifestations of a perfect soul  at last the messenger despatched to fetch matai shang returned  i craned my neck to catch the first glimpse of those who should be following but the messenger was alone  halting before the throne he addressed his jeddak in a voice that was plainly audible to all within the chamber  o kulan tith mightiest of jeddaks he cried after the fashion of the court your messenger returns alone for when he reached the apartments of the father of therns he found them empty as were those occupied by his suite  kulan tith went white  a low groan burst from the lips of thuvan dihn who stood next me not having ascended the throne which awaited him beside his host for a moment the silence of death reigned in the great audience chamber of kulan tith jeddak of kaol  it was he who broke the spell  rising from his throne he stepped down from the dais to the side of thuvan dihn  tears dimmed his eyes as he placed both his hands upon the shoulders of his friend  o thuvan dihn he cried that this should have happened in the palace of thy best friend  with my own hands would i have wrung the neck of matai shang had i guessed what was in his foul heart last night my lifelong faith was weakenedthis morning it has been shattered but too late too late  to wrest your daughter and the wife of this royal warrior from the clutches of these archfiends you have but to command the resources of a mighty nation for all kaol is at your disposal  what may be done  say the word  first i suggested let us find those of your people who be responsible for the escape of matai shang and his followers without assistance on the part of the palace guard this thing could not have come to pass  seek the guilty and from them force an explanation of the manner of their going and the direction they have taken  before kulan tith could issue the commands that would initiate the investigation a handsome young officer stepped forward and addressed his jeddak  o kulan tith mightiest of jeddaks he said i alone be responsible for this grievous error  last night it was i who commanded the palace guard  i was on duty in other parts of the palace during the audience of the early morning and knew nothing of what transpired then so that when the father of therns summoned me and explained that it was your wish that his party be hastened from the city because of the presence here of a deadly enemy who sought the holy hekkadors life i did only what a lifetime of training has taught me was the proper thing to doi obeyed him whom i believed to be the ruler of us all mightier even than thou mightiest of jeddaks  let the consequences and the punishment fall on me alone for i alone am guilty  those others of the palace guard who assisted in the flight did so under my instructions  kulan tith looked first at me and then at thuvan dihn as though to ask our judgment upon the man but the error was so evidently excusable that neither of us had any mind to see the young officer suffer for a mistake that any might readily have made  how left they asked thuvan dihn and what direction did they take  they left as they came replied the officer upon their own flier  for some time after they had departed i watched the vessels lights which vanished finally due north  where north could matai shang find an asylum asked thuvan dihn of kulan tith  for some moments the jeddak of kaol stood with bowed head apparently deep in thought  then a sudden light brightened his countenance  i have it he cried  only yesterday matai shang let drop a hint of his destination telling me of a race of people unlike ourselves who dwell far to the north  they he said had always been known to the holy therns and were devout and faithful followers of the ancient cult  among them would he find a perpetual haven of refuge where no lying heretics might seek him out  it is there that matai shang has gone  and in all kaol there be no flier wherein to follow i cried  nor nearer than ptarth replied thuvan dihn  wait i exclaimed beyond the southern fringe of this great forest lies the wreck of the thern flier which brought me that far upon my way  if you will loan me men to fetch it and artificers to assist me i can repair it in two days kulan tith  i had been more than half suspicious of the seeming sincerity of the kaolian jeddaks sudden apostasy but the alacrity with which he embraced my suggestion and the despatch with which a force of officers and men were placed at my disposal entirely removed the last vestige of my doubts  two days later the flier rested upon the top of the watchtower ready to depart  thuvan dihn and kulan tith had offered me the entire resources of two nationsmillions of fighting men were at my disposal but my flier could hold but one other than myself and woola  as i stepped aboard her thuvan dihn took his place beside me  i cast a look of questioning surprise upon him  he turned to the highest of his own officers who had accompanied him to kaol  to you i entrust the return of my retinue to ptarth he said there my son rules ably in my absence  the prince of helium shall not go alone into the land of his enemies  i have spoken  farewell     through the carrion caves   straight toward the north day and night our destination compass led us after the fleeing flier upon which it had remained set since i first attuned it after leaving the thern fortress  early in the second night we noticed the air becoming perceptibly colder and from the distance we had come from the equator were assured that we were rapidly approaching the north arctic region  my knowledge of the efforts that had been made by countless expeditions to explore that unknown land bade me to caution for never had flier returned who had passed to any considerable distance beyond the mighty icebarrier that fringes the southern hem of the frigid zone  what became of them none knewonly that they passed forever out of the sight of man into that grim and mysterious country of the pole  the distance from the barrier to the pole was no more than a swift flier should cover in a few hours and so it was assumed that some frightful catastrophe awaited those who reached the forbidden land as it had come to be called by the martians of the outer world  thus it was that i went more slowly as we approached the barrier for it was my intention to move cautiously by day over the icepack that i might discover before i had run into a trap if there really lay an inhabited country at the north pole for there only could i imagine a spot where matai shang might feel secure from john carter prince of helium  we were flying at a snails pace but a few feet above the groundliterally feeling our way along through the darkness for both moons had set and the night was black with the clouds that are to be found only at marss two extremities  suddenly a towering wall of white rose directly in our path and though i threw the helm hard over and reversed our engine i was too late to avoid collision with a sickening crash we struck the high looming obstacle threequarters on  the flier reeled half over the engine stopped as one the patched buoyancy tanks burst and we plunged headforemost to the ground twenty feet beneath  fortunately none of us was injured and when we had disentangled ourselves from the wreckage and the lesser moon had burst again from below the horizon we found that we were at the foot of a mighty icebarrier from which outcropped great patches of the granite hills which hold it from encroaching farther toward the south  what fate  with the journey all but completed to be thus wrecked upon the wrong side of that precipitous and unscalable wall of rock and ice  i looked at thuvan dihn  he but shook his head dejectedly  the balance of the night we spent shivering in our inadequate sleeping silks and furs upon the snow that lies at the foot of the icebarrier  with daylight my battered spirits regained something of their accustomed hopefulness though i must admit that there was little enough for them to feed upon  what shall we do asked thuvan dihn  how may we pass that which is impassable  first we must disprove its impassability i replied  nor shall i admit that it is impassable before i have followed its entire circle and stand again upon this spot defeated  the sooner we start the better for i see no other way and it will take us more than a month to travel the weary frigid miles that lie before us  for five days of cold and suffering and privation we traversed the rough and frozen way which lies at the foot of the icebarrier fierce furbearing creatures attacked us by daylight and by dark never for a moment were we safe from the sudden charge of some huge demon of the north  the apt was our most consistent and dangerous foe  it is a huge whitefurred creature with six limbs four of which short and heavy carry it swiftly over the snow and ice while the other two growing forward from its shoulders on either side of its long powerful neck terminate in white hairless hands with which it seizes and holds its prey  its head and mouth are more similar in appearance to those of a hippopotamus than to any other earthly animal except that from the sides of the lower jawbone two mighty horns curve slightly downward toward the front  its two huge eyes inspired my greatest curiosity  they extend in two vast oval patches from the center of the top of the cranium down either side of the head to below the roots of the horns so that these weapons really grow out from the lower part of the eyes which are composed of several thousand ocelli each  this eye structure seemed remarkable in a beast whose haunts were upon a glaring field of ice and snow and though i found upon minute examination of several that we killed that each ocellus is furnished with its own lid and that the animal can at will close as many of the facets of his huge eyes as he chooses yet i was positive that nature had thus equipped him because much of his life was to be spent in dark subterranean recesses  shortly after this we came upon the hugest apt that we had seen the creature stood fully eight feet at the shoulder and was so sleek and clean and glossy that i could have sworn that he had but recently been groomed  he stood headon eyeing us as we approached him for we had found it a waste of time to attempt to escape the perpetual bestial rage which seems to possess these demon creatures who rove the dismal north attacking every living thing that comes within the scope of their farseeing eyes  even when their bellies are full and they can eat no more they kill purely for the pleasure which they derive from taking life and so when this particular apt failed to charge us and instead wheeled and trotted away as we neared him i should have been greatly surprised had i not chanced to glimpse the sheen of a golden collar about its neck  thuvan dihn saw it too and it carried the same message of hope to us both  only man could have placed that collar there and as no race of martians of which we knew aught ever had attempted to domesticate the ferocious apt he must belong to a people of the north of whose very existence we were ignorantpossibly to the fabled yellow men of barsoom that once powerful race which was supposed to be extinct though sometimes by theorists thought still to exist in the frozen north  simultaneously we started upon the trail of the great beast woola was quickly made to understand our desires so that it was unnecessary to attempt to keep in sight of the animal whose swift flight over the rough ground soon put him beyond our vision  for the better part of two hours the trail paralleled the barrier and then suddenly turned toward it through the roughest and seemingly most impassable country i ever had beheld  enormous granite boulders blocked the way on every hand deep rifts in the ice threatened to engulf us at the least misstep and from the north a slight breeze wafted to our nostrils an unspeakable stench that almost choked us  for another two hours we were occupied in traversing a few hundred yards to the foot of the barrier  then turning about the corner of a walllike outcropping of granite we came upon a smooth area of two or three acres before the base of the towering pile of ice and rock that had baffled us for days and before us beheld the dark and cavernous mouth of a cave  from this repelling portal the horrid stench was emanating and as thuvan dihn espied the place he halted with an exclamation of profound astonishment  by all my ancestors he ejaculated  that i should have lived to witness the reality of the fabled carrion caves  if these indeed be they we have found a way beyond the icebarrier  the ancient chronicles of the first historians of barsoomso ancient that we have for ages considered them mythologyrecord the passing of the yellow men from the ravages of the green hordes that overran barsoom as the drying up of the great oceans drove the dominant races from their strongholds  they tell of the wanderings of the remnants of this once powerful race harassed at every step until at last they found a way through the icebarrier of the north to a fertile valley at the pole  at the opening to the subterranean passage that led to their haven of refuge a mighty battle was fought in which the yellow men were victorious and within the caves that gave ingress to their new home they piled the bodies of the dead both yellow and green that the stench might warn away their enemies from further pursuit  and ever since that longgone day have the dead of this fabled land been carried to the carrion caves that in death and decay they might serve their country and warn away invading enemies  here too is brought so the fable runs all the waste stuff of the nationeverything that is subject to rot and that can add to the foul stench that assails our nostrils  and death lurks at every step among rotting dead for here the fierce apts lair adding to the putrid accumulation with the fragments of their own prey which they cannot devour  it is a horrid avenue to our goal but it is the only one  you are sure then that we have found the way to the land of the yellow men i cried  as sure as may be he replied having only ancient legend to support my belief  but see how closely so far each detail tallies with the worldold story of the hegira of the yellow race  yes i am sure that we have discovered the way to their ancient hiding place  if it be true and let us pray that such may be the case i said then here may we solve the mystery of the disappearance of tardos mors jeddak of helium and mors kajak his son for no other spot upon barsoom has remained unexplored by the many expeditions and the countless spies that have been searching for them for nearly two years  the last word that came from them was that they sought carthoris my own brave son beyond the icebarrier  as we talked we had been approaching the entrance to the cave and as we crossed the threshold i ceased to wonder that the ancient green enemies of the yellow men had been halted by the horrors of that awful way  the bones of dead men lay man high upon the broad floor of the first cave and over all was a putrid mush of decaying flesh through which the apts had beaten a hideous trail toward the entrance to the second cave beyond  the roof of this first apartment was low like all that we traversed subsequently so that the foul odors were confined and condensed to such an extent that they seemed to possess tangible substance one was almost tempted to draw his shortsword and hew his way through in search of pure air beyond  can man breathe this polluted air and live asked thuvan dihn choking  not for long i imagine i replied so let us make haste  i will go first and you bring up the rear with woola between come and with the words i dashed forward across the fetid mass of putrefaction  it was not until we had passed through seven caves of different sizes and varying but little in the power and quality of their stenches that we met with any physical opposition  then within the eighth cave we came upon a lair of apts  a full score of the mighty beasts were disposed about the chamber some were sleeping while others tore at the freshkilled carcasses of newbrought prey or fought among themselves in their lovemaking  here in the dim light of their subterranean home the value of their great eyes was apparent for these inner caves are shrouded in perpetual gloom that is but little less than utter darkness  to attempt to pass through the midst of that fierce herd seemed even to me the height of folly and so i proposed to thuvan dihn that he return to the outer world with woola that the two might find their way to civilization and come again with a sufficient force to overcome not only the apts but any further obstacles that might lie between us and our goal  in the meantime i continued i may discover some means of winning my way alone to the land of the yellow men but if i am unsuccessful one life only will have been sacrificed  should we all go on and perish there will be none to guide a succoring party to dejah thoris and your daughter  i shall not return and leave you here alone john carter replied thuvan dihn  whether you go on to victory or death the jeddak of ptarth remains at your side  i have spoken  i knew from his tone that it were useless to attempt to argue the question and so i compromised by sending woola back with a hastily penned note enclosed in a small metal case and fastened about his neck  i commanded the faithful creature to seek carthoris at helium and though half a world and countless dangers lay between i knew that if the thing could be done woola would do it  equipped as he was by nature with marvelous speed and endurance and with frightful ferocity that made him a match for any single enemy of the way his keen intelligence and wondrous instinct should easily furnish all else that was needed for the successful accomplishment of his mission  it was with evident reluctance that the great beast turned to leave me in compliance with my command and ere he had gone i could not resist the inclination to throw my arms about his great neck in a parting hug  he rubbed his cheek against mine in a final caress and a moment later was speeding through the carrion caves toward the outer world  in my note to carthoris i had given explicit directions for locating the carrion caves impressing upon him the necessity for making entrance to the country beyond through this avenue and not to attempt under any circumstances to cross the icebarrier with a fleet  i told him that what lay beyond the eighth cave i could not even guess but i was sure that somewhere upon the other side of the icebarrier his mother lay in the power of matai shang and that possibly his grandfather and greatgrandfather as well if they lived  further i advised him to call upon kulan tith and the son of thuvan dihn for warriors and ships that the expedition might be sufficiently strong to insure success at the first blow  and i concluded if there be time bring tars tarkas with you for if i live until you reach me i can think of few greater pleasures than to fight once more shoulder to shoulder with my old friend  when woola had left us thuvan dihn and i hiding in the seventh cave discussed and discarded many plans for crossing the eighth chamber  from where we stood we saw that the fighting among the apts was growing less and that many that had been feeding had ceased and lain down to sleep  presently it became apparent that in a short time all the ferocious monsters might be peacefully slumbering and thus a hazardous opportunity be presented to us to cross through their lair  one by one the remaining brutes stretched themselves upon the bubbling decomposition that covered the mass of bones upon the floor of their den until but a single apt remained awake  this huge fellow roamed restlessly about nosing among his companions and the abhorrent litter of the cave  occasionally he would stop to peer intently toward first one of the exits from the chamber and then the other  his whole demeanor was as of one who acts as sentry  we were at last forced to the belief that he would not sleep while the other occupants of the lair slept and so cast about in our minds for some scheme whereby we might trick him  finally i suggested a plan to thuvan dihn and as it seemed as good as any that we had discussed we decided to put it to the test  to this end thuvan dihn placed himself close against the caves wall beside the entrance to the eighth chamber while i deliberately showed myself to the guardian apt as he looked toward our retreat then i sprang to the opposite side of the entrance flattening my body close to the wall  without a sound the great beast moved rapidly toward the seventh cave to see what manner of intruder had thus rashly penetrated so far within the precincts of his habitation  as he poked his head through the narrow aperture that connects the two caves a heavy longsword was awaiting him upon either hand and before he had an opportunity to emit even a single growl his severed head rolled at our feet  quickly we glanced into the eighth chambernot an apt had moved crawling over the carcass of the huge beast that blocked the doorway thuvan dihn and i cautiously entered the forbidding and dangerous den  like snails we wound our silent and careful way among the huge recumbent forms  the only sound above our breathing was the sucking noise of our feet as we lifted them from the ooze of decaying flesh through which we crept  halfway across the chamber and one of the mighty beasts directly before me moved restlessly at the very instant that my foot was poised above his head over which i must step  breathlessly i waited balancing upon one foot for i did not dare move a muscle  in my right hand was my keen shortsword the point hovering an inch above the thick fur beneath which beat the savage heart  finally the apt relaxed sighing as with the passing of a bad dream and resumed the regular respiration of deep slumber  i planted my raised foot beyond the fierce head and an instant later had stepped over the beast  thuvan dihn followed directly after me and another moment found us at the further door undetected  the carrion caves consist of a series of twentyseven connecting chambers and present the appearance of having been eroded by running water in some fargone age when a mighty river found its way to the south through this single breach in the barrier of rock and ice that hems the country of the pole  thuvan dihn and i traversed the remaining nineteen caverns without adventure or mishap  we were afterward to learn that but once a month is it possible to find all the apts of the carrion caves in a single chamber  at other times they roam singly or in pairs in and out of the caves so that it would have been practically impossible for two men to have passed through the entire twentyseven chambers without encountering an apt in nearly every one of them  once a month they sleep for a full day and it was our good fortune to stumble by accident upon one of these occasions  beyond the last cave we emerged into a desolate country of snow and ice but found a wellmarked trail leading north  the way was boulderstrewn as had been that south of the barrier so that we could see but a short distance ahead of us at any time  after a couple of hours we passed round a huge boulder to come to a steep declivity leading down into a valley  directly before us we saw a half dozen menfierce blackbearded fellows with skins the color of a ripe lemon  the yellow men of barsoom ejaculated thuvan dihn as though even now that he saw them he found it scarce possible to believe that the very race we expected to find hidden in this remote and inaccessible land did really exist  we withdrew behind an adjacent boulder to watch the actions of the little party which stood huddled at the foot of another huge rock their backs toward us  one of them was peering round the edge of the granite mass as though watching one who approached from the opposite side  presently the object of his scrutiny came within the range of my vision and i saw that it was another yellow man  all were clothed in magnificent fursthe six in the black and yellow striped hide of the orluk while he who approached alone was resplendent in the pure white skin of an apt  the yellow men were armed with two swords and a short javelin was slung across the back of each while from their left arms hung cuplike shields no larger than a dinner plate the concave sides of which turned outward toward an antagonist  they seemed puny and futile implements of safety against an even ordinary swordsman but i was later to see the purpose of them and with what wondrous dexterity the yellow men manipulate them  one of the swords which each of the warriors carried caught my immediate attention  i call it a sword but really it was a sharpedged blade with a complete hook at the far end  the other sword was of about the same length as the hooked instrument and somewhere between that of my longsword and my shortsword it was straight and twoedged  in addition to the weapons i have enumerated each man carried a dagger in his harness  as the whitefurred one approached the six grasped their swords more firmlythe hooked instrument in the left hand the straight sword in the right while above the left wrist the small shield was held rigid upon a metal bracelet  as the lone warrior came opposite them the six rushed out upon him with fiendish yells that resembled nothing more closely than the savage war cry of the apaches of the southwest  instantly the attacked drew both his swords and as the six fell upon him i witnessed as pretty fighting as one might care to see  with their sharp hooks the combatants attempted to take hold of an adversary but like lightning the cupshaped shield would spring before the darting weapon and into its hollow the hook would plunge  once the lone warrior caught an antagonist in the side with his hook and drawing him close ran his sword through him  but the odds were too unequal and though he who fought alone was by far the best and bravest of them all i saw that it was but a question of time before the remaining five would find an opening through his marvelous guard and bring him down  now my sympathies have ever been with the weaker side of an argument and though i knew nothing of the cause of the trouble i could not stand idly by and see a brave man butchered by superior numbers  as a matter of fact i presume i gave little attention to seeking an excuse for i love a good fight too well to need any other reason for joining in when one is afoot  so it was that before thuvan dihn knew what i was about he saw me standing by the side of the whiteclad yellow man battling like mad with his five adversaries     with the yellow men   thuvan dihn was not long in joining me and though we found the hooked weapon a strange and savage thing with which to deal the three of us soon despatched the five blackbearded warriors who opposed us  when the battle was over our new acquaintance turned to me and removing the shield from his wrist held it out  i did not know the significance of his act but judged that it was but a form of expressing his gratitude to me  i afterward learned that it symbolized the offering of a mans life in return for some great favor done him and my act of refusing which i had immediately done was what was expected of me  then accept from talu prince of marentina said the yellow man this token of my gratitude and reaching beneath one of his wide sleeves he withdrew a bracelet and placed it upon my arm  he then went through the same ceremony with thuvan dihn  next he asked our names and from what land we hailed  he seemed quite familiar with the geography of the outerworld and when i said i was from helium he raised his brows  ah he said you seek your ruler and his company  know you of them i asked  but little more than that they were captured by my uncle salensus oll jeddak of jeddaks ruler of okar land of the yellow men of barsoom  as to their fate i know nothing for i am at war with my uncle who would crush my power in the principality of marentina  these from whom you have just saved me are warriors he has sent out to find and slay me for they know that often i come alone to hunt and kill the sacred apt which salensus oll so much reveres it is partly because i hate his religion that salensus oll hates me but mostly does he fear my growing power and the great faction which has arisen throughout okar that would be glad to see me ruler of okar and jeddak of jeddaks in his place  he is a cruel and tyrannous master whom all hate and were it not for the great fear they have of him i could raise an army overnight that would wipe out the few that might remain loyal to him  my own people are faithful to me and the little valley of marentina has paid no tribute to the court of salensus oll for a year  nor can he force us for a dozen men may hold the narrow way to marentina against a million  but now as to thine own affairs how may i aid you  my palace is at your disposal if you wish to honor me by coming to marentina  when our work is done we shall be glad to accept your invitation i replied  but now you can assist us most by directing us to the court of salensus oll and suggesting some means by which we may gain admission to the city and the palace or whatever other place we find our friends to be confined  talu gazed ruefully at our smooth faces and at thuvan dihns red skin and my white one  first you must come to marentina he said for a great change must be wrought in your appearance before you can hope to enter any city in okar  you must have yellow faces and black beards and your apparel and trappings must be those least likely to arouse suspicion  in my palace is one who can make you appear as truly yellow men as does salensus oll himself  his counsel seemed wise and as there was apparently no other way to insure a successful entry to kadabra the capital city of okar we set out with talu prince of marentina for his little rockbound country  the way was over some of the worst traveling i have ever seen and i do not wonder that in this land where there are neither thoats nor fliers that marentina is in little fear of invasion but at last we reached our destination the first view of which i had from a slight elevation a halfmile from the city  nestled in a deep valley lay a city of martian concrete whose every street and plaza and open space was roofed with glass  all about lay snow and ice but there was none upon the rounded domelike crystal covering that enveloped the whole city  then i saw how these people combated the rigors of the arctic and lived in luxury and comfort in the midst of a land of perpetual ice  their cities were veritable hothouses and when i had come within this one my respect and admiration for the scientific and engineering skill of this buried nation was unbounded  the moment we entered the city talu threw off his outer garments of fur as did we and i saw that his apparel differed but little from that of the red races of barsoom  except for his leathern harness covered thick with jewels and metal he was naked nor could one have comfortably worn apparel in that warm and humid atmosphere  for three days we remained the guests of prince talu and during that time he showered upon us every attention and courtesy within his power  he showed us all that was of interest in his great city  the marentina atmosphere plant will maintain life indefinitely in the cities of the north pole after all life upon the balance of dying mars is extinct through the failure of the air supply should the great central plant again cease functioning as it did upon that memorable occasion that gave me the opportunity of restoring life and happiness to the strange world that i had already learned to love so well  he showed us the heating system that stores the suns rays in great reservoirs beneath the city and how little is necessary to maintain the perpetual summer heat of the glorious garden spot within this arctic paradise  broad avenues of sod sewn with the seed of the ocher vegetation of the dead sea bottoms carried the noiseless traffic of light and airy ground fliers that are the only form of artificial transportation used north of the gigantic icebarrier  the broad tires of these unique fliers are but rubberlike gas bags filled with the eighth barsoomian ray or ray of propulsionthat remarkable discovery of the martians that has made possible the great fleets of mighty airships that render the red man of the outer world supreme  it is this ray which propels the inherent or reflected light of the planet off into space and when confined gives to the martian craft their airy buoyancy  the ground fliers of marentina contain just sufficient buoyancy in their automobilelike wheels to give the cars traction for steering purposes and though the hind wheels are geared to the engine and aid in driving the machine the bulk of this work is carried by a small propeller at the stern  i know of no more delightful sensation than that of riding in one of these luxuriously appointed cars which skim light and airy as feathers along the soft mossy avenues of marentina  they move with absolute noiselessness between borders of crimson sward and beneath arching trees gorgeous with the wondrous blooms that mark so many of the highly cultivated varieties of barsoomian vegetation  by the end of the third day the court barberi can think of no other earthly appellation by which to describe himhad wrought so remarkable a transformation in both thuvan dihn and myself that our own wives would never have known us  our skins were of the same lemon color as his own and great black beards and mustaches had been deftly affixed to our smooth faces  the trappings of warriors of okar aided in the deception and for wear beyond the hothouse cities we each had suits of the black and yellowstriped orluk  talu gave us careful directions for the journey to kadabra the capital city of the okar nation which is the racial name of the yellow men  this good friend even accompanied us part way and then promising to aid us in any way that he found possible bade us adieu  on parting he slipped upon my finger a curiously wrought ring set with a deadblack lusterless stone which appeared more like a bit of bituminous coal than the priceless barsoomian gem which in reality it is  there had been but three others cut from the mother stone he said which is in my possession  these three are worn by nobles high in my confidence all of whom have been sent on secret missions to the court of salensus oll  should you come within fifty feet of any of these three you will feel a rapid pricking sensation in the finger upon which you wear this ring  he who wears one of its mates will experience the same feeling it is caused by an electrical action that takes place the moment two of these gems cut from the same mother stone come within the radius of each others power  by it you will know that a friend is at hand upon whom you may depend for assistance in time of need  should another wearer of one of these gems call upon you for aid do not deny him and should death threaten you swallow the ring rather than let it fall into the hands of enemies  guard it with your life john carter for some day it may mean more than life to you  with this parting admonition our good friend turned back toward marentina and we set our faces in the direction of the city of kadabra and the court of salensus oll jeddak of jeddaks  that very evening we came within sight of the walled and glassroofed city of kadabra  it lies in a low depression near the pole surrounded by rocky snowclad hills  from the pass through which we entered the valley we had a splendid view of this great city of the north  its crystal domes sparkled in the brilliant sunlight gleaming above the frostcovered outer wall that circles the entire one hundred miles of its circumference  at regular intervals great gates give entrance to the city but even at the distance from which we looked upon the massive pile we could see that all were closed and in accordance with talus suggestion we deferred attempting to enter the city until the following morning  as he had said we found numerous caves in the hillsides about us and into one of these we crept for the night  our warm orluk skins kept us perfectly comfortable and it was only after a most refreshing sleep that we awoke shortly after daylight on the following morning  already the city was astir and from several of the gates we saw parties of yellow men emerging  following closely each detail of the instructions given us by our good friend of marentina we remained concealed for several hours until one party of some half dozen warriors had passed along the trail below our hiding place and entered the hills by way of the pass along which we had come the previous evening  after giving them time to get well out of sight of our cave thuvan dihn and i crept out and followed them overtaking them when they were well into the hills  when we had come almost to them i called aloud to their leader when the whole party halted and turned toward us  the crucial test had come  could we but deceive these men the rest would be comparatively easy  kaor i cried as i came closer to them  kaor responded the officer in charge of the party  we be from illall i continued giving the name of the most remote city of okar which has little or no intercourse with kadabra only yesterday we arrived and this morning the captain of the gate told us that you were setting out to hunt orluks which is a sport we do not find in our own neighborhood  we have hastened after you to pray that you allow us to accompany you  the officer was entirely deceived and graciously permitted us to go with them for the day  the chance guess that they were bound upon an orluk hunt proved correct and talu had said that the chances were ten to one that such would be the mission of any party leaving kadabra by the pass through which we entered the valley since that way leads directly to the vast plains frequented by this elephantine beast of prey  in so far as the hunt was concerned the day was a failure for we did not see a single orluk but this proved more than fortunate for us since the yellow men were so chagrined by their misfortune that they would not enter the city by the same gate by which they had left it in the morning as it seemed that they had made great boasts to the captain of that gate about their skill at this dangerous sport  we therefore approached kadabra at a point several miles from that at which the party had quitted it in the morning and so were relieved of the danger of embarrassing questions and explanations on the part of the gate captain whom we had said had directed us to this particular hunting party  we had come quite close to the city when my attention was attracted toward a tall black shaft that reared its head several hundred feet into the air from what appeared to be a tangled mass of junk or wreckage now partially snowcovered  i did not dare venture an inquiry for fear of arousing suspicion by evident ignorance of something which as a yellow man i should have known but before we reached the city gate i was to learn the purpose of that grim shaft and the meaning of the mighty accumulation beneath it  we had come almost to the gate when one of the party called to his fellows at the same time pointing toward the distant southern horizon  following the direction he indicated my eyes descried the hull of a large flier approaching rapidly from above the crest of the encircling hills  still other fools who would solve the mysteries of the forbidden north said the officer half to himself  will they never cease their fatal curiosity  let us hope not answered one of the warriors for then what should we do for slaves and sport  true but what stupid beasts they are to continue to come to a region from whence none of them ever has returned  let us tarry and watch the end of this one suggested one of the men  the officer looked toward the city  the watch has seen him he said we may remain for we may be needed  i looked toward the city and saw several hundred warriors issuing from the nearest gate  they moved leisurely as though there were no need for hastenor was there as i was presently to learn  then i turned my eyes once more toward the flier  she was moving rapidly toward the city and when she had come close enough i was surprised to see that her propellers were idle  straight for that grim shaft she bore  at the last minute i saw the great blades move to reverse her yet on she came as though drawn by some mighty irresistible power  intense excitement prevailed upon her deck where men were running hither and thither manning the guns and preparing to launch the small oneman fliers a fleet of which is part of the equipment of every martian war vessel  closer and closer to the black shaft the ship sped  in another instant she must strike and then i saw the familiar signal flown that sends the lesser boats in a great flock from the deck of the mother ship  instantly a hundred tiny fliers rose from her deck like a swarm of huge dragon flies but scarcely were they clear of the battleship than the nose of each turned toward the shaft and they too rushed on at frightful speed toward the same now seemingly inevitable end that menaced the larger vessel  a moment later the collision came  men were hurled in every direction from the ships deck while she bent and crumpled took the last long plunge to the scrapheap at the shafts base  with her fell a shower of her own tiny fliers for each of them had come in violent collision with the solid shaft  i noticed that the wrecked fliers scraped down the shafts side and that their fall was not as rapid as might have been expected and then suddenly the secret of the shaft burst upon me and with it an explanation of the cause that prevented a flier that passed too far across the icebarrier ever returning  the shaft was a mighty magnet and when once a vessel came within the radius of its powerful attraction for the aluminum steel that enters so largely into the construction of all barsoomian craft no power on earth could prevent such an end as we had just witnessed  i afterward learned that the shaft rests directly over the magnetic pole of mars but whether this adds in any way to its incalculable power of attraction i do not know  i am a fighting man not a scientist  here at last was an explanation of the long absence of tardos mors and mors kajak  these valiant and intrepid warriors had dared the mysteries and dangers of the frozen north to search for carthoris whose long absence had bowed in grief the head of his beautiful mother dejah thoris princess of helium  the moment that the last of the fliers came to rest at the base of the shaft the blackbearded yellow warriors swarmed over the mass of wreckage upon which they lay making prisoners of those who were uninjured and occasionally despatching with a swordthrust one of the wounded who seemed prone to resent their taunts and insults  a few of the uninjured red men battled bravely against their cruel foes but for the most part they seemed too overwhelmed by the horror of the catastrophe that had befallen them to do more than submit supinely to the golden chains with which they were manacled  when the last of the prisoners had been confined the party returned to the city at the gate of which we met a pack of fierce goldcollared apts each of which marched between two warriors who held them with strong chains of the same metal as their collars  just beyond the gate the attendants loosened the whole terrible herd and as they bounded off toward the grim black shaft i did not need to ask to know their mission  had there not been those within the cruel city of kadabra who needed succor far worse than the poor unfortunate dead and dying out there in the cold upon the bent and broken carcasses of a thousand fliers i could not have restrained my desire to hasten back and do battle with those horrid creatures that had been despatched to rend and devour them  as it was i could but follow the yellow warriors with bowed head and give thanks for the chance that had given thuvan dihn and me such easy ingress to the capital of salensus oll  once within the gates we had no difficulty in eluding our friends of the morning and presently found ourselves in a martian hostelry     in durance   the public houses of barsoom i have found vary but little  there is no privacy for other than married couples  men without their wives are escorted to a large chamber the floor of which is usually of white marble or heavy glass kept scrupulously clean  here are many small raised platforms for the guests sleeping silks and furs and if he have none of his own clean fresh ones are furnished at a nominal charge  once a mans belongings have been deposited upon one of these platforms he is a guest of the house and that platform his own until he leaves  no one will disturb or molest his belongings as there are no thieves upon mars  as assassination is the one thing to be feared the proprietors of the hostelries furnish armed guards who pace back and forth through the sleepingrooms day and night  the number of guards and gorgeousness of their trappings quite usually denote the status of the hotel  no meals are served in these houses but generally a public eating place adjoins them  baths are connected with the sleeping chambers and each guest is required to bathe daily or depart from the hotel  usually on a second or third floor there is a large sleepingroom for single women guests but its appointments do not vary materially from the chamber occupied by men  the guards who watch the women remain in the corridor outside the sleeping chamber while female slaves pace back and forth among the sleepers within ready to notify the warriors should their presence be required  i was surprised to note that all the guards with the hotel at which we stopped were red men and on inquiring of one of them i learned that they were slaves purchased by the proprietors of the hotels from the government  the man whose post was past my sleeping platform had been commander of the navy of a great martian nation but fate had carried his flagship across the icebarrier within the radius of power of the magnetic shaft and now for many tedious years he had been a slave of the yellow men  he told me that princes jeds and even jeddaks of the outer world were among the menials who served the yellow race but when i asked him if he had heard of the fate of mors kajak or tardos mors he shook his head saying that he never had heard of their being prisoners here though he was very familiar with the reputations and fame they bore in the outer world  neither had he heard any rumor of the coming of the father of therns and the black dator of the first born but he hastened to explain that he knew little of what took place within the palace  i could see that he wondered not a little that a yellow man should be so inquisitive about certain red prisoners from beyond the icebarrier and that i should be so ignorant of customs and conditions among my own race  in fact i had forgotten my disguise upon discovering a red man pacing before my sleeping platform but his growing expression of surprise warned me in time for i had no mind to reveal my identity to any unless some good could come of it and i did not see how this poor fellow could serve me yet though i had it in my mind that later i might be the means of serving him and all the other thousands of prisoners who do the bidding of their stern masters in kadabra  thuvan dihn and i discussed our plans as we sat together among our sleeping silks and furs that night in the midst of the hundreds of yellow men who occupied the apartment with us  we spoke in low whispers but as that is only what courtesy demands in a public sleeping place we roused no suspicion  at last determining that all must be but idle speculation until after we had had a chance to explore the city and attempt to put into execution the plan talu had suggested we bade each other good night and turned to sleep  after breakfasting the following morning we set out to see kadabra and as through the generosity of the prince of marentina we were well supplied with the funds current in okar we purchased a handsome ground flier  having learned to drive them while in marentina we spent a delightful and profitable day exploring the city and late in the afternoon at the hour talu told us we would find government officials in their offices we stopped before a magnificent building on the plaza opposite the royal grounds and the palace  here we walked boldly in past the armed guard at the door to be met by a red slave within who asked our wishes  tell sorav your master that two warriors from illall wish to take service in the palace guard i said  sorav talu had told us was the commander of the forces of the palace and as men from the further cities of okarand especially illallwere less likely to be tainted with the germ of intrigue which had for years infected the household of salensus oll he was sure that we would be welcomed and few questions asked us  he had primed us with such general information as he thought would be necessary for us to pass muster before sorav after which we would have to undergo a further examination before salensus oll that he might determine our physical fitness and our ability as warriors  the little experience we had had with the strange hooked sword of the yellow man and his cuplike shield made it seem rather unlikely that either of us could pass this final test but there was the chance that we might be quartered in the palace of salensus oll for several days after being accepted by sorav before the jeddak of jeddaks would find time to put us to the final test  after a wait of several minutes in an antechamber we were summoned into the private office of sorav where we were courteously greeted by this ferociousappearing blackbearded officer  he asked us our names and stations in our own city and having received replies that were evidently satisfactory to him he put certain questions to us that talu had foreseen and prepared us for  the interview could not have lasted over ten minutes when sorav summoned an aid whom he instructed to record us properly and then escort us to the quarters in the palace which are set aside for aspirants to membership in the palace guard  the aid took us to his own office first where he measured and weighed and photographed us simultaneously with a machine ingeniously devised for that purpose five copies being instantly reproduced in five different offices of the government two of which are located in other cities miles distant  then he led us through the palace grounds to the main guardroom of the palace there turning us over to the officer in charge  this individual again questioned us briefly and finally despatched a soldier to guide us to our quarters  these we found located upon the second floor of the palace in a semidetached tower at the rear of the edifice  when we asked our guide why we were quartered so far from the guardroom he replied that the custom of the older members of the guard of picking quarrels with aspirants to try their metal had resulted in so many deaths that it was found difficult to maintain the guard at its full strength while this custom prevailed  salensus oll had therefore set apart these quarters for aspirants and here they were securely locked against the danger of attack by members of the guard  this unwelcome information put a sudden check to all our welllaid plans for it meant that we should virtually be prisoners in the palace of salensus oll until the time that he should see fit to give us the final examination for efficiency  as it was this interval upon which we had banked to accomplish so much in our search for dejah thoris and thuvia of ptarth our chagrin was unbounded when we heard the great lock click behind our guide as he had quitted us after ushering us into the chambers we were to occupy  with a wry face i turned to thuvan dihn  my companion but shook his head disconsolately and walked to one of the windows upon the far side of the apartment  scarcely had he gazed beyond them than he called to me in a tone of suppressed excitement and surprise  in an instant i was by his side  look said thuvan dihn pointing toward the courtyard below  as my eyes followed the direction indicated i saw two women pacing back and forth in an enclosed garden  at the same moment i recognized themthey were dejah thoris and thuvia of ptarth  there were they whom i had trailed from one pole to another the length of a world  only ten feet of space and a few metal bars separated me from them  with a cry i attracted their attention and as dejah thoris looked up full into my eyes i made the sign of love that the men of barsoom make to their women  to my astonishment and horror her head went high and as a look of utter contempt touched her finely chiseled features she turned her back full upon me  my body is covered with the scars of a thousand conflicts but never in all my long life have i suffered such anguish from a wound for this time the steel of a womans look had entered my heart  with a groan i turned away and buried my face in my arms  i heard thuvan dihn call aloud to thuvia but an instant later his exclamation of surprise betokened that he too had been repulsed by his own daughter  they will not even listen he cried to me  they have put their hands over their ears and walked to the farther end of the garden ever heard you of such mad work john carter  the two must be bewitched  presently i mustered the courage to return to the window for even though she spurned me i loved her and could not keep my eyes from feasting upon her divine face and figure but when she saw me looking she again turned away  i was at my wits end to account for her strange actions and that thuvia too had turned against her father seemed incredible  could it be that my incomparable princess still clung to the hideous faith from which i had rescued her world  could it be that she looked upon me with loathing and contempt because i had returned from the valley dor or because i had desecrated the temples and persons of the holy therns  to naught else could i ascribe her strange deportment yet it seemed far from possible that such could be the case for the love of dejah thoris for john carter had been a great and wondrous lovefar above racial distinctions creed or religion  as i gazed ruefully at the back of her haughty royal head a gate at the opposite end of the garden opened and a man entered  as he did so he turned and slipped something into the hand of the yellow guardsman beyond the gate nor was the distance too great that i might not see that money had passed between them  instantly i knew that this newcomer had bribed his way within the garden  then he turned in the direction of the two women and i saw that he was none other than thurid the black dator of the first born  he approached quite close to them before he spoke and as they turned at the sound of his voice i saw dejah thoris shrink from him  there was a nasty leer upon his face as he stepped close to her and spoke again  i could not hear his words but her answer came clearly  the granddaughter of tardos mors can always die she said but she could never live at the price you name  then i saw the black scoundrel go upon his knees beside her fairly groveling in the dirt pleading with her  only part of what he said came to me for though he was evidently laboring under the stress of passion and excitement it was equally apparent that he did not dare raise his voice for fear of detection  i would save you from matai shang i heard him say  you know the fate that awaits you at his hands  would you not choose me rather than the other  i would choose neither replied dejah thoris even were i free to choose as you know well i am not  you are free he cried  john carter prince of helium is dead  i know better than that but even were he dead and i must needs choose another mate it should be a plant man or a great white ape in preference to either matai shang or you black calot she answered with a sneer of contempt  of a sudden the vicious beast lost all control of himself as with a vile oath he leaped at the slender woman gripping her tender throat in his brute clutch  thuvia screamed and sprang to aid her fellowprisoner and at the same instant i too went mad and tearing at the bars that spanned my window i ripped them from their sockets as they had been but copper wire  hurling myself through the aperture i reached the garden but a hundred feet from where the black was choking the life from my dejah thoris and with a single great bound i was upon him  i spoke no word as i tore his defiling fingers from that beautiful throat nor did i utter a sound as i hurled him twenty feet from me  foaming with rage thurid regained his feet and charged me like a mad bull  yellow man he shrieked you knew not upon whom you had laid your vile hands but ere i am done with you you will know well what it means to offend the person of a first born  then he was upon me reaching for my throat and precisely as i had done that day in the courtyard of the temple of issus i did here in the garden of the palace of salensus oll  i ducked beneath his outstretched arms and as he lunged past me i planted a terrific right upon the side of his jaw  just as he had done upon that other occasion he did now  like a top he spun round his knees gave beneath him and he crumpled to the ground at my feet  then i heard a voice behind me  it was the deep voice of authority that marks the ruler of men and when i turned to face the resplendent figure of a giant yellow man i did not need to ask to know that it was salensus oll  at his right stood matai shang and behind them a score of guardsmen  who are you he cried and what means this intrusion within the precincts of the womens garden  i do not recall your face  how came you here  but for his last words i should have forgotten my disguise entirely and told him outright that i was john carter prince of helium but his question recalled me to myself  i pointed to the dislodged bars of the window above  i am an aspirant to membership in the palace guard i said and from yonder window in the tower where i was confined awaiting the final test for fitness i saw this brute attack thethis woman  i could not stand idly by o jeddak and see this thing done within the very palace grounds and yet feel that i was fit to serve and guard your royal person  i had evidently made an impression upon the ruler of okar by my fair words and when he had turned to dejah thoris and thuvia of ptarth and both had corroborated my statements it began to look pretty dark for thurid  i saw the ugly gleam in matai shangs evil eyes as dejah thoris narrated all that had passed between thurid and herself and when she came to that part which dealt with my interference with the dator of the first born her gratitude was quite apparent though i could see by her eyes that something puzzled her strangely  i did not wonder at her attitude toward me while others were present but that she should have denied me while she and thuvia were the only occupants of the garden still cut me sorely  as the examination proceeded i cast a glance at thurid and startled him looking wideeyed and wonderingly at me and then of a sudden he laughed full in my face  a moment later salensus oll turned toward the black  what have you to say in explanation of these charges he asked in a deep and terrible voice  dare you aspire to one whom the father of therns has chosenone who might even be a fit mate for the jeddak of jeddaks himself  and then the blackbearded tyrant turned and cast a sudden greedy look upon dejah thoris as though with the words a new thought and a new desire had sprung up within his mind and breast  thurid had been about to reply and with a malicious grin upon his face was pointing an accusing finger at me when salensus olls words and the expression of his face cut him short  a cunning look crept into his eyes and i knew from the expression of his face that his next words were not the ones he had intended to speak  o mightiest of jeddaks he said the man and the women do not speak the truth  the fellow had come into the garden to assist them to escape  i was beyond and overheard their conversation and when i entered the woman screamed and the man sprang upon me and would have killed me  what know you of this man  he is a stranger to you and i dare say that you will find him an enemy and a spy  let him be put on trial salensus oll rather than your friend and guest thurid dator of the first born  salensus oll looked puzzled  he turned again and looked upon dejah thoris and then thurid stepped quite close to him and whispered something in his earwhat i know not  presently the yellow ruler turned to one of his officers  see that this man be securely confined until we have time to go deeper into this affair he commanded and as bars alone seem inadequate to restrain him let chains be added  then he turned and left the garden taking dejah thoris with himhis hand upon her shoulder  thurid and matai shang went also and as they reached the gateway the black turned and laughed again aloud in my face  what could be the meaning of his sudden change toward me  could he suspect my true identity  it must be that and the thing that had betrayed me was the trick and blow that had laid him low for the second time  as the guards dragged me away my heart was very sad and bitter indeed for now to the two relentless enemies that had hounded her for so long another and a more powerful one had been added for i would have been but a fool had i not recognized the sudden love for dejah thoris that had just been born in the terrible breast of salensus oll jeddak of jeddaks ruler of okar     the pit of plenty   i did not languish long within the prison of salensus oll  during the short time that i lay there fettered with chains of gold i often wondered as to the fate of thuvan dihn jeddak of ptarth  my brave companion had followed me into the garden as i attacked thurid and when salensus oll had left with dejah thoris and the others leaving thuvia of ptarth behind he too had remained in the garden with his daughter apparently unnoticed for he was appareled similarly to the guards  the last i had seen of him he stood waiting for the warriors who escorted me to close the gate behind them that he might be alone with thuvia  could it be possible that they had escaped  i doubted it and yet with all my heart i hoped that it might be true  the third day of my incarceration brought a dozen warriors to escort me to the audience chamber where salensus oll himself was to try me  a great number of nobles crowded the room and among them i saw thurid but matai shang was not there  dejah thoris as radiantly beautiful as ever sat upon a small throne beside salensus oll  the expression of sad hopelessness upon her dear face cut deep into my heart  her position beside the jeddak of jeddaks boded ill for her and me and on the instant that i saw her there there sprang to my mind the firm intention never to leave that chamber alive if i must leave her in the clutches of this powerful tyrant  i had killed better men than salensus oll and killed them with my bare hands and now i swore to myself that i should kill him if i found that the only way to save the princess of helium  that it would mean almost instant death for me i cared not except that it would remove me from further efforts in behalf of dejah thoris and for this reason alone i would have chosen another way for even though i should kill salensus oll that act would not restore my beloved wife to her own people  i determined to wait the final outcome of the trial that i might learn all that i could of the okarian rulers intentions and then act accordingly  scarcely had i come before him than salensus oll summoned thurid also  dator thurid he said you have made a strange request of me but in accordance with your wishes and your promise that it will result only to my interests i have decided to accede  you tell me that a certain announcement will be the means of convicting this prisoner and at the same time open the way to the gratification of my dearest wish  thurid nodded  then shall i make the announcement here before all my nobles continued salensus oll  for a year no queen has sat upon the throne beside me and now it suits me to take to wife one who is reputed the most beautiful woman upon barsoom  a statement which none may truthfully deny  nobles of okar unsheathe your swords and do homage to dejah thoris princess of helium and future queen of okar for at the end of the allotted ten days she shall become the wife of salensus oll  as the nobles drew their blades and lifted them on high in accordance with the ancient custom of okar when a jeddak announces his intention to wed dejah thoris sprang to her feet and raising her hand aloft cried in a loud voice that they desist  i may not be the wife of salensus oll she pleaded for already i be a wife and mother  john carter prince of helium still lives i know it to be true for i overheard matai shang tell his daughter phaidor that he had seen him in kaor at the court of kulan tith jeddak  a jeddak does not wed a married woman nor will salensus oll thus violate the bonds of matrimony  salensus oll turned upon thurid with an ugly look  is this the surprise you held in store for me he cried  you assured me that no obstacle which might not be easily overcome stood between me and this woman and now i find that the one insuperable obstacle intervenes  what mean you man  what have you to say  and should i deliver john carter into your hands salensus oll would you not feel that i had more than satisfied the promise that i made you answered thurid  talk not like a fool cried the enraged jeddak  i am no child to be thus played with  i am talking only as a man who knows replied thurid  knows that he can do all that he claims  then turn john carter over to me within ten days or yourself suffer the end that i should mete out to him were he in my power snapped the jeddak of jeddaks with an ugly scowl  you need not wait ten days salensus oll replied thurid and then turning suddenly upon me as he extended a pointing finger he cried  there stands john carter prince of helium  fool shrieked salensus oll  fool  john carter is a white man  this fellow be as yellow as myself  john carters face is smoothmatai shang has described him to me  this prisoner has a beard and mustache as large and black as any in okar  quick guardsmen to the pits with the black maniac who wishes to throw his life away for a poor joke upon your ruler  hold cried thurid and springing forward before i could guess his intention he had grasped my beard and ripped the whole false fabric from my face and head revealing my smooth tanned skin beneath and my closecropped black hair  instantly pandemonium reigned in the audience chamber of salensus oll  warriors pressed forward with drawn blades thinking that i might be contemplating the assassination of the jeddak of jeddaks while others out of curiosity to see one whose name was familiar from pole to pole crowded behind their fellows  as my identity was revealed i saw dejah thoris spring to her feetamazement writ large upon her faceand then through that jam of armed men she forced her way before any could prevent  a moment only and she was before me with outstretched arms and eyes filled with the light of her great love  john carter  john carter she cried as i folded her to my breast and then of a sudden i knew why she had denied me in the garden beneath the tower  what a fool i had been  expecting that she would penetrate the marvelous disguise that had been wrought for me by the barber of marentina  she had not known me that was all and when she saw the sign of love from a stranger she was offended and righteously indignant  indeed but i had been a fool  and it was you she cried who spoke to me from the tower  how could i dream that my beloved virginian lay behind that fierce beard and that yellow skin  she had been wont to call me her virginian as a term of endearment for she knew that i loved the sound of that beautiful name made a thousand times more beautiful and hallowed by her dear lips and as i heard it again after all those long years my eyes became dimmed with tears and my voice choked with emotion  but an instant did i crush that dear form to me ere salensus oll trembling with rage and jealousy shouldered his way to us  seize the man he cried to his warriors and a hundred ruthless hands tore us apart  well it was for the nobles of the court of okar that john carter had been disarmed  as it was a dozen of them felt the weight of my clenched fists and i had fought my way half up the steps before the throne to which salensus oll had carried dejah thoris ere ever they could stop me  then i went down fighting beneath a halfhundred warriors but before they had battered me into unconsciousness i heard that from the lips of dejah thoris that made all my suffering well worth while  standing there beside the great tyrant who clutched her by the arm she pointed to where i fought alone against such awful odds  think you salensus oll that the wife of such as he is she cried would ever dishonor his memory were he a thousand times dead by mating with a lesser mortal  lives there upon any world such another as john carter prince of helium  lives there another man who could fight his way back and forth across a warlike planet facing savage beasts and hordes of savage men for the love of a woman  i dejah thoris princess of helium am his  he fought for me and won me  if you be a brave man you will honor the bravery that is his and you will not kill him  make him a slave if you will salensus oll but spare his life  i would rather be a slave with such as he than be queen of okar  neither slave nor queen dictates to salensus oll replied the jeddak of jeddaks  john carter shall die a natural death in the pit of plenty and the day he dies dejah thoris shall become my queen  i did not hear her reply for it was then that a blow upon my head brought unconsciousness and when i recovered my senses only a handful of guardsmen remained in the audience chamber with me as i opened my eyes they goaded me with the points of their swords and bade me rise  then they led me through long corridors to a court far toward the center of the palace  in the center of the court was a deep pit near the edge of which stood half a dozen other guardsmen awaiting me  one of them carried a long rope in his hands which he commenced to make ready as we approached  we had come to within fifty feet of these men when i felt a sudden strange and rapid pricking sensation in one of my fingers  for a moment i was nonplused by the odd feeling and then there came to me recollection of that which in the stress of my adventure i had entirely forgottenthe gift ring of prince talu of marentina  instantly i looked toward the group we were nearing at the same time raising my left hand to my forehead that the ring might be visible to one who sought it  simultaneously one of the waiting warriors raised his left hand ostensibly to brush back his hair and upon one of his fingers i saw the duplicate of my own ring  a quick look of intelligence passed between us after which i kept my eyes turned away from the warrior and did not look at him again for fear that i might arouse the suspicion of the okarians  when we reached the edge of the pit i saw that it was very deep and presently i realized i was soon to judge just how far it extended below the surface of the court for he who held the rope passed it about my body in such a way that it could be released from above at any time and then as all the warriors grasped it he pushed me forward and i fell into the yawning abyss  after the first jerk as i reached the end of the rope that had been paid out to let me fall below the pits edge they lowered me quickly but smoothly  the moment before the plunge while two or three of the men had been assisting in adjusting the rope about me one of them had brought his mouth close to my cheek and in the brief interval before i was cast into the forbidding hole he breathed a single word into my ear  courage  the pit which my imagination had pictured as bottomless proved to be not more than a hundred feet in depth but as its walls were smoothly polished it might as well have been a thousand feet for i could never hope to escape without outside assistance  for a day i was left in darkness and then quite suddenly a brilliant light illumined my strange cell  i was reasonably hungry and thirsty by this time not having tasted food or drink since the day prior to my incarceration  to my amazement i found the sides of the pit that i had thought smooth lined with shelves upon which were the most delicious viands and liquid refreshments that okar afforded  with an exclamation of delight i sprang forward to partake of some of the welcome food but ere ever i reached it the light was extinguished and though i groped my way about the chamber my hands came in contact with nothing beside the smooth hard wall that i had felt on my first examination of my prison  immediately the pangs of hunger and thirst began to assail me where before i had had but a mild craving for food and drink i now actually suffered for want of it and all because of the tantalizing sight that i had had of food almost within my grasp  once more darkness and silence enveloped me a silence that was broken only by a single mocking laugh  for another day nothing occurred to break the monotony of my imprisonment or relieve the suffering superinduced by hunger and thirst  slowly the pangs became less keen as suffering deadened the activity of certain nerves and then the light flashed on once again and before me stood an array of new and tempting dishes with great bottles of clear water and flagons of refreshing wine upon the outside of which the cold sweat of condensation stood  again with the hunger madness of a wild beast i sprang forward to seize those tempting dishes but as before the light went out and i came to a sudden stop against a hard wall  then the mocking laugh rang out for a second time  the pit of plenty  ah what a cruel mind must have devised this exquisite hellish torture  day after day was the thing repeated until i was on the verge of madness and then as i had done in the pits of the warhoons i took a new firm hold upon my reason and forced it back into the channels of sanity  by sheer willpower i regained control over my tottering mentality and so successful was i that the next time that the light came i sat quite still and looked indifferently at the fresh and tempting food almost within my reach  glad i was that i had done so for it gave me an opportunity to solve the seeming mystery of those vanishing banquets  as i made no move to reach the food the torturers left the light turned on in the hope that at last i could refrain no longer from giving them the delicious thrill of enjoyment that my former futile efforts to obtain it had caused  and as i sat scrutinizing the laden shelves i presently saw how the thing was accomplished and so simple was it that i wondered i had not guessed it before  the wall of my prison was of clearest glassbehind the glass were the tantalizing viands  after nearly an hour the light went out but this time there was no mocking laughterat least not upon the part of my tormentors but i to be at quits with them gave a low laugh that none might mistake for the cackle of a maniac  nine days passed and i was weak from hunger and thirst but no longer sufferingi was past that  then down through the darkness above a little parcel fell to the floor at my side  indifferently i groped for it thinking it but some new invention of my jailers to add to my sufferings  at last i found ita tiny package wrapped in paper at the end of a strong and slender cord  as i opened it a few lozenges fell to the floor  as i gathered them up feeling of them and smelling of them i discovered that they were tablets of concentrated food such as are quite common in all parts of barsoom  poison i thought  well what of it  why not end my misery now rather than drag out a few more wretched days in this dark pit  slowly i raised one of the little pellets to my lips  goodbye my dejah thoris i breathed  i have lived for you and fought for you and now my next dearest wish is to be realized for i shall die for you and taking the morsel in my mouth i devoured it  one by one i ate them all nor ever did anything taste better than those tiny bits of nourishment within which i knew must lie the seeds of deathpossibly of some hideous torturing death  as i sat quietly upon the floor of my prison waiting for the end my fingers by accident came in contact with the bit of paper in which the things had been wrapped and as i idly played with it my mind roaming far back into the past that i might live again for a few brief moments before i died some of the many happy moments of a long and happy life i became aware of strange protuberances upon the smooth surface of the parchmentlike substance in my hands  for a time they carried no special significance to my mindi merely was mildly wondrous that they were there but at last they seemed to take form and then i realized that there was but a single line of them like writing  now more interestedly my fingers traced and retraced them  there were four separate and distinct combinations of raised lines  could it be that these were four words and that they were intended to carry a message to me  the more i thought of it the more excited i became until my fingers raced madly back and forth over those bewildering little hills and valleys upon that bit of paper  but i could make nothing of them and at last i decided that my very haste was preventing me from solving the mystery  then i took it more slowly  again and again my forefinger traced the first of those four combinations  martian writing is rather difficult to explain to an earth manit is something of a cross between shorthand and picturewriting and is an entirely different language from the spoken language of mars  upon barsoom there is but a single oral language  it is spoken today by every race and nation just as it was at the beginning of human life upon barsoom  it has grown with the growth of the planets learning and scientific achievements but so ingenious a thing it is that new words to express new thoughts or describe new conditions or discoveries form themselvesno other word could explain the thing that a new word is required for other than the word that naturally falls to it and so no matter how far removed two nations or races their spoken languages are identical  not so their written languages however  no two nations have the same written language and often cities of the same nation have a written language that differs greatly from that of the nation to which they belong  thus it was that the signs upon the paper if in reality they were words baffled me for some time but at last i made out the first one  it was courage and it was written in the letters of marentina  courage  that was the word the yellow guardsman had whispered in my ear as i stood upon the verge of the pit of plenty  the message must be from him and he i knew was a friend  with renewed hope i bent my every energy to the deciphering of the balance of the message and at last success rewarded my endeavori had read the four words  courage  follow the rope     follow the rope   what could it mean  follow the rope  what rope  presently i recalled the cord that had been attached to the parcel when it fell at my side and after a little groping my hand came in contact with it again  it depended from above and when i pulled upon it i discovered that it was rigidly fastened possibly at the pits mouth  upon examination i found that the cord though small was amply able to sustain the weight of several men  then i made another discoverythere was a second message knotted in the rope at about the height of my head  this i deciphered more easily now that the key was mine  bring the rope with you  beyond the knots lies danger  that was all there was to this message  it was evidently hastily formedan afterthought  i did not pause longer than to learn the contents of the second message and though i was none too sure of the meaning of the final admonition beyond the knots lies danger yet i was sure that here before me lay an avenue of escape and that the sooner i took advantage of it the more likely was i to win to liberty  at least i could be but little worse off than i had been in the pit of plenty  i was to find however ere i was well out of that damnable hole that i might have been very much worse off had i been compelled to remain there another two minutes  it had taken me about that length of time to ascend some fifty feet above the bottom when a noise above attracted my attention  to my chagrin i saw that the covering of the pit was being removed far above me and in the light of the courtyard beyond i saw a number of yellow warriors  could it be that i was laboriously working my way into some new trap  were the messages spurious after all  and then just as my hope and courage had ebbed to their lowest i saw two things  one was the body of a huge struggling snarling apt being lowered over the side of the pit toward me and the other was an aperture in the side of the shaftan aperture larger than a mans body into which my rope led  just as i scrambled into the dark hole before me the apt passed me reaching out with his mighty hands to clutch me and snapping growling and roaring in a most frightful manner  plainly now i saw the end for which salensus oll had destined me after first torturing me with starvation he had caused this fierce beast to be lowered into my prison to finish the work that the jeddaks hellish imagination had conceived  and then another truth flashed upon mei had lived nine days of the allotted ten which must intervene before salensus oll could make dejah thoris his queen  the purpose of the apt was to insure my death before the tenth day  i almost laughed aloud as i thought how salensus olls measure of safety was to aid in defeating the very end he sought for when they discovered that the apt was alone in the pit of plenty they could not know but that he had completely devoured me and so no suspicion of my escape would cause a search to be made for me  coiling the rope that had carried me thus far upon my strange journey i sought for the other end but found that as i followed it forward it extended always before me  so this was the meaning of the words  follow the rope  the tunnel through which i crawled was low and dark  i had followed it for several hundred yards when i felt a knot beneath my fingers beyond the knots lies danger  now i went with the utmost caution and a moment later a sharp turn in the tunnel brought me to an opening into a large brilliantly lighted chamber  the trend of the tunnel i had been traversing had been slightly upward and from this i judged that the chamber into which i now found myself looking must be either on the first floor of the palace or directly beneath the first floor  upon the opposite wall were many strange instruments and devices and in the center of the room stood a long table at which two men were seated in earnest conversation  he who faced me was a yellow mana little wizenedup pastyfaced old fellow with great eyes that showed the white round the entire circumference of the iris  his companion was a black man and i did not need to see his face to know that it was thurid for there was no other of the first born north of the icebarrier  thurid was speaking as i came within hearing of the mens voices  solan he was saying there is no risk and the reward is great you know that you hate salensus oll and that nothing would please you more than to thwart him in some cherished plan  there be nothing that he more cherishes today than the idea of wedding the beautiful princess of helium but i too want her and with your help i may win her  you need not more than step from this room for an instant when i give you the signal  i will do the rest and then when i am gone you may come and throw the great switch back into its place and all will be as before  i need but an hours start to be safe beyond the devilish power that you control in this hidden chamber beneath the palace of your master  see how easy and with the words the black dator rose from his seat and crossing the room laid his hand upon a large burnished lever that protruded from the opposite wall  no no cried the little old man springing after him with a wild shriek  not that one  not that one  that controls the sunray tanks and should you pull it too far down all kadabra would be consumed by heat before i could replace it  come away  come away you know not with what mighty powers you play  this is the lever that you seek  note well the symbol inlaid in white upon its ebon surface  thurid approached and examined the handle of the lever  ah a magnet he said  i will remember  it is settled then i take it he continued  the old man hesitated  a look of combined greed and apprehension overspread his none too beautiful features  double the figure he said  even that were all too small an amount for the service you ask  why i risk my life by even entertaining you here within the forbidden precincts of my station  should salensus oll learn of it he would have me thrown to the apts before the day was done  he dare not do that and you know it full well solan contradicted the black  too great a power of life and death you hold over the people of kadabra for salensus oll ever to risk threatening you with death  before ever his minions could lay their hands upon you you might seize this very lever from which you have just warned me and wipe out the entire city  and myself into the bargain said solan with a shudder  but if you were to die anyway you would find the nerve to do it replied thurid  yes muttered solan i have often thought upon that very thing well first born is your red princess worth the price i ask for my services or will you go without her and see her in the arms of salensus oll tomorrow night  take your price yellow man replied thurid with an oath  half now and the balance when you have fulfilled your contract  with that the dator threw a wellfilled moneypouch upon the table  solan opened the pouch and with trembling fingers counted its contents his weird eyes assumed a greedy expression and his unkempt beard and mustache twitched with the muscles of his mouth and chin  it was quite evident from his very mannerism that thurid had keenly guessed the mans weaknesseven the clawlike clutching movement of the fingers betokened the avariciousness of the miser  having satisfied himself that the amount was correct solan replaced the money in the pouch and rose from the table  now he said are you quite sure that you know the way to your destination  you must travel quickly to cover the ground to the cave and from thence beyond the great power all within a brief hour for no more dare i spare you  let me repeat it to you said thurid that you may see if i be letterperfect  proceed replied solan  through yonder door he commenced pointing to a door at the far end of the apartment i follow a corridor passing three diverging corridors upon my right then into the fourth righthand corridor straight to where three corridors meet here again i follow to the right hugging the left wall closely to avoid the pit  at the end of this corridor i shall come to a spiral runway which i must follow down instead of up after that the way is along but a single branchless corridor  am i right  quite right dator answered solan and now begone  already have you tempted fate too long within this forbidden place  tonight or tomorrow then you may expect the signal said thurid rising to go  tonight or tomorrow repeated solan and as the door closed behind his guest the old man continued to mutter as he turned back to the table where he again dumped the contents of the moneypouch running his fingers through the heap of shining metal piling the coins into little towers counting recounting and fondling the wealth the while he muttered on and on in a crooning undertone  presently his fingers ceased their play his eyes popped wider than ever as they fastened upon the door through which thurid had disappeared  the croon changed to a querulous muttering and finally to an ugly growl  then the old man rose from the table shaking his fist at the closed door  now he raised his voice and his words came distinctly  fool he muttered  think you that for your happiness solan will give up his life  if you escaped salensus oll would know that only through my connivance could you have succeeded  then would he send for me  what would you have me do  reduce the city and myself to ashes  no fool there is a better waya better way for solan to keep thy money and be revenged upon salensus oll  he laughed in a nasty cackling note  poor fool  you may throw the great switch that will give you the freedom of the air of okar and then in fatuous security go on with thy red princess to the freedom ofdeath  when you have passed beyond this chamber in your flight what can prevent solan replacing the switch as it was before your vile hand touched it nothing and then the guardian of the north will claim you and your woman and salensus oll when he sees your dead bodies will never dream that the hand of solan had aught to do with the thing  then his voice dropped once more into mutterings that i could not translate but i had heard enough to cause me to guess a great deal more and i thanked the kind providence that had led me to this chamber at a time so filled with importance to dejah thoris and myself as this  but how to pass the old man now  the cord almost invisible upon the floor stretched straight across the apartment to a door upon the far side  there was no other way of which i knew nor could i afford to ignore the advice to follow the rope  i must cross this room but however i should accomplish it undetected with that old man in the very center of it baffled me  of course i might have sprung in upon him and with my bare hands silenced him forever but i had heard enough to convince me that with him alive the knowledge that i had gained might serve me at some future moment while should i kill him and another be stationed in his place thurid would not come hither with dejah thoris as was quite evidently his intention  as i stood in the dark shadow of the tunnels end racking my brain for a feasible plan the while i watched catlike the old mans every move he took up the moneypouch and crossed to one end of the apartment where bending to his knees he fumbled with a panel in the wall  instantly i guessed that here was the hiding place in which he hoarded his wealth and while he bent there his back toward me i entered the chamber upon tiptoe and with the utmost stealth essayed to reach the opposite side before he should complete his task and turn again toward the rooms center  scarcely thirty steps all told must i take and yet it seemed to my overwrought imagination that that farther wall was miles away but at last i reached it nor once had i taken my eyes from the back of the old misers head  he did not turn until my hand was upon the button that controlled the door through which my way led and then he turned away from me as i passed through and gently closed the door  for an instant i paused my ear close to the panel to learn if he had suspected aught but as no sound of pursuit came from within i wheeled and made my way along the new corridor following the rope which i coiled and brought with me as i advanced  but a short distance farther on i came to the ropes end at a point where five corridors met  what was i to do  which way should i turn  i was nonplused  a careful examination of the end of the rope revealed the fact that it had been cleanly cut with some sharp instrument  this fact and the words that had cautioned me that danger lay beyond the knots convinced me that the rope had been severed since my friend had placed it as my guide for i had but passed a single knot whereas there had evidently been two or more in the entire length of the cord  now indeed was i in a pretty fix for neither did i know which avenue to follow nor when danger lay directly in my path but there was nothing else to be done than follow one of the corridors for i could gain nothing by remaining where i was  so i chose the central opening and passed on into its gloomy depths with a prayer upon my lips  the floor of the tunnel rose rapidly as i advanced and a moment later the way came to an abrupt end before a heavy door  i could hear nothing beyond and with my accustomed rashness pushed the portal wide to step into a room filled with yellow warriors  the first to see me opened his eyes wide in astonishment and at the same instant i felt the tingling sensation in my finger that denoted the presence of a friend of the ring  then others saw me and there was a concerted rush to lay hands upon me for these were all members of the palace guardmen familiar with my face  the first to reach me was the wearer of the mate to my strange ring and as he came close he whispered  surrender to me then in a loud voice shouted  you are my prisoner white man and menaced me with his two weapons  and so john carter prince of helium meekly surrendered to a single antagonist  the others now swarmed about us asking many questions but i would not talk to them and finally my captor announced that he would lead me back to my cell  an officer ordered several other warriors to accompany him and a moment later we were retracing the way i had just come  my friend walked close beside me asking many silly questions about the country from which i had come until finally his fellows paid no further attention to him or his gabbling  gradually as he spoke he lowered his voice so that presently he was able to converse with me in a low tone without attracting attention  his ruse was a clever one and showed that talu had not misjudged the mans fitness for the dangerous duty upon which he was detailed  when he had fully assured himself that the other guardsmen were not listening he asked me why i had not followed the rope and when i told him that it had ended at the five corridors he said that it must have been cut by someone in need of a piece of rope for he was sure that the stupid kadabrans would never have guessed its purpose  before we had reached the spot from which the five corridors diverge my marentinian friend had managed to drop to the rear of the little column with me and when we came in sight of the branching ways he whispered  run up the first upon the right  it leads to the watchtower upon the south wall  i will direct the pursuit up the next corridor and with that he gave me a great shove into the dark mouth of the tunnel at the same time crying out in simulated pain and alarm as he threw himself upon the floor as though i had felled him with a blow  from behind the voices of the excited guardsmen came reverberating along the corridor suddenly growing fainter as talus spy led them up the wrong passageway in fancied pursuit  as i ran for my life through the dark galleries beneath the palace of salensus oll i must indeed have presented a remarkable appearance had there been any to note it for though death loomed large about me my face was split by a broad grin as i thought of the resourcefulness of the nameless hero of marentina to whom i owed my life  of such stuff are the men of my beloved helium and when i meet another of their kind of whatever race or color my heart goes out to him as it did now to my new friend who had risked his life for me simply because i wore the mate to the ring his ruler had put upon his finger  the corridor along which i ran led almost straight for a considerable distance terminating at the foot of a spiral runway up which i proceeded to emerge presently into a circular chamber upon the first floor of a tower  in this apartment a dozen red slaves were employed polishing or repairing the weapons of the yellow men  the walls of the room were lined with racks in which were hundreds of straight and hooked swords javelins and daggers  it was evidently an armory  there were but three warriors guarding the workers  my eyes took in the entire scene at a glance  here were weapons in plenty  here were sinewy red warriors to wield them  and here now was john carter prince of helium in need both of weapons and warriors  as i stepped into the apartment guards and prisoners saw me simultaneously  close to the entrance where i stood was a rack of straight swords and as my hand closed upon the hilt of one of them my eyes fell upon the faces of two of the prisoners who worked side by side  one of the guards started toward me  who are you he demanded what do you here  i come for tardos mors jeddak of helium and his son mors kajak i cried pointing to the two red prisoners who had now sprung to their feet wideeyed in astonished recognition  rise red men  before we die let us leave a memorial in the palace of okars tyrant that will stand forever in the annals of kadabra to the honor and glory of helium for i had seen that all the prisoners there were men of tardos morss navy  then the first guardsman was upon me and the fight was on but scarce did we engage ere to my horror i saw that the red slaves were shackled to the floor     the magnet switch   the guardsmen paid not the slightest attention to their wards for the red men could not move over two feet from the great rings to which they were padlocked though each had seized a weapon upon which he had been engaged when i entered the room and stood ready to join me could they have but done so  the yellow men devoted all their attention to me nor were they long in discovering that the three of them were none too many to defend the armory against john carter  would that i had had my own good longsword in my hand that day but as it was i rendered a satisfactory account of myself with the unfamiliar weapon of the yellow man  at first i had a time of it dodging their villainous hookswords but after a minute or two i had succeeded in wresting a second straight sword from one of the racks along the wall and thereafter using it to parry the hooks of my antagonists i felt more evenly equipped  the three of them were on me at once and but for a lucky circumstance my end might have come quickly  the foremost guardsman made a vicious lunge for my side with his hook after the three of them had backed me against the wall but as i sidestepped and raised my arm his weapon but grazed my side passing into a rack of javelins where it became entangled  before he could release it i had run him through and then falling back upon the tactics that have saved me a hundred times in tight pinches i rushed the two remaining warriors forcing them back with a perfect torrent of cuts and thrusts weaving my sword in and out about their guards until i had the fear of death upon them  then one of them commenced calling for help but it was too late to save them  they were as putty in my hands now and i backed them about the armory as i would until i had them where i wanted themwithin reach of the swords of the shackled slaves  in an instant both lay dead upon the floor  but their cries had not been entirely fruitless for now i heard answering shouts and the footfalls of many men running and the clank of accouterments and the commands of officers  the door  quick john carter bar the door cried tardos mors  already the guard was in sight charging across the open court that was visible through the doorway  a dozen seconds would bring them into the tower  a single leap carried me to the heavy portal  with a resounding bang i slammed it shut  the bar shouted tardos mors  i tried to slip the huge fastening into place but it defied my every attempt  raise it a little to release the catch cried one of the red men  i could hear the yellow warriors leaping along the flagging just beyond the door  i raised the bar and shot it to the right just as the foremost of the guardsmen threw himself against the opposite side of the massive panels  the barrier heldi had been in time but by the fraction of a second only  now i turned my attention to the prisoners  to tardos mors i went first asking where the keys might be which would unfasten their fetters  the officer of the guard has them replied the jeddak of helium and he is among those without who seek entrance  you will have to force them  most of the prisoners were already hacking at their bonds with the swords in their hands  the yellow men were battering at the door with javelins and axes  i turned my attention to the chains that held tardos mors  again and again i cut deep into the metal with my sharp blade but ever faster and faster fell the torrent of blows upon the portal  at last a link parted beneath my efforts and a moment later tardos mors was free though a few inches of trailing chain still dangled from his ankle  a splinter of wood falling inward from the door announced the headway that our enemies were making toward us  the mighty panels trembled and bent beneath the furious onslaught of the enraged yellow men  what with the battering upon the door and the hacking of the red men at their chains the din within the armory was appalling  no sooner was tardos mors free than he turned his attention to another of the prisoners while i set to work to liberate mors kajak  we must work fast if we would have all those fetters cut before the door gave way  now a panel crashed inward upon the floor and mors kajak sprang to the opening to defend the way until we should have time to release the others  with javelins snatched from the wall he wrought havoc among the foremost of the okarians while we battled with the insensate metal that stood between our fellows and freedom  at length all but one of the prisoners were freed and then the door fell with a mighty crash before a hastily improvised batteringram and the yellow horde was upon us  to the upper chambers shouted the red man who was still fettered to the floor  to the upper chambers  there you may defend the tower against all kadabra  do not delay because of me who could pray for no better death than in the service of tardos mors and the prince of helium  but i would have sacrificed the life of every man of us rather than desert a single red man much less the lionhearted hero who begged us to leave him  cut his chains i cried to two of the red men while the balance of us hold off the foe  there were ten of us now to do battle with the okarian guard and i warrant that that ancient watchtower never looked down upon a more hotly contested battle than took place that day within its own grim walls  the first inrushing wave of yellow warriors recoiled from the slashing blades of ten of heliums veteran fighting men  a dozen okarian corpses blocked the doorway but over the gruesome barrier a score more of their fellows dashed shouting their hoarse and hideous warcry  upon the bloody mound we met them hand to hand stabbing where the quarters were too close to cut thrusting when we could push a foeman to arms length and mingled with the wild cry of the okarian there rose and fell the glorious words  for helium  for helium that for countless ages have spurred on the bravest of the brave to those deeds of valor that have sent the fame of heliums heroes broadcast throughout the length and breadth of a world  now were the fetters struck from the last of the red men and thirteen strong we met each new charge of the soldiers of salensus oll  scarce one of us but bled from a score of wounds yet none had fallen  from without we saw hundreds of guardsmen pouring into the courtyard and along the lower corridor from which i had found my way to the armory we could hear the clank of metal and the shouting of men  in a moment we should be attacked from two sides and with all our prowess we could not hope to withstand the unequal odds which would thus divide our attention and our small numbers  to the upper chambers cried tardos mors and a moment later we fell back toward the runway that led to the floors above  here another bloody battle was waged with the force of yellow men who charged into the armory as we fell back from the doorway  here we lost our first man a noble fellow whom we could ill spare but at length all had backed into the runway except myself who remained to hold back the okarians until the others were safe above  in the mouth of the narrow spiral but a single warrior could attack me at a time so that i had little difficulty in holding them all back for the brief moment that was necessary  then backing slowly before them i commenced the ascent of the spiral  all the long way to the towers top the guardsmen pressed me closely when one went down before my sword another scrambled over the dead man to take his place and thus taking an awful toll with each few feet gained i came to the spacious glasswalled watchtower of kadabra  here my companions clustered ready to take my place and for a moments respite i stepped to one side while they held the enemy off  from the lofty perch a view could be had for miles in every direction toward the south stretched the rugged iceclad waste to the edge of the mighty barrier  toward the east and west and dimly toward the north i descried other okarian cities while in the immediate foreground just beyond the walls of kadabra the grim guardian shaft reared its somber head  then i cast my eyes down into the streets of kadabra from which a sudden tumult had arisen and there i saw a battle raging and beyond the citys walls i saw armed men marching in great columns toward a nearby gate  eagerly i pressed forward against the glass wall of the observatory scarce daring to credit the testimony of my own  eyes  but at last i could doubt no longer and with a shout of joy that rose strangely in the midst of the cursing and groaning of the battling men at the entrance to the chamber i called to tardos mors  as he joined me i pointed down into the streets of kadabra and to the advancing columns beyond above which floated bravely in the arctic air the flags and banners of helium  an instant later every red man in the lofty chamber had seen the inspiring sight and such a shout of thanksgiving arose as i warrant never before echoed through that ageold pile of stone  but still we must fight on for though our troops had entered kadabra the city was yet far from capitulation nor had the palace been even assaulted  turn and turn about we held the top of the runway while the others feasted their eyes upon the sight of our valiant countrymen battling far beneath us  now they have rushed the palace gate  great batteringrams are dashed against its formidable surface  now they are repulsed by a deadly shower of javelins from the walls top  once again they charge but a sortie by a large force of okarians from an intersecting avenue crumples the head of the column and the men of helium go down fighting beneath an overwhelming force  the palace gate flies open and a force of the jeddaks own guard picked men from the flower of the okarian army sallies forth to shatter the broken regiments  for a moment it looks as though nothing could avert defeat and then i see a noble figure upon a mighty thoatnot the tiny thoat of the red man but one of his huge cousins of the dead sea bottoms  the warrior hews his way to the front and behind him rally the disorganized soldiers of helium  as he raises his head aloft to fling a challenge at the men upon the palace walls i see his face and my heart swells in pride and happiness as the red warriors leap to the side of their leader and win back the ground that they had but just lostthe face of him upon the mighty thoat is the face of my soncarthoris of helium  at his side fights a huge martian warhound nor did i need a second look to know that it was woolamy faithful woola who had thus well performed his arduous task and brought the succoring legions in the nick of time  in the nick of time  who yet might say that they were not too late to save but surely they could avenge  and such retribution as that unconquered army would deal out to the hateful okarians  i sighed to think that i might not be alive to witness it  again i turned to the windows  the red men had not yet forced the outer palace wall but they were fighting nobly against the best that okar affordedvaliant warriors who contested every inch of the way  now my attention was caught by a new element without the city walla great body of mounted warriors looming large above the red men they were the huge green allies of heliumthe savage hordes from the dead sea bottoms of the far south  in grim and terrible silence they sped on toward the gate the padded hoofs of their frightful mounts giving forth no sound  into the doomed city they charged and as they wheeled across the wide plaza before the palace of the jeddak of jeddaks i saw riding at their head the mighty figure of their mighty leadertars tarkas jeddak of thark  my wish then was to be gratified for i was to see my old friend battling once again and though not shoulder to shoulder with him i too would be fighting in the same cause here in the high tower of okar  nor did it seem that our foes would ever cease their stubborn attacks for still they came though the way to our chamber was often clogged with the bodies of their dead  at times they would pause long enough to drag back the impeding corpses and then fresh warriors would forge upward to taste the cup of death  i had been taking my turn with the others in defending the approach to our lofty retreat when mors kajak who had been watching the battle in the street below called aloud in sudden excitement there was a note of apprehension in his voice that brought me to his side the instant that i could turn my place over to another and as i reached him he pointed far out across the waste of snow and ice toward the southern horizon  alas he cried that i should be forced to witness cruel fate betray them without power to warn or aid but they be past either now  as i looked in the direction he indicated i saw the cause of his perturbation  a mighty fleet of fliers was approaching majestically toward kadabra from the direction of the icebarrier  on and on they came with ever increasing velocity  the grim shaft that they call the guardian of the north is beckoning to them said mors kajak sadly just as it beckoned to tardos mors and his great fleet see where they lie crumpled and broken a grim and terrible monument to the mighty force of destruction which naught can resist  i too saw but something else i saw that mors kajak did not in my minds eye i saw a buried chamber whose walls were lined with strange instruments and devices  in the center of the chamber was a long table and before it sat a little popeyed old man counting his money but plainest of all i saw upon the wall a great switch with a small magnet inlaid within the surface of its black handle  then i glanced out at the fastapproaching fleet  in five minutes that mighty armada of the skies would be bent and worthless scrap lying at the base of the shaft beyond the citys wall and yellow hordes would be loosed from another gate to rush out upon the few survivors stumbling blindly down through the mass of wreckage then the apts would come  i shuddered at the thought for i could vividly picture the whole horrible scene  quick have i always been to decide and act  the impulse that moves me and the doing of the thing seem simultaneous for if my mind goes through the tedious formality of reasoning it must be a subconscious act of which i am not objectively aware  psychologists tell me that as the subconscious does not reason too close a scrutiny of my mental activities might prove anything but flattering but be that as it may i have often won success while the thinker would have been still at the endless task of comparing various judgments  and now celerity of action was the prime essential to the success of the thing that i had decided upon  grasping my sword more firmly in my hand i called to the red man at the opening to the runway to stand aside  way for the prince of helium i shouted and before the astonished yellow man whose misfortune it was to be at the fighting end of the line at that particular moment could gather his wits together my sword had decapitated him and i was rushing like a mad bull down upon those behind him  way for the prince of helium i shouted as i cut a path through the astonished guardsmen of salensus oll  hewing to right and left i beat my way down that warriorchoked spiral until near the bottom those below thinking that an army was descending upon them turned and fled  the armory at the first floor was vacant when i entered it the last of the okarians having fled into the courtyard so none saw me continue down the spiral toward the corridor beneath  here i ran as rapidly as my legs would carry me toward the five corners and there plunged into the passageway that led to the station of the old miser  without the formality of a knock i burst into the room  there sat the old man at his table but as he saw me he sprang to his feet drawing his sword  with scarce more than a glance toward him i leaped for the great switch but quick as i was that wiry old fellow was there before me  how he did it i shall never know nor does it seem credible that any martianborn creature could approximate the marvelous speed of my earthly muscles  like a tiger he turned upon me and i was quick to see why solan had been chosen for this important duty  never in all my life have i seen such wondrous swordsmanship and such uncanny agility as that ancient bag of bones displayed  he was in forty places at the same time and before i had half a chance to awaken to my danger he was like to have made a monkey of me and a dead monkey at that  it is strange how new and unexpected conditions bring out unguessed ability to meet them  that day in the buried chamber beneath the palace of salensus oll i learned what swordsmanship meant and to what heights of sword mastery i could achieve when pitted against such a wizard of the blade as solan  for a time he liked to have bested me but presently the latent possibilities that must have been lying dormant within me for a lifetime came to the fore and i fought as i had never dreamed a human being could fight  that that duelroyal should have taken place in the dark recesses of a cellar without a single appreciative eye to witness it has always seemed to me almost a world calamityat least from the viewpoint barsoomian where bloody strife is the first and greatest consideration of individuals nations and races  i was fighting to reach the switch solan to prevent me and though we stood not three feet from it i could not win an inch toward it for he forced me back an inch for the first five minutes of our battle  i knew that if i were to throw it in time to save the oncoming fleet it must be done in the next few seconds and so i tried my old rushing tactics but i might as well have rushed a brick wall for all that solan gave way  in fact i came near to impaling myself upon his point for my pains but right was on my side and i think that that must give a man greater confidence than though he knew himself to be battling in a wicked cause  at least i did not want in confidence and when i next rushed solan it was to one side with implicit confidence that he must turn to meet my new line of attack and turn he did so that now we fought with our sides towards the coveted goalthe great switch stood within my reach upon my right hand  to uncover my breast for an instant would have been to court sudden death but i saw no other way than to chance it if by so doing i might rescue that oncoming succoring fleet and so in the face of a wicked swordthrust i reached out my point and caught the great switch a sudden blow that released it from its seating  so surprised and horrified was solan that he forgot to finish his thrust instead he wheeled toward the switch with a loud shrieka shriek which was his last for before his hand could touch the lever it sought my swords point had passed through his heart     the tide of battle   but solans last loud cry had not been without effect for a moment later a dozen guardsmen burst into the chamber though not before i had so bent and demolished the great switch that it could not be again used to turn the powerful current into the mighty magnet of destruction it controlled  the result of the sudden coming of the guardsmen had been to compel me to seek seclusion in the first passageway that i could find and that to my disappointment proved to be not the one with which i was familiar but another upon its left  they must have either heard or guessed which way i went for i had proceeded but a short distance when i heard the sound of pursuit i had no mind to stop and fight these men here when there was fighting aplenty elsewhere in the city of kadabrafighting that could be of much more avail to me and mine than useless lifetaking far below the palace  but the fellows were pressing me and as i did not know the way at all i soon saw that they would overtake me unless i found a place to conceal myself until they had passed which would then give me an opportunity to return the way i had come and regain the tower or possibly find a way to reach the city streets  the passageway had risen rapidly since leaving the apartment of the switch and now ran level and well lighted straight into the distance as far as i could see  the moment that my pursuers reached this straight stretch i would be in plain sight of them with no chance to escape from the corridor undetected  presently i saw a series of doors opening from either side of the corridor and as they all looked alike to me i tried the first one that i reached  it opened into a small chamber luxuriously furnished and was evidently an antechamber off some office or audience chamber of the palace  on the far side was a heavily curtained doorway beyond which i heard the hum of voices  instantly i crossed the small chamber and parting the curtains looked within the larger apartment  before me were a party of perhaps fifty gorgeously clad nobles of the court standing before a throne upon which sat salensus oll the jeddak of jeddaks was addressing them  the allotted hour has come he was saying as i entered the apartment and though the enemies of okar be within her gates naught may stay the will of salensus oll  the great ceremony must be omitted that no single man may be kept from his place in the defenses other than the fifty that custom demands shall witness the creation of a new queen in okar  in a moment the thing shall have been done and we may return to the battle while she who is now the princess of helium looks down from the queens tower upon the annihilation of her former countrymen and witnesses the greatness which is her husbands  then turning to a courtier he issued some command in a low voice  the addressed hastened to a small door at the far end of the chamber and swinging it wide cried  way for dejah thoris future queen of okar  immediately two guardsmen appeared dragging the unwilling bride toward the altar  her hands were still manacled behind her evidently to prevent suicide  her disheveled hair and panting bosom betokened that chained though she was still had she fought against the thing that they would do to her  at sight of her salensus oll rose and drew his sword and the sword of each of the fifty nobles was raised on high to form an arch beneath which the poor beautiful creature was dragged toward her doom  a grim smile forced itself to my lips as i thought of the rude awakening that lay in store for the ruler of okar and my itching fingers fondled the hilt of my bloody sword  as i watched the procession that moved slowly toward the thronea procession which consisted of but a handful of priests who followed dejah thoris and the two guardsmeni caught a fleeting glimpse of a black face peering from behind the draperies that covered the wall back of the dais upon which stood salensus oll awaiting his bride  now the guardsmen were forcing the princess of helium up the few steps to the side of the tyrant of okar and i had no eyes and no thoughts for aught else  a priest opened a book and raising his hand commenced to drone out a singsong ritual  salensus oll reached for the hand of his bride  i had intended waiting until some circumstance should give me a reasonable hope of success for even though the entire ceremony should be completed there could be no valid marriage while i lived  what i was most concerned in of course was the rescuing of dejah thorisi wished to take her from the palace of salensus oll if such a thing were possible but whether it were accomplished before or after the mock marriage was a matter of secondary import  when however i saw the vile hand of salensus oll reach out for the hand of my beloved princess i could restrain myself no longer and before the nobles of okar knew that aught had happened i had leaped through their thin line and was upon the dais beside dejah thoris and salensus oll  with the flat of my sword i struck down his polluting hand and grasping dejah thoris round the waist i swung her behind me as with my back against the draperies of the dais i faced the tyrant of the north and his roomful of noble warriors  the jeddak of jeddaks was a great mountain of a mana coarse brutal beast of a manand as he towered above me there his fierce black whiskers and mustache bristling in rage i can well imagine that a less seasoned warrior might have trembled before him  with a snarl he sprang toward me with naked sword but whether salensus oll was a good swordsman or a poor i never learned for with dejah thoris at my back i was no longer humani was a superman and no man could have withstood me then  with a single low  for the princess of helium i ran my blade straight through the rotten heart of okars rotten ruler and before the white drawn faces of his nobles salensus oll rolled grinning in horrible death to the foot of the steps below his marriage throne  for a moment tense silence reigned in the nuptialroom  then the fifty nobles rushed upon me  furiously we fought but the advantage was mine for i stood upon a raised platform above them and i fought for the most glorious woman of a glorious race and i fought for a great love and for the mother of my boy  and from behind my shoulder in the silvery cadence of that dear voice rose the brave battle anthem of helium which the nations women sing as their men march out to victory  that alone was enough to inspire me to victory over even greater odds and i verily believe that i should have bested the entire roomful of yellow warriors that day in the nuptial chamber of the palace at kadabra had not interruption come to my aid  fast and furious was the fighting as the nobles of salensus oll sprang time and again up the steps before the throne only to fall back before a sword hand that seemed to have gained a new wizardry from its experience with the cunning solan  two were pressing me so closely that i could not turn when i heard a movement behind me and noted that the sound of the battle anthem had ceased  was dejah thoris preparing to take her place beside me  heroic daughter of a heroic world  it would not be unlike her to have seized a sword and fought at my side for though the women of mars are not trained in the arts of war the spirit is theirs and they have been known to do that very thing upon countless occasions  but she did not come and glad i was for it would have doubled my burden in protecting her before i should have been able to force her back again out of harms way  she must be contemplating some cunning strategy i thought and so i fought on secure in the belief that my divine princess stood close behind me  for half an hour at least i must have fought there against the nobles of okar ere ever a one placed a foot upon the dais where i stood and then of a sudden all that remained of them formed below me for a last mad desperate charge but even as they advanced the door at the far end of the chamber swung wide and a wildeyed messenger sprang into the room  the jeddak of jeddaks he cried  where is the jeddak of jeddaks the city has fallen before the hordes from beyond the barrier and but now the great gate of the palace itself has been forced and the warriors of the south are pouring into its sacred precincts  where is salensus oll  he alone may revive the flagging courage of our warriors  he alone may save the day for okar  where is salensus oll  the nobles stepped back from about the dead body of their ruler and one of them pointed to the grinning corpse  the messenger staggered back in horror as though from a blow in the face  then fly nobles of okar he cried for naught can save you hark  they come  as he spoke we heard the deep roar of angry men from the corridor without and the clank of metal and the clang of swords  without another glance toward me who had stood a spectator of the tragic scene the nobles wheeled and fled from the apartment through another exit  almost immediately a force of yellow warriors appeared in the doorway through which the messenger had come  they were backing toward the apartment stubbornly resisting the advance of a handful of red men who faced them and forced them slowly but inevitably back  above the heads of the contestants i could see from my elevated station upon the dais the face of my old friend kantos kan  he was leading the little party that had won its way into the very heart of the palace of salensus oll  in an instant i saw that by attacking the okarians from the rear i could so quickly disorganize them that their further resistance would be shortlived and with this idea in mind i sprang from the dais casting a word of explanation to dejah thoris over my shoulder though i did not turn to look at her  with myself ever between her enemies and herself and with kantos kan and his warriors winning to the apartment there could be no danger to dejah thoris standing there alone beside the throne  i wanted the men of helium to see me and to know that their beloved princess was here too for i knew that this knowledge would inspire them to even greater deeds of valor than they had performed in the past though great indeed must have been those which won for them a way into the almost impregnable palace of the tyrant of the north  as i crossed the chamber to attack the kadabrans from the rear a small doorway at my left opened and to my surprise revealed the figures of matai shang father of therns and phaidor his daughter peering into the room  a quick glance about they took  their eyes rested for a moment wide in horror upon the dead body of salensus oll upon the blood that crimsoned the floor upon the corpses of the nobles who had fallen thick before the throne upon me and upon the battling warriors at the other door  they did not essay to enter the apartment but scanned its every corner from where they stood and then when their eyes had sought its entire area a look of fierce rage overspread the features of matai shang and a cold and cunning smile touched the lips of phaidor  then they were gone but not before a taunting laugh was thrown directly in my face by the woman  i did not understand then the meaning of matai shangs rage or phaidors pleasure but i knew that neither boded good for me  a moment later i was upon the backs of the yellow men and as the red men of helium saw me above the shoulders of their antagonists a great shout rang through the corridor and for a moment drowned the noise of battle  for the prince of helium they cried  for the prince of helium and like hungry lions upon their prey they fell once more upon the weakening warriors of the north  the yellow men cornered between two enemies fought with the desperation that utter hopelessness often induces  fought as i should have fought had i been in their stead with the determination to take as many of my enemies with me when i died as lay within the power of my sword arm  it was a glorious battle but the end seemed inevitable when presently from down the corridor behind the red men came a great body of reenforcing yellow warriors  now were the tables turned and it was the men of helium who seemed doomed to be ground between two millstones  all were compelled to turn to meet this new assault by a greatly superior force so that to me was left the remnants of the yellow men within the throneroom  they kept me busy too so busy that i began to wonder if indeed i should ever be done with them  slowly they pressed me back into the room and when they had all passed in after me one of them closed and bolted the door effectually barring the way against the men of kantos kan  it was a clever move for it put me at the mercy of a dozen men within a chamber from which assistance was locked out and it gave the red men in the corridor beyond no avenue of escape should their new antagonists press them too closely  but i have faced heavier odds myself than were pitted against me that day and i knew that kantos kan had battled his way from a hundred more dangerous traps than that in which he now was  so it was with no feelings of despair that i turned my attention to the business of the moment  constantly my thoughts reverted to dejah thoris and i longed for the moment when the fighting done i could fold her in my arms and hear once more the words of love which had been denied me for so many years  during the fighting in the chamber i had not even a single chance to so much as steal a glance at her where she stood behind me beside the throne of the dead ruler  i wondered why she no longer urged me on with the strains of the martial hymn of helium but i did not need more than the knowledge that i was battling for her to bring out the best that is in me  it would be wearisome to narrate the details of that bloody struggle of how we fought from the doorway the full length of the room to the very foot of the throne before the last of my antagonists fell with my blade piercing his heart  and then with a glad cry i turned with outstretched arms to seize my princess and as my lips smothered hers to reap the reward that would be thrice ample payment for the bloody encounters through which i had passed for her dear sake from the south pole to the north  the glad cry died frozen upon my lips my arms dropped limp and lifeless to my sides as one who reels beneath the burden of a mortal wound i staggered up the steps before the throne  dejah thoris was gone     rewards   with the realization that dejah thoris was no longer within the throneroom came the belated recollection of the dark face that i had glimpsed peering from behind the draperies that backed the throne of salensus oll at the moment that i had first come so unexpectedly upon the strange scene being enacted within the chamber  why had the sight of that evil countenance not warned me to greater caution  why had i permitted the rapid development of new situations to efface the recollection of that menacing danger  but alas vain regret would not erase the calamity that had befallen  once again had dejah thoris fallen into the clutches of that archfiend thurid the black dator of the first born  again was all my arduous labor gone for naught  now i realized the cause of the rage that had been writ so large upon the features of matai shang and the cruel pleasure that i had seen upon the face of phaidor  they had known or guessed the truth and the hekkador of the holy therns who had evidently come to the chamber in the hope of thwarting salensus oll in his contemplated perfidy against the high priest who coveted dejah thoris for himself realized that thurid had stolen the prize from beneath his very nose  phaidors pleasure had been due to her realization of what this last cruel blow would mean to me as well as to a partial satisfaction of her jealous hatred for the princess of helium  my first thought was to look beyond the draperies at the back of the throne for there it was that i had seen thurid  with a single jerk i tore the priceless stuff from its fastenings and there before me was revealed a narrow doorway behind the throne  no question entered my mind but that here lay the opening of the avenue of escape which thurid had followed and had there been it would have been dissipated by the sight of a tiny jeweled ornament which lay a few steps within the corridor beyond  as i snatched up the bauble i saw that it bore the device of the princess of helium and then pressing it to my lips i dashed madly along the winding way that led gently downward toward the lower galleries of the palace  i had followed but a short distance when i came upon the room in which solan formerly had held sway  his dead body still lay where i had left it nor was there any sign that another had passed through the room since i had been there but i knew that two had done sothurid the black dator and dejah thoris  for a moment i paused uncertain as to which of the several exits from the apartment would lead me upon the right path  i tried to recollect the directions which i had heard thurid repeat to solan and at last slowly as though through a heavy fog the memory of the words of the first born came to me  follow a corridor passing three diverging corridors upon the right then into the fourth righthand corridor to where three corridors meet here again follow to the right hugging the left wall closely to avoid the pit  at the end of this corridor i shall come to a spiral runway which i must follow down instead of up after that the way is along but a single branchless corridor  and i recalled the exit at which he had pointed as he spoke  it did not take me long to start upon that unknown way nor did i go with caution although i knew that there might be grave dangers before me  part of the way was black as sin but for the most it was fairly well lighted  the stretch where i must hug the left wall to avoid the pits was darkest of them all and i was nearly over the edge of the abyss before i knew that i was near the danger spot  a narrow ledge scarce a foot wide was all that had been left to carry the initiated past that frightful cavity into which the unknowing must surely have toppled at the first step  but at last i had won safely beyond it and then a feeble light made the balance of the way plain until at the end of the last corridor i came suddenly out into the glare of day upon a field of snow and ice  clad for the warm atmosphere of the hothouse city of kadabra the sudden change to arctic frigidity was anything but pleasant but the worst of it was that i knew i could not endure the bitter cold almost naked as i was and that i would perish before ever i could overtake thurid and dejah thoris  to be thus blocked by nature who had had all the arts and wiles of cunning man pitted against him seemed a cruel fate and as i staggered back into the warmth of the tunnels end i was as near hopelessness as i ever have been  i had by no means given up my intention of continuing the pursuit for if needs be i would go ahead though i perished ere ever i reached my goal but if there were a safer way it were well worth the delay to attempt to discover it that i might come again to the side of dejah thoris in fit condition to do battle for her  scarce had i returned to the tunnel than i stumbled over a portion of a fur garment that seemed fastened to the floor of the corridor close to the wall  in the darkness i could not see what held it but by groping with my hands i discovered that it was wedged beneath the bottom of a closed door  pushing the portal aside i found myself upon the threshold of a small chamber the walls of which were lined with hooks from which depended suits of the complete outdoor apparel of the yellow men  situated as it was at the mouth of a tunnel leading from the palace it was quite evident that this was the dressingroom used by the nobles leaving and entering the hothouse city and that thurid having knowledge of it had stopped here to outfit himself and dejah thoris before venturing into the bitter cold of the arctic world beyond  in his haste he had dropped several garments upon the floor and the telltale fur that had fallen partly within the corridor had proved the means of guiding me to the very spot he would least have wished me to have knowledge of  it required but the matter of a few seconds to don the necessary orlukskin clothing with the heavy furlined boots that are so essential a part of the garmenture of one who would successfully contend with the frozen trails and the icy winds of the bleak northland  once more i stepped beyond the tunnels mouth to find the fresh tracks of thurid and dejah thoris in the newfallen snow  now at last was my task an easy one for though the going was rough in the extreme i was no longer vexed by doubts as to the direction i should follow or harassed by darkness or hidden dangers  through a snowcovered canyon the way led up toward the summit of low hills  beyond these it dipped again into another canyon only to rise a quartermile farther on toward a pass which skirted the flank of a rocky hill  i could see by the signs of those who had gone before that when dejah thoris had walked she had been continually holding back and that the black man had been compelled to drag her  for other stretches only his footprints were visible deep and close together in the heavy snow and i knew from these signs that then he had been forced to carry her and i could well imagine that she had fought him fiercely every step of the way  as i came round the jutting promontory of the hills shoulder i saw that which quickened my pulses and set my heart to beating high for within a tiny basin between the crest of this hill and the next stood four people before the mouth of a great cave and beside them upon the gleaming snow rested a flier which had evidently but just been dragged from its hiding place  the four were dejah thoris phaidor thurid and matai shang  the two men were engaged in a heated argumentthe father of therns threatening while the black scoffed at him as he went about the work at which he was engaged  as i crept toward them cautiously that i might come as near as possible before being discovered i saw that finally the men appeared to have reached some sort of a compromise for with phaidors assistance they both set about dragging the resisting dejah thoris to the fliers deck  here they made her fast and then both again descended to the ground to complete the preparations for departure  phaidor entered the small cabin upon the vessels deck  i had come to within a quarter of a mile of them when matai shang espied me  i saw him seize thurid by the shoulder wheeling him around in my direction as he pointed to where i was now plainly visible for the moment that i knew i had been perceived i cast aside every attempt at stealth and broke into a mad race for the flier  the two redoubled their efforts at the propeller at which they were working and which very evidently was being replaced after having been removed for some purpose of repair  they had the thing completed before i had covered half the distance that lay between me and them and then both made a rush for the boardingladder  thurid was the first to reach it and with the agility of a monkey clambered swiftly to the boats deck where a touch of the button controlling the buoyancy tanks sent the craft slowly upward though not with the speed that marks the wellconditioned flier  i was still some hundred yards away as i saw them rising from my grasp  back by the city of kadabra lay a great fleet of mighty fliersthe ships of helium and ptarth that i had saved from destruction earlier in the day but before ever i could reach them thurid could easily make good his escape  as i ran i saw matai shang clambering up the swaying swinging ladder toward the deck while above him leaned the evil face of the first born  a trailing rope from the vessels stern put new hope in me for if i could but reach it before it whipped too high above my head there was yet a chance to gain the deck by its slender aid  that there was something radically wrong with the flier was evident from its lack of buoyancy and the further fact that though thurid had turned twice to the starting lever the boat still hung motionless in the air except for a slight drifting with a low breeze from the north  now matai shang was close to the gunwale  a long clawlike hand was reaching up to grasp the metal rail  thurid leaned farther down toward his coconspirator  suddenly a raised dagger gleamed in the upflung hand of the black down it drove toward the white face of the father of therns  with a loud shriek of fear the holy hekkador grasped frantically at that menacing arm  i was almost to the trailing rope by now  the craft was still rising slowly the while it drifted from me  then i stumbled on the icy way striking my head upon a rock as i fell sprawling but an arms length from the rope the end of which was now just leaving the ground  with the blow upon my head came unconsciousness  it could not have been more than a few seconds that i lay senseless there upon the northern ice while all that was dearest to me drifted farther from my reach in the clutches of that black fiend for when i opened my eyes thurid and matai shang yet battled at the ladders top and the flier drifted but a hundred yards farther to the southbut the end of the trailing rope was now a good thirty feet above the ground  goaded to madness by the cruel misfortune that had tripped me when success was almost within my grasp i tore frantically across the intervening space and just beneath the ropes dangling end i put my earthly muscles to the supreme test  with a mighty catlike bound i sprang upward toward that slender strandthe only avenue which yet remained that could carry me to my vanishing love  a foot above its lowest end my fingers closed  tightly as i clung i felt the rope slipping slipping through my grasp  i tried to raise my free hand to take a second hold above my first but the change of position that resulted caused me to slip more rapidly toward the end of the rope  slowly i felt the tantalizing thing escaping me  in a moment all that i had gained would be lostthen my fingers reached a knot at the very end of the rope and slipped no more  with a prayer of gratitude upon my lips i scrambled upward toward the boats deck  i could not see thurid and matai shang now but i heard the sounds of conflict and thus knew that they still foughtthe thern for his life and the black for the increased buoyancy that relief from the weight of even a single body would give the craft  should matai shang die before i reached the deck my chances of ever reaching it would be slender indeed for the black dator need but cut the rope above me to be freed from me forever for the vessel had drifted across the brink of a chasm into whose yawning depths my body would drop to be crushed to a shapeless pulp should thurid reach the rope now  at last my hand closed upon the ships rail and that very instant a horrid shriek rang out below me that sent my blood cold and turned my horrified eyes downward to a shrieking hurtling twisting thing that shot downward into the awful chasm beneath me  it was matai shang holy hekkador father of therns gone to his last accounting  then my head came above the deck and i saw thurid dagger in hand leaping toward me  he was opposite the forward end of the cabin while i was attempting to clamber aboard near the vessels stern but a few paces lay between us  no power on earth could raise me to that deck before the infuriated black would be upon me  my end had come  i knew it but had there been a doubt in my mind the nasty leer of triumph upon that wicked face would have convinced me  beyond thurid i could see my dejah thoris wideeyed and horrified struggling at her bonds  that she should be forced to witness my awful death made my bitter fate seem doubly cruel  i ceased my efforts to climb across the gunwale  instead i took a firm grasp upon the rail with my left hand and drew my dagger  i should at least die as i had livedfighting  as thurid came opposite the cabins doorway a new element projected itself into the grim tragedy of the air that was being enacted upon the deck of matai shangs disabled flier  it was phaidor  with flushed face and disheveled hair and eyes that betrayed the recent presence of mortal tearsabove which this proud goddess had always held herselfshe leaped to the deck directly before me  in her hand was a long slim dagger  i cast a last look upon my beloved princess smiling as men should who are about to die then i turned my face up toward phaidorwaiting for the blow  never have i seen that beautiful face more beautiful than it was at that moment  it seemed incredible that one so lovely could yet harbor within her fair bosom a heart so cruel and relentless and today there was a new expression in her wondrous eyes that i never before had seen therean unfamiliar softness and a look of suffering  thurid was beside her nowpushing past to reach me first and then what happened happened so quickly that it was all over before i could realize the truth of it  phaidors slim hand shot out to close upon the blacks dagger wrist her right hand went high with its gleaming blade  that for matai shang she cried and she buried her blade deep in the dators breast  that for the wrong you would have done dejah thoris and again the sharp steel sank into the bloody flesh  and that and that and that she shrieked for john carter prince of helium and with each word her sharp point pierced the vile heart of the great villain  then with a vindictive shove she cast the carcass of the first born from the deck to fall in awful silence after the body of his victim  i had been so paralyzed by surprise that i had made no move to reach the deck during the aweinspiring scene which i had just witnessed and now i was to be still further amazed by her next act for phaidor extended her hand to me and assisted me to the deck where i stood gazing at her in unconcealed and stupefied wonderment  a wan smile touched her lipsit was not the cruel and haughty smile of the goddess with which i was familiar  you wonder john carter she said what strange thing has wrought this change in me  i will tell you  it is lovelove of you and when i darkened my brows in disapproval of her words she raised an appealing hand  wait she said  it is a different love from mineit is the love of your princess dejah thoris for you that has taught me what true love may bewhat it should be and how far from real love was my selfish and jealous passion for you  now i am different  now could i love as dejah thoris loves and so my only happiness can be to know that you and she are once more united for in her alone can you find true happiness  but i am unhappy because of the wickedness that i have wrought  i have many sins to expiate and though i be deathless life is all too short for the atonement  but there is another way and if phaidor daughter of the holy hekkador of the holy therns has sinned she has this day already made partial reparation and lest you doubt the sincerity of her protestations and her avowal of a new love that embraces dejah thoris also she will prove her sincerity in the only way that lies openhaving saved you for another phaidor leaves you to her embraces  with her last word she turned and leaped from the vessels deck into the abyss below  with a cry of horror i sprang forward in a vain attempt to save the life that for two years i would so gladly have seen extinguished i was too late  with teardimmed eyes i turned away that i might not see the awful sight beneath  a moment later i had struck the bonds from dejah thoris and as her dear arms went about my neck and her perfect lips pressed to mine i forgot the horrors that i had witnessed and the suffering that i had endured in the rapture of my reward     the new ruler   the flier upon whose deck dejah thoris and i found ourselves after twelve long years of separation proved entirely useless  her buoyancy tanks leaked badly  her engine would not start  we were helpless there in mid air above the arctic ice  the craft had drifted across the chasm which held the corpses of matai shang thurid and phaidor and now hung above a low hill opening the buoyancy escape valves i permitted her to come slowly to the ground and as she touched dejah thoris and i stepped from her deck and hand in hand turned back across the frozen waste toward the city of kadabra  through the tunnel that had led me in pursuit of them we passed walking slowly for we had much to say to each other  she told me of that last terrible moment months before when the door of her prison cell within the temple of the sun was slowly closing between us  of how phaidor had sprung upon her with uplifted dagger and of thuvias shriek as she had realized the foul intention of the thern goddess  it had been that cry that had rung in my ears all the long weary months that i had been left in cruel doubt as to my princess fate for i had not known that thuvia had wrested the blade from the daughter of matai shang before it had touched either dejah thoris or herself  she told me too of the awful eternity of her imprisonment  of the cruel hatred of phaidor and the tender love of thuvia and of how even when despair was the darkest those two red girls had clung to the same hope and beliefthat john carter would find a way to release them  presently we came to the chamber of solan  i had been proceeding without thought of caution for i was sure that the city and the palace were both in the hands of my friends by this time  and so it was that i bolted into the chamber full into the midst of a dozen nobles of the court of salensus oll  they were passing through on their way to the outside world along the corridors we had just traversed  at sight of us they halted in their tracks and then an ugly smile overspread the features of their leader  the author of all our misfortunes he cried pointing at me  we shall have the satisfaction of a partial vengeance at least when we leave behind us here the dead and mutilated corpses of the prince and princess of helium  when they find them he went on jerking his thumb upward toward the palace above they will realize that the vengeance of the yellow man costs his enemies dear  prepare to die john carter but that your end may be the more bitter know that i may change my intention as to meting a merciful death to your princesspossibly she shall be preserved as a plaything for my nobles  i stood close to the instrumentcovered walldejah thoris at my side  she looked up at me wonderingly as the warriors advanced upon us with drawn swords for mine still hung within its scabbard at my side and there was a smile upon my lips  the yellow nobles too looked in surprise and then as i made no move to draw they hesitated fearing a ruse but their leader urged them on  when they had come almost within swords reach of me i raised my hand and laid it upon the polished surface of a great lever and then still smiling grimly i looked my enemies full in the face  as one they came to a sudden stop casting affrighted glances at me and at one another  stop shrieked their leader  you dream not what you do  right you are i replied  john carter does not dream  he knowsknows that should one of you take another step toward dejah thoris princess of helium i pull this lever wide and she and i shall die together but we shall not die alone  the nobles shrank back whispering together for a few moments  at last their leader turned to me  go your way john carter he said and we shall go ours  prisoners do not go their own way i answered and you are prisonersprisoners of the prince of helium  before they could make answer a door upon the opposite side of the apartment opened and a score of yellow men poured into the apartment for an instant the nobles looked relieved and then as their eyes fell upon the leader of the new party their faces fell for he was talu rebel prince of marentina and they knew that they could look for neither aid nor mercy at his hands  well done john carter he cried  you turn their own mighty power against them  fortunate for okar is it that you were here to prevent their escape for these be the greatest villains north of the icebarrier and this onepointing to the leader of the partywould have made himself jeddak of jeddaks in the place of the dead salensus oll  then indeed would we have had a more villainous ruler than the hated tyrant who fell before your sword  the okarian nobles now submitted to arrest since nothing but death faced them should they resist and escorted by the warriors of talu we made our way to the great audience chamber that had been salensus olls  here was a vast concourse of warriors  red men from helium and ptarth yellow men of the north rubbing elbows with the blacks of the first born who had come under my friend xodar to help in the search for me and my princess  there were savage green warriors from the dead sea bottoms of the south and a handful of whiteskinned therns who had renounced their religion and sworn allegiance to xodar  there was tardos mors and mors kajak and tall and mighty in his gorgeous warrior trappings carthoris my son  these three fell upon dejah thoris as we entered the apartment and though the lives and training of royal martians tend not toward vulgar demonstration i thought that they would suffocate her with their embraces  and there were tars tarkas jeddak of thark and kantos kan my oldtime friends and leaping and tearing at my harness in the exuberance of his great love was dear old woolafrantic mad with happiness  long and loud was the cheering that burst forth at sight of us deafening was the din of ringing metal as the veteran warriors of every martian clime clashed their blades together on high in token of success and victory but as i passed among the throng of saluting nobles and warriors jeds and jeddaks my heart still was heavy for there were two faces missing that i would have given much to have seen therethuvan dihn and thuvia of ptarth were not to be found in the great chamber  i made inquiries concerning them among men of every nation and at last from one of the yellow prisoners of war i learned that they had been apprehended by an officer of the palace as they sought to reach the pit of plenty while i lay imprisoned there  i did not need to ask to know what had sent them thitherthe courageous jeddak and his loyal daughter  my informer said that they lay now in one of the many buried dungeons of the palace where they had been placed pending a decision as to their fate by the tyrant of the north  a moment later searching parties were scouring the ancient pile in search of them and my cup of happiness was full when i saw them being escorted into the room by a cheering guard of honor  thuvias first act was to rush to the side of dejah thoris and i needed no better proof of the love these two bore for each other than the sincerity with which they embraced  looking down upon that crowded chamber stood the silent and empty throne of okar  of all the strange scenes it must have witnessed since that longdead age that had first seen a jeddak of jeddaks take his seat upon it none might compare with that upon which it now looked down and as i pondered the past and future of that longburied race of blackbearded yellow men i thought that i saw a brighter and more useful existence for them among the great family of friendly nations that now stretched from the south pole almost to their very doors  twentytwo years before i had been cast naked and a stranger into this strange and savage world  the hand of every race and nation was raised in continual strife and warring against the men of every other land and color  today by the might of my sword and the loyalty of the friends my sword had made for me black man and white red man and green rubbed shoulders in peace and goodfellowship all the nations of barsoom were not yet as one but a great stride forward toward that goal had been taken and now if i could but cement the fierce yellow race into this solidarity of nations i should feel that i had rounded out a great lifework and repaid to mars at least a portion of the immense debt of gratitude i owed her for having given me my dejah thoris  and as i thought i saw but one way and a single man who could insure the success of my hopes  as is ever the way with me i acted then as i always actwithout deliberation and without consultation  those who do not like my plans and my ways of promoting them have always their swords at their sides wherewith to back up their disapproval but now there seemed to be no dissenting voice as grasping talu by the arm i sprang to the throne that had once been salensus olls  warriors of barsoom i cried kadabra has fallen and with her the hateful tyrant of the north but the integrity of okar must be preserved  the red men are ruled by red jeddaks the green warriors of the ancient seas acknowledge none but a green ruler the first born of the south pole take their law from black xodar nor would it be to the interests of either yellow or red man were a red jeddak to sit upon the throne of okar  there be but one warrior best fitted for the ancient and mighty title of jeddak of jeddaks of the north  men of okar raise your swords to your new rulertalu the rebel prince of marentina  and then a great cry of rejoicing rose among the free men of marentina and the kadabran prisoners for all had thought that the red men would retain that which they had taken by force of arms for such had been the way upon barsoom and that they should be ruled henceforth by an alien jeddak  the victorious warriors who had followed carthoris joined in the mad demonstration and amidst the wild confusion and the tumult and the cheering dejah thoris and i passed out into the gorgeous garden of the jeddaks that graces the inner courtyard of the palace of kadabra  at our heels walked woola and upon a carved seat of wondrous beauty beneath a bower of purple blooms we saw two who had preceded usthuvia of ptarth and carthoris of helium  the handsome head of the handsome youth was bent low above the beautiful face of his companion  i looked at dejah thoris smiling and as i drew her close to me i whispered  why not  indeed why not  what matter ages in this world of perpetual youth  we remained at kadabra the guests of talu until after his formal induction into office and then upon the great fleet which i had been so fortunate to preserve from destruction we sailed south across the icebarrier but not before we had witnessed the total demolition of the grim guardian of the north under orders of the new jeddak of jeddaks  henceforth he said as the work was completed the fleets of the red men and the black are free to come and go across the icebarrier as over their own lands  the carrion caves shall be cleansed that the green men may find an easy way to the land of the yellow and the hunting of the sacred apt shall be the sport of my nobles until no single specimen of that hideous creature roams the frozen north  we bade our yellow friends farewell with real regret as we set sail for ptarth  there we remained the guest of thuvan dihn for a month and i could see that carthoris would have remained forever had he not been a prince of helium  above the mighty forests of kaol we hovered until word from kulan tith brought us to his single landingtower where all day and half a night the vessels disembarked their crews  at the city of kaol we visited cementing the new ties that had been formed between kaol and helium and then one longtoberemembered day we sighted the tall thin towers of the twin cities of helium  the people had long been preparing for our coming  the sky was gorgeous with gaily trimmed fliers  every roof within both cities was spread with costly silks and tapestries  gold and jewels were scattered over roof and street and plaza so that the two cities seemed ablaze with the fires of the hearts of the magnificent stones and burnished metal that reflected the brilliant sunlight changing it into countless glorious hues  at last after twelve years the royal family of helium was reunited in their own mighty city surrounded by joymad millions before the palace gates  women and children and mighty warriors wept in gratitude for the fate that had restored their beloved tardos mors and the divine princess whom the whole nation idolized  nor did any of us who had been upon that expedition of indescribable danger and glory lack for plaudits  that night a messenger came to me as i sat with dejah thoris and carthoris upon the roof of my city palace where we had long since caused a lovely garden to be made that we three might find seclusion and quiet happiness among ourselves far from the pomp and ceremony of court to summon us to the temple of rewardwhere one is to be judged this night the summons concluded  i racked my brain to try and determine what important case there might be pending which could call the royal family from their palaces on the eve of their return to helium after years of absence but when the jeddak summons no man delays  as our flier touched the landing stage at the temples top we saw countless other craft arriving and departing  in the streets below a great multitude surged toward the great gates of the temple  slowly there came to me the recollection of the deferred doom that awaited me since that time i had been tried here in the temple by zat arras for the sin of returning from the valley dor and the lost sea of korus  could it be possible that the strict sense of justice which dominates the men of mars had caused them to overlook the great good that had come out of my heresy  could they ignore the fact that to me and me alone was due the rescue of carthoris of dejah thoris of mors kajak of tardos mors  i could not believe it and yet for what other purpose could i have been summoned to the temple of reward immediately upon the return of tardos mors to his throne  my first surprise as i entered the temple and approached the throne of righteousness was to note the men who sat there as judges  there was kulan tith jeddak of kaol whom we had but just left within his own palace a few days since there was thuvan dihn jeddak of ptarthhow came he to helium as soon as we  there was tars tarkas jeddak of thark and xodar jeddak of the first born there was talu jeddak of jeddaks of the north whom i could have sworn was still in his icebound hothouse city beyond the northern barrier and among them sat tardos mors and mors kajak with enough lesser jeds and jeddaks to make up the thirtyone who must sit in judgment upon their fellowman  a right royal tribunal indeed and such a one i warrant as never before sat together during all the history of ancient mars  as i entered silence fell upon the great concourse of people that packed the auditorium  then tardos mors arose  john carter he said in his deep martial voice take your place upon the pedestal of truth for you are to be tried by a fair and impartial tribunal of your fellowmen  with level eye and highheld head i did as he bade and as i glanced about that circle of faces that a moment before i could have sworn contained the best friends i had upon barsoom i saw no single friendly glanceonly stern uncompromising judges there to do their duty  a clerk rose and from a great book read a long list of the more notable deeds that i had thought to my credit covering a long period of twentytwo years since first i had stepped the ocher sea bottom beside the incubator of the tharks  with the others he read of all that i had done within the circle of the otz mountains where the holy therns and the first born had held sway  it is the way upon barsoom to recite a mans virtues with his sins when he is come to trial and so i was not surprised that all that was to my credit should be read there to my judgeswho knew it all by hearteven down to the present moment  when the reading had ceased tardos mors arose  most righteous judges he exclaimed you have heard recited all that is known of john carter prince of heliumthe good with the bad  what is your judgment  then tars tarkas came slowly to his feet unfolding all his mighty towering height until he loomed a greenbronze statue far above us all  he turned a baleful eye upon mehe tars tarkas with whom i had fought through countless battles whom i loved as a brother  i could have wept had i not been so mad with rage that i almost whipped my sword out and had at them all upon the spot  judges he said there can be but one verdict  no longer may john carter be prince of heliumhe pausedbut instead let him be jeddak of jeddaks warlord of barsoom  as the thirtyone judges sprang to their feet with drawn and upraised swords in unanimous concurrence in the verdict the storm broke throughout the length and breadth and height of that mighty building until i thought the roof would fall from the thunder of the mad shouting  now at last i saw the grim humor of the method they had adopted to do me this great honor but that there was any hoax in the reality of the title they had conferred upon me was readily disproved by the sincerity of the congratulations that were heaped upon me by the judges first and then the nobles  presently fifty of the mightiest nobles of the greatest courts of mars marched down the broad aisle of hope bearing a splendid car upon their shoulders and as the people saw who sat within the cheers that had rung out for me paled into insignificance beside those which thundered through the vast edifice now for she whom the nobles carried was dejah thoris beloved princess of helium  straight to the throne of righteousness they bore her and there tardos mors assisted her from the car leading her forward to my side  let a worlds most beautiful woman share the honor of her husband he said  before them all i drew my wife close to me and kissed her upon the lips
