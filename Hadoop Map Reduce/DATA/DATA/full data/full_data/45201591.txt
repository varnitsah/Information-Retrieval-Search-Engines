45201591	silver lake by rm ballantyne    chapter one  the hunters  it was on a cold winter morning long ago that robin gore a bold hunter of the backwoods of america entered his parlour and sat him down to breakfast  robins parlour was also his diningroom and his drawingroom besides being his bedroom and his kitchen  in fact it was the only room in his wooden hut except a small apartment opening off it which was a workshop and lumberroom  robins family consisted of himself and his wife and his son roy who was twelve years of ageand his daughter nelly who was eight or thereabout  in addition to these his household comprised a nephew walter and an irishman larry odowd  the former was tall strong fearless and twenty  the latter was stout short powerful and forty  the personal history of robin gore to the point at which we take it up runs briefly thus  he had been born in a backwoods settlement had grown up and married in the little hamlet in which he had been born and hunted around it contentedly until he was forty years of age  but as population increased he became restive  he disliked restraint resolved to take his wife and family into the wilderness and after getting his nephew and an irish adventurer to agree to accompany him carried his resolution into effect  he travelled several hundreds of miles into the woodsbeyond the most remote settlementbuilt three wooden huts surrounded them with a tall stockade set up a flagstaff in the centre thereof and styled the whole affair fort enterprise  im sorry to bring you to such a lonesome spot molly my dear said robin as he sat on the trunk of a fallen tree on the afternoon of the day on which he arrived at the scene of his future home itll be rayther tryin at first but youll soon get used to it and we wont be bothered hereaway wi all the newfangled notions o settlement folk well dwell in the free wilderness where there are no tyrannical laws to hamper a man an no nonsensical customs to fix the fashion of his coat an leggins  besides youll have roy an nelly an walter an larry to keep you company lass not to mention our neighbours to look in upon now and again  very true robin replied the wife i have no doubt it will be quite cheery and homelike in course of time  she looked out upon the broad bosom of the lake which lay before the site of their forest home and sighed  it was evident that mrs gore had a strong partiality for the laws and customs which her husband abhorred  the neighbours to whom robin referred lived in a leather tent twenty miles distant from the fort  they were an indian named the black swan his wife named the white swan and a halfcaste trapper whose proper name was unknown to all save himself  his cognomen in the wilderness was slugs a name which originated in his frequent use of clipped pieces of lead instead of shot in the loading of his gun  but to return to the point from which we started  it was on a cold winter morning that robin gore entered his parlour and sat him down to breakfast  it was not only coldvery cold colder than ever was experienced in our favoured british islesbut it was also very dark  robin had risen before daybreak in order to visit his traps and shoot some game as early in the day as possible  the larder chanced to be nearly empty that day a fact which was all the more to be regretted that it was new years day and as robin remarked that day didnt occur more than once in the year  this statement larry odowd disputed affirming that it occurred at laste twice ivery yearwance at the beginnin an wance at the end of it  come along lad said robin trimming the candle as his nephew walter entered well ha to make the most of our time today for we dine at sharp five pm an our dinnerleastwise the most of itis at this moment alive an kickin if its not sleepin in the forest and has got to be found and shot yet  hallo boy where are you bound for  for the woods father with you and walter replied his son roy sitting down and coolly helping himself to a portion of bears meat with which the hunter was regaling himself  nonsense boy said robin somewhat gruffly  youll not be able to keep up with us added walter for weve little time before us an a long way to go  if i break down i can turn back retorted roy  very good please yourself said robin in a tone of indifference although his glance seemed to indicate that he was not sorry to see his boy determined to attempt an expedition which he knew from experience would be very trying to a lad of his years  breakfast over the three hunters clothed themselves in habiliments suitable to the climateleathern coats and trousers which were impervious to the wind cloth leggings to keep the snow from the trousers leather mocassins or shoes with three pairs of blanket socks inside of them furcaps with earpieces leather mittens with an apartment for the fingers and a separate chamber for the thumb powderhorns shotpouches guns and snowshoes  these latter were light wooden frames netted across with deerskin threads about five feet long and upwards of a foot wide  the shoes were of this enormous size in order that they might support the wearers on the surface of the snow which was on an average four feet deep in the woods  they were clumsy to look at but not so difficult to walk in as one might suppose  in silence the three hunters entered the dark woods in front of fort enterprise  robin went first and beat the track walter followed in his footsteps roy brought up the rear  the father sank about six inches at every step but the snow which fell upon his snowshoes was so fine and dry owing to the intense frost that it fell through the network of the shoes like dust  walter and roy treading in the footsteps had less labour in walking but walter being almost as strong as his uncle took his turn at beating the track every two hours  through the woods they went over mound and hollow across frozen swamp and plain through brush and break until near noon when they halted for rest and refreshment  while walter cut firewood robin and roy cleared away the snow using their snowshoes as shovels and prepared their meal  it was simple a few mouthfuls of dried meat and a tin can of hot teathe backwoodsmans greatest luxury next to his pipe  it was short too  half an hour sufficed to prepare and consume it  lets see now what we have got said robin counting the game before resuming the march  more than enough said walter lighting his pipe for a hurried whiff ten brace of white grouse four rabbits six red foxes and a black one and two wolves  we cant eat all that  surely we wont eat the foxes and wolves cried roy laughing  not till were starvin replied his father  come lets go onare ye tired lad  fresh as walter said the boy proudly  well we wont try you too much  well just take a sweep round by the wolfs glen an look at the traps thereafter which make for home and have our new years dinner  go ahead walter and beat the track it is your turn this time  without speaking walter slipped his feet into the lines of his snowshoes extinguished his pipe and led the way once more through the pathless forest    chapter two  the starved indian  in the depths of the same forest and not far from the locality to which we have introduced our reader a red indian was dragging his limbs wearily along over the untrodden snow  the attenuated frame of this son of the soil his hollow cheeks and glaring eyeballs his belt drawn with extreme tightness round his waist to repress the gnawings of hunger as well as his enfeebled gait proved that he was approaching the last stage of starvation  for many weeks wapaw had been travelling in the woods guided on his way by the stars and by those slight and delicate signs of the wilderness such as the difference of thickness in the bark on the north from that on the south side of a treewhich are perceptible only to the keen eye of an indian or a white man whose life has been spent in the wilderness  but wapaw was a very different man when he quitted his tribe from what he was at the time we introduce him to our reader  strong wiry upright and lithe as a panther he left his wigwam and his wife and turned his face towards the rising sun but the season was a severe one and game was scarce from the very beginning of his journey he had found it difficult to supply himself with a sufficiency of food  towards the middle of it he was on short allowance and much reduced in strength and now near its termination he was as we have said almost in the last stage of starvation  fort enterprise was wapaws goal  he had never been there before but from the description of the place and its locality given by those of his kindred who had visited robin gore he was able to direct his march with unerring certainty towards it  of course as he drew near to it he could not ascertain his exact distancewhether he was a day or several days journey offbut from the tracks of robins snowshoes which he crossed more than once he guessed that he was nearing the fort and pushed on with renewed hope and energy  robin however was an active hunter  he often made long and rapid marches from his lonely dwellingsometimes staying away a week or two at a time even in winter so that wapaw thought himself nearer fort enterprise than he really was when he first discovered the bold hunters tracks  when at length he did arrive at less than a days journey from the fort he was not aware of its close proximity and having tasted nothing whatever for two days he felt the approach of that terrible state of exhaustion which precedes death  it was a somewhat stormy day when the poor indians strength finally broke down  hitherto he had pushed forward with some degree of hope but on the morning of this day a broken branch caught his snowshoe and tripped him  at any other time the fall would have been a trifle but in his weak condition it acted like the last straw which breaks the camels back  wapaw rose with difficulty and brushing the snow from his eyes looked earnestly at his snowshoes well knowing that if they had been broken in the fall his power of advancing would have been taken away and his fate sealed for he had neither strength nor energy left to repair them  they were uninjured however so he once more attempted to stagger on  a slight rising ground lay before him  to ascend this was a labour so great that he almost sank in the midst of it  he reached the top however and gazed eagerly before him  he had gazed thus at the top of every rising ground that he had reached during the last two days in the hope of seeing some sign of the fort  a deep sigh escaped him as he rested his hands on the muzzle of his gun and his grave countenance was overspread with a look of profound melancholy  for the first time in his life the once stout and active wapaw had reached the point of giving way to despair  a wide open plain stretched out before him  the cold wind was howling wildly across it driving the keen snowdrift before it in whirling clouds  even a strong man might have shrunk from exposing himself on such a plain and to such a blast on that bitter arctic day  wapaw felt that in his case to cross it would be certain death so with the calm philosophy of a red indian he made up his mind to lay him down and die  his manner of preparing for his end was somewhat singular  turning aside into the woods he set about making an encampment with as much vigour as he could summon up  clearing away the snow from the roots of a large spreading pinetree he strewed branches on the ground and thus made a rude couch  on this he spread his blanket  then he cut some firewood with the axe that hung at his side and soon kindled by means of flint steel and tinder a good fire  seating himself before the warm blaze the exhausted man rested awhile with his legs drawn together and his head resting on his knees  he sat so long thus that he nearly fell asleep  presently he roused himself and proceeded to make a close examination of his wallet and firebagthe latter being a beautifully ornamented pouch which indians and furtraders wear at their belts for the purpose of containing the materials for producing fire besides pipes and tobacco  poor wapaw had already searched his wallet and firebag twice without finding a crumb of food or a morsel of tobacco  he knew well that they were empty yet he turned them inside out and examined the seams and corners with as much earnestness as if he really expected to find relief from his sufferings there  there was no expression of pain on the red mans faceonly a look of profound melancholy  he laid aside the firebag after a little while and then quietly drew his knife and cut a piece of leather from the skirt of his hunting coat  the leather had been dried and smoked and contained no substance whatever that could sustain life  wapaw was aware of thisnevertheless he singed a portion of it until it was reduced almost to ashes and mingling a little snow with this ate it greedily  then raising his eyes to the sky with a long earnest gaze he sat immovable until the sinking fire and the increasing cold recalled his wandering faculties  there was a wild glassy look about the indians eyes now which probably resulted from exhaustion  he seemed to struggle several times to rouse himself before he succeeded shuddering with intense cold he crept to the little pile of firewood and placed several billets on the fire which speedily blazed up again and the dying man cowered over it regardless of the smoke which ever and anon wreathed round his drooping head  in a few minutes wapaw started up as if new energy had been infused into him  he placed his gun axe firebag and powderhorn by themselves on the ground then he wrapped himself in his blanket and lay slowly down beside them with his feet towards the fire  for a few minutes he lay on his back gazing earnestly upwards while his lips moved slowly but no sound issued from them  then he turned wearily on his side and covering his head with the blanket and turning his face towards the ground he resigned himself to death  but god had ordained that at that time the red man should not die  about the time when he lay down our hunters emerged upon the plain which had caused the indian to despair  its of no use goin farther observed robin as he and his companions stood at the edge of the forest and looked across the plain the wind blows too hard and the drift is keen besides there aint much to be got hereaway even in seasons of plenty  father is that smoke risin over the bluff yonder asked roy pointing with his finger as he spoke  no doubt of it lad  indians may be said walter  robin shook his head  dont think so said he for the redskins dont often come to see me at this time o the year  but well go see an look to your primin ladsif its a warparty well ha to fight mayhap if we dont run  the three hunters crossed the plain in the teeth of the howling drift and cautiously approached the bluff referred to by roy and from behind which the smoke ascended  its a camp fire whispered robin as he glanced back at his companions but i see no one there  they must have just left the place  there was a shade of anxiety in the hunters voice as he spoke for he thought of fort enterprise its defenceless condition and the possibility of the indians having gone thither  they cant have gone to the fort said walter else we should have seen their tracks on the way hither  come said robin stepping forward quickly we can see their tracks now anyhow and follow them up and if they lead to the fort  the hunter did not finish his sentence for at that moment he caught sight of the recumbent form of wapaw in the camp  hist  a redskin alone and asleep  well i never did xpect to see that  mayhap hes a decoyduck suggested walter  better look sharp out  robin and roy heeded not the caution  they at once went forward and the father lifted the blanket from the indians head  dead exclaimed roy in a solemn tone  not yet lad but i do blieve the poor critters amost gone wi starvation  come bestir you boysrouse up the fire and boil the kettle  walter and roy did not require a second bidding  the kettle was ere long singing on a blazing fire  the indians limbs were chafed and warmed a can of hot tea was administered and wapaw soon revived sufficiently to look up and thank his deliverers  now as good luck has it i chanced to leave my handsled at the wolfs glen  go fetch it roy said robin  the lad set off at once and as the glen was not far distant soon returned with a flat wooden sledge six feet long by eighteen inches broad on which trappers are wont to pack their game in winter  on this sledge wapaw was firmly tied and dragged by the hunters to fort enterprise  hast got a deer father cried little nelly as she bounded in advance of her mother to meet the returning party  no nellytis dearer game than that  what a redskin exclaimed dame gore in surprise is he dead  no nor likely to die said robin hes in a starvin state though anll be none the worse of a bit of our new years dinner  here is game enough for one meal an more come lass get it ready as fast as may be  so saying the bold hunter passed through the fort gate dragging the red man behind him    chapter three  preparations for a feast  why so grave robin inquired mrs gore when her husband returned to the parlour after seeing wapaw laid in a warm corner of the kitchen and committed to the care of larry odowd  molly my dear its of no use concealin things from you cause when bad luck falls we must just face it  this injunwapaw he calls himselftells me he has comd here apurpose as fast as he could to say that his tribe have resolved to attack me burn the fort kill all the men and carry you off into slavery  god help me can this be true  true enough i dont doubt cause wapaw has the face of an honest man and i believe in faces  he says some of the worst men of his tribe are in power just now that they want the contents of my store without paying for them that he tried to get them to give up the notion but failed  on seeing that they were bent on it he said he was going off to hunt and came straight here to warn me  he says they talked of starting for the fort two days after he did and that he pushed on as fast as he could travel so its not likely theyll be here for two or three days yet  ill get ready for them howsever and when the reptiles do come theyll meet with a warm reception i warrant them meanwhile do you go and get dinner ready  we wont let such varmints interfere with our new years feast  while robins wife went to her larder his children were in the kitchen tending the indian with earnest solicitude and larry was preparing a little soup for him  do you like rabbit soup asked nelly kneeling beside the pallet of pine branches on which wapaw lay  the indian smiled and said something in his native tongue  sure he dont onderstan ye exclaimed larry as he bustled in an energetic way amongst his pots and pans  let me try him with cree said roy kneeling beside his sister i know a littlea very little cree  roy tried his very little cree but without success  its o no use he said father must talk to him for he knows every language on earth i believe  roys idea of the number of languages on earth was very limited  och dont bother him see here is a lingo that every wan onderstans cried larry carrying a can of hot soup towards wapaw  oh let me do let me cried nelly jumping up and seizing the can  be all manes said larry resigning it  the child once more knelt by the side of the indian and held the can to him while he conveyed the soup to his lips with a trembling unsteady hand  the eyes of the poor man glittered as he gazed eagerly at the food which he ate with the avidity of a halffamished wolf  his nurses looked on with great satisfaction and when wapaw glanced up from time to time in their faces he was advised to continue his meal with nods and smiles of goodwill  great preparations were made for the dinner of that new years day those who dwell at home at ease have no idea of the peculiar feelings with which the worlds wanderers hail the season of christmas and new year  surrounded as they usually are by strange scenes and ignorant as they are of what friends at home are doing or thinking they lay hold of this season as being one point at least in the circle of the year in which they can unite with the home circle and at the same time commemorate with them the birth of the blessed saviour of mankind and think with them of absent friends  much therefore as the happy season is made of in the old country it is made more of if possible in the colonies especially on the outskirts of the world where the adventurous and daring have pitched their tents  of course robin gore and his household did not think of the old country for they were descendants of settlers but they had imbibed the spirit of the old country from their forefathers and thought of those wellremembered friends whom they had left behind them in the settlements  notwithstanding the delay caused by the conveying of wapaw to the fort the hunters had walked so fast that there was still some time to spare before dinner should be ready  roy resolved to devote this time to a ramble in the woods with his sister nelly  accordingly the two put on their snowshoes and merely saying to their mother that they were going to take a run in the woods set forth  now it must be known that mrs gore had looked forward to new years day dinner with great interest and much anxiety  there was a general feeling of hilarity and excitement among the male members of the selfexiled family that extended itself to the good woman and induced her to resolve that the entire household should have what walter styled a rare blowout  during the whole morning she had been busy with the preparation of the various dishes among which were a tart made of cloudberry jam a salt goose and a lump of bears ham besides the rabbits and ptarmigan which had been shot that day  thats the way to do it molly cried robin as he opened the door and peeped in upon his wife during the height and heat of her culinary labours keep the pot bilin my dear and dont spare the butter this day  it only comes once a year you know  twice muttered larry in a low voice as he stirred the contents of a large pot which hung over the fire  and see that you look after wapaw continued robin  dont give him too much at first itll hurt him  no fear of that replied larry hes got so much aready that he couldnt howld another morsel av he was to try  well well take care of him anyhow said robin with a laugh meanwhile ill go see after the defences o the fort and make all snug  by dint of unwearied perseverance the dinner was cooked and then it occurred to robin to ask where the children were but no one could tell so the hunter remarked quietly that they would doubtless make their appearance in a short while  gradually the dinner reached that interesting point which is usually styled ready to dish  whereupon robin again asked where the children were  still no one could tell so he said he would go out and hail them  loudly and long did the hunter call but no one answered then he made a rapid search in and about the fort but they were not to be found  moreover a snowstorm had begun to set in and the drift rendered it difficult to distinguish tracks in the snow  at last the days labours were brought to a close  dinner was served and smoked invitingly on the table  the party only awaited the return of robin with the children  in a few minutes robin entered hastily  molly said he in a tone of anxiety the foolish things have gone into the woods i think  come lads we must hunt them down  its snowin hard so weve no time to lose  walter and larry at once put on their capotes furcaps and snowshoes and sallied forth leaving mrs gore seated alone and in a state of deep anxiety by the side of her untasted new years day dinner    chapter four  lost in the snow  when roy and nelly set out for a ramble they had at first no intention of going beyond their usual haunts in the woods around the fort but roy had been inspirited by his successful march that day with his father and walter and felt inclined to show nelly some new scenes to which they had not up to that time dared to penetrate together  the snowstorm already referred to had commenced gradually  when the children set forth on their ramble only a few flakes were falling but they had not been away half an hour when snow fell so thickly that they could not see distinctly more than a few yards ahead of them  there was no wind however so they continued to advance rather pleased than otherwise with the state of things  oh i do like to see falling snow cried nelly with a burst of animation  so do i said roy looking back at his sister with a bright smile and i like it best when it comes down thick and heavy in big flakes on a very calm day dont you  yes oh its so nice responded nelly sympathetically  they paused for minutes to shake some of the snow from their garments and beat their hands together for their fingers were cold and to laugh boisterously for their hearts were merry  then they resumed their march roy beating the track manfully and nelly following in his footsteps  in passing beneath a tall firtree roy chanced to touch a twig  the result was literally overwhelming for in a moment he was almost buried in snow to the unutterable delight of his sister who stood screaming with laughter as the unfortunate boy struggled to disentomb himself  in those northern wilds where snow falls frequently and in great abundance masses are constantly accumulating on the branches of trees particularly on the pines on the broad flat branches of which these masses attain to considerable size  a slight touch is generally sufficient to bring these down but being soft they never do any injury worth mentioning  when roy had fairly emerged from the snow he joined his sister in the laugh but suddenly he stopped and his face became very grave  whats the matter asked nelly with an anxious look  my snowshoes broken said roy  there was greater cause for anxiety on account of this accident than the reader is perhaps aware of  it may be easily understood that in a country where the snow averages four feet in depth no one can walk halfamile without snowshoes without being thoroughly exhausted on the other hand a man can walk thirty or forty miles a day by means of snowshoes  cant you mend it asked nelly  roy who had been carefully examining the damaged shoe shook his head  ive nothing here to do it with besides its an awful smash  i must just try to scramble home the best way i can  come its not very far well only be a bit late for dinner  the snowshoe having been bandaged after a fashion with a pockethandkerchief the little wanderers began to retrace their steps but this was now a matter of extreme difficulty owing to the quantity of snow which had fallen and almost obliterated the tracks  the broken shoe also was constantly giving way so that ere long the children became bewildered as well as anxious and soon lost the track of their outward march altogether  to make matters worse the wind began to blow clouds of snowdrift into their faces compelling them to seek the denser parts of the forest for shelter  they wandered on however in the belief that they were drawing nearer home every step and roy whose heart was stout and brave cheered up his sisters spirit so much that she began to feel quite confident their troubles would soon be over  presently all their hopes were dashed to the ground by their suddenly emerging upon an open space close to the very spot where the snowmass had fallen on roys head  after the first feeling of alarm and disappointment had subsided roy plucked up heart and encouraged nelly by pointing out to her that they had at all events recovered their old track which they would be very careful not to lose sight of again  poor nelly whimpered a little partly from cold and hunger as well as from disappointment as she listened to her brothers words then she dried her eyes and said she was ready to begin again  so they set off once more  but the difficulty of discerning the track if great at first was greater now because the falling and drifting snow had wellnigh covered it up completely  in a very few minutes roy stopped and confessing that he had lost it again proposed to return once more to their starting point to try to recover it  nelly agreed for she was by this time too much fatigued and alarmed to have any will of her own and was quite ready to do whatever she was told without question  after wandering about for nearly an hour in this state of uncertainty roy at last stopped and putting his arm round his sisters waist said that he had lost himself altogether  poor nelly whose heart had been gradually sinking fairly broke down she hid her face in her brothers bosom and wept  come now dont do that dear nell said roy tenderly ill tell you what we shall dowell camp in the snow  we have often done it close to the house you know for fun so well do it now in earnest  but its so dark and cold sobbed nelly looking round with a shudder into the dark recesses of the forest which were by that time enshrouded by the gathering shades of night and im so hungry too  oh me what shall we do  now dont get so despairing urged roy whose courage rose in proportion as his sisters sank its not such an awful business after all for father is sure to scour the woods in search of us an if we only get a comfortable encampment made an a roarin fire kindled why well sit beside it an tell stories till they find us  theyll be sure to see the fire you know so comelets to work  roy said this so cheerfully that the child felt a little comforted dried her eyes and said she would help to make the camp  this matter of making an encampment in the snow although laborious work was by no means a novelty to these children of the backwoods they had often been taught how to do it by cousin walter and larry odowd and had made playing at camps their chief amusement in fine winter days  when therefore they found themselves compelled to campout from necessity neither of them was at a loss how to proceed roy drew a circle in the snow about three yards in diameter at the foot of a large tree and then both set to work to dig a hole in this space using their snowshoes as shovels  it took an hours hard work to reach the ground and when they did so the piledup snow all round raised the walls of this hole to the height of about six feet  now for bedding cried roy scrambling over the walls of their camp and going into the woods in search of a young pinetree while nelly sat down on the ground to rest after her toil  it was a dark night and the woods were so profoundly obscured that roy had to grope about for some time before he found a suitable tree cutting it down with the axe which always hung at his girdle he returned to camp with it on his shoulder and cut off the small soft branches which nelly spread over the ground to the depth of nearly half a foot  this pinebrush as it is called formed a soft elastic couch  the fire was the next business  again roy went into the bush and gathered a large bundle of dry branches  now nelly do you break a lot of the small twigs said roy and ill strike a light  he pulled his firebag from his belt as he spoke and drew from it flint steel and tinder  no one ever travels in the wilds of which we write without such means of procuring fire  roy followed the example of his elder companions in carrying a firebag although he did not like them carry tobacco and pipe in it  soon the bright sparks that flew from the flint caught on the tinder this was placed in a handful of dry grass and whirled rapidly round until it was fanned into a flame  nelly had prepared another handful of dry grass with small twigs above it  the light was applied the fire leaped up more sticks were piled on and at last the fire roared upward sending bright showers of sparks into the branches overhead lighting the white walls of the camp with a glow that caused them to sparkle as with millions of gems and filling the hearts of the children with a sensation of comfort and gladness while they stood before the blaze and warmed themselves rubbing their hands and laughing with glee  no one save those who have experienced it can form any conception of the cheering effect of a fire in the heart of a dark wood at night  roy and nelly quite forgot their lost condition for a short time in the enjoyment of the comforting heat and the bright gladsome blaze  the brother cut firewood until he was rendered almost breathless the sister heaped on the wood until the fire roared and leaped high above their heads  strange though it may appear to some the snow did not melt the weather was too cold for that only a little of that which was nearest the fire meltedthe snow walls remained hard frozen all round roy soon sat down to rest as close to the fire as he could without getting scorched then nelly seated herself by his side and nestled her head in his breast  there they sat telling stories and gazing at the fire and waiting for father to come  meanwhile robin and his comrade ranged the forest far and near in desperate anxiety  but it was a wide and wild country  the children had wandered far away a high ridge of land hid their fire from view moreover robin knowing the childrens usual haunts had chanced to go off in the wrong direction  when night set in the hunters returned to fort enterprise to procure ammunition and provisions in order to commence a more thorough and prolonged search  poor mrs gore still sat beside the cold and untasted feast and there the hunters left her while they once more plunged into the pathless wilderness to search for the lost ones on that luckless new years day    chapter five  carried off  while robin gore and his companions were anxiously searching the woods around fort enterprise for the lost children a warparty of savages was making its way swiftly towards the fort  a chief of the indians named hawk who was a shrewd as well as a bad man had suspected wapaws intentions in quitting the camp of his people alone and in such unnecessary haste  this man had great influence over his fellows and easily prevailed on them to set off on their murderous expedition against the fort of the palefaces without delay  being well supplied with food they travelled faster than their starving comrade and almost overtook him  they finally encamped within a short distance of the fort the day after wapaws arrival and prepared to assault it early next morning  if the wicked skunk has got there before us said hawk to his fellows as they prepared to set out before daybreak the palefaces will be ready for us and we may as well go back to our wigwams at once but if that badgers whelp has been slow of foot we shall hang the scalps of the palefaces at our belts and eat their food this day  the polite titles above used by hawk were meant to refer to wapaw  indians are not naturally loquacious  no reply was made to hawks remark except that one man with a blackened face and a streak of red ochre down the bridge of his nose said ho and another with an equally black face and three red streaks on each of his cheeks said hum as the warparty put on their snowshoes and prepared to start  they had not gone far when hawk came to a sudden pause and stood transfixed and motionless like a dark statue  his comrades also stopped abruptly and crouched  no question was asked but hawk pointed to a spark of fire which every indian in the band had observed the instant their leader had paused  silently they crept forward with guns cocked and arrows fitted to the bowstrings until they all stood round an encampment where the fire was still smouldering and in the centre of which lay a little boy and girl fast asleep and shuddering with cold  poor roy and nelly had told each other stories until their eyes would not remain open then they fell asleep despite their efforts to keep awake and as the fire sank low they began to shiver with the cold lucky was it for them that the indians discovered them else they had certainly been frozen to death that night  hawk roused them with little ceremony  roy by an impulse which would appear to be natural to those who dwell in wild countries whether young or old seized his axe which lay beside him as he leaped up  hawk grinned and took the axe from him at once and the poor boy seeing that he was surrounded by dark warriors offered no resistance but sought to comfort nelly who was clinging to him and trembling with terror  immediately the savages sat down in the encampment and began an earnest discussion which the children watched with great eagerness  they evidently did not agree for much gesticulation and great vehemence characterised their debate  some pointed towards the fort and touched their tomahawks while others pointed to the woods in the direction whence they had come and shook their heads  not a few drew their scalping knives partially from their sheaths and pointing to the children showed clearly that they wished to cut their career short without delay but several of the more sedate members of the party evidently objected to this  finally hawk turned to roy and said something to him in the indian tongue  roy did not understand and attempted to say so as well as he could by signs and the use of the few words of the cree language which his father had taught him  in the course of his speech if we may use that term he chanced to mention wapaws name  ho ho ho said one and another of the indians while hawk grinned horribly  a variety of questions were now put to poor roy who not understanding of course could not answer them  hawk however repeated wapaws name and pointed towards the fort with a look of inquiry to which roy replied by nodding his head and repeating wapaw once or twice also pointing to the fort for he began to suspect these must be wapaws comrades who had come to search for him  he therefore volunteered a little additional information by means of signs rubbed his stomach looked dreadfully rueful rolled himself as if in agony on the ground and then getting up pretended to eat and look happy  by all of which he meant to show how that wapaw had been on the borders of starvation but had been happily saved therefrom  indians in council might teach a useful lesson to our members of parliament for they witnessed this rather laughable species of pantomime with profound gravity and silence  when roy concluded they nodded their heads and said ho ho which no doubt was equivalent to hear hear  after a little more discussion they rose to depart and made signs to the children to get up and follow  roy then pointed out the broken state of his snowshoe but this difficulty was overcome by hawk who threw it away and made him put on his sisters snowshoes  a stout young warrior was ordered to take nelly on his back which he did without delay and the whole party left the encampment headed by their chief  the children submitted cheerfully at first under the impression that the indians meant to convey them to the fort  great however was their horror when they were taken through the woods by a way which they knew to be quite in the opposite direction  when roy saw this he stopped and looked back but an indian behind him gave him a poke with the butt of his gun which there was no resisting for a moment the lad thought of trying to break away run home and tell his father of nellys fate but a second thought convinced him that this course was utterly impracticable  as for nelly she was too far from her brother in the procession to hold converse with him and as she knew not what to do say think she was reduced to the miserable consolation of bedewing with her tears the shoulders of the young warrior who carried her  the storm which had commenced the day before still continued so that in the course of a few hours traces of the track of the warparty were almost obliterated and the chance of their being followed by robin and his friends was rendered less and less likely as time ran on  all that day they travelled without halt and when they stopped at night to encamp roy was nearly dead from exhaustion  my poor nell said he drawing his sobbing sister close to him as they sat near the camp fire after having eaten the small quantity of dried venison that was thrown to them by their captors dont despair father will be sure to hunt us down if its in the power of man to do it  i dont despair sobbed nelly but oh what will darling mother do when she finds that were lost and im so afraid theyll kill us  no fear o that nell its not worth their while  remember too what mother often told usthatthatwhat is it she used to read so often out of the bible  i forget  i think it was call upon me in the time of trouble and i will deliver thee  ive been thinkin of that roy already  thats right nell now come cheer up  have you had enough to eat  yes said nelly with a loud yawn which she did not attempt to check  roy echoed it as a matter of course who ever did see anyone yawn without following suit and then the two lay down together spread over themselves an old blanket which one of the indians had given them and fell asleep at once  day succeeded day night followed night and weeks came and went yet the indians continued their journey through the snowclad wilderness roys snowshoes had been picked up and repaired by one of the savages and nelly was made to walk a good deal on her own snowshoes but it is justice to the indians to say that they slackened their pace a little for the sake of the children and when nelly showed symptoms of being fatigued the stout young warrior who originally carried her took her on his shoulders  at length the encampment of the tribe was reached and nelly was handed over to hawks wife to be her slave  soon after that the tents were struck and the whole tribe went deeper into the northern wilds several gales arose and passed away completely covering their footprints so that no tracks were left behind them    chapter six  the camp the attack and the escape  it were vain to attempt a description of the varied condition of mind into which the brother and sister fell when they found themselves actually reduced to a state of slavery in an indian camp and separated from their parents as they firmly believed for ever  nelly wept her eyes almost out of their sockets at first  then she fell into a sort of apathetic state in which for several days she went about her duties almost mechanically feeling as if it were all a horrible dream out of which she would soon awake and find herself at home with her darling mother beside her  this passed however and she had another fit of heartbreaking sorrow from which she found relief by recalling some of the passages in gods word which her mother had taught her to repeat by heart especially that verse in which it is said that jesus is a friend who sticketh closer than a brother  and this came to the poor childs mind with peculiar power because her own brother roy was so kind and took such pains to comfort her and to enter into all her girlish feelings and sympathies that she could scarcely imagine it possible for anyone to stick closer to her in all her distress than he did  as for roy he was not given to the melting mood  his nature was bold and manly  whatever he felt he kept it to himself and he forgot more than half his own sorrow in his brotherly efforts to assuage that of nelly  both of them were active and willing to oblige so that they did not allow their grief to interfere with their work a circumstance which induced their captors to treat them with forbearance and even kindness nelly sobbed and worked gradually the sobbing decreased and the work was carried on with vigour so that she soon became quite expert at skinning rabbits boiling meat embroidering mocassins smoking deerskins chopping firewood into small pieces and many other details of indian household economy while roy went out with the hunters and became a very nimrod insomuch that he soon excelled all the lads of his own age and many of those who were older in the use of the bow the snowshoes the spear the axe and the gun  but all this and what they did and said in the indian camp during that winter and what was said and done to them we do not mean to write about having matter of deeper interest to tell  winter passed away and spring came  but little do those who dwell in england know of the enchantment of returning spring in the frozen wilderness of north america  the long long winter seems as though it would never pass away  the intense frost seals up all the sweet odours of the woods for so many months that the nostrils become powerfully sensitive and as it were yearn for something to smell the skin gets so used to frost that a balmy breeze is thought of as a thing of the past or wellnigh forgotten  spring in those regions comes suddenly  it came on our wanderers with a gush  one night the temperature rose high above the freezing point next day all the sights and sounds of natures great awakening were in full play  the air fanned their cheeks like a summer breeze the strange unwonted sound of tinkling and dropping water was heard scents as of green things were met and inhaled greedily  as the thirsty bedouin drinks from the well in the oasis so did roy and nelly drink in the delicious influences of melting nature  and they thought of those words which say that the wilderness shall rejoice and blossom as the rose  the rejoicing had commenced the blossoming would soon follow  but warlike and wicked men were even then preparing to desecrate the beautiful land  a warparty of enemies had come down upon the tribe with whom they dwelt  scouts had brought in the news  all was commotion and excitement in the camp  goods and chattels were being packed up  the women and children were to be sent off with these under an escort to a place of greater security while the braves armed for the fight  in the middle of all the confusion roy took nelly aside and with a look of mystery said  nell dear im goin to run away  stay now dont stare so like an owl but hold your sweet tongue until i have explained what i mean to do  you and i have picked up a good deal of useful knowledge of one sort or another since we came here and im inclined to think we are quite fit to take to the woods and work our way back to fort enterprise  but isnt it an awful long way said nelly  it is but we have an awful long time to travel havent we all our lives before us  if our lives are long well manage it if they are short why we wont want to manage it so we need not bother our heads about that  but the way home suggested nelly do you know it  of course i know it that is to say i know from that ugly thief hawk that it lies somewhere or other to the southwest o this place some hundreds of miles off how many hundreds does not much matter for we have got the whole of the spring summer and fall before us  but what if we dont get home in the fall  then we shall spend the winter in the woods thats all  nelly laughed in spite of her anxieties at the confident tone in which her brother spoke and being quite unable to argue the matter farther she said that she was ready to do whatever roy pleased having perfect confidence in his wisdom  thats right nell now you get ready to start at a moments notice when the injuns attack the camp well give em the slip  put all you want to take with you on a toboggan see note 1 and meet me at the crooked tree when the camp moves  that night the camp was struck and the women and children departed under a strong escort  almost at the same time the enemy came down on their prey but they met men prepared for them  in the dark nelly crept to the crooked tree dragging the toboggan after her  she was met by roy who took the sledgeline and her hand and led her into the dark forest while the savages were fighting and yelling like fiends in the camp  there let us leave them to fight it out  enough for us to know that their warfare prevented any pursuit of the young fugitives  weeks passed and roy and nelly wandered on all fear of pursuit soon left them  ducks geese and other waterfowl came in myriads with the spring  roy had brought with him his gun the one he was wont to use in hunting and bow and quiver  they fed on the fat of the land  summer advanced and game became less plentiful still there was more than sufficient to supply them with abundance of food  autumn approached the wild fowl that had passed northward in spring began to return southward and again the wants of the young wanderers were superabundantly supplied  the polestar was roys guide  at night he laid his course by it and by the sun during the day making constant allowance of course for the suns rate of travelling through the sky and taking advantage of all prominent landmarks on the way  time sped on many weary miles were travelled but no sign of fort enterprise was to be seen  day after day week after week month after month they wandered and still found themselves in the heart of an unknown wilderness  occasionally they observed signs of indians and carefully kept out of sight at such times as you may easily believe  at last there came a day when hard frost set in  it was the first touch of another winter  roy and nelly did not betray their feelings to each other but their hearts sank as they thought of what lay before them the frost was shortlived however towards noon the air became delightfully warm and their spirits revived  on reaching the summit of an eminence up which they had toiled for several hours they beheld a small lake in which the silvery clouds were clearly reflected  the day was calm the sun unusually brilliant the autumnal foliage most gorgeous in colour  it was like a scene in fairyland  splendid exclaimed roy sitting down beside his sister on the trunk of a fallen tree  oh how beautiful cried nelly  its so like silver said roy  silver lake murmured nelly  roy seemed to think the name appropriate for he echoed the words yes silver lake  and there brother and sister sat for a long time on the fallen tree in silent admiration of the scene    note 1  a small indian sledge dragged on the snow either by hand or by dog with loops at the sides for lashing the loading of the sledge upon it    chapter seven  the encampment on silver lake  when roy and nelly sat down to gaze in admiration on silver lake they little thought how long a period they should have to spend on its shores  the lake was a small sheet of water not more than half a mile broad embosomed among low hills which though not grand were picturesque in outline and wooded to their tops  it occupied the summit of an elevated region or heightoflanda watershed in factand roy afterwards discovered that water flowed from both the northeast and southwest sides of the tableland in the midst of which it lay  these fountainheads separated by little more than half a mile from each other were the sources of streams which flowing in opposite directions through hundreds of miles of wild beautiful and uncultivated wilderness found their way on the one hand into hudsons bay on the other hand into the atlantic through the great rivers and lakes of canada  the waters of the lake were strikingly clear and pellucid  when the young wanderer first came upon the scene not a zephyr stirred the leaves of the forest the blue sky was studded with towering masses of white clouds which glowed in sunshine and these reflected in the glassy wateras if far far down in its unfathomable depthsproduced that silvery effect which prompted nelly to utter the name which we have adopted  small though the silver lake was it boasted two islets which like twin babes lay side by side on their mothers fair breast their reflected images stretching down into that breast as if striving to reach and grasp its heart  couldnt we stay here a short time asked nelly breaking the silence in a tone that indicated anxiety hope and enthusiasm only for a very little time she added coaxingly  roy looked grave and sagacious  boys as well as men like to be leant upon and trusted by the fair sexat least in things masculineand nelly had such boundless faith in her brothers capacity to protect her and guide her through the forest that she unwittingly inspired him with an exuberant amount of courage and selfreliance  the lad was bold and fearless enough by nature  his sisters confidence in him had the effect of inducing him to think himself fit for anything  he affected therefore at times a look of grave sagacity befitting as he thought so important and responsible a character  ive just been thinking said he  oh dont think but say yes interrupted nelly  well im going to say yes but i meant to give you my reasons for sayin so  in the first place my powder and shot is gettin low  you see i did not bring away very much from the injun camp and weve been using it for so many months now that it wont last much longer so i think it would not be a bad plan to stop here awhile and fish and shoot and feed upfor you need rest nellyand then start fresh with a wellloaded sledge  ill save some powder by using the bow we made the other day  but you forget its broken  so it isnever mind we can make anothertheres a tree that will make a firstrater down in the hollow dye see it nell  whereoh yesjust by the grassy place where the rock juts out into the water with the sun shining on it what a nice place to build a hut  just so said roy smiling at the girls enthusiasm thats the spot and thats the very thought that jumped bang into my brain as you spoke by the way does a thought jump into a mans brain or out of it i wonder  out of it of course cried nelly with a laugh  im not so sure of that nell  i send it rather slowly out through my mouth but i think it jumps into my brain  i wonder how it gets in whether by the eyes or ears or mouthperhaps it goes up the nose  what stuff you do talk cried nelly  dye think so said roy with a grin well that bein the case lets go and fix our camp for the sun is not given to sitting up all night in these parts so we must work while it shines  with hurried steps and eager looks for roy despite his affected coolness was as enthusiastic about the new plan as his sister they descended to the margin of silver lake and began to make their encampment on the sunny spot before referred to  it turned out to be most suitable for their purpose having a gentle slope towards the margin of the lake which was fringed with a beach of pure white pebbles and being well sheltered in the rear by umbrageous trees  the point of rocks close at hand formed a natural jetty which roy observed would be useful as a landingplace when he got his raft under way the turf was soft a matter of some importance as it was to form their couch at night and a small stream trickled down from one of the numerous springs which welled up at the foot of the nearest hill  solitary and remote from the usual haunts of men as this lake was there was no feeling of solitude about it at the time we write of  the entire region was alive with wild fowl of many kinds  wild geese trumpeted their advent as they came from the far north en route for the far south and settled on the bosom of silver lake to take a nights lodging there  ducks from the same region and bound for the same goalthough with less stately and regular flightflew hither and thither with whistling wings ever and anon going swash into the water as a tempting patch of reeds invited them to feed or a whim of fancy induced them to rest  wild swans occasionally sailed in all their majesty on its waters while plover of every length of limb and bill and every species of plaintive cry waded round its margin or swept in clouds over the neighbouring swamps  sometimes deer would trot out of the woods and slake their thirst on its shore and the frequent rings that broke its smooth surface told of life in the watery depths below  the whole air was filled with gushing sounds of wild melody as though bird and beast were uniting in a hymn of praise to the beneficent creator who had provided the means of and given the capacity for so much enjoyment  having decided on a suitable spot for their temporary restingplace roys first care was to construct a hut  this was neither a work of time nor difficulty  in a couple of hours it was finished  he commenced the work by felling about a dozen young firtrees not much thicker than a mans wrist from which he chopped the branches thus leaving them bare poles about nine feet long  while he was thus employed his sister cleared the spot on which their dwelling was to stand and having an eye to the picturesque so arranged that the opening of the hut should command an uninterrupted view of the lake  on going into the bush to the place where roy was at work she found him cutting down his sixth tree and the ground was strewn with the flat branches of those already cut  come along nellyhow hot i amcarry these branches into camp lass an go ahead for ive got supper to kill yet  nelly made no direct reply but muttered to herself something that sounded very like oh what fun as she filled her tiny arms with pine branches and hugging them to her heaving breast staggered to the camp  when she had carried all the branches roy had cut all the poles so he proceeded to set them up  tying three poles together at the top and using the pliant roots of a tree for the purpose he set them up in the form of a tripod  against these three all the other poles were piled crossing each other at the top and spreading out at the base so as to enclose a circle of about six feet in diameter  being numerous the poles were pretty close together thus affording good support to the branches which were afterwards piled on them  pine branches are flat spreading and thick so that when laid above each other to a depth of several inches they form a very good shelter from dew and light rain the hut was entirely covered with such branches which were kept in their places by other poles leaning upon and pressing them down  the floor of the hut was also covered with pine brush  now for supper nelly said roy seizing his bow when the hut was completed and splicing its broken part with a strip of deerskin cut from the lines of the sledge  get a goose roy and pick out a nice fat one cried nelly laughing ill have the fire ready when you come back  ill try said roy and he did try but tried in vain  although a good shot he was not sufficiently expert with the bow to shoot wild fowl on the wing so he returned to the hut emptyhanded  we must make a new bow nell said he sitting down by the fire i can do nothin wi this and it wont do to use the gun for anythin but deer  meanwhile lets have the remains of our dinner for supper  come cheer up old ooman we shall feast on the fat of the land tomorrow  the stars were shining in the sky and winking at their reflections down in the depths of silver lake and the lake itself lay as black as ink under the shadow of the hills when the brother and sister spread their blanket above them that night and sank almost immediately into profound slumber    chapter eight  hunting and other matters on silver lake  sunrise is a gladsome event almost at all times we say almost because there are times when sunrise is not particularly gladsome  in the arctic regions of norway for instance we have seen it rise only twenty minutes after it set and the rising and setting were so much mingled that no very strong feelings of any kind were awakened moreover we were somewhat depressed at the time in consequence of having failed to reach those latitudes where the sun does not set at all for several weeks in summer but shines night and day  to the sick sunrise brings little comfort too often it is watched for with weariness and beheld at last with a feeling of depression at the thought that another day of pain has begun  but to the healthy and especially to the young sunrise is undoubtedly on most occasions a gladsome event  at least nelly gore thought so when she awoke and beheld from the floor of the hut where she lay a flood of yellow glory gushing through a valley turning silver lake into gold tipping the trees with fire and blazing full in roys face which was at that moment turned up to the sky with the mouth open and the nose snoring  oh how beautiful screamed nelly in the exuberance of her delight  hallo murder come on ye black varmints shouted roy as he sprang up and seized the axe which lay at his side  oh its only you what a yell you do give nelly why one would think you were a born injun what ist all about lass  yeaow how sleepy i amtoo late to have another nap i suppose eh  oh yes lazy thing get up and come out quick cried the other as she sprang up and ran out of the hut to enjoy the full blaze of the sunshine and the fresh morning air  that morning nelly could do little but ramble about in a wild sort of fashion trying to imagine that she was queen of the world around her she sobered down however towards noon and went diligently about the work which roy had given her to do  she had the internal arrangements of the hut to complete and improve some pairs of mocassins to mend and several arrows to feather besides other matters  meanwhile roy went out to hunt  determined not to use his fastdiminishing ammunition except on large game and anxious to become more expert with the bow he set to work the first thing that day and made a new bow  armed with this and a dozen arrows he sallied forth  some of his arrows were pointed with ivory some with iron and some had no points at all but blunt heavy heads instead  these latter were and still are used by indians in shooting game that is tame and easily killed  grouse of various kinds for instance if hit with full force from a short range by a bluntheaded arrow will be effectually stunned especially if hit on the head  at first roy walked along the shores of the lake but was not very successful because the ducks and geese were hid among reeds and rose suddenly with a distracting whirr usually flying off over the water to have let fly at these would have cost him an arrow every shot so after losing one he wisely restrained himself  after a time he turned into the woods resolving to try his fortune where his arrows were not so likely to be lost  he had not gone far when a treegrouse sprang into the air and settled on a neighbouring pine  roy became excited for he was anxious not to return to the hut emptyhanded a second time  he fitted a sharpheaded arrow to the string and advanced towards the bird cautiously  his anxiety to make little noise was so great that he tripped over a root and fell with a hideous crash into the middle of a dead bush the branches of which snapped like a discharge of little crackers  poor roy got up disgusted but on looking up found that the grouse was still sitting there filled apparently with more curiosity than alarm  seeing this he advanced to within a few yards of the bird and substituting a blunt arrow for the sharp one discharged it with vigour  it hit the grouse on the left eye and brought it to the ground like a stone  good thats number one muttered the lad as he fastened the bird to his belt hope number two is not far off  number two was nearer than he imagined for four other birds of the same kind rose a few yards ahead of him with all the noise and flurry that is characteristic of the species  they settled on a tree not far off and looked about them  sit there my fine fellows till i come up muttered roy  the lad had a habit of speaking to himself while out hunting  they obeyed the order and sat until he was close to them  again was the blunt arrow fitted to the string once more it sped true to its mark and number two fell fluttering to the ground  now the grouse of north america is sometimes a very stupid creature it literally sits still to be shot if the hunter is only careful to fire first at the lowest bird of the group  if he were to fire at the topmost one its fluttering down amongst the others would start them off  roy was aware of this fact and had aimed at the bird that sat lowest on the tree  another arrow was discharged and number three lay sprawling on the ground  the blunt arrows being exhausted he now tried a sharp one but missed  the birds stretched their necks turned their heads on one side and looked at the lad as though to say it wont dotry again  another shaft was more successful  it pierced the heart of number four and brought it down like a lump of lead  number five seemed a little perplexed by this time and made a motion as though it were about to fly off but an arrow caught it in the throat and cut short its intentions and its career  thus did roy bag or rather belt five birds consecutively  see note one  our hero was not one of those civilised sportsmen who slaughter as much game as they can  he merely wanted to provide food for a day or two he therefore turned his steps homewardif we may be allowed the expressionbeing anxious to assist his sister in making the hut comfortable  as he walked along his active mind ran riot in many eccentric channels those who take any interest in the study of mind know that it is not only the mind of a romantic boy that does this but that the mind of man generally is when left to itself the veriest acrobat the most unaccountable harlequin that ever leaped across the stage of fancy  roys mind was now in the clouds now on the earth  anon it was away in the faroff wilderness or scampering through the settlements and presently it was deep down in silver lake playing with the fish  roy himself muttered a word or so now and then as he walked along which gave indication of the whereabouts of his mind at the time  capital fun said he only it wont do to stay too long  poor mother how shell be wearin for us  hallo ducks youre noisy coons wonder why you get up with such a bang  bang that reminds me of the gun  no more banging of you old chap if my hand keeps in so well with the bow  eh duck whats wrong  this latter question was addressed to a small duck which seemed in an anxious state of mind to judge from its motions  presently a head as if of a fish broke the surface of the lake and the duck disappeared  oh the villain exclaimed roy a fish has bolted him  after this the lad walked on in silence looking at the ground and evidently pondering deeply  nelly said he entering the hut and throwing the grouse at her feet here is dinner supper and breakfast for you and please get the first ready as fast as you can for im famishing  oh how nice how did you get them  ill tell you presently but my heads full of a notion about catching ducks just now  catching ducks roy what is the notion  never mind nelly i hant scratched it out o my brain yet but ill tell ee after dinner and well try the plan tomorrow mornin    note 1  the author has himself in the backwoods taken four birds in succession off a tree in this fashion with a fowlingpiece    chapter nine  fishing extraordinary  early on the following morning roy and nelly rose to try the new style of duckhunting which the former had devised  i wonder if it will do said the little girl as she tripped along by her brothers side in the direction of a marshy bay which had been selected as the scene of their experiments  how clever of you to invent such a funny plan  well i didnt exactly invent it lass  the fact is that i remembered father havin told me he had read it in a book before he left the settlements  i wish we had some books  pity that weve got no books  so it is assented nell with a touch of sadness in her tone  both roy and his sister were good readers having been taught by their mother out of the biblethe only book that robin gore had brought with him from the settlements  robin could read but he did not care much for readingneither did walter nor larry odowd  indeed the latter could not read at all  mrs gore had wanted to take a few books with her into the wilderness but her husband said he thought the bible was enough for her so the library at fort enterprise was select and small one good resulted from thisthe bible was read by all who could read a great deal more than would have been the case had there been other books at hand  but the young people longed earnestly for books containing fairy tales such as was told to them by their mother and wild adventures such as walter could relate or invent by the hour  it might have been observed that roy carried on his shoulder a remarkable objectsomething like a clumsy basket made of reeds and about twice the size of a mans head  this had been made by nelly the night before  the use to which it was to be put was soon shown by roy having reached the spot where the experiment was to be tried and having observed that there were many ducks large and small floating about among the reeds he got nelly to hold the basket if we may so call it as high as she could raise it  there was a hole in the bottom of it through this roy thrust his head so that the machine rested on his shoulders his head being inside and completely concealed  now nelly what think you of my helmet  oh it is splendid cried the girl laughing in a subdued voice its so awfully absurd looking but can you see for i dont see a bit of your face  see ay as well as need be  theres lots of small holes which i can peep through in all directions  but come ill try it  keep close nell and dont laugh too loud for ducks aint used to laughing dye see and may be frightened by it  so saying roy crept on his hands and knees to the edge of the lake being concealed by bushes until he got into the water  here a few steps took him into the reeds which clustered so thickly at that spot and grew so tall that he was soon hidden from sight altogether  he had not taken off much of his dress which we may remark in passing was of the simplest at all timesconsisting of a pair of trousers a striped cotton shirt and a grey cloth capote with a hood to it  his capote and cap were left in charge of his sister  as for the shirt and trousers they could be easily dried again  nelly watched the place where her brother had disappeared with breathless interest  as he did not reappear as quickly as she had expected she became greatly alarmed  in a few minutes more she would certainly have rushed into the lake to the rescue regardless of consequences and of ducks had not roys strange headdress come suddenly into view at the outward verge of the reeds  the lad had waded in up to his neck and was now slowlyalmost imperceptiblyapproaching a group of ducks that were disporting themselves gaily in the water  theyll never let him near them thought nelly  she was wrong for at that moment an extremely fat and pert young duck observed the bundle of reeds and swam straight up to it animated no doubt by that reckless curiosity which is peculiar to young creatures had its mother known what was inside of the bundle she would no doubt have remonstrated with her headstrong child but old and sagacious though that mother was she was completely deceived  she was not even astonished when her duckling suddenly disappeared beneath the water thinking no doubt that it had dived  soon the bundle of reeds drew near to the mother and she too disappeared suddenly below the water whatever her astonishment was at feeling her legs seized from below she had not time to express it before her voice was choked  nelly observed these disappearances with intense amazement and delight stamped every lineament of her little visage  when the bundle moved towards the father of the duckfamily that gentleman became agitated and suspicious  probably males are less trusting than females in all conditions of animal life  at all events he sheered off  the bundle waxed impatient and made a rush at him  the drake missing his wife and child quacked the alarm  the bundle made another rush and suddenly disappeared with a tremendous splash in the midst of which a leg and an arm appeared  away went the whole brood of ducks with immense splutter and nelly gave a wild scream of terror supposingand she was rightthat her brother had fallen into a hole and that he would be drowned  in the latter supposition however she was mistaken for roy swam ashore in a few moments with a duck in each hand  o roy aint you cold inquired nelly as she helped him to squeeze the water out of his garments  yyyees said roy trembling in every limb while his teeth rattled like small castanets im very ccccold but im in luck for ive ggggot tonights ssssupper anyhow  this was true but as he could not hope to procure many more suppers in the same fashion at that season of the year he and his sister went off without delay to try the fishing  they had brought a fishingline and a few hooks among other small things from the indian camp  this line was now got out overhauled and baited with a bit of the young ducks breast  from the end of the point of rocks which had been named the wharf the line was cast for there the lake was deep  take the end of the line nell i want you to catch the first fish  how dye know we shall catchoh ohooh  the fish in silver lake had never seen a bait or felt a hook in their lives before that day they actually fought for the prize  a big bullyas is usually the case in other spheres of lifegained it and found he had caught a tartar he nearly pulled nelly into the lake but roy sprang to the rescue and before the childs shout of surprise had ceased to echo among the cliffs a beautiful silvery fish about a foot and a half long lay tumbling on the strand  hurray cried roy  try again  they did try again and again and over again until they had caught two dozen and a half of those peculiar whitefish which swarm in most of the lakes of north america  then they stopped being somewhat exhausted and having more than enough for present use  before sitting down to supper that night they preserved their fish in the simple but effective manner which is practised among the furtraders in cold weather and which they had learned while with the indians each fish was split open and cleaned out and then hung up by the tail to dry  what a jolly time we shall have of it said roy with his mouth full as he sat beside nelly and toasted his toes that night at supper  yes said nellyifif we were only a little nearer home  this reply made them both silent and sad for a time  never mind resumed roy cheerily as he began another whitefish having already finished one fish and the ducklingcheer up nell well stay here long enough to get up a stock o dried meat and then set off again  i only wish it would come frost to make our fish keep  roys wish was gratified sooner than he expected and much more fully than he desired    chapter ten  changes sliding fishing etcetera  that night king frost spread his wings over the land with unwonted suddenness and rigour insomuch that a sheet of ice full an inch thick sealed up the waters of silver lake  roy and nelly had feasted heartily and had piled wood on the fire so high that the hut was comparatively warm and they slept soundly till morning but about sunrise the fire having died out they both awoke shivering with cold  being very sleepy they tried for some time to drop off again in spite of the cold  failing in this roy at last jumped up with vigour and said he would light the fire but he had scarcely issued from the hut when a shout brought nelly in alarm and haste to his side  if silver lake was worthy of its name before it was infinitely more worthy of it now  the sun had just overtopped the opposite ridge and was streaming over a very world of silver  the frozen lake was like a sheet of the purest glass which reflected the silvery clouds and white rolling mists of morning as perfectly in their form as the realities that floated in the blue sky  every tree every twig seemed made of silver being encased in hoarfrost and as these moved very gently in the calm airfor there was no breezemillions of crystalline points caught the suns rays and scattered them around with dazzling lustre nature seemed robed in cloth of diamonds but the comparison is feeble for what diamonds cut by man can equal those countless crystal gems that are fashioned by the hand of god to decorate for an hour or two the spotless robe of a winter morning  had roy been a man and nelly a woman the two would probably have cast around a lingering glance of admiration and then gone quietly about their avocations but being children they made up their minds on the spot to enjoy the state of things to the utmost  they ran down to the lake and tried the ice  finding that it was strong enough to bear them they advanced cautiously out upon its glassy surface then they tried to slide but did not succeed well owing to their soft mocassins being ill adapted for sliding  then they picked up stones and tried how far they could make them skim out on the lake  how i wish we could slide exclaimed nelly pausing in the midst of her amusement  roy also paused and appeared to meditate for a minute  so you shall said he quickly  come and let us breakfast and ill make you a pair of sliders  sliders what are they  you shall see get breakfast ready a mans fit for nothing without grub  while breakfast was preparing roy began to fashion wooden soles for his sisters feet and his own  these he fixed on by means of strips of deerskin which were sunk into grooves in the under part of the soles to prevent them from chafing  rough and ready they were nevertheless they fitted well and tightly to their feet but it was found that the want of a joint at the instep rendered it difficult to walk with these soles on and impossible to run  roys ingenuity however soon overcame this difficulty  he cut the soles through just under the instep and then boring two holes in each part lashed them firmly together with deerskin thus producing a joint or hinge  eager to try this new invention he fastened on his own sliders first and running down to the lake made a rush at the ice and sent himself off with all his force  never was boy more taken by surprise he went skimming over the surface like a stone from a sling  the other side of the lake seemed to be the only termination of his journey  what if it should not be bearing in the middle  his delight was evinced by a cheer  it was echoed with the addition of a laugh by nell who stood in rapt admiration on the shore  roy began well with his legs far apart and his arms in the air then he turned round and advanced the wrong way then he staggeredtried to recover himself failed shouted cheered again and fell flat on his back and performed the remainder of the journey in that position  it was a magnificent slide and was repeated and continued with every possible and conceivable modification for full two hours at the end of which time nelly said she couldnt take another slide to save her life and roy felt as if every bone in his body were going out of joint  this is all very well said roy as they went up to the hut together but it wont do much in the way of getting us a supply of meat or fish  thats true assented nelly  well then continued roy well rest a bit and then set to work its quite plain that we can have no more wading after ducks but the fish wont object to feed in cold weather so well try them again after having had a bit to eat  in pursuance of this plan the two went to the wharf after having refreshed themselves and set to work with the fishingline  nelly baited the hook and roy cut a hole in the ice with his axe  having put in the hook and let it down to the bottom they stood at the edge of the holeexpectant  frost seems to spoil their appetite said roy in a tone of disappointment after about five minutes had elapsed  a fish seemed to have been listening for before nelly could reply there came a violent tug at the line  roy returned a still more violent tug and instead of hauling it up hand over hand ran swiftly along the ice drawing the line after him until the fish came out of the hole with a flop and a severe splutter  it was above four pounds weight and they afterwards found that the deeper the water into which the line was cast the larger were the fish procured  whitefish were the kind they caught most of but there were a species of trout much resembling a salmon in colour and flavour of which they caught a good many above ten and even fifteen pounds weight  all these fish except those reserved for immediate use they cleaned and hung up in the manner already described  thus they occupied themselves for several days and as the work was hard they did not wander much from their hut but ate their meals with appetite and slept at nights soundly  one night just as they were about to lay down to rest roy went out to fetch an armful of firewood  he returned with a look of satisfaction on his face  look here nell what call ye that pointing to a few specks of white on his breast and arms  snow exclaimed nelly  aysnow its come at last and i am glad of it for we have far more than enough o grub now and its time we were off from this  you see lass we cant expect to find much game on a journey in winter so we must carry all we can with us  our backs wont take so much as the sled but the sled cant go loaded till theres snow on the ground so the moment there is enough of it well set off  before starting howsever i must go off and try for a deer for men cant walk well on fish alone and when im away you can be getting the snowshoes repaired and the sledlashings overhauled  we will set about all that tomorrow  but isnt tomorrow sabbath said nelly  so tis  i forgot well we can put it off till monday  it may be well here to remark that mrs gore being a sincere christian had a great reverence for the sabbathday and had imbued her children with some of her own spirit in regard to it  during the troubles and anxieties of the period when the children were lost in the snow and captured by the indians they had lost count of the days of the week  roy was not much troubled about this but his sisters tender conscience caused her much uneasiness and when they afterwards ran away from the indians and could do as they pleased they agreed together to fix a sabbathday for themselves beginning with the particular day on which it first occurred to them that they had not kept a sabbath for a long long time  we cant find out the right day now you know observed nelly in an apologetic tone  of course not said roy besides it dont matter because you remember how it is in the ten commandments six days shalt thou labour and do all thy work but the seventh day is the sabbath  we will keep today then work six days and then keep the seventh day  we have elsewhere observed that roy was a bit of a philosopher  having reasoned the matter out thus philosophically the children held to their resolve they travelled six days and observed every seventh day as the sabbath  the particular sabbathday about which we are writing turned out to be a memorable one as we shall see  roy and nelly lay down that night side by side as was their wont with their separate blankets wrapped around them and their feet pointing towards the fire  of course they never undressed at night on this journey but washed their underclothing as they found time and opportunity  soon they were sound asleep and their gentle breathing was the only sound that broke the stillness of the night  but snow was falling silently in thick heavy flakes and it soon lay deep on the bosom of silver lake  towards morning the wind arose and snowdrift began to whirl round the hut and block up its low doorway  still the brother and sister slumbered peacefully undisturbed by the gathering storm    chapter eleven  a change in the weatherrabbits and bears appear  hi  hallo  i say nelly whats all this  there was good cause for the tone of surprise in which roy uttered these words when he awoke for the fireplace and the lower half of his own as well as his sisters blanket were covered with at least half a foot of snow  it had found its way in at the hole in the roof of the hut and the wind had blown a great deal through the crevices of the doorway so that a snowwreath more than a foot high lay close to nellys elbow  this was bad enough but what made it worse was that a perfect hurricane was blowing outside  fortunately the hut was sheltered by the woods and by a high cliff on the windward side but this cliff although it broke the force of the gale occasioned an eddy which sent fearful gusts and thick clouds of snow ever and anon full against the doorway  o roy what shall we do said nelly in an anxious tone  dont know said roy jumping up and tightening his belt you never can know whats got to be done till youve took an observation o whats goin on as daddy used to say  hallo hold on  i say if it goes on like this itll blow the hut down  come nelly dont whimper its only a puff after all an if it did capsize us it wouldnt be the first time we had a tumble in the snow  seems to me that were goin to have a stormy sabbath though  rouse up lass and while youre clearin off the snow ill go get a bundle o sticks and light the fire  roy stooped to pass under the low doorway or rather hole of the hut and bending his head to the blast passed out while nelly whose heart was cheered by her brothers confident tone more than by his words set about shovelling away the snowdrift with great activity  presently roy returned staggering under a heavy load of firewood  ho  nell he cried flinging down the wood with a clatter just you come an see silver lake  such a sight it is you never saw but come slick offnever mind your belt just roll your blanket round you over head and earsthere said he assisting to fasten the rough garment and seizing his sisters hand hold on tight by me  oh what a storm gasped the little girl as she staggered out and came within the full force of the gale  it was indeed a storm such as would have appalled the hearts of youngsters less accustomed to the woods than were our hero and heroine but roy and nelly had been born and bred in the midst of stormy backwoods elements and were not easily alarmed chiefly because they had become accustomed to estimate correctly the extent of most of the dangers that menaced them from time to time  a gale of the fiercest kind was blowing  in its passage it bent the trees until they groaned and creaked again it tore off the smaller twigs and whisked them up into the air it lifted the snow in masses out of the open spots in the woods and hurled them in cloudlike volumes everywhere and it roared and shrieked through the valleys and round the mountain tops as if a thousand evil spirits were let loose upon the scene  silver lake was still silvery in its aspect for the white drift was flying across it like the waves of a raging sea but here being exposed the turmoil was so tremendous that there was no distinguishing between earth lake and sky  confusion worse confounded reigned every where or rather appeared to reign for in point of fact there is no confusion whatever in the works and ways of god  common sense if unfallen would tell us that  the word reveals it and science of late years has added its testimony thereto  roy and nelly very naturally came to the conclusion that things were in a very disordered state indeed on that sabbath morning so they returned to their hut to spend the day as best they might  their first care was to kindle the fire and prepare breakfast  while nelly was engaged in this roy went out and cut several small trees with which he propped the hut all round to prevent it from being blown down  but it was discovered first that the fire would hardly kindle and second that when it was kindled it filled the whole place with smoke  by dint of perseverance however breakfast was cooked and devoured after which the fire was allowed to go out as the smoke had almost blinded them  never mind nell cheer up said roy on concluding breakfast well rig up a tent to keep the snow off us  the snow be it understood had been falling into the fire and more or less upon themselves through the hole in the roof so they made a tent inside the hut by erecting two posts with a ridgepole at a height of three feet from the ground over which they spread one of their blankets  under this tent they reclined with the other blankets spread over them and chatted comfortably during the greater part of that day  of course their talk was chiefly of home and of the mother who had been the sun and the joy of their existence up to that sad day when they were lost in the snow and naturally they conversed of the bible and the hymns which their mother had made the chief objects of their contemplation on the sabbaths they had spent at fort enterprise  monday was as bad as sunday in regard to weather but tuesday dawned bright and calm so that our wanderers were enabled to resume their avocations  the snowshoes were put in order the sled was overhauled and mended and more fish were caught and hung up to dry  in the evening roy loaded his gun with ball put on his snowshoes and sallied forth alone to search for deer  he carried with him several small pieces of line wherewith to make rabbit snares for the moment the snow fell innumerable tracks revealed the fact that there were thousands of rabbits in that region  nelly meanwhile busied herself in putting the hut in order and in repairing the mocassins which would be required for the journey home  lest any reader should wonder where our heroine found materials for all the mending and repairing referred to we may remark that the indians in the wilderness were and still are supplied with needles beads cloth powder and shot guns axes etcetera etcetera by the adventurous furtraders who penetrate deep and far into the wilderness of north america and when nelly and roy ran away from their captors they took care to carry with them an ample supply of such things as they might require in their flight  about half a mile from the hut roy set several snares  he had often helped his father in such work and knew exactly how to do it selecting a rabbittrack at a spot where it passed between two bushes he set his snare so that it presented a loop in the centre of the path this loop was fastened to the bough of a tree bent downwards and so arranged that it held fast to a root in the ground when a rabbit should endeavour to leap or force through it he would necessarily pull away the fastening that held it down and the bough would spring up and lift the hapless creature by the neck off the ground  having set halfadozen such snares roy continued his march in search of deertracks  he was unsuccessful but to his surprise he came suddenly on the huge track of a bear  being early in the season this particular bruin had not yet settled himself into his winter quarters so roy determined to make a trap for him  he had not much hope of catching him but resolved to try and not to tell nelly of his discovery until he should see the result  against the face of a cliff he raised several huge stones so as to form a sort of box or cave or hole the front of which was open the sides being the stones referred to and the back the cliff  then he felled a tree as thick as his waist which stood close by and so managed that it fell near to his trap  by great exertions and with the aid of a wooden lever prepared on the spot he rolled this treewhen denuded of its branchesclose to the mouth of the trap  next he cut three small pieces of stick in such a form that they made a triggersomething like the figure 4on which the tree might rest  on the top of this trigger he raised the treestem and on the end of the trigger which projected into the trap he stuck a piece of dried fish so that when the bear should creep under the stem and touch the bait it would disarrange the trigger set it off and the heavy stem would fall on bruins back  as he knew however that bears were very strong he cut several other thick stems and piled them on the first to give it additional weight  all being ready and the evening far advanced he returned to the hut to supper    chapter twelve  roys dream  nelly yeaaow exclaimed roy yawning as he awoke on the following morning from a dream in which bears figured largely what a night ive had of it to be surefightin like a mad buffalo with here roy paused abruptly  well what were you fighting with asked nell with a smile that ended in a yawn  i wont tell you just now lass as it might spoil your appetite for breakfast  set about getting that ready as fast as you can for i want to be off as soon as possible to visit my snares  i guess we shall have rabbits for dinner today  what are you going to do with the sled inquired nelly observing that her brother was overhauling the lashings and dragrope  well i set a lot o snares an theres no sayin how many rabbits may have got into em  besides if the rabbits in them parts are tenderhearted a lot o their relations may have died o grief so i shall take the sled to fetch em all home  after breakfast roy loaded his gun with ball and putting on his snowshoes sallied forth with an admonition to his sister to have a roarin fire ready to cook a rare feast  nelly laughingly replied that she would and so they parted  the first part of roys journey that day led him through a thicklywooded part of the country  he went along with the quick yet cautious and noiseless step of a hunter accustomed to the woods from infancy  his thoughts were busy within him and far away from the scene in which he moved yet such is the force of habit he never for a moment ceased to cast quick inquiring glances on each side as he went along  nothing escaped his observation  oh if i could only get a deer this day thought he how scrumptious it would be  what he meant by scrumptious is best known to himself but at that moment a large deer suddenlyperhaps scrumptiouslyappeared on the brow of a ridge not fifty yards in advance of him  they had been both walking towards each other all that forenoon  roy having no powers of scent beyond human powers did not know the fact and as the wind was blowing from the deer to the hunter the formergifted though he was with scenting powerswas also ignorant of the approaching meeting  one instant the startled deer stood in bewildered surprise  one instant roy paused in mute amazement  the next instant the deer wheeled round while roys gun leaped to his shoulder  there was a loud report followed by reverberating echoes among the hills and the deer lay dead on the snow  the young hunter could not repress a shout of joy for he not only had secured a noble stag but he had now a sufficiency of food to enable him to resume his homeward journey  his first impulse was to run back to the hut with the deers tongue and a few choice bits to tell nelly of his good fortune but on second thoughts he resolved to complete the business on which he had started leaving the deer where it fell he went on and found that the snares had been very successful  some indeed had been broken by the strength of the boughs to which they had been fastened and others remained as he had set them but above twothirds of them had each a rabbit hung up by the neck so that the sled was pretty well loaded when all the snares had been visited  he had by this time approached the spot where the beartrap was set and naturally began to grow a little anxious for although his chance of success was very slight his good fortune that morning had made him more sanguine than usual  there is a proverb which asserts that it never rains but it pours  it would seem to be a common experience of mankind that pieces of good fortune as well as misfortunes come not singly  whether the proverb be true or no this experience was realised by roy on that day for he actually did find a bear in his trap  moreover it was alive and apparently had only just been caught for it struggled to free itself with a degree of ferocity that was terrible to witness  it was an ordinary black bear of considerable size and immense strength heavy and thick though the trees were that lay on its back and crushed it to the earth it caused them to shake leap and quiver as though they had been endowed with life  roy was greatly alarmed for he perceived that at each successive struggle the brute was ridding itself of the superincumbent load while fierce growls and short gasps indicated at once the wrath and the agony by which it was convulsed  roy had neglected to reload his piece after shooting the deera most unhunterlike error which was the result of excitement  thinking that he had not time to load he acted now on the first suggestion of his bold spirit  resting his gun against a tree he drew the small axe that hung at his belt and attacked the bear  the first blow was well delivered and sank deep into bruins skull but that skull was thick and the brain was not reached  a roar and a furious struggle caused roy to deliver his second blow with less effect but this partial failure caused his pugnacity to rise and he immediately rained down blows on the head and neck of the bear so fast and furious that the snow was speedily covered with blood  in proportion as roy strove to end the conflict by vigorous and quick blows the bear tried to get free by furious efforts  he shook the treestem that held him down so violently that one of the other trees that rested on it fell off and thus the load was lightened  roy observed this and made a desperate effort to split the bears skull in his haste he misdirected the blow which fell not on the head but on the neck in which the iron head of the axe was instantly burieda main artery was severed and a fountain of blood sprang forth  this was fortunate for the bears strength was quickly exhausted and in less than two minutes after it sank dead upon the snow  roy sat down to rest and wipe the blood from his hands and garments and then cutting off the claws of the animal as a trophy he left it there for a time  having now far more than it was possible for him to drag to the hut he resolved to proceed thither with the rabbits and bring nelly back to help him to drag home the deer  well done roy cried nelly clapping her hands when her brother approached with the sledload of rabbits but you are covered with blood  have you cut yourself  she became nervously anxious for she well knew that a bad cut on a journey costs many a man his life as it not only disables from continuing the journey but from hunting for provisions  all right nell but ive killed a deerandandsomething else come lass get on your snowshoes and follow me  well drag home the deer and then see what is to be done with the  oh what is it do tell cried nell eagerly  well then its a bear  nonsensetell me true now  thats the truth nell as you shall see and here are the claws  look sharp now and lets off  away went these two through the snow until they came to where the deer had been left  it was hard work to get it lashed on the sled and much harder work to drag it over the snow but by dint of perseverance and resolution they got it home  they were so fatigued however that it was impossible to think of doing the same with the bear  this was a perplexing state of things for roy had observed a wolftrack when out and feared that nothing but the bones would be left in the morning  what is to be done said nelly with that pretty air of utter helplessness which she was wont to assume when she felt that her brother was the proper person to decide  roy pondered a few moments and then said abruptly campout nelly  campout  ay beside the bearkeep it company all night with a big fire to scare away the wolves  well put everything into the hut block up the door and kindle a huge fire outside that will burn nearly all night  so now lets go about it at once  although nelly did not much relish the idea of leaving their comfortable hut and going out to encamp in the snow beside the carcase of a dead bear she was so accustomed to regard her brothers plans as perfect and to obey him promptly that she at once began to assist in the necessary preparations  having secured everything safely in the hut and kindled a fire near it which was large enough to have roasted an ox they set off for the beartrap and reached it in time to scare away a large wolf which was just going to begin his supper on bruin  an encampment was then made in the usual way close to the beartrap a fire as large as could be conveniently made was kindled and the brother and sister wrapped themselves in their blankets and lay comfortably down beside it to spend the night there    chapter thirteen  shooskin  next day roy and nelly rose with the sun and spent the forenoon in skinning and cutting up the bear for they intended to dry part of the meat and use it on their journey  the afternoon was spent in dragging the various parts to the hut  in the evening roy proposed that they should go and have a shoosk  nelly agreed so they sallied forth to a neighbouring slope with their sledge  shoosking good reader is a game which is played not only by children but by men and women it is also played in various parts of the world such as canada and russia and goes by various names but we shall adopt the name used by our hero and heroine namely shoosking  it is very simple but uncommonly violent and consists in hauling a sledge to the top of a snowhill or slope getting upon it and sliding down to the bottom  of course the extent of violence depends on the steepness of the slope the interruptions that occur in it and the nature of the ground at the bottom  we once shoosked with an indian down a woodcutters track on the side of a steep hill which had a sharp turn in it with a pile of firewood at the turn and a hole in the snow at the bottom in which were a number of old empty casks  our great difficulties in this place were to take the turn without grazing the firewood and to stop our sledges before reaching the hole  we each had separate sledges  for some time we got on famously but at last we ran into the pile of firewood and tore all the buttons off our coat and the indian went down into the hole with a hideous crash among the empty casks yet strange to say neither of us came by any serious damage  theres a splendid slope said roy as they walked briskly along the shores of silver lake dragging the sledge after them just beyond the big cliff but im afraid its too much for you  oh i can go if you can said nell promptly  youve a good opinion of yourself  i guess i could make you sing small if i were to try  then dont try said nelly with a laugh  see continued roy theres the slope you see it is very steep wed go down it like a streak of greased lightnin but i dont like to try it  why not  it seems easy enough to me  im sure we have gone down as steep places before at home  ay lass but not with a roundbacked drift like that at the bottom it has got such a curve that i think it would make us fly right up into the air  nelly admitted that it looked dangerous but suggested that they might make a trial  well so we will but ill go down by myself first said roy arranging the sledge at the summit of a slope which was full fifty feet high  now then pick up the bits tenderly nell if im knocked to pieces here goes hurrah  roy had seated himself on the sledge with his feet resting on the head of it and holding on to the sidelines with both hands firmly  he pushed off as he cheered and the next moment was flying down the hill at railway speed with a cloud of snowdrift rolling like steam behind him  he reached the foot and the impetus sent him up and over the snowdrift or wave and far out upon the surface of the lake  it is true he made one or two violent swerves in this wild descent owing to inequalities in the hill but by a touch of his hands in the snow on either side he guided the sledge as with a rudder and reached the foot in safety  may i venture roy inquired nell eagerly as the lad came panting up the hill  venture  of course  i rose off the top o the drift only a little bit hardly felt the crack at all come get you on in front and ill sit at yer back an steer  nelly needed no second bidding  she sat down and seized the sidelines of the sledge with a look of what we may call wild expectation roy sat down behind her  now lass steady and away we go  at the last word they shot from the hilltop like an arrow from a bow the cloud of snow behind them rolled thicker for the sledge was more heavily laden than before  owing to the same cause it plunged into the hollow at the foot of the hill with greater violence and shot up the slope of the snowdrift and over its crest with such force that it sprung horizontally forward for a few feet in the air and came to the ground with a crash that extracted a loud gasp from roy and a sharp squeak from nelly  it was found to be so delightful however that they tried it again and again each time becoming more expert and therefore more confident  excessive confidence however frequently engenders carelessness  roy soon became reckless nelly waxed fearless  the result was that the former steered somewhat wildly and finally upset  their last shoosk that evening was undertaken just as the suns latest rays were shooting between the hills on the opposite side of silver lake and casting a crimson glow on the hut and the surrounding scenery roy had fixed a snowshoe on the outer ridge of the snowdrift to mark the distance of their last leap from its crest and had given the sledge an extra push on the way down to increase its impetus  this extra push disconcerted him in steering he reached the hollow in a sidelong fashion shot up the slope of the drift waveringly and left its crest with a swing that not only turned the sledge right round but also upside down  of course they were both thrown off and all three fell into the snow in a condition of dire confusion  fortunately no damage was done beyond the shock and the fright but this accident was sufficient to calm their spirits and incline them to go home to supper  well its great fun no doubt but we must turn our minds to more earnest work for our journey lies before us said roy with the gravity of an iroquois warrior as he sat beside the fire that night discussing a bearsteak with his sister  we have more than enough of fish and meat you see a day or two will do to turn our deer and bear into dried meat the snowshoes are mended the sledge is in good order as tonights work has proved and all that weve got to do is to start fresh with true bearins andhey for home  i wish i was there said nelly laying down a marrowbone with a sigh  wishin aint enough nell  i know that an im ready to work said nelly resuming the bone with a resolute air  when shall we set out  when we are ready lass  we shall begin to dry the meat tomorrow an as soon as its fixedoff well start  i only hope the cold weather will last for if it came warm it would go hard with your little feet nell  but lets turn in now  hard work requires a good sleep an it may be that weve harder work than we think before us    chapter fourteen  the journey home resumed and interrupted  three days more and our young friends bade farewell to silver lake  short though their stay had been it had proved very pleasant for it was full of energetic labour and active preparation besides a great deal of amusement so that quite a home feeling had been aroused in their minds and their regret at leaving was considerable  but after the first few miles of their journey had been accomplished the feeling of sadness with which they set out wore away and hopeful anticipations of being home again in a few weeks rendered them cheerful and enabled them to proceed with vigour  the weather at starting was fine too so that the night encampments in the snow were comparatively agreeable and the progress made during the first few days was satisfactory  after this however the good fortune of our adventurers seemed to desert them  first of all one of nellys snowshoes broke down  this necessitated a halt of half a day in order to have it repaired  then one of roys snowshoes gave way which caused another halt  after this a heavy snowstorm set in rendering the walking very difficult as they sank snowshoes and all nearly to the knees at each step  a storm of wind which arose about the same time effectually stopped their farther advance and obliged them to take to the shelter of a dense part of the woods and encamp  during three days and three nights the hurricane raged and the snow was blown up in the air and whirled about like the foam of the roaring sea but our wanderers did not feel its effects much for they had chosen a very sheltered spot at the foot of a large pine which grew in a hollow where a cliff on one side and a bluff of wood on the other rendered the blast powerless  its fierce howling could be heard however if not felt and as the brother and sister lay at the bottom of their hole in the snow with their toes to the comfortable fire they chatted much more cheerily than might have been expected in the midst of such a scene and gazed upward from time to time with comparative indifference at the dark clouds and snowdrifts that were rushing madly overhead  on the fourth day the gale subsided almost as quickly as it had arisen and roy announced that it was his intention to start  in a few minutes everything was packed up and ready  i say nell said roy just as they were about to leave the camp dont the sled look smaller than it used to  so it does roy but i suppose its because we have eaten so much during the last three days  roy shook his head and looked carefully round the hole they were about to quit  dont know lass it seems to me as if somethin was awantin  did ye pack your own bundle very tight  yes i think i did it tighter than usual but im not very sure  humthats it no doubtweve packed the sled tighter and eaten it down  well lets off now  so saying roy threw the lines of the sledge over his shoulder and led the way followed by his sister whose only burden was a light blanket fastened as a bundle to her shoulders and a small tin can which hung at her belt  the country through which they passed that day was almost destitute of wood being a series of undulating plains with clumps of willows and stunted trees scattered over it like islets in the sea  the land lay in a succession of ridges or steppes which descended from the elevated region they were leaving and many parts of these ridges terminated abruptly in sheer precipices from forty to sixty feet high  the sun shone with dazzling brilliancy insomuch that the travellers eyes became slightly affected by snowblindness  this temporary blindness is very common in these regions and ranges from the point of slight dazzlement to that of total blindness fortunately it is curable by the removal of the causethe bright light of the sun on pure snow esquimaux use goggles or spectacles made of wood with a narrow slit in them as a preventive of snowblindness  at first neither roy nor nelly felt much inconvenience but towards evening they could not see as distinctly as usual  one consequence of this was that they approached a precipice without seeing it  the snow on its crest was so like to the plain of snow extending far below that it might have deceived one whose eyesight was not in any degree impaired  the first intimation they had of their danger was the giving way of the snow that projected over the edge of the precipice  roy fell over headlong dragging the sledge with him  nelly who was a few feet behind him stood on the extreme edge of the precipice with the points of her snowshoes projecting over it  roy uttered a cry as he fell and his sister stopped short  a shock of terror blanched her cheek and caused her heart to stand still  she could not move or cry for a few seconds then she uttered a loud shriek and shrank backwards  there chanced to be a stout bush or tree growing on the face of the cliff not ten feet below the spot where the snowwreath had broken off roy caught at this convulsively and held on  fortunately the line on his shoulder broke and the sledge fell into the abyss below  had this not happened it is probable that he would have been dragged from his hold of the bush  as it was he maintained his hold and hung for a few seconds suspended in the air  nellys shriek revived him from the gush of deadly terror that seized him when he fell  he grasped the boughs above him and was quickly in a position of comparative security among the branches of the bush  all right nell he gasped on hearing her repeat her cry of despair im holdin on quite safe  keep back from the edge lasstheres no fear o me  are you sure roy cried nelly trembling very much as she stretched forward to try to catch sight of her brother  ay quite sure but i cant get up for theres six feet o smooth rock above me an nothin to climb up by  oh what shall i do cried nelly  dont get flurriedthats the main thing lass  let me thinkay thats ityouve got your belt  yes  well take it off and drop the end over to me but lie down on your breast and be careful  nelly obeyed and in a few seconds the end of the worsted belt that usually encircled her waist was dangling almost within reach of her brother  this belt was above five feet long  roy wore one of similar material and length  he untied it and then sought to lay hold of the other  with some difficulty and much risk of falling he succeeded and fastened his own belt to it firmly  now nell haul up a little bithold enough  what am i to do now asked nell piteously i cannot pull you up you know  of course not but take your snowshoe and dig down to the rocks youll find somethin i dare say to tie the belts to  cheer up lass and go at it  thus encouraged the active little girl soon cleared away the snow until she reached the ground where she found several roots of shrubs that seemed quite strong enough for her purpose  to one of these she tied the end of her belt and roy being an athletic lad hauled himself up hand over hand until he gained a place of safety  but the sledge is gone cried nelly pausing suddenly in the midst of her congratulations  ay and the grub said roy with a blank look  this was indeed too true and on examination it was found that things were even worse than had been anticipated for the sledge had fallen on a ledge half way down the precipice that was absolutely inaccessible either from above or below  an hour was spent in ascertaining this beyond all doubt and then roy determined to return at once to their last encampment to gather the scraps they had thrown away or left behind as useless  that night they went supperless to rest  next morning they set out with heavy hearts for the encampment of the previous day  on reaching it and searching carefully they found that one of the bundles of dry meat had been forgotten  this accounted for the lightness of the sledge and at the same time revived their drooping spirits  what is to be done now inquired nelly  return to silver lake said roy promptly  we must go back fish and hunt again until we have another supply o grub and then begin our journey once more  sadly and slowly they retraced their steps  do what he would roy could not cheer up his sisters spirits  she felt that her back was turned towards her fathers househer mothers homeand every step took her farther from it  it was a lovely evening about sunset when they reached silver lake and found the hut as they had left it and enough of old scraps of provisions to afford a sufficient meal  that night they ate their supper in a more cheerful frame of mind  next day they breakfasted almost with a feeling of heartiness and when they went out to resume their fishing and to set snares and make traps the old feeling of hopefulness returned  ere long hope became again so strong in their ardent young hearts that they laughed and talked and sported as they had done during the period of their first residence there  at first they were so anxious to make up the lost quantity of food that they did little else but fish hunt and dry their provisions when obtained but after a few days they had procured such an ample supply that they took to shoosking againhaving succeeded in making a new sledge  but a thaw came suddenly and spoiled all their fish  a wolf carried off the greater part of their dried meat one day while they were absent from the hut  after this the frost set in with extreme violence game became more scarce and fish did not take the bait so readily so that although they procured more than enough for present consumption they were slow in accumulating a travelling store and thus it came to pass that november found roy and nelly still toiling wearily yet hopefully on the shores of silver lake    chapter fifteen  the massacre  we must return now to robin gore and his wife who on the morning on which we reintroduce them to the reader were standing in the trading store of fort enterprise conversing earnestly with black the indian who has been already mentioned at the beginning of our tale  the wife of the latterthe white swanwas busily engaged in counting over the pack of furs that lay open on the counter absorbed apparently in an abstruse calculation as to how many yards of cloth and strings of beads they would purchase  well im glad thats fixed anyhow said robin to his wife as he turned to the indian with a satisfied air and addressed him in his native tongue its a bargain then that you an slugs go with me on this expedition ist so  the black swan is ready replied the indian quietly and he thinks that slugs will go toobut the white hunter is selfwilled he has a mouthask himself  ay ye dont like to answer for him said robin with a smile assuredly slugs has his own notions and holds to em but ill ask him  he is to be here this night with a deer i hope for there are many mouths to fill  black swan who was a tall taciturn and powerful indian here glanced at his wife who was like most indian women a humblelooking and not very pretty or clean creature  turning again to robin he said in a low soft voice  the white swan is not strong and she is not used to be alone  i understand you said robin she shall come to the fort and be looked after  you wont object to take her in molly when were away  object robin said molly with a smile which was accompanied by a sigh ill only be too glad to have her company  well then thats settled and now black swan i may as well tell you what coorse i mean to follow out in this sarch for my childn  you know already that four white menstrangershave come to the fort an are now smokin their pipes in the hall but you dont know that one on em is my own brother jefferson jeff ive bin used to call him  jeffs bin a haremscarem feller all his lifeactive and able enough an good naturd too but he never could stick to nothin an so hes bin wanderin about the world till grey hairs have begun to show on him without gettin a home or a wife  the last thing he tried was stokin a steamboat on the mississippi but the boat blew up pitched a lot o the passengers into the water an the rest o them into the next world jeff was always in luck with his life hes lost everythin over an over again but that  he was one o the lot as was blowed into the water so when he come up he swamed ashore an come straight away here to visit me bringin three o the blowedup passengers with him  the three are somethin like himself good for nothin an id rather have their room than their company at most times  howsever just at this time im very glad theyve come for ill leave them in charge o the fort and set off to look for the childn in two days from this  ill take walter and larry wi me for brother jeff is able enough to manage the trade if redskins come he can fight too if need be  the gore family could always do that so ye neednt be afraid molly  ill not be afraid robin but ill be anxious about ye  thats natral lass but it cant be helped  well then continued robin the five of us will start for the black hills  ive bin told by a redskin who comed here last week that he an his tribe had had a scrimmage with hawk an the reptiles that follow him  he says that there was a white boy an a white girl with hawks party an from his account of em im sartin sure its my roy and nelly  god help em but says he they made their escape durin the attack an we followed our enemies so far that we didnt think it worth while to return to look for em so im convinced they made for the black hills nigh which hawk was attacked an if we follow em up there we may find em alive yet mayhap  poor robins voice became deeper and less animated as he spoke and the last word was uttered with hesitation and in a whisper  o robin robin exclaimed mrs gore throwing her arms suddenly round her husbands neck and hiding her sobbing face in his breast dye think they can still be alive  come molly said robin commanding his feelings with a great effort hant ye often read to me that wi god all things is possible  the poor woman thanked god in her heart for up to that day robin had never once quoted scripture in his efforts to comfort her  was wapaw with hawk when they were attacked inquired the black swan  wapaw is dead said a deep voice as the huge form of a western hunter darkened the little doorway and the next moment slugs strode into the store and quietly seated himself on the counter  dead exclaimed robin as he shook the hunters proffered hand  ay dead  have ye no word of welcome for a chum after a months absence said slugs holding out his horny hand to the black swan who gravely grasped and shook it  you redskins are a queer lot said slugs with a grin yer as stiff as a rifle ramrod to look at but theres warm and good stuff in ee for all that  but what about wapaw inquired mrs gore anxiously surely hes not dead  if hes not dead hes not livin for i saw hawk himself not four weeks ago shoot him and follow him up with his tomahawk and then heard their shout as they killed him  where did he say he was goin when he left you  he said he would go down to the settlements to see the missionaries an that he thought o lookin in on the furtraders that set up a fort last year fifty miles to the southard o this  ay just so said slugs i was puzzled to know what he was doin thereaway and that explains it  hes dead now an so are the furtraders he went to see  ill tell ye all about it if youll give me baccy enough to fill my pipe  i ran out ot three days agone an ha bin smokin tealeaves an bark an all sorts o trash  thank ee thats a scent more sweet nor roses  as he said this the stout hunter cut up the piece of tobacco which robin at once handed to him and rolled it with great zest between his palms when the pipe was filled and properly lighted he leaned his back against an unopened bale of goods that lay on the counter and drawing several whiffs began his narrative  you must know that i made tracks for the noo furtradin post when i left you black swan about a month ago  i hadnt much of a object it was mainly cooriosity as took me there  i got there all right an was sittin in the hall chattin wi the head manmacdonell they called himabout the trade and the injuns  macdonells two little childn was playin about a boy an a girl as lively as kittens an his wifea goodlookin young oomanwas lookin arter em when the door opens and in stalks a longlegged injun  it was wapaw  down he sat in front o the fireplace an after some palaver an a pipefor your injunsll never tell all theyve got to say at oncehe tells macdonell that there was a dark plot hatchin agin himthat hawk a big rascal of his own tribe had worked upon a lot o reptiles like hisself an they had made up their minds to come an massacre everybody at the fort and carry off the goods  at first macdonell didnt seem to believe the injun but when i told him i knowed him an that he was a trustworthy man he was much troubled an in doubt what to do  now its quite clear to me that hawk must have somehow found out or suspected that wapaw was goin to peach on him an that he had followed his trail close up for in less than an hour arter wapaw arrived an while we was yet sittin smokin by the fire there was a most tremendous yell outside  i knowd it for the warwhoop o the redskins so i jumped up an cocked my rifle  the others jumped up too like lightnin an mrs macdonell she got hold o her girlie in her arms an was runnin across the hall to her own room when the door was knocked off its hinges and fell flat on the floor before it had wellnigh fallen i got sight o somethin an let drive the yell that follered told me i had spoilt somebodys aim  a volley was poured on us next moment an a redskin jumped in but wapaws tomahawk sent him out again with a split skull  before they could reloadfor the stupid fools had all fired togetheri had the door up and a heavy table shoved agin it  then i turned round to load agin while i was doin this i observed poor macdonell on his knees beside his wife so i went to them an found that the wife an girl were stone deadboth shot through the heart with the same ball  as soon as macdonell saw this he rose up quietly but with a look on his face sich as i never see in a man xcept when he means to stick at nothin  he got hold of his doublebarrelled gun an stuck a scalpin knife an an axe in his belt  git on my back tommy says he to his little boy who was cryin in a corner  tommy got up at once an jumped on his dads back  all this time the redskins were yellin round the house like fiends an batterin the door so that it was clear it couldnt stand long  friends said he turnin to me an wapaw an a poor terrified chap that was the only one o his men as chanced to be in the house at the time friends its every man for himself now ill cut my way though them or  he stopped short an took hold o his axe in one hand an his gun in the other  are ye ready says he  we threw forward our rifles an cocked em macdonellhe was a big strong mansuddenly upset the table the savages dashed in the door with sich force that three or four o em fell sprawlin on the floor  we jumped over these before they could rise and fired a volley which sent three or four o the reptiles behind on their backs  we got into the bush without a scratch an used our legs well i can tell ee  they fired a volley after us which missed us all except poor tommy  a bullet entered his brain an killed him dead  for some time his father would not drop him though i told him he was quite dead but his weight kept him from runnin fast an we heard the redskins gainin on us so at last macdonell put the boy down tenderly under a bush  me and wapaw stopped to fire an keep the reptiles back but they fired on us and wapaw fell  i tried to lift him but he struggled out o my arms  poor fellow he was a brave man and ive no doubt did it apurpose knowin that i couldnt run fast enough with him  just then i saw hawk come jumpin and yellin at us followed by two or three dozen redskins all flourishin their tomahawks  macdonell and me turned to die fightin alongside o our red comrade but wapaw suddenly sprang up uttered a shout of defiance an dashed into the bush  the injuns were after him in a moment and before we could get near them a yell of triumph told us that it was too late so we turned and bolted in different directions  i soon left them behind me but i hung about the place for a day or two to see if macdonell should turn up or any of his men  i even went back to the fort after the reptiles had left it  they had burned it down an i saw parts o the limbs o the poor wife and child lyin among the halfburned goods that they werent able to carry away with them    chapter sixteen  vengeance  the terrible tale which was related by slugs had the effect of changing robin gores plans  he resolved to pursue the murderers and inflict summary punishment on them before setting off on the contemplated search for his lost children and he was all the more induced to do this that there was some hope he might be able to obtain a clue to their whereabouts from some of the prisoners whom he hoped to seize  it might be thought by some a rash step for him to takethe pursuit of a band of about fifty savages with a party of six men  but backwood hunters were bold fellows in those days and indians were by no means noted for reckless courage  six stout resolute and wellarmed men were in robins opinion quite a match for fifty redskins  he could not muster more than six because it was absolutely necessary to leave at least three men to guard fort enterprise  robin therefore resolved to leave his brother jeff to look after it with two of the strangers and jeff accepted the charge with pleasure saying he would defend the place agin a hundred red reptiles  the third strangera man named stiffhe resolved to take with him  the warparty when mustered consisted of robin gore his nephew walter larry odowd the black swan slugs the hunter and stiff the stranger  armed to the teeth these six put on their snowshoes the following morning and set forth on their journey in silence  now this change of plans wasall unknown to robinthe means of leading him towards instead of away from his lost little ones  for roy and nelly had travelled so far during their long wanderings from the black hillsthe place where they escaped from the indiansthat they were at that time many long miles away from them in another direction  in fact if robin had carried out his original plan of search he would have been increasing the distance between himself and his children every step he took  not knowing this however and being under the impression that each days march lessened his chance of ultimately finding his lost ones he walked along mile after mile and day after day in stern silence  on the third day out towards evening the party descried a thin line of blue smoke rising above the treetops  they had reached an elevated and somewhat hilly region so that the ground favoured their approach by stealth nevertheless fearing to lose their prey they resolved to wait till dark and take their enemies if such they should turn out to be by surprise  soon after sunset robin gave the word to advance  each man of the party laid aside his blanket and left his provisions etcetera in the encampment taking with him his arms only  i need not say that there must be no speaking and that we must tread lightly  youre up to redskin ways as well as me except mayhap our friend stiff here  stiff who was a tall yankee protested that he could chaw up his tongue and go as slick as a feline mouser  on nearing the fire they made a detour to examine the tracks that led to it and found from their number and other signs that it was indeed hawks party  robin advanced alone to reconnoitre  on returning he said  its just the reptiles theres forty of em if theres one an theyve got a white man bound with em no doubt from what you said of him slugs its macdonell but i dont see wapaw  i fear me that his days are over  now then lads heres our plan well attack them from six different points at once  well all give the warwhoop at the same moment takin the word from walter there whos got a loud pipe of his own then when the varmints start to their feetfor i dont like the notion o firin at men off their guardwalter larry an stiff will fire  black swan slugs an i will reserve our fire while you reload the reptiles will scatter of course an well give em a volley an a united yell as they cut stick thatll keep em from waitin for more  the plan thus hastily sketched was at once carried out  advancing stealthily to their several stations the six men as it were surrounded the savages who not dreaming of pursuit had neglected to place sentinels round the camp  when walters loud halloo rang in their ears the whole band sprang to their feet and seized their arms but three shots laid three of them dead on the ground  as they fled right and left the reserve fired and shot three others among whom was hawk himself  black swan had picked him out and shot him through the head  before they were quite out of shot the three who had first fired had reloaded and fired again with some effect for blood was afterwards observed on the snow  slugs now made a rush into the camp to unbind macdonell but to his horror he discovered that a knife was plunged up to the handle in his breast and that he was almost dead  hawk had evidently committed this cowardly deed on the first alarm for the knife was known to be his macdonell tried hard to speak but all that he was able to say was wapaw wounded escapedfollow  then his head fell back and he died  from the few words thus uttered however the pursuers concluded that wapaw was not dead but wounded and that he had escaped  if that be so said walter then they must have been on wapaws tracks an if we search we shall find em an may follow em up  true said slugs and the sooner were away from this the better for the reptiles may return and find us not so strong a band as they think  acting on this advice the whole party set off at once  wapaws track was soon discovered being of course a solitary one and in advance of his enemies who were in pursuit  following the track with untiring vigour the party found that it led them out of the lower country into a region high up amongst the hills    chapter seventeen  the pursuit  wapaw must have worked hard for we should have overhauled him by this time said walter to his uncle on the evening of the next day as they plodded steadily along through the snow  i would give up the pursuit said robin somewhat gloomily for its losin time that might be better spent on another search but it wont do to leave the crittur for if hes badly wounded he may die for want o help  guess he cant be very bad else hed niver travel so fast observed stiff who now that the chief murderer was punished did not care much to go in search of the wounded indian  when a man thinks a band o yellin redskins are follerin up his trail said slugs hes pretty sure to travel fast wounded or not woundedleastways if hes able  but i dont think well have to go much farther now for ive noticed that his stride aint so long as it was and thats a sartin sure sign that hes failin i only hope he wont go under before we find him  niver a fear o that said larry odowd with a grin  ive seed him as far gone as any one iver i comed across wi starvation but the way that fellow walked into the grub when he got the chance was wonderful to behold  i thought hed ait me out o the house entirely and he put so much flesh on his bones in a week or two that he was able to go about his business though he warnt no fatter when he began to ait than a consumptive darnin needle  true for yeits naither walkin starvin nor cowld asll kill wapaw  what does the black swan think inquired robin  we shall see wapaw when the sun is low tomorrow replied the indian  mayhap we shall quoth robin but it behooves us to get the steam up for tomorrow so comrades as theres a good clump o timber here away well camp  robin threw down his bundle as he spoke and his example was at once followed by the others each of whom set to work vigorously to assist in preparing the encampment  they had all the requisite implements for this purpose having returned after the attack on the indians for the things they had left behind them  its a pity that we shall have to keep watch tonight said walter one of us will have to do it i fancy for though i dont believe these murderin redskins have pluck to attack us it would not do to trust to that  slugs to whom this remark was addressed lowered the axe with which he was about to fell a neighbouring tree for firewood  thats true said he looking round him in all directions hold on comrades yonders a mound with a bare top wed better camp there makin a big blaze on sitch a placell show the red reptiles we dont care a gunflint for them and theyll not dare to come near so we wont have to watch  arrah an a purty spot itll be for the blackyirds to shoot us all aisy as were sottin at supper exclaimed larry odowd  doubtless theres a hollow on it rejoined slugs for the top is flat  humph maybe growled larry who still seemed to object but as the rest of the party were willing to adopt the suggestion he said no more and they all went to the top of the little mound which commanded a clear view of the surrounding country  as slugs had surmised there was a slight hollow on the summit of the mound which effectually screened the party from any one who might wish to fire at them from below and as there was no other mound in the immediate neighbourhood they felt quite secure  huge logs were cut and carried to the top of the mound the snow was cleared out of the hole pine branches were spread over it the fire was kindled the kettle put on and filled with snow and soon larry odowd was involved in the heat steam smoke and activities of preparing supper while his comrades spread out their blankets and lay down to smoke with their arms ready beside them  the fire roared up into the wintry sky causing the mound to resemble the cone or crater of a volcano which could be seen for miles round ever and anon while supper was being eaten the black swan or slugs would rise and going stealthily to the edge of the mound would peep cautiously over to make sure that none of their enemies were approaching  immediately after supper they all lay down to sleep but for a time each motionless form that lay rolled tightly in its blanket like an egyptian mummy sent a series of little puffs from its head  at last the stars came out and the pipes dropped from each sleepers lips then the moon rosea circumstance which rendered their position still more secureand the fire sank low  but slugs was too cautious a hunter to trust entirely to the alleged cowardice of the savages  he knew well that many indeed most of the redskins bad as well as good had quite enough of mere brute courage to make them dare and risk a good deal for the sake of scalping a white hunter so he rose once or twice during the night to replenish the fire and take a look round and as often as he rose for these purposes so often did he observe the glittering eye of the black swan glaring round the encampment although its owner never once moved from his recumbent posture  thus the night was spent  the first glimmer of daylight found the whole party up and equipped for the journey  they did not breakfast before setting out as they preferred to take their morning meal later in the day  few words were spoken  at that early hour and in the sleepy condition which usually results from a very early start men are seldom inclined to talk  only one or two monosyllables were uttered as each man rolled up his blanket with his share of the provisions in it and fastened on his snowshoes  a few minutes later robin led the way down the slope and the whole party marched off in single file and reentered the woods    chapter eighteen  interesting though puzzling discoveries  about eight oclock they halted for breakfast which larry odowd prepared with his accustomed celerity and assisted to consume with his wonted voracity  theres nothin like aitin when yer hungry observed larry with his mouth full  xcept drinking when youre dry said stiff ironically  now i dont agree with ye retorted larry i used to think so wance before i left the owld countrymy blissin rest on it  i used to think there was nothin like drink an sure i was right for there niver was anythin like it for turnin a poor man into a baste but when i comed into the woods here i couldnt get drink for love or money an sure i found after a while i didnt need it and got on better widout it an enjoyed me life more for want of it  musha its little i care for drink now but och  ive a mortal love for aitin  it needed not larrys assurance to convince his hearers of the fact for he consumed nearly twice as much dried meat as any of his comrades  well if ye dont drink ginsling or cocktail said stiff youre mighty hard on the tea  true for ye stiff it was the favrite tipple o me owld mother an im fond of it on that score not to mention other raisins of a private natur  couldnt ye make these reasons public said walter  unpossible said larry with much gravity as he helped himself to another can of tea  come times up said robin abruptly as he rose to put on his snowshoes  larry swallowed the tea at a draught the others rose promptly and in a few minutes more they were again on the march  towards noon they issued out of the woods upon a wide undulating country which extended as far as the eye could see to faint blue mountains in the distance  this region was varied in character and extremely beautiful  the undulations of the land resembled in some places the waves of the sea  in other places there were clumps of trees like islets  elsewhere there were hollows in which lakelets and ponds evidently existed but the deep snow covered all these with a uniform carpet  in some parts the ground was irregular and broken by miniature hills where there were numerous abrupt and high precipices  the party were approaching one of the latter in the afternoon when robin suddenly paused and pointed to a projecting ledge on the face of one of the cliffs  what would ye say yonder objic was he inquired of slugs  the hunter shaded his eyes with his hand and remained silent for a few seconds  it looks like a sled said he dropping his hand but how it got thar would puzzle even a redskin to tell for theres no track up to that ledge  it is a sled said black swan curtly  an how came it there asked robin  it fell from the top replied the indian  right lad yer right said slugs who had taken another long look at the object in question i see somethin like a broken tree near the top o the precipice  i hope wapaw haint gone an tumbled over that cliff  this supposition was received in silence and with grave looks for all felt that the thing was not impossible but the indian shook his head  come black swan said walter you dont agree with uswhat think ye  wapaw had no sled with him replied the indian  right again cried slugs i do believe my sense is forsakin me an injun baby might have thought of that for his tracks are plain enough howsever lets go see for its o no use standin here guessin  the party at once advanced to the foot of the precipice and for nearly an hour they did their utmost to ascend to the ledge on which the sledge lay but their efforts were in vain  the rock was everywhere too steep and smooth to afford foothold  it wont do said larry wiping the perspiration from his brow av we had wings we might but we haint got em so its o no manner o use tryin  we shall try from the top now said robin  if anybody has tumbled over the poor crittur may be alive yet for all we know  they found their efforts to descend from the top of the precipice equally fruitless and much more dangerous and although they spent a long time in the attempt and taxed their wits to the utmost they were ultimately compelled to leave the place and continue their journey without attaining their object  one discovery was made however  it was ascertained by the old marks in the snow at the edge of the precipice that whatever members of the party who owned the sledge had tumbled over at least two of them had escaped for their trackfaint and scarcely discerniblewas traced for some distance  it was found also that wapaws track joined this old one  the wounded indian had fallen upon it not far from the precipice and supposing no doubt that it would lead him to some encampment he had followed it up  robin and his men also followed itincreasing their speed as much as possible  night began to descend again but wapaw was not overtaken despite the black swans prophecy  this however was not so much owing to the miscalculation of the indian as to the fact that a great deal of time had been lost in their futile endeavour to reach the sledge that had fallen over the precipice  about sunset they came to a place where the track turned suddenly at a right angle and entered the bushes  ha the first travellers must have camped here and wapaw has followed their example said robin as he pushed aside the bushes  just so heres the place but the ashes are cold so i fear we are not so near our injun friend as we could wish  well it cant be helped cried stiff throwing down his bundle weve had plenty o walkin for one day so i vote for supper right off  i second the motion said walter seizing his axe seein that the camp is ready made to hand  now larry get your pot ready  sure its stuffed full areadyan i only wish i was in the same state said the irishman as he pressed the snow tightly into a tin kettle and hung it over the fire which slugs had just kindled  the supper scene of the previous night was in most of its details enacted over again but it was resolved that each of the party should keep watch for an hour as if the indians had followed there was a possibility of their having gained on them during the delay at the precipice  before the watch was set however and while all the party were enjoying their pipes after supper the black swan suddenly exclaimed ho and pointed with his finger to something which peeped out of the snow at larrys elbow that volatile individual having uncovered it during some of his eccentric movements  its only an owld mocassin said larry plucking the object from the snow as he spoke some injun lad has throwd it away for useless  hand it here said robin relighting his pipe which had gone out  larry tossed the mocassin to his leader who eyed it carelessly for a moment  suddenly he started and turning the mocassin over examined it with close and earnest attention  then he smiled as if at his passing anxiety and dropped it on the ground  it reminded me said he to walter of my nelly for it has something of the same shape that she was fond of an for a moment i was foolish enough to think it might ha belonged to the dear child but  come larry have ee got any more tea there  is it tay ye want faix then its little more nor laves thats remainin said larry draining the last drops into a pannikin well theres about half a mugfull afther all its wonderful what can be got out o it sometimes by squaazin the pot  hand it over thats enough said robin thank ee ladheres luck  he drained the pannikin as though it had been a glass of rum and smacking his lips proceeded leisurely to refill his pipe  are ye sure its not one of nellys old mocassins asked walter as he eyed the little shoe earnestly  sure enough nephy i would know her mothers make among ten thousand an although that one is oncommon like it in some respecs it aint one o hers  but nelly might have made it herself suggested walter and that would account for its bein like her mothers in the make  robin shook his head  not likely said he  the child didnt use to make mocassins  im not sure if she could do it at all besides she was last heard of miles and miles away from here in another direction  no no walter lad we mustnt let foolish fancies bother us  however the sight o this has fixed me to push on tomorrow as hard as i can lay my legs to it for if wapaws alive we cant fail to come up wi him afore sundown and im keen to turn about an go after my children  ill push on by myself if ye dont care to keep up wi me  this latter remark was made to stiff whose countenance indicated that he had no desire to undertake a harder days march than usual  the effect of the remark was to stir up all the yankees pride  ill tell ee what it is mister gore said he tartly you may think yourself an oncommon hard walker but obadiah stiff is not the man to cave in to any white man alive  i dont care to go trampin over the country day after day like the wandering jew after a redskin as ill go bound aint no better than the rest o his kind but if ye want to see which of our legs is the best pair o compasses ill walk with ye from here to hereafter i guess or anywhar else ye choose if i dont then my name aint stiff  it would be well av it wornt stiff for yeve no reason to be proud ot observed larry odowd with a grin dont spake so loud man but shut up yer potatie trap and go to roost  yell need it all if ye wouldnt like to fall behind tomorrow  there now dont reply yeve no call to make me yer father confessor and apologise for boastin good night an go to slape  the rest of the party who had lain down laughed at this sally and stiff on consideration thought it best to laugh too  in a few minutes every one in the encampment was sound asleep with the exception of robin gore who took the first hour of watching and who sat beside the sinking fire like a indian in earnest meditation with his eyes resting dreamily on the wornout mocassin    chapter nineteen  short allowance and a surprise  once again we return to silver lake but here we do not find affairs as we left them  true roy and nelly are still there the hut is as snug as it used to be and the scenery as beautiful but provisions have begun to fail and an expression of real anxiety clouds the usually cheerful countenance of roy while reflected anxiety sits on the sweet little face of nell  the winter is far advanced and the prospect of resuming the journey home is farther off than ever  one morning roy entered the hut with a slow step and a sad countenance  nell said he throwing down a small fish which he had just caught things look very bad now seems to me that well starve here  since we broke the long line ive only caught little things like that theres no rabbits in the snaresi looked at every one this morninand as for deer they seem to have said goodbye for the winter  i thought of goin out with the gun this forenoon but i think it ant o no use for i was out all yesterday without seeing a feather or a hoofprint  the tone in which roy said this and the manner in which he flung himself down on the ground beside the fire alarmed his sister greatly so that she scarcely knew what to say  dont know whats to be done at all continued roy somewhat peevishly  this was so unlike himself that the little girl felt a strong tendency to burst into tears but she restrained herself  after a short silence she said somewhat timidly  dont you think we might try to pray  whats the use said roy quickly im sure ive prayed often and often and so have you but nothins come of it  it was quite evident that roy was in a state of rebellion  this was the first time nelly had suggested united prayer to her brother she did it timidly and the rebuff caused her to shrink within herself  roys quick eye observed the shrinking he repented instantly and drawing nelly to him laid her head on his breast  forgive me nell i shouldnt have said it for after all weve had everything given to us here that we have needed up to this time  come i will pray with you  they both got upon their knees at once but strive as he might not a word would cross roys lips for several minutes  nelly raised her head and looked at him  god help us he ejaculated  for jesus sake murmured nelly  they both said amen to these words and these were all their prayers  roys rebellion of heart was gone now but his feelings were not yet calmed  he leaped up and raising his sister kissed her almost violently  now lass we have prayed and i do believe that god will answer us so ill take my gun and snowshoes an off to the woods to look for a deer  see that you have a roarin fire ready to roast him three hours hence  nelly smiled through her tears and said she would while roy slipped his feet through the lines of his snowshoes threw his powderhorn and bulletpouch over his shoulder seized his gun and sallied forth with a light step  when he was gone nelly began actively to prepare for the fulfilment of her promise  she took up the axe which roy had left behind him and went into the forest behind the hut to cut firewood  she was very expert at this laborious work  her blows were indeed light for her little arms although strong for their size were not strong for such labour but she knew exactly where to hit and how to hit  every stroke fell on the right spot with the axe at the right angle so that a chip or two flew off every time  she panted a good deal and grew uncommonly warm but she liked the work her face glowed and her eyes sparkled and it was evident that she was not exhausted by it  in little more than an hour she had cut enough of dry wood to make a fire that would have roasted an entire sheep  then she carried it to the hut after which she sat down to rest a little  while resting she gathered carefully together all the scraps of food in the hut and found that there was still enough for two good meals so she ate a small piece of dried fish and began to wish that roy would return  suddenly she was startled by a loud fluttering noise close to the hut and went out to see what it could be  it might be supposed that a little girl in such solitary and unprotected circumstances would have felt alarmed and thought of wolves or bears but nelly was too well accustomed to the dangers and risks of the backwoods to be much troubled with mere fancies  she was well aware that wolves and bears as a rule shun the presence of human beings and the noise which she had heard was not of a very alarming character  the first sight that greeted her was a large bird of the grouse species sitting on a tree not three yards from the hut  she almost felt that by springing forward she could seize it with her hands and her first impulse was to throw the axe at it but checking herself she went noiselessly back into the hut and quickly reissued with the bow and a couple of arrows  fitting an arrow to the string she whispered to herself oh how i do hope i wont miss it and took a careful aim  anxiety however made her hand unsteady for the next moment the arrow was quivering in the stem of the tree at least three inches below the bird  a look of deep disappointment was mingled with an expression of determination as she pursed her little mouth and fitted the second arrow to the string  this time she did not take so careful an aim but let fly at once and her shaft entered the birds throat and brought it to the ground  with a cry of delight she sprang upon her prize and bore it in triumph into the hut where she speedily plucked it  then she split it open and went down to the lake and washed it quite clean and spread it out flat  her next proceeding was to cut a short stick about two feet in length which she pointed at both ends making one point thinner than the other  this thin point she thrust through the bird and stuck it up before the fire to roast placing a small dish made of birch bark below it to catch the dripping  i hope he wont come back till its ready she muttered as the skin of the bird began to brown and frizzle while a delicious odour began to fill the hut  just as the thought was uttered a footstep was heard outside the covering of the doorway was raised a tall figure stooped to enter and the next instant a gaunt and halfnaked savage stood before her  nelly uttered a faint cry of terror but she was so paralysed that she could make no effort to escape even had escape been possible  the appearance of the indian was indeed calculated to strike terror to a stouter heart than that of poor nelly for besides being partially clad in torn garments his eyes were sunken and bloodshot and his whole person was more or less smeared with blood  as the poor child gazed at this apparition in horror the indian said ho by way of salutation and stepping forward took her hand gently and shook it after the manner of the white man  a gleam of intelligence and surprise at once removed the look of fear from nellys face  wapaw she exclaimed breathlessly  ho replied the indian with a nod and a smile as he laid aside his gun and snowshoes and squatted himself down before the fire  there was not much to be gathered from ho but the nod and smile proved to nelly that the intruder was indeed none other than her old friend wapaw  her alarm being now removed she perceived that the poor indian was suffering both from fatigue and woundsperhaps from hunger too but this latter idea was discarded when she observed that several birds similar to the one she had just killed hung at the indians belt  she rose up quickly therefore and running down to the lake soon returned with a can of clear water with which she purposed bathing wapaws wounds  wapaw seized the can however and emptied the contents down his throat so she was constrained to go for a second supply  having washed the wounds which were chiefly on the head and appeared to her to be very severe although in reality they were not so she set the roasted bird before him and desired him to eat  of course she had put a great many questions to wapaw while thus occupied  her residence with the indians had enabled her to speak and understand the indian tongue a little and although she had some difficulty in understanding much of what wapaw said in reply she comprehended enough to let her know that a number of white men had been killed by the savages and that wapaw was fleeing for his life  on first hearing this a deadly paleness overspread her face for she imagined that the white people killed must be her own kindred but wapaw quickly relieved her mind on this point  after this he devoted himself entirely to the roasted bird and nelly related to him as well as she could the particulars of her own and roys escape from the indians    chapter twenty  more surprising discoveries  while they were thus occupied a cry was heard to ring through the forest  the indian laid his hand on his gun raised his head which he turned to one side in a listening attitude and sat as still as a dark statue  the only motion that could be detected in the man was a slight action in his distended nostrils as he breathed gently  this attitude was but momentary however for the cry was repeated hi nelly hi in clear silvery tones and wapaw smiled as he recognised roys voice and quietly resumed his former occupation  nelly bounded up at once and ran out to receive her brother and tell him of the arrival of their old friend  she slipped on her snowshoes and went off in the direction of the cry on rounding the foot of a cliff she discovered roy standing as if he had been petrified with his eyes glaring at the snow with a mingled look of surprise and alarm  nellys step roused him  ho  nell he cried giving vent to a deep sigh of relief im thankful to see youbut look here  what snowshoe made this track i came on it just this moment and it pulled me up slick i can tell ye  nelly at once removed roys alarm and increased his surprise by telling him of the new arrival who she said was friendly but she did not tell him that he was an old friend  but come now what have you got for dinner roy said nelly with an arch smile for oh  im so hungry  roys countenance fell and he looked like a convicted culprit  nell i havent got nothin at all  what a pity  we must just go supperless to bed i suppose  come lass i see by the twinkle in your eye that youve got grub somehow or other  has the redskin brought some at with him  yes he has brought a little but the best fun is that i shot a bird myself and had it all ready beautifully cooked for your supper when wap  well what dye mean by wap inquired roy as nelly stopped short  nothing  i only meant to say that the indian arrived suddenly and ate it all up  the villain  well ill pay him off by eatin up some o his grub did he say what his name was or where he came from inquired roy  never mind you can ask him yourself said nelly as they drew near to the hut he seems to me to have been badly wounded by his enemies  they stooped and entered the hut as nelly spoke  the indian looked up at her brother and uttering his wonted ho held out his hand  good luck to ye cried roy grasping it and shaking it with a feeling of hearty hospitality  its good to see yer face though it is a strange un buthalloi sayyer face aint so strange after all what  why youre not wapwapwapaw  the indian displayed all his teeth which were very numerous and remarkably white and nodded his head gently  well now that beats everything cried roy seizing the indians hand again and shaking it violently then turning to nelly he said come nell stir yer stumps and pluck two o them birds  ill split em an wash em an roast em an well all eat emwapawll be ready for more before its ready for him  jump now and see if we dont have a feast tonight if we should starve tomorrow  but i say wapaw dont ye think the redskins may be after you yet  the first part of this speech was uttered in wild glee but the last sentence was spoken more earnestly as the thought occurred to him that wapaw might have been closely pursued for nelly had told him of the indian having been wounded by enemies and obliged to fly  wapaw shook his head and made his young friend understand as well as he could that there was little chance of that as he had travelled with the utmost speed in order to distance his pursuers and induce them to give up the chase  well it may be as you say friend observed roy as he sat down before the fire and pulled off his hunting mocassins and socks which he replaced by lighter footgear more suited to the hut but i dont much like the notion o givin them a chance to come up and cut all our throats at once  its not likely however that theyll be here tonight considerin the pace you say you came at so well make our minds easy but with your leave well cut our sticks tomorrow an make tracks for fort enterprise  we hant got much in the way o grub to start wi it is true but we have enough at least for two days eatin and for the rest we have our guns and you to be our guide  this plan was agreed to by wapaw who thereupon advised that they should all lie down to sleep without delay  roy who was fatigued with his days exertions agreed and in less than half an hour the three were sound asleep  next morning they arose with the sun much refreshed and while wapaw and nelly collected together and packed on their new sledge the few things that they possessed roy went for the last time to cast his line in silver lake  he was more fortunate than usual and returned in an hour with four fine fish of about six pounds weight each  with this acceptable though small addition to their slender stock of provisions they left the hut about noon and commenced their journey making a considerable detour in order to avoid meeting with any of the indians who might chance to have continued the pursuit of wapaw  that same evening towards sunset a party of hunters marched out of the woods and stood upon the shores of silver lake the tracks about which they began to examine with particular interest  there were six of the party five of them being white hunters and one an indian  we need scarcely add that they were our friend robin and his companions  i tell ee what it is cried robin in an excited tone thats my nellys fut id know the prints ot among a thousand an its quite plain roy is with her an that wapaw has come on em for their tracks are clear  sure it looks like it observed larry odowd scratching his head as if in perplexity but the tracks is so mixed up it aint aisy to foller em  see heres a wellbeaten track goin into the wood cried walter who had like his companions been searching among the bushes  every one followed walter who led the way towards the hut which was finally discovered with a thin scarcely perceptible line of smoke still issuing from the chimney  they all stopped at once and held back to allow robin to advance alone  the poor man went forward with a beating heart and stopped abruptly at the entrance where he stood for a few seconds as if he were unable to go in  at length he raised the curtain and looked in then he entered quickly  gone walter theyre gone he cried come in lad and see  heres evidence o my dear children everywhere  its plain too that they have left only a few hours agone  true for ye the fires hot said larry lighting his pipe from the embers in testimony of the truth of his assertion  they cant be far off said slugs who was examining every relic of the absent ones with the most minute care  the less time we lose in follerin of em the betterwhat think ye lad  the black swan nodded his approval of the sentiment  what without sleep or supper cried stiff whose enthusiasm in the chase had long ago evaporated  ay said robin sternly i start now  let those stop here who will  to do stiff justice his objections were never pressed home so he comforted himself with a quid of tobacco and accompanied robin and his men with dogged resolution when they left the hut  plunging once more into the forest they followed up the track all night as they had already followed it up all day    chapter twenty one  a gladsome meeting  some hours before dawn robin gore came to an abrupt pause and looking over his shoulder held up his hand to command silence  then he pointed to a small mound on the top of which a faint glow of light was seen falling on the boughs of the shrubs with which it was crowned  the moon had just set but there was sufficient light left to render surrounding objects pretty distinct  thats them said robin to walter in a low whisper as the latter came close to his side no doubt theyre sound asleep an im puzzled how to wake em up without givin em a fright  musha its a fright that wapaw will give us av we start him suddenly for hes murtherin quick wi his rifle whispered larry  wed better hide and then give a howl suggested stiff an after theyre sot up bring em down with a familiar hail  the deliberations of the party were out short and rendered unnecessary however by wapaw himself  that sharpeared red man had been startled by the breaking of a branch which larry odowd chanced to set his foot on and before robin had observed their fire he had roused roy and nelly and hurried with them to the summit of a rocky eminence from which stronghold they now anxiously watched the proceedings of the hunters  the spot to which they had fled for refuge was almost impregnable and might have been held for hours by a couple of resolute men against a host of savages  robin after a little further consultation resolved to send the black swan in advance to reconnoitre  this he did contrary to his wonted custom of taking the lead in everything because of an unaccountable feeling of dread lest he should not find his children there  black swan at once stepped cautiously forward with his rifle ready cocked in the hollow of his left arm and his finger on the triggerguard  step by step he moved towards the encampment without making the slightest noise and with so little motion that he might easily have been mistaken for a dark shadow  raising his head over the edge of the encampment he gazed earnestly into it then he advanced another pace or two finally he stepped into it and standing erect looked around him  with a wave of his hand he summoned his comrades to advance  robin gores heart beat hard as he approached followed by the others  meanwhile they were closely watched by roy and wapaw  when the black swans head appeared roy exclaimed in a whisper an injundye know him wapaw  he is one of our tribe i think replied the indian in the same low voice but i know him not the light of the fire is not strong  if hes one o your tribe said roy its all up with us for they wont be long o findin us here  keep close to me nell  ill stick by you lass dont fear  wapaws brows lowered when he saw the black swan step into the encampment and make the signal to his comrades to advance  he raised his rifle and took deliberate aim at his heart  roy he whispered get an arrow ready aim at the next man that steps into the light and let fly ill not fire till after you for the smoke would blind you  roy obeyed with a trembling hand  notwithstanding the rough life he had led in those wild woods of the west he had never yet been called on to lift his hand against a human being and the thought of taking life in this deliberate and almost murderous way caused him to shudder still he felt that their case was desperate and he nerved himself to the deed  another moment and robin stood beside the black swan  roy tried to raise his bow but his heart failed him  wapaw glanced at him and said sternly  shoot first  at that moment obadiah stiff stepped into the encampment and stirring the embers of the fire with a piece of stick caused a bright flame and showers of sparks to shoot upwards  this revealed the fact that some of the party were white men so wapaw lowered his rifle  a single glance of his practised eye told him who they were  laying his hand suddenly and heavily on roys shoulder he pressed him down  come let us go he said quickly i must see these men alone and you must keep closeyou must not look  he said the latter words with emphasis but in order to make sure that they should not have a chance of looking he led his young companions to a point whence the encampment could not be seen and left them there with strict injunctions not to quit the spot until he should return  in a few seconds wapaw stepped into the circle of light where robin and his party were all assembled and so rapid and noiseless had his movement been that he was in the midst of them almost before they were aware of his approach  wapaw exclaimed walter in surprise why you seem to have dropped from the clouds  sure its a ghost ye must be cried larry  the indian took no notice of these remarks but turned to robin who with a look of deep anxiety said  have ee seed the childer wapaw  they are safe answered the indian  thank god for that cried robin while a sigh of relief burst from him i believe ye wapaw yer a true man an wouldnt tell me a lie would ye  the tone in which the hunter said this implied that the statement was scarcely a true index to his feelings and that he would be glad to hear wapaw assure him that he was indeed telling the truth  but this indian was a man of truthfulness and did not deem it necessary to repeat his assertion  he said however that he would go and fetch the children and immediately quitted the camp  soon after he returned with roy and nelly he had not told them however who the strangers were  when roy first caught sight of his father he gave a shout of surprise and stood still as if he were bewildered  nelly uttered a wild scream and rushed forward with outstretched arms  robin met her more than half way and the next moment folded his longlost little one to his bosom    chapter twenty two  at silver lake once more  it were needless to detail all that was said and done during the remainder of that night or rather morning for day began to break soon after the happy meeting narrated in the last chapter  it would require more space than we can afford to tell of all that was said and done how robin embraced his children over and over again in the strength of his love and thanked god in the fervour of his gratitude how roy and nelly were eager to relate all that had befallen them since they were carried away into captivity in a much shorter time than such a long story could by any possibility be told how walter rendered the telling of it much more difficult by frequent interruptions with eager questions which induced divergencies from which the taletellers forgot to return to the points where the interruptions occurred how larry odowd complicated matters by sometimes volunteering anecdotes of his own illustrative of points similar to those which were being related how slugs always cut these anecdotes short with a facetious poke in the ribs which caused larry to howl how stiff rendered confusion worse confounded by trying to cook some breakfast and by upsetting the whole affair into the fire and how the children themselves broke in on their own discourse continually with sudden and enthusiastic questions as to the health of their mother and the welfare of the live stock at fort enterprise  all this cannot be described therefore we leave it to the vivid imagination of the reader  now comrades said robin after the sun had risen after breakfast had been and eaten after every incident had been related at least twice over and after every conceivable question had been asked four or five timesnow comrades it remains for us to fix what well do  to the fort said larry odowd abruptly  ayhome cried walter  oh yeshomehome exclaimed roy and nelly in the same breath  ditto observed obadiah stiff  slugs and the black swan being men of few words said nothing but nodded approval  well its quite plain that were all of one mind resumed robin nevertheless there are one or two points to which i ax yer attention in the first place its now near the end of november  fort enterprise in a straight line is more nor three weeks march from hereaway  our provisions is low  when i left the fort provisions was low there too an if my brother jeff hant had more nor his usual luck in huntin theyll be lower yet before long  now i think it would be better to go back to silver lake for a week or so hunt an fish there till weve got a good supply make noo sleds load em chock full an thenho for home  what say ye to that comrades  as every one assented readily to this plan they proceeded at once to carry it into execution  at first indeed nelly looked a little disappointed saying that she wanted to get to her darling mother without delay but on walter pointing out to her that it would only delay matters a week or so and that it would enable the whole party to rest and recruit and give wapaw time to recover thoroughly from his wounds she became reconciled and put on her snowshoes to return to silver lake with some degree of cheerfulness and when in the course of that days walk she began to tell her father of all the beauties and wonders of silver lake she was not only reconciled but delighted to return  o father said she as they walked briskly through the forest youve no notion what a beautiful place silver lake is  its so clear and sosooh  i dont know how to tell you so like the fairy places walter used to tell us of with clear water and high cliffs and the clouds shining up at the clouds shining down and two sunsone below and another above  and then the hut we made it all ourselves  what made the trees and all said robin with a smile  no of course not the trees but we cut the trees and piled em up and spread the brushwood andandthen the fish we caught such big ones  how big nelly  oh ever so big  how big may that be  well some were so long measuring off the size on her arm an some near as long as my legan they were good to eat toono good youve no notion but youll see and taste em too  then theres the shooskin  did you ever shoosk father  no lassleastways i dont remember if i did  but you know what it is  to be sure nelly hant i seed ye do it often on the slopes at fort enterprise  well the shooskin here is far far better  the first time roy did it he said it nearly banged all his bones to piecesyes he said he felt as if his backbone was shoved up into his brain and i sometimes thought it would squeeze all my ribs together  oh it is so nice you shall try it father  robin laughed heartily at this and remarked that he would be very glad to try it though he had no particular desire to have his ribs squeezed together or his backbone shoved up into his brain  then nelly went on with great animation and volubility to tell of the trapping of the bear and the snaring of rabbits and the catching of fish and of roys peculiar method of wading into the lake for ducks and many other things  roy meanwhile entertained walter and larry odowd with a somewhat similar account of their doings during the months of their residence in that wild region and thus the journey was beguiled so that the time seemed to pass on swallows wings  towards evening the party approached the spot where silver lake had first burst upon the enraptured gaze of the wandering pair  as they drew near roy and nelly hurried on in advance and mounting the fallen tree on which they had formerly rested waved to the others to come on and shouted for glee  and well might they shout for the evening happened to be brighter and calmer if possible than the one on which they first saw the lake  the rolling clouds were whiter too and the waters looked more silvery than ever  the exclamations of delight and the looks of admiration with which the glorious scene was greeted by the hunters when they came up gratified the hearts of roy and nelly very much  oh how i wish mother was here to see it cried nelly  aint that a place for a king to live in daddy said roy enthusiastically  so tis lad so tisleastwise its a goodish spot for a hunter  how say you slugs  slugs smiled grimly and nodded his head  would the red man like to pitch his wigwam there said robin addressing the black swan  he has pitched his wigwam here before replied the black swan softly when he first took the white swan home to be his mate he came to hunt here  och is it the honeymoon ye spint here broke in larry  faix its a purty spot for courtin and no mistake  is that a beehive over there he added pointing across the lake  why thats our hutour palace cried nell with gleeful look  then the sooner we get down to it and have supper the better observed walter for well have to work hard tomorrow  come along then cried robin an go you ahead roy beat the track and show us the way  roy accepted the position of honour  nelly followed him and the whole band marched off in single file along the shores of silver lake  they soon reached the hut and here again nelly found many interesting points to dilate upon  she poured her words into willing and sympathetic ears so that she monopolised nearly all the talk during the time that larry odowd was preparing supper  when that meal was being eaten the conversation became more general plans were discussed as to the intended procedure on the morrow and various courses of action fixed  after that as a matter of course the pipes came out and while these were being smoked only the talkative members of the party kept up the conversation at intervals  roy and nelly having exhausted all they had to say began to feel desperately sleepy and the latter having laid her head on her fathers knee fell sound asleep in that position  soon the pipes were smoked out the fire was replenished the blankets unrolled and in a very brief period of time the whole party was in a state of happy unconsciousness with the exception of poor wapaw whose wounds made him rather restless and the black swan whose duty it was to take the first watch for it was deemed right to set a watch lest by any chance the indians should have followed the hunters tracks though this was not probable  next morning robin aroused the sleepers somewhat abruptly by shooting a grey hen with his rifle from the tent door  theres breakfast for you and me nelly at any rate remarked the hunter as he went down to the lake to secure his bird  an wont there be the bones and feathers for the rest of us observed larry yawning so we wont starve this day anyhow  in a few minutes every man was actively engaged in work of some sort or other  robin and walter prepared fishinglines from some pieces of buckskin parchment black swan and slugs went out to cut wood for making sledges stiff repaired the snowshoes of the party or rather assisted nelly in this operation and larry attended to the preparation of breakfast  wapaw was the only one who lay still it being thought better to make him rest and get strong for the approaching journey  during the course of the day the lines were tried and a good number of fish caught  slugs also went off in search of deer and returned in the evening with a large stag on his broad shoulders  this raised the spirits of the party greatly and they feasted that night with much rejoicing on venison marrowbones and broiled fish  thus they spent their time for several days  one party went regularly every morning to fish in the iceholes another party roamed the woods and returned with grouse or rabbits and sometimes with deer while some remained part of the day at least in the hut mending snowshoes and moccasins and making other preparations  in the midst of all this busy labour the shoosking was not forgotten one day robin said to his little daughter at breakfast that as they had got nearly enough of provisions for the journey they would take a holiday and go and have a shoosk  the proposal was hailed with delight and the whole party went off with the new sledges and spent the forenoon in sliding and tumbling down the hills like very children  at last everything was ready for a start  the provisions were tightly fastened on the sledges which were to be drawn by each of the men in turn  snowshoes were put on guns and bows looked to and shouldered and on a bright frosty december morning the hunters left the hut struck into the woods and set out for fort enterprise  at the top of the slope beside the fallen tree they stopped with one consent and gazed back and there nelly took her last sad look at silver lake and sorrowfully said her last farewell    chapter twenty three  the happiest meeting of all  the snow was driving through the forests and over the plains of the north american wilderness the wind was shrieking among the treetops and whirling the drift in great clouds high up into the frosty air and the sun was setting in a glow of fiery red when on the last day of the year robin gore and his followers came to an abrupt halt and with one consent admitted that the thing was impossible  we cant do it boys said robin resting his rifle against a tree so its o no use to try  the fort is good ten miles off an the children are dead beat  no they aint interrupted roy whose tone and aspect however proved that his fathers statement was true at least im not beat yetim game for two or three hours more  well lad praps ye are but nelly aint so well camp here an take em by surprise in the morning early  nelly who had been carried on the backs of those who had broadest shoulders during the last dozen miles smiled faintly when spoken to and said she was vey seepy  so they set to work in the usual style and were soon comfortably seated in their snowy encampment  next morning before dawn robin awoke them  ho he cried get up lads look alive  a happy new year to ee all young an old red an white  kiss me nell deara shake o yer paw roy  an its a good new years day too in more ways than one praise the almighty for that  the whole party was astir immediately and that feeling of kindly brotherhood which usually pervades the hearts of men on the first day of a new year induced them to shake hands heartily all round  youll eat your new years dinner at home after all said walter to nelly  sure an its a happy ooman yer motherll be this good day said larry as he stirred up the embers of the fire and blew them into a flame  the kettle was boiled and a good breakfast eaten because although it is usually the custom for hunters to start on their days journey and accomplish a good many miles of it before breakfast they had consideration for roy and nelly both of whom were still suffering a little from the fatigue of the previous day  they hoped to be at fort enterprise in about four hours and were anxious to arrive fresh  the sun was rising when they reached the top of a ridge whence they could obtain a distant view of the fort  here we are at home nelly said robin stooping down to kiss his child on the forehead  darling darling mother was all that poor nelly could say as she tried in vain to see the fort though the tears which sprang to her eyes  dont you see it nell said roy passing his arm round his sisters waist  no i dont cried nelly brushing the tears away oh do let us go on  robin patted her on the had and at once resumed the march    that morning mrs gore rose from her bed about the saddest woman in the land  her mind flew back to the last new years day when her children were lost to her as she feared for ever  the very fact that people are usually more jocose and hearty and happy on the first day of the year was sufficient to make her more sorrowful than usual so she got up and sighed and then not being a woman of great selfrestraint she wept  in a few minutes she dried her eyes and took up her bible and as she read its blessed pages she felt comfortsuch as the world can neither give nor take awaygradually stealing over her soul  when she met her kinsman and his friends at breakfast she was comparatively cheerful and returned their hearty salutation with some show of a reciprocal spirit  jeff said mrs gore with a slight sigh its a year this day since my two darlings were lost in the snow  dye say so observed jeff as he sat down to his morning meal and commenced eating with much voracity  jeff was not an unkind man but he was very stupid  he said nothing more for some time but after consuming nearly a pound of venison steak he observed suddenly  wall i guess it wor a bad business thatwornt it missus  it was responded mrs gore and feeling that she had no hope of meeting with sympathy from jeff she relapsed into silence  after a time she said  but we must get up a feast jeff  it wont do to let new years day pass without a good dinner  thats true as gospl said jeff  feed up is my motto always  it dont much matter wot turns up if ye dont feed up yer fit for nothin but contrairywise if ye do feed up why yer ready for anythin or nothin as the case may be  having given vent to this sentiment jeff finished his meal with a prolonged draught of tea  wall now said he filling his pipe weve got enough o deers meat an other things to make a pretty fair feast missus but my comrades and we will go an try to git somethin fresh for dinner  if we git nothin else well git a appetite and thats worth a good long march any day so lads if  jeffs speech was interrupted here by a sudden and tremendous outburst of barking on the part of the dogs of the establishment  he sprang up and hastened to the door followed by his companions and mrs gore  injuns mayhap see to your guns boys we can niver be sure o the reptiles  theyre friendly observed one of jeffs friends as they stood at the fort gate enemies never come on in that straightforward fashion  not so sure o that said jeff  ive seen redskins do somethin o that kind when they meant mischief but if my eyes aint telling lies id say there were white men there  ay an young folk too remarked one of the others  young folk exclaimed mrs gore as she shaded her eyes from the sun with her hand and gazed earnestly at the band which was approaching  suddenly one of them ran a little in advance of the rest and waved a handkerchief  the figure was a small one  a faint cheer was heard in the distance  it was followed or rather accompanied by a loud manly and wellknown shout  mrs gore grew pale and would have fallen to the ground had not jeff caught and supported her  why i do declare its robinaneh if there beant the children wi im  the advancing party broke into a run as he spoke another loud cheer burst forth and in a few seconds nelly was locked once more in her dear mothers arms    chapter twenty four  conclusion  it is not necessary to say that there was joypowerful inexpressible within the wooden walls of fort enterprise on that new years morning and a new years hymn of praise welled up continually from the glad mothers heart finding expression sometimes in her voice but oftener in her eyes as she gazed upon the faces of her dear ones the lost and found  the flag at fort enterprise which had not flaunted its red field from the flagstaff since the sad daythat day twelve months exactlywhen the children were lost once more waved gaily in the frosty air and glowed in the beams of the wintry sun  the sound of joyful revelry which had not been heard within the walls of the fort for a long long year once again burst forth with such energy that one might have been led to suppose its being pent up so long had intensified its power  the huge fireplace roared and blazed and crackled with a log so massive that no other yule log in the known world could have held a candle to it and in on and around that fire were pots pans and goblets innumerable all of which hissed and spluttered and steamed at larry odowd as if with glee at the sight of his honest face once again presiding over his own peculiar domain  and the parlour of fort enterprisethat parlour which we have mentioned as being robins diningroom and drawingroom besides being his bedroom and his kitchenwas converted into a leafy bower by means of pine branches and festooned evergreens and laid out for a feast the like of which had not been seen there for many a day and which was transcendently more magnificent than that memorable new years day dinner which had been cooked but not eaten just three hundred and sixtyfive days before  in short everything in and about fort enterprise bore evidence that its inmates meant to rejoice and make merry on that first day of a new year as it was meet they should do under such favourable circumstances  jeff gore had shot a deer not many days before and one of its fat haunches was to be the great dish of the feast but robin said that it was not enough so after the first congratulations were over he and walter and slugs and black swan set off into the forest and ere long returned with several brace of grouse and a few rabbits  roy with a very sly look had asked leave to go and have a walk on snowshoes in the woods with nelly before dinner but his father threatened to lock him up in the cellar so he consented to remain at home for that day and assist his mother  now nelly you and roy will come help me to prepare the feast said mrs gore whose eyes were swollen with joyful weeping till they looked like a couple of inflamed oysters not that theres much to do for now that larry is come back well leave everything to him except the plplumpoopoodingoh my darling  here mrs gore broke down for the fifteenth time and catching nelly to her bosom hugged her  darling mother sighed nelly  och but its a sight good for sore eyes anyhow exclaimed larry looking up from his occupation among the steaming pots and pans  wapaw who was the only other member of the party who chose to remain in the house during the forenoon of that day sat smoking his pipe in the chimney corner and regarded the whole scene with that look of stoical solemnity which is peculiar to north american indians  come i say thisll never do mother cried roy going to the flourbarrel which stood in a corner  if were to help you wi that ere poodin lets have at it at once  thus admonished mrs gore and her recovered progeny set to work and fabricated a plumpudding which was nearly as hard almost as heavy as and much larger than a sixtyfour pound cannon ball  it would have killed with indigestion half a regiment of artillery but it could not affect the hardened frames of these men of the backwoods  in course of time the board was spread the viands smoked upon it and the united party set to work  mrs gore sat at the head of the table with nelly on one side and roy on the other  robin sat at the foot supported by the white swan on his right and wapaw on his left  ranged between these were walter slugs the black swan jeff gore obadiah stiff the two other strangers who came with jeff and larry odowdfor larry acted the part of cook only and did not pretend to wait  after he had placed the viands on the table he sat down with the rest  these backwoodsmen ignored waiters  they passed their plates from hand to hand and when anything was wanted by any one he rose to fetch it himself  after the plates were cleared away the teakettle was put on the table in some parts of the backwoods spirits are fortunately so difficult to procure that hunters and trappers live for many months without tasting a drop and get into the habit of doing entirely without intoxicating drink of any kind  robin had no spirits except animal spirits but he had plenty of tea  when it was poured out into huge cups which might have been styled small slopbasins and sweetened and passed round robin applied his knuckles to the table to command silence  friends said he i niver wos much o a speechifier but i could always manage to blurt out my meanin somehow  wot ive got to say to you this day is im thankful to the almighty for givin me back my childer an im right glad to see ye all under my roof this noo years day and sos the wife i knowaint ye molly my dear  to this appeal mrs g replied with a hysterical yees and an application of her apron to the inflamed oysters  robin continued  well im sorry there aint nothin stronger in the fort to give ee than tea but for my part i find it strong enough to keep up my spirits an yer all heartily welcome to swig bucketsfull o that  there is an old fiddle in the store  if any o ye can scrape a tune well have a dance  if not why well sing and be jolly  this speech was followed up by another from obadiah stiff who with a countenance of the deepest solemnity requested permission to make a few brief observations  friends said he turning the quid of tobacco which usually graced his right cheek into his left its not every day a mans got a chance o o wot i was agoin to obsarve is that men who are so much indebted to their muchrespected host asas nelly happened to sneeze at this point and distracted stiffs attention asyes i guess we hant often got the chance to chase the redskins andand  in short without makin an onnecessairy phrase about itim happy to say that i can play the fiddle so heres luck  mr stiff sat down abruptly and drained his cup at a draught  praps said larry with a twinkle in his eye mister stiff would favour the company wi a song before we commence to cut capers  hear hear from walter  hurrah from roy  mr stiff cleared his throat and began at once  the tune was so dolorous and the voice so unmusical that in any other circumstances it would have been intolerable but there were lines in it touching upon good fellowship which partially redeemed it and in the last verse there was reference made to home and absent friends which rendered it a complete success insomuch that it was concluded amid rapturous cheering so true is it as walter observed that one touch of nature covers a multitude of sins  lets drink to absent friends an owld ireland cried larry filling his cup and pushing the kettle round  this was drunk with enthusiasm and was followed by a succession of toasts and songs which were drunk and sung not at the table but round the fire to which the party withdrew in order to enjoy their pipes more thoroughly  then followed a number of anecdotes of storiessome true some doubtful and some fabricatedwhich were listened to with deep interest not only by roy and nelly but by the whole party including the indians who listened intently with faces like owls although they did not understand a word that was said  many of these stories were so touching that poor mrs gores eyes became more inflamed and more oysterlike than ever  nelly too became sympathetic and her eyes were similarly affected  when the evening was pretty well advanced the violin was sent for and tuned and stiff turned out to be a very fair player of scotch reels so the party laid aside their pipes cleared the floor and began to dance  it was rough but hearty dancing  each dancer composed his own steps on the spur of the moment but executed them with a degree of precision and violence that would have caused civilised dancing masters to blush with shame and envy  mrs gore and nelly danced too weeping the while with joy and so did the white swan but her performances were peculiar  she danced with a slowness of manner and a rigidity of person that are utterly indescribable  she looked as if all her joints had become inflexible except those of her knees and her arms hung straight down at her sides while she pendulated about the floor and gazed at the rafters in deep solemnity  how they did keep it up to be sure  men of the backwoods find it no easy matter to fatigue their muscles or exhaust their spirits so they danced all night and a considerable portion of next morning too  long before they gave in however the females were obliged to retire  they lay down on their rude couches without taking the trouble to undress and in a few moments after were sound asleepnelly locked in her mothers arms with their two cheeks touching their dishevelled hair mingling and a few tears welling from their inflamed eyes and mixing as they flowed slowly down their united noses  sleeping thus the mother dreamed of home and nelly dreamed of silver lake    reader our tale is told  we have not space to tell of what befell robin gore and his family in after life but we may remark in conclusion that although robin stoutly refused to go back to civilisation in the course of a few years civilisation considerately advanced to him and the wild region which was once a dense forest around fort enterprise finally became to mrs gores inexpressible joy a flourishing settlement in which were heard the sounds of human industry and the tinkle of the sabbath bell
