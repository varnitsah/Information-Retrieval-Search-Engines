48148812	deep waters  by ww jacobs     shareholders   sailor mansaid the nightwatchman musinglya sailorman is like a fish he is safest when e is at sea  when a fish comes ashore it is in for trouble and so is sailorman  one poor chap i knew ardly ever came ashore without getting married and he was found out there was no less than six wimmen in the court all taking away is character at once  and when he spoke up solomon the magistrate pretty near bit is ead off  then look at the trouble they get in with their money  they come ashore from a long trip smelling of it amost and they go from port to port like a lord  everybody has got their eye on that moneyeverybody except the sailorman that isand afore he knows wots appened and who as got it hes looking for a ship agin  when he aint robbed of is money he wastes it and when e dont do either he loses it  i knew one chap who hid is money  hed been away ten months and knowing ow easy money goes e made up sixteen pounds in a nice little parcel and hid it where nobody could find it  thats wot he said and praps e was right  all i know is he never found it  i did the same thing myself once with a couple o quid i ran acrost unexpected ony unfortunately for me i hid it the day afore my missus started er springcleaning  one o the worst men i ever knew for getting into trouble when he came ashore was old sam small if he couldnt find it by imself ginger dick and peter russet would help im look for it  generally speaking they found it without straining their eyesight  i remember one time they was home arter being away pretty near a year and when they was paid off they felt like walking goldmines  they went about smiling all over with goodtemper and appiness and for the first three days they was like brothers  that didnt last of course and on the fourth day sam small arter saying wot e would do to ginger and peter if it wasnt for the police went off by imself  his temper passed off arter a time and e began to look cheerful agin it was a lovely morning and having nothing to do and plenty in is pocket to do it with he went along like a schoolboy with a arf holiday he went as far as stratford on the top of a tram for a mouthful o fresh air and came back to his favourite coffeeshop with a fine appetite for dinner there was a very nice gentlemanly chap sitting opposite im and the way he begged sams pardon for splashing gravy over im made sam take a liking to him at once  nicely dressed he was with a gold pin in is tie and a fine gold watchchain acrost his weskit and sam could see he ad been brought up well by the way he used is knife and fork  he kept looking at sam in a thoughtful kind o way and at last he said wot a beautiful morning it was and wot a fine day it must be in the country in a little while they began to talk like a couple of old friends and he told sam all about is father wot was a clergyman in the country and sam talked about a father of his as was living private on three undred a year  ah moneys a useful thing ses the man  it aint everything ses sam  it wont give you appiness  ive run through a lot in my time so i ought to know  i expect youve got a bit left though ses the man with a wink  sam laughed and smacked is pocket  ive got a trifle to go on with he ses winking back  i never feel comfortable without a pound or two in my pocket  you look as though youre just back from a vyge ses the man looking at im very hard  i am ses sam nodding  just back arter ten months and im going to spend a bit o money afore i sign on agin i can tell you  thats wot it was given to us for ses the man nodding at him  they both got up to go at the same time and walked out into the street together and when sam asked im whether he might have the pleasure of standing im a drink he said he might  he talked about the different kinds of drink as they walked along till sam wot was looking for a high class pub got such a raging thirst on im he hardly knew wot to do with imself  he passed several pubs and walked on as fast as he could to the three widders  do you want to go in there partikler ses the man stopping at the door  no ses sam staring  cos i know a place where they sell the best glass o port wine in london ses the man  he took sam up two or three turnings and then led him into a quiet little pub in a back street  there was a cosy little saloon bar with nobody in it and arter sam had ad two port wines for the look of the thing he ad a pint o sixale because he liked it  his new pal had one too and he ad just taken a pull at it and wiped his mouth when e noticed a little bill pinned up at the back of the bar  lost betweenthe mint andtower stairs he ses leaning forward and reading very slow a goldlocketset withdiamonds  whoever willreturnthe same tomr smithorange villabarnetwill receive thirty poundsreward  ow much ses sam starting thirty pounds ses the man  must be a good locket  whered you get that he ses turning to the barmaid  gentleman came in an hour ago ses the gal and arter he had ad two or three drinks with the guvnor he asks im to stick it up  arf crying he wassaid it ad belonged to his old woman wot died  she went off to serve a customer at the other end of the bar wot was making little dents in it with his pot and the man came back and sat down by sam agin and began to talk about horseracing  at least he tried to but sam couldnt talk of nothing but that locket and wot a nice steady sailorman could do with thirty pounds  well praps youll find it ses the man chaffinglike  ave another pint  sam had one but it only made im more solemn and he got in quite a temper as e spoke about casuals loafing about on tower hill with their ands in their pockets and taking gold lockets out of the mouths of hardworking sailormen  it mightnt be found yet ses the man speaking thoughtfullike  its wonderful how long a thingll lay sometimes  wot about going and aving a look for it  sam shook his ead at fust but arter turning the thing over in his mind and aving another look at the bill and copying down the name and address for luck e said praps they might as well walk that way as anywhere else  something seems to tell me weve got a chance ses the man as they stepped outside   its a funny feeling and i cant explain it but it always means good luck  last time i had it an aunt o mine swallered er false teeth and left me five undred pounds  theres aunts and aunts ses sam grunting  i ad one once but if she had swallered er teeth shed ha been round to me to help er buy some new ones  thats the sort she was  mind ses the man patting im on the shoulder if we do find this i dont want any of it  ive got all i want  its all for you  they went on like a couple o brothers arter that especially sam and when they got to the mint they walked along slow down tower hill looking for the locket  it was awkward work because if people saw them looking about theyd ave started looking too and twice sam nearly fell over owing to walking like a man with a stiff neck and squinting down both sides of his nose at once  when they got as far as the stairs they came back on the other side of the road and they ad turned to go back agin when a dockerlooking chap stopped sams friend and spoke to im  ive got no change my man ses sams pal pushing past him  i aint begging guvnor ses the chap follering im up  im trying to sell something  wot is it ses the other stopping  the man looked up and down the street and then he put his ead near them and whispered  eh ses sams pal  something i picked up ses the man still awhispering  sam got a pinch on the arm from is pal that nearly made him scream then they both stood still staring at the docker  wot is it  ses sam at last  the docker looked over his shoulder agin and then e put his and in his trouserpocket and just showed em a big fat gold locket with diamonds stuck all over it  then he shoved it back in is pocket while sams pal was giving im a pinch worse than wot the other was  its the one he ses in a whisper  lets ave another look at it he ses to the docker  the man fished it out of his pocket agin and held on to it tight while they looked at it  where did you find it ses sam  found it over there just by the mint ses the man pointing  illustration found it over there just by the mint ses the man pointing  wot dye want for it ses sams pal  as much as i can get ses the man  i dont quite know ow much its worth thats the worst of it  wot dye say to twenty pounds and chance it  sam laughedthe sort of laugh a pal ad once give him a black eye for  twenty pounds he ses twenty pounds  ave you gorn out of your mind or wot  ill give you a couple of quid for it  well its all right captin ses the man theres no arm done  ill try somebody elseor praps therell be a big reward for it  i dont believe it was bought for a undred pounds  he was just sheering off when sams pal caught im by the arm and asked him to let im have another look at it  then he came back to sam and led im a little way off whispering to im that it was the chance of a life time  and if you prefer to keep it for a little while and then sell it instead of getting the reward for it i dare say it would be worth a hundred pounds to you e ses  i aint got twenty pounds ses sam  ow much ave you got ses his pal  sam felt in is pockets and the docker came up and stood watching while he counted it  altogether it was nine pounds fourteen shillings and tuppence  praps youve got some more at ome ses his pal  not a farthing ses sam which was true as far as the farthing went  or praps you could borrer some ses his pal in a soft kind voice id lend it to you with pleasure ony i havent got it with me  sam shook his ead and at last arter the docker ad said he wouldnt let it go for less than twenty even to save is life he let it go for the nine pounds odd a silver watchchain two cigars wot sam ad been sitting on by mistake and a sheathknife  shove it in your pocket and dont let a soul see it ses the man handing over the locket  i might as well give it away amost  but it cant be elped  he went off up the ill shaking his ead and sams pal arter watching him for a few seconds said goodbye in a hurry and went off arter im to tell him to keep is mouth shut about it  sam walked back to his lodgings on air as the saying is and even did a little bit of a skirtdance to a piannerorgan wot was playing  peter and ginger was out and so was his landlady a respectable woman as was minding the rest of is money for him and when he asked er little gal a kid of eleven to trust im for some tin she gave im a lecture on wasting his money instead wot took is breath awayall but a word or two  he got some of is money from his landlady at eight oclock arter listening to er for arf an hour and then he ad to pick it up off of the floor and say thank you for it  he went to bed afore ginger and peter came in but e was so excited he couldnt sleep and long arter they was in bed he laid there and thought of all the different ways of spending a undred pounds  he kept taking the locket from under is piller and feeling it then he felt e must ave another look at it and arter coughing ard two or three times and calling out to the other two not to snoreto see if they was awakehe got out o bed and lit the candle  ginger and peter was both fast asleep with their eyes screwed up and their mouths wide open and e sat on the bed and looked at the locket until he was amost dazzled  ullo sam  ses a voice  wot ave you got there  sam nearly fell off the bed with surprise and temper  then e hid the locket in his and and blew out the candle  who gave it to you ses ginger  you get off to sleep and mind your own bisness ses sam grinding is teeth  he got back into bed agin and laid there listening to ginger waking up peter  peter woke up disagreeable but when ginger told im that sam ad stole a gold locket as big as a saucer covered with diamonds he altered is mind  lets ave a look at it he ses sitting up  gingers dreaming ses sam in a shaky voice  i aint got no locket wot dyou think i want a locket for  ginger got out o bed and lit the candle agin  come on he ses lets ave a look at it  i wasnt dreaming  ive been awake all the time watching you  sam shut is eyes and turned his back to them  hes gone to sleep pore old chap ses ginger  well ave a look at it without waking im  you take that side peter  mind you dont disturb im  he put his and in under the bedcloes and felt all up and down sams back very careful  sam stood it for arf a minute and then e sat up in bed and behaved more like a windmill than a man  hold his ands ses ginger  hold em yourself ses peter dabbing is nose with his shirtsleeve  well were going to see it ses ginger if we have to make enough noise to rouse the ouse  fust of all were going to ask you perlite then we shall get louder and louder show us the locket wot you stole sam  showusthediamond locket  ses peter  its my turn peter ses ginger  one two three  showusth  shut up ses sam trembling all over  ill show it to you if you stop your noise  he put his and under his piller but afore he showed it to em he sat up in bed and made em a little speech  he said e never wanted to see their faces agin as long as he lived and why gingers mother adnt put im in a pail o cold water when e was born e couldnt understand  he said e didnt believe that even a mother could love a baby that looked like a codfish with red air and as for peter russet e believed his mother died of fright  thatll do ses ginger as sam stopped to get is breath  are you going to show us the locket or ave we got to shout agin  sam swallered something that nearly choked im and then he opened his and and showed it to them  peter told im to wave it so as they could see the diamonds flash and then ginger waved the candle to see ow they looked that way and pretty near set pore sams whiskers on fire  they didnt leave im alone till they knew as much about it as he could tell em and they both of em told im that if he took a reward of thirty pounds for it instead of selling it for a undred he was a bigger fool than he looked  i shall turn it over in my mind ses sam sucking is teeth  when i want your advice ill ask you for it  we wasnt thinking of you ses ginger we was thinking of ourselves  you ses sam with a bit of a start  wots it got to do with you  our sharell be bigger thats all ses ginger  much bigger ses peter  i couldnt dream of letting it go at thirty its chucking money away  why we might get two undred for it  who knows  sam sat on the edge of is bed like a man in a dream then e began to make a noise like a cat with a fishbone in its throat and then e stood up and let fly  dont stop im peter ses ginger  let im go on itll do him good  hes forgot all about that penknife you picked up and went shares in ses peter  i wouldnt be mean for twenty lockets  nor me neither ses ginger  but we wont let im be meanfor is own sake  well ave our rights  rights ses sam  rights  you didnt find it  we always go shares if we find anything ses ginger  wheres your memory sam  but i didnt find it ses sam  no you bought it ses peter and if you dont go shares well split on yousee  then you cant sell it anyway and perhaps you wont even get the reward  we can be at orange villa as soon as wot you can  sooner ses ginger nodding  but theres no need to do that  if e dont go shares ill slip round to the policestation fust thing in the morning  you know the way there all right ses sam very bitter  and we dont want none o your backanswers ses ginger  are you going shares or not  wot about the money i paid for it ses sam and my trouble  ginger and peter sat down on the bed to talk it over and at last arter calling themselves a lot o bad names for being too kindearted they offered im five pounds each for their share in the locket  and that means youve got your share for next to nothing sam ses ginger  some people wouldnt ave given you anything ses peter  sam gave way at last and then e stood by making nasty remarks while ginger wrote out a paper for them all to sign because he said he had known sam such a long time  it was amost daylight afore they got to sleep and the fust thing ginger did when he woke was to wake sam up and offer to shake ands with him the noise woke peter up and as sam wouldnt shake ands with im either they both patted him on the back instead  they made him take em to the little pub arter breakfast to read the bill about the reward  sam didnt mind going as it appened as he oped to meet is new pal there and tell im his troubles but though they stayed there some time e didnt turn up  he wasnt at the coffeeshop for dinner neither  peter and ginger was in igh spirits and though sam told em plain that he would sooner walk about with a couple of real pickpockets they wouldnt leave im an inch  anybody could steal it off of you sam ses ginger patting im on the weskit to make sure the locket was still there  its a good job youve got us to look arter you  we must buy im a moneybelt with a pocket in it ses peter  ginger nodded at im  yes he ses that would be safer  and hed better wear it next to is skin with everything over it  i should feel more comfortable then  and wot about me says sam turning on im  well well take it in turns ses ginger  you one day and then me and then peter  sam gave way at last as arter all he could see it was the safest thing to do but he ad so much to say about it that they got fair sick of the sound of is voice  they ad to go ome for im to put the belt on and then at seven oclock in the evening arter sam had ad two or three pints they had to go ome agin cos he was complaining of tightlacing  ginger had it on next day and he went ome five times  the other two went with im in case he lost imself and stood there making nasty remarks while he messed imself up with a pennorth of cold cream  it was a cheap belt and pore ginger said that when they ad done with it it would come in handy for sandpaper  peter didnt like it any better than the other two did and twice they ad to speak to im about stopping in the street and trying to make imself more comfortable by wriggling  sam said people misunderstood it  arter that they agreed to wear it outside their shirt and even then ginger said it scratched im  and every day they got more and more worried about wot was the best thing to do with the locket and whether it would be safe to try and sell it  the idea o walking about with a fortune in their pockets that they couldnt spend amost drove em crazy  the longer we keep it the safer itll be ses sam as they was walking down houndsditch one day  well sell it when im sixty ses ginger nastylike  then old sam wont be ere to have is share ses peter  sam was just going to answer em back when he stopped and began to smile instead  straight in front of im was the gentleman he ad met in the coffeeshop coming along with another man and he just ad time to see that it was the docker who ad sold him the locket when they both saw im  they turned like a flash and afore sam could get is breath bolted up a little alley and disappeared  wots the row  ses ginger staring  sam didnt answer im  he stood there struck all of a heap  do you know em  ses peter  sam couldnt answer im for a time  he was doing a bit of ard thinking  chap i ad a row with the other night he ses at last  he walked on very thoughtful and the more e thought the less e liked it  he was so pale that ginger thought e was ill and advised im to ave a drop o brandy  peter recommended rum so to please em he ad both  it brought is colour back but not is cheerfulness  he gave em both the slip next morning which was easy as ginger was wearing the locket and arter fust aving a long ride for nothing owing to getting in the wrong train he got to barnet  it was a big place big enough to ave a dozen orange villas but pore sam couldnt find one  it wasnt for want of trying neither  he asked at over twenty shops and the postoffice and even went to the policestation  he must ha walked six or seven miles looking for it and at last arf ready to drop e took the train back  he ad some sausages and mashed potatoes with a pint o stout at a place in bishopsgate and then e started to walk ome  the only comfort he ad was the thought of the ten pounds ginger and peter ad paid im and when he remembered that he began to cheer up and even smile  by the time he got ome e was beaming all over is face  whereve you been  ses ginger  enjoying myself by myself ses sam  please yourself ses peter very severe but whered you ha been if we ad sold the locket and skipped eh  you wouldnt ave enjoyed yourself by yourself then ses ginger  yes you may laugh  sam didnt answer im but he sat down on is bed and is shoulders shook till ginger lost his temper and gave him a couple o thumps on the back that pretty near broke it  all right ses sam very firm  now you ave done for yourselves  i ad amost made up my mind to go shares now you shant ave a hapenny  ginger laughed then  ho he ses and ow are you going to prevent it  weve got the locket sam ses peter smiling and shaking his ead at im  and well mind it till its sold ses ginger  sam laughed agin short and nasty  then he undressed imself very slow and got into bed  at twelve oclock just as ginger was dropping off he began to laugh agin and e only stopped when e heard ginger getting out of bed to im  he stayed in bed next morning cos he said is sides was aching but e laughed agin as they was going out and when they came back he ad gorn  we never know ow much we like anything till we lose it  a week arterwards as ginger was being elped out of a pawnshop by peter he said e would give all he adnt got for the locket to be near enough to sam to hear im laugh agin
