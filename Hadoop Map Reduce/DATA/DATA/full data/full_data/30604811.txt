if i should postpone our start until i had drawn you a map of the route with all the stoppingplaces set down  we have far to go and a great many things to see and it may be that some of you will be very tired before we get through  if so i shall be sorry but it will be a comfort to think that none of us need go any farther than we choose  there will be considerable variety in our rambles we shall walk about familiar places and we shall explore streets and houses that have been buried for centuries we shall go down deep into the earth and we shall float in a balloon high up into the air we shall see many beasts of the forest some that are bloody and cruel and others that are gentle and wise we will meet with birds fishes grand old buildings fleas vast woods bugs mummies snakes tightrope dancers gorillas willothewisps beautiful blossoms boomerangs oceans birds nests and i cannot tell you what all besides we will also have some adventures hear some stories and have a peep at a fairy or two before we are done  i shall not however be able to go with you everywhere when you are enjoying a bird chat buying the mirror learning when we must not believe our eyes visiting a city under the ground hearing of the coachmans troubles sitting under the oaktree finding out wonderful things about glass watching what happens when schools out or following the fortunes of carl your guide will be a lady and i think that you will all agree that she knows very well where she ought to go and how to get there the rest of the time you will be with me  and now having talked enough suppose we start     winter in the woods  illustration   what can be more delightful to a boy of spirit than a day in the woods when there has been a good snow if he also happens to have a good friend or two and some good dogs who are just as likely to be friends as his boycompanions he ought to be much happier than an ordinary king a forest is a fine place at any time but when the ground is well covered with snowespecially if there is a hard crust upon itthe woods seem to possess a peculiar charm you can go anywhere then  in the summer the thick undergrowth the intertwining vines and the heavy lower branches of the trees make it difficult even to see into the dark recesses of the forest but in the winter all is open the low wet places the deep holes the rotten bogs everything on the ground that is in the way of a good run and a jump is covered up you do not walk a hundred yards under the bare branches of the trees before up starts a rabbit or a hare if you would rather call him by his right nameand away go the dogs and away you goall of you tearing along at the top of your speed  but poor bunny has a small chance when a hard snow is on the ground his hidingplaces are all covered up and before he knows it the dogs have caught him and your mother will have stewed rabbit for supper it seems a hard fate for the poor little fellow but he was born partly for that purpose  when you have caught your rabbit and come back to where the men are cutting wood you will be just as proud to tell the boy who is cutting up the branches all about your splendid hunt as if you had chased and killed a stag  theres where we started him you will cry and away he scudded over there among the chestnuts and rover right at his heels and when we got down there to the creek rover turned heelsoverhead on the ice he was going so fast but i gave one slide right across and just up there by the big walnut the other two dogs got him  that boy is almost as much excited as you are and he would drop his axe in one minute and be off with you on another chase if his father were not there  and now you find that you have reached the woodcutters exactly in time for that great tree is just about to come down  there go the topbranches moving slowly along through the tops of the other trees and now they move faster and everything begins to crack and with a rush and a clatter of breaking limbs the great oak comes crashing down jarring the very earth beneath your feet and making the snow fly about like a sparkling cloud while away run the dogs with their tails between their legs  the tree is down now and you will want to be home in time for dinner farmer browns sled has just passed and if you will cut across the woods you can catch up with him and have a ride home and tell him all about the rabbithunt on the way  if it is saturday and a holiday you will be out again this afternoon with some of the other boys perhaps and have a grand hunt  suppose it is snowing what will you care you will not mind the snow any more than if it were a shower of blossoms from the appletrees in may     tricks of light  illustration   there is nothing more straightforward in its ways than lightwhen we let it alone but like many of us when it is introduced to the inventions and contrivances of the civilized world it often becomes exceedingly fond of vagaries and extravagances  of all the companions of light which endeavor to induce it to forsake its former simple habits there is not one which has the influence possessed by glass when light and glass get together it is difficult to divine what tricks they are going to perform but some of these are very interesting if they are a little wild and there are very few of us who do not enjoy them  illustration  for instance what a delight to any company be it composed of young folks or old is a magiclantern the most beautiful and the most absurd pictures may be made to appear upon the wall or screen but there is an instrument called the phantasmagoria which is really nothing but an improved magiclantern which is capable of producing much more striking effects it is a much larger instrument than the other and when it is exhibited a screen is placed between it and the spectators so that they do not see how the pictures are produced it is mounted on castors so that at times it can be brought nearer and nearer to the screen until the picture seems to enlarge and grow in a wonderful manner then when it is drawn back the image diminishes and recedes far into the distance the lenses and other mechanism of the phantasmagoria can also be moved in various directions making the action of the pictures still more wonderful sometimes when the instrument is exhibited in public the screen is not used but the pictures are thrown upon a cloud of smoke which is itself almost invisible in the dim light of the room in such a case the figures seem as if they were floating in the air  a man named robertson once gave exhibitions in paris in an old chapel and at the close of his performances he generally caused a great skeleton figure of death to appear among the pillars and arches many of the audience were often nearly scared to death by this apparition the more ignorant people of paris who attended these exhibitions could not be persuaded when they saw men women and animals walking about in the air between the arches of the chapel that robertson was not a magician although he explained to them that the images were nothing but the effect of a lantern and some glass lenses when these people could see that the figures were produced on a volume of smoke they were still more astonished and awed for they thought that the spirits arose from the fire which caused the smoke  but robertson had still other means of exhibiting the tricks of light opposite is a picture of the dance of demons  this delusion is very simple indeed and is produced by placing a cardfigure on a screen and throwing shadows from this upon another screen by means of several lights held by assistants thus each light throws its own shadow and if the candles are moved up and down and about the shadows will dance jump over each other and do all sorts of wonderful things robertson and other public exhibitors had quite complicated arrangements of this kind but they all acted on the same principle but all of those who exhibit to the public the freaks of light are not as honest as mr robertson you may have heard of nostradamus who also lived in paris but long before robertson and who pretended to be a magician among other things he asserted that he could show people pictures of their future husbands or wives marie de medicis a celebrated princess of the time came to him on this sensible errand and he being very anxious to please her showed her in a lookingglass the reflected image of henry of navarre sitting upon the throne of france this of course astonished the princess very much but it need not astonish us if we carefully examine the picture of that conjuring scene  illustration  the mirror into which the lady was to look was in a room adjoining that in which henry was sitting on the throne it was placed at such an angle that her face would not be reflected in it but an aperture in the wall allowed the figure of henry to be reflected from a lookingglass hung near the ceiling down upon the magic mirror so of course she saw his picture there and believed entirely in the old humbug nostradamus  illustration  but there are much simpler methods by which the vagaries of light may be made amusing and among the best of these are what are called chinese shadows these require a little ingenuity but they are certainly simple enough they consist of nothing but a card or paper upon which the lights of the picture intended to be represented are cut out when this is held between a candle and a wall a startling shadowimage may be produced which one would not imagine to have any connection with the card unless he had studied the manner in which said card was cut here is a picture of a company amusing themselves with these cards no one would suppose that the card which the young man is holding in his hand bore the least resemblance to a lions head but there is no mistaking the shadow on the wall  illustration  the most wonderful public exhibitions of optical illusions have been those in which a real ghost or spectre apparently moves across the stage of a theatre this has frequently been done in late years both in this country and europe the audiences were perfectly amazed to see a spirit suddenly appear walk about the stage and act like a regular ghost who did not seem to be in the least disturbed when an actor fired a pistol at him or ran him through with a sword the method of producing this illusion is well shown in the accompanying picture a large plate of glass is placed in front of the stage so that the audience does not perceive it the edges of it must be concealed by curtains which are not shown in the picture an actor dressed as a ghost walks in front of the stage below its level where he is not seen by the audience and a strong electric light being thrown upon him his reflected image appears to the spectator as if it were walking about on the stage when the light is put out of course the spirit instantly vanishes  illustration  a very amusing account is given of a man who was hired to do some work about a theatre he had finished his work for the present and wishing to eat his supper which he had brought with him he chose a nice quiet place under the stage where he thought he would not be disturbed not knowing that everything was prepared for the appearance of a ghost he sat down in front of the electric lamp and as soon as it was lighted the audience was amazed to see sitting very comfortably in the air above the stage a man in his shirtsleeves eating bread and cheese little did he think when he heard the audience roaring with laughter that they were laughing at his ghost  light plays so many tricks with our eyes and senses that it is possible to narrate but a few of them here but those that i have mentioned are enough to show us what a wild fellow he is especially where he and glass get frolicking together     saving the toll  illustration   when i was a youngster and lived in the country there were three of us boys who used to go very frequently to a small village about a mile from our homes to reach this village it was necessary to cross a narrow river and there was a tollbridge for that purpose the toll for every footpassenger who went over this bridge was one cent now this does not seem like a very high charge but at that time we very often thought that we would much rather keep our pennies to spend in the village than to pay them to the old man who took toll on the bridge but it was often necessary for us to cross the river and to do so and save our money at the same time we used to adopt a very hazardous expedient  at a short distance below the tollbridge there was a railroadbridge which you cannot see in the picture this bridge was not intended for anything but railroad trains it was very high above the water it was very long and it was not floored when any one stood on the crossties which supported the rails he could look right down into the water far below him for the convenience of the railroadmen and others who sometimes were obliged to go on the bridge there was a single line of boards placed over the ties at one side of the track and there was a slight handrail put up at that side of the bridge  to save our pennies we used to cross this bridge and every time we did so we risked our lives  we were careful however not to go on the bridge at times when a train might be expected to cross it for when the cars passed us we had much rather be on solid ground but one day when we had forgotten the hour or a train was behind or ahead of time or an extra train was on the roadwe were crossing this railroad bridge and had just about reached the middle of it when we heard the whistle of a locomotive looking up quickly we saw a train not a quarter of a mile away which was coming towards us at full speed we stood paralyzed for a moment we did not know what to do in a minute or less the train would be on the bridge and we had not or thought we had not time to get off of it whether we went forward or backward  but we could not stand on that narrow path of boards while the train was passing the cars would almost touch us what could we do i believe that if we had had time we would have climbed down on the trestlework below the bridge and so let the train pass over us but whatever could be done must be done instantly and we could think of nothing better than to get outside of the railing and hold on as well as we could in this position we would at any rate be far enough from the cars to prevent them from touching us so out we got and stood on the ends of the timbers holding fast to the slender handrail and on came the train when the locomotive first touched the bridge we could feel the shock and as it came rattling and grinding over the rails towards uscoming right on to us as it seemedour faces turned pale you may well believe  but the locomotive did not run off the track just at that exact spot where we were standinga catastrophe which i believe in the bottom of our hearts every one of us feared it passed on and the train came thundering after it how dreadfully close those cars did come to us how that bridge did shake and tremble in every timber and how we trembled for fear we should be shaken off into the river so far below us and what an enormously long train it was i suppose that it took really but a very short time to pass but it seemed to us as if there was no end to it at all and as if it would never never get entirely over that bridge  but it did cross at last and went rumbling away into the distance  then we three almost too much frightened to speak to each other crept under the rail and hurried over the bridge  all that anxiety that fright that actual misery of mind and positive danger of body to save one cent apiece  but we never saved any more money in that way when we crossed the river after that we went over the tollbridge and we paid our pennies like other sensible people  had it been positively necessary for us to have crossed that river and had there been no other way for us to do it but to go over the railroad bridge i think we might have been called brave boys for the bridge was very high above the water and a timid person would have been very likely to have been frightened when he looked down at his feet and saw how easy it would be for him to make a misstep and go tumbling down between the timbers  but as there was no necessity or sufficient reason for our risking our lives in that manner we were nothing more or less than three little fools  it would be well if all boys or girls to whom a hazardous feat presents itself would ask themselves the question would it be a brave thing for me to do that or would i be merely proving myself a simpleton     the real king of beasts  illustration a royal procession   for many centuries there has been a usurper on the throne of the beasts that creature is the lion  but those who take an interest in the animal kingdom and i am very sorry for those who do not should force the lion to take off the crown put down the sceptre and surrender the throne to the real king of beaststhe elephant  there is every reason why this high honor should be accorded to the elephant in the first place he is physically superior to the lion an elephant attacked by a lion could dash his antagonist to the ground with his trunk run him through with his tusks and trample him to death under his feet the claws and teeth of the lion would make no impression of any consequence on the elephants thick skin and massive muscles if the elephant was to decide his claim to the throne by dint of fighting for it the lion would find himself an exking in a very short time but the elephant is too peaceful to assert his right in this wayand what is more he does not suppose that any one could even imagine a lion to be his superior he never had such an idea himself  but besides his strength of body the elephant is superior in intelligence to all animals except the dog and man he is said by naturalists to have a very fine brain considering that he is only a beast his instinct seems to rise on some occasions almost to the level of our practical reasoning and the stories which are told of his smartness are very many indeed  but no one can assert that the lion has any particular intelligence to be sure there have been stories told of his generosity but they are not many and they are all very old the elephant proves his preeminence as a thinking beast every day we see him very frequently in menageries and we can judge of what he is capable we see the lion also and we very soon find out what he can do he can lie still and look grave and majestic he can jump about in his cage if he has been trained and he can eat he is certainly great in that respect  we all know a great deal about the elephant how he is caught and tamed and made the servant and sometimes the friend of man this however seldom happens but in india in africa they do not often tame elephants as they hunt them generally for the sake of their ivory and the poor beasts are killed by hundreds and hundreds so that we may have billiardballs knifehandles and finetooth combs  rut whether the elephant is wanted as a beast of burden or it is only his great tusks that are desired it is no joke to hunt him he will not attack a man without provocation except in very rare cases when he does get in a passion it is time for the hunter to look out for his precious skin if the man is armed with a gun he must take the best of aim and his bullets must be like young cannonballs for the elephants head is hard and his skin is tough if the hunter is on a horse he need not suppose that he can escape by merely putting his steed to its best speed the elephant is big and awkwardlooking but he gets over the ground in a very rapid manner  here is an illustration of an incident in which a boy found out in great sorrow and trepidation how fast an elephant can run  this boy was one of the attendants of the duke of edinburgh one of queen victorias sons who was hunting elephants in africa the elephants which the party were after on that particular day had got out of the sight of the hunters and this boy being mounted on a horse went to look them up it was not long before he found them and he also found much more than he had bargained for he found that one of the big fellows was very much inclined to hunt him and he came riding out of the forest as hard as he could go with a great elephant full tilt after him fortunately for the boy the duke was ready with his gun and when the elephant came dashing up he put two balls into his head the great beast dropped mortally wounded and the boy was saved i dont believe that he was so curious about the whereabouts of elephants after that  illustration  when the elephant is desired as a servant he is captured in various ways sometimes he is driven into great pens sometimes he tumbles into pitfalls and sometimes tame elephants coax him into traps and fondle and amuse him while their masters tie up his legs with strong ropes the pitfalls are not favorite methods of capturing elephants besides the injury that may be done to the animal other beasts may fall into and disturb the trap and even men may find themselves at the bottom of a great deep hole when they least expect it for the top is very carefully covered over with sticks and leaves so as to look as much as possible like the surrounding ground du chaillu who was a great hunter in africa once fell down one of these pits and it was a long time before he could make anybody hear him and come and help him out if an elephant had happened to put his foot on the covering of that hole while du chaillu was down there the hunter would have found himself very much crowded  when the elephant is caught he is soon tamed and trained and then he goes to work to make himself useful if there is anything for him to do and it is when he becomes the servant and companion of man that we have an opportunity of seeing what a smart fellow he is  it is sometimes hard to believe all that we hear of the elephants cleverness and sagacity but we know that most of the stories we hear about him are true  for instance an elephant which was on exhibition in this country had a fast and true friend a little dog one day when these animals were temporarily residing in a barn while on their march from one town to another the elephant heard some men teasing the dog just outside of the barn the rough fellows made the poor little dog howl and yelp as they persecuted him by all sorts of mean tricks and ill usage when the elephant heard the cries of his friend he became very much worried and when at last he comprehended that the dog was being badly treated he lifted up his trunk and just smashed a great hole in the side of the barn making the stones and boards fly before him  illustration  when the men saw this great head sticking out through the side of the barn and that great long trunk brandishing itself above their heads they thought it was time to leave that little dog alone  here again is an elephant story which is almost as tough as the animals hide but we have no right to disbelieve it for it is told by very respectable writers during the war between the east indian natives and the english in 1858 there was an elephant named kudabar moll the secondhis mother having been a noted elephant named kudabar moll this animal belonged to the british army and his duty was to carry a cannon on his back in this way he became very familiar with artillery during a battle when his cannon was posted on a battery and was blazing away at the enemy the good kudabar was standing according to custom a few paces in the rear of the gunners but the fire became very hot on that battery and very soon most of the gunners were shot down so that there was no one to pass the cartridges from the ammunition wagon to the artillerymen perceiving this kudabar without being ordered took the cartridges from the wagon and passed them one by one to the gunner very soon however there were only three men left and these just as they had loaded their cannon for another volley fell killed or wounded almost at the same moment one of them who held a lighted match in his hand called as he fell to the elephant and handed him the match the intelligent kudabar took the match in his trunk stepped up to the cannon and fired it off  he was then about to apply the match to others when reenforcements came up and his services as an artilleryman were no longer required  i cannot help thinking that if that elephant had been furnished with a pen and ink he might possibly have written a very good account of the battle  but few stories are quite as wonderful as that one we have no difficulty at all in believing the account of the elephant who took care of a little child he did not wear a cap and apron as the artist has shown in the picture but he certainly was a very kind and attentive nurse when the child fell down the elephant would put his trunk gently around it and pick it up when it got tangled among thorns or vines the great nurse would disengage it as carefully as any one could have done it and when it wandered too far the elephant would bring it back and make it play within proper limits i do not know what would have been the consequence if this child had behaved badly and the elephant had thought fit to give it a box on the ear but nothing of the kind ever happened and the child was a great deal safer than it would have been with many ordinary nurses  illustration  there are so many stories told about the elephant that i can allude to but few even if i did not believe that you were familiar with a great many of them  one of the most humane and thoughtful elephants of whom i have ever heard was one which was attached like our friend kudabar to an artillery train in india he was walking on a march behind a wagon when he perceived a soldier slip down in the road and fall exactly where in another instant the hindwheel of the wagon would pass over him without being ordered the elephant seized the wheel with his trunk lifted itwagon and allin the air and held it up until it had passed over the fallen soldier  neither you nor i could have done better than that even if we had been strong enough  illustration  a very pretty story is told of an indian elephant who was very gallant his master a young burman lord had recently been married and shortly after the wedding he and his bride with many of their guests and followers were gathered together in the veranda on the outside of his house the elephant who was a great favorite with the young lord happened to be conducted past the house as the company were thus enjoying themselves feeling no doubt that it was right to be as polite as possible on this occasion he put his trunk over a bamboofence which enclosed a garden and selecting the biggest and brightest flower he could see he approached the veranda and rearing himself upon his hindlegs he stretched out his trunk with the flower held delicately in the little finger at its end towards the company one of the women reached out her hand for it but the elephant would not give it to her then his master wished to take it but the elephant would not let him have it but when the newlymade bride came forward the elephant presented it to her with all the grace of which he was capable  illustration  now do you not think that an animal which is larger and more powerful than any beast which walks the earth and is at the same time gentle enough to nurse a child humane enough to protect a dog or a man and sensible enough to be polite to a newlymarried lady is deserving of the title of the king of beasts     the french soldierboy  illustration   anxiously the generalinchief of the french army stood upon a little mound overlooking the battlefield the cannon were thundering the musketry was rattling and clouds of smoke obscured the field and the contending armies  ah thought he if that town over yonder is not taken if my brave captains fall and my brave soldiers falter at that stone wall and if our flag shall not soon wave over those ramparts france may yet be humbled  is it then a wonder feeling that so much depended on the result of this battle that his eyes strove so earnestly to pierce the heavy clouds of smoke that overhung the scene  but while he stood there came towards him galloping madly out of the battle a solitary rider  in a few minutes he had reached the general and thrown himself from his saddle  it was a mere boyone of the very youngest of soldiers  sire he cried weve taken the town our men are in the marketplace and you can ride there now and seeupon the wallsour flag  the eyes of the general flashed with joy and triumph here was glorious news  as he turned to the boy to thank him for the more than welcome tidings that he brought he noticed that the lad was pale and trembling and that as he stood holding by the mane of his horse his left hand was pressed upon his chest and the blood was slowly trickling between his fingers  my boy said he tenderly as he fixed his eyes upon the stripling youre wounded  no sire cried the boy his pale face flushing as his general thus addressed him and the shouts of victory filled his ears i am not wounded i am killed and down at his generals feet he fell and died  there have been brave men upon the battlefield ever since the world began but there never was a truer soldiers heart than that which kept this boy alive until he had borne to his general the glorious news of the battle won     a lively way to ring a bell  illustration   here are two young men who look very much as if they were trying to break their necks but in reality they have no such desire  they are simply ringing that great bell and riding backward and forward on it as it swings through the air  these young fellows are spaniards and in many churches in their country it is considered a fine thing to go up into the belfry of a church or cathedral and when the regular bellringers are tired to jump on the great bells and swing away as hard as they can make them go no matter about any particular peal or style of ringing  the faster and the more furiously they swing the jollier the ride and the greater the racket sometimes in a cathedral there are twenty bells all going at once with a couple of mad chaps riding on each one of them it is doubtless a very pleasant amusement after one gets used to it but it is a wonder that some of those young men are not shot off into the air when the great bell gets to swinging as fast and as far as it can go  but although they hold on as tightly as if they were riding a wild young colt they are simply foolhardy no man or boy has a right to risk his life and limbs in such reckless feats  there is no probability however of the sport ever being introduced into this country  even if there were no danger in it such a clatter and banging as is heard in a spanish belfry when the young men are swinging on the bells would never be allowed in our churches the spaniards may like such a noise and hubbub but they like a great many things which would not suit us     down in the earth  illustration   let us take a little trip down under the surface of the earth there will be something unusual about such an excursion of course as we are not going to dig our way we will have to find a convenient hole somewhere and the best hole for the purpose which i know of is in edmondson county kentucky  so let us go there  when we reach this hole we find that it is not a very large one but still quite high and wide enough for us to enter but before we go in to that dark place we will get some one to carry a light and guide us for this underground country which we are going to explore is very extensive very dark and in some places very dangerous  here is a black man who will go with us he has a lantern and he says he knows every nook and corner of the place so we engage him get some lanterns for ourselves and in we go we commence to go downwards very soon after we have passed from the outer air and sunshine but it is not long before we stand upon a level surface where we can see nothing of the outside world if our lanterns went out we should be in pitchy darkness  now we are in the mammoth cave of kentucky  this vast cavern which stretches so many miles beneath the surface of the earth has never been fully explored but we are going over as much of it as our guide is accustomed to show to visitors and if our legs are not tired before we get back i shall be very much surprised for the trip will take us all day the floor on which we are now standing is smooth and level and runs back into the interior of the cave fully a thousand yards this place they call the audubon galleryafter our famous naturalist who made birds the study of his life his works are published in enormous volumes costing about one hundred and fifty dollars apiece perhaps your father will get you one  we pass quickly through this gallery where there is not much to see although to be sure they used to manufacture saltpetre here think of that a manufactory in the bowels of the earth then we enter a large roundish room called the rotunda and from this there are a great many passages leading off in various directions one of these which is called the grand vestibule will take us to the church  yes we have a church here and what is more there has been preaching in it although i have never heard that it had any regular members this room has a vast arched roof and a great many stalactites hang from the walls and roof in such a way as to give one an idea of gothic architecture therefore this has been called the gothic church you can see a great deal which looks like oldfashioned church ornaments and furniture and as the light of the lanterns flashes about on the walls and ceiling you can imagine a great deal more  after this we come to the gothic avenue which would be a very interesting place to us if we but had a little more time but we hurry through it for the next room we are to visit is called the haunted chamber every one of us must be very anxious to see anything of that kind when we get into it however we are very much disappointed it is not half so gloomy and dark as the rest of the cave for here we are pretty sure to find people and lights and signs of life  here you may sometimes buy gingerbread and bottled beer from women who have stands here for that purpose it is expected that when visitors get this far they will be hungry sometimes too there are persons who live down here and spend most of their time in this chamber these are invalid people with weak lungs who think that the air of the cave is good for them i do not know whether they are right or not but i am sure that they take very gloomy medicine the only reason for calling this room the haunted chamber is that the first explorers of the cave found mummies here  who these were when they were alive no man can say if they were indians they were very different indians from those who have lived in this country since its discovery they do not make mummies but all over our land we find evidences that some racenow extinctlived here before the present north american indian  whether the ghosts of any of these mummies walk about in this room i cannot say but as no one ever saw any or heard any or knew anybody who had seen or heard any i think it is doubtful  when we leave this room we go down some ladders and over a bridge and then we enter what is called the labyrinth where the passage turns and twists on itself in a very abrupt manner and where the roof is so low that all of us except those who are very short indeed must stoop very low when we get through this passage which some folks call the path of humiliationfor everybody has to bow down you knowwe come to a spot where the guide says he is going to show us something through a window  the window is nothing but a hole broken in a rocky wall but as we look through it and hold the lanterns so that we can see as much as possible we perceive that we are gazing down into a deep and enormous well they call it the bottomless pit if we drop bits of burning paper into this well we can see them fall down down and down until they go out but can never see them stop as if they had reached the bottom  the hole through which we are looking is cut through one side of this well so that there is a great deal of it above us as well as below but although we hold our lanterns up hoping to see the top we can see nothing but pitchy darkness up there the roof of this pit is too high for the light to strike upon it here is a picture of some persons dropping lights down into this pit hoping to be able to see the bottom  we must climb up and down some more ladders now and then we will reach the mammoth dome this is a vast roombig enough for a gymnasium for giantsand the roof is so high that no ordinary light will show it it is nearly four hundred feet from the floor the next room we visit is one of the most beautiful places in the whole cave it is called the starry chamber the roof and walls and floor are covered with little bright bits of stone which shine and glitter when a light is brought into the room like real stars in the sky if the guide is used to his business he can here produce most beautiful effects by concealing his lantern behind a rock or pillar and then gradually bringing it out throwing more and more light upon the roof he can create a most lovely starlight scene  illustration  at first all will be dark and then a few stars will twinkle out and then there will be more of them and each one will be brighter and at last you will think you are looking up into a dark sky full of glorious shining stars and if you look at the walls you will see thousands of stars that seem as if they were dropping from the sky and if you cast your eyes upon the ground you will see it covered with other thousands of stars that seem to have already fallen  this is a lovely place but we cannot stay here any longer we want to reach the underground stream of which we have heard so muchthe river styx  this is a regular river running through a great part of the mammoth cave you may float on it in a boat and if you choose you may fish in it although you would not be likely to catch anything but if you did the fish would have no eyes all the fish in this river are blind you can easily perceive that eyes would be of no use in a place where it is always as dark as pitch except when travellers come along with their lanterns  there is a rough boat here and we will get into it and have a row over this dark and gloomy river whenever our guide shouts we hear the wildest kind of echoes and everything seems solemn and unearthly at one time our boat stops for a moment and the guide goes on shore and directly we hear the most awful crash imaginable it sounds as if a dozen gongfactories had blown up at once and we nearly jump out of the boat but we soon see that it was nothing but the guide striking on a piece of sheetiron or tin the echoes one after another from this noise had produced the horrible crashing sounds we had heard  after sailing along for about half an hour we land and soon reach an avenue which has its walls ornamented with beautiful flowersall formed on the rocky walls by the hand of nature  now we visit the ball room which is large and handsome with its walls as white as snow leaving this we take a difficult and exciting journey to the rocky mountains we go down steep paths which are narrow and up steep ones which are wide we jump over wide cracks and step over great stones and we are getting very tired of scrambling about in the bowels of the earth but the guide tells us that if we will but cross the mountainswhich we find to be nothing more than great rocks which have fallen from the roof above but which however are not very easy to get overwe shall rest in the fairy grotto so on we push and reach the delightful abode of the fairies of the mammoth cave that is if there were any fairies in this cave they would live here  and a splendid place they would have  great colonnades and magnificent arches all ornamented with beautiful stalactites of various forms and glittering like cutglass in the light of our lanterns and thousands of different ornaments of sparkling stone many of them appearing as if they were cut by the hand of skilful artists adorn this beautiful grotto at one end there is a group of stalactites which looks to us exactly like a graceful palmtree cut out of alabaster all over the vast hall we can hear the pattering and tinkling of the water which has been dripping drop by drop for centuries and making as it carried with it little particles of earth and rock all these beautiful forms which we see  we have now walked nearly five miles into the great cave and there is much which we have not seen but we must go back to the upper earth we will have a tiresome trip of it but it is seldom that we can get anything good without taking a little trouble for it and to have seen this greatest of all natural caverns is worth far more labor and fatigue than we have expended on its exploration there is nothing like it in the known world     the lion  illustration the lions home   i do not desire to be wanting in respect to the lion because i asserted that it was my opinion that he should resign the throne of the king of beasts to the elephant i do not wish to deprive him of any part of his just reputation  the lion with the exception of any animal but the elephant the rhinoceros the hippopotamus and such big fellows is the strongest of beasts compared to tigers and panthers he is somewhat generous and compared to most of the flesheating animals he is quite intelligent lions have been taught to perform certain feats when in a state of captivity but as all of us know who have seen the performing animals in a menagerie he is by no means the equal of a dog or an elephant  the lion appears to the greatest advantage in the midst of his family when he and his wife are taking their walks abroad they will often fly before a man especially if he is a white man  but at home surrounded by their little ones the case is different those cubs in the picture of the lions home are nice little fellows and you might play with them without fear of more than a few scratches but where is the brave man who would dare to go down among those rocks armed with guns pistols or whatever he pleased and take one of them  i do not think he lives in your town  we never see a lion looking very brave or noble in a cage most of those that i have seen appeared to me to be excessively lazy they had not half the spirit of the tigers and wolves but out in his native country he presents a much more imposing spectacle especially if one can get a full view of him when he is a little excited here is a picture of such a lion as you will not see in a cage  illustration  considering his size the strength of the lion is astonishing he will kill an ox with one blow of his great paw if he strikes it on the back and then seizing it in his great jaws he will carry it off almost as easily as you could carry a baby  and when he has carried his prey to the spot where he chooses to have his dinner he shows that no beast can surpass him in the meateating line when he has satisfied his hunger on an ox there is not much left for those who come to the second table and there are often other lions younger and weaker than the one who has provided the dinner who must wait until their master or father is done before they have a chance to take a bite but as you may see by this picture they do not wait very patiently they roar and growl and grumble until their turn comes  illustration  lions have some very peculiar characteristics when they have made a bound upon their prey and have missed it they seldom chase the frightened animal they are accustomed to make one spring on a deer or an ox and to settle the matter there and then so after a failure to do this they go to the place from which they have made the spring and practise the jump over and over until they feel that they can make it the next time they have a chance  this is by no means a bad idea for a lionor a man either  another of their peculiarities is their fear of traps and snares very often they will not spring upon an ox or a horse simply because it is tied to a tree they think there is some trick when they see the animal is fastened by a rope  and when they come upon a man who is asleep they will very often let him lie undisturbed they are not accustomed to seeing men lying about in their haunts and they dont know what to make of it sometimes they take it in their heads to lie down there themselves then it becomes disagreeable for the man when he awakes  illustration  a story of this kind is told of an african who had been hunting and who being tired had lain down to sleep when he awoke there lay a great lion at a short distance from him for a minute or two the man remained motionless with fright and then he put forth his hand to take his gun which was on the ground a few feet from him  but when the lion saw him move he raised his head and roared  the man was quiet in a second  after a while it began to be terribly hot and the rocks on which the poor man was lying became so heated by the sun that they burned his feet  but whenever he moved the old lion raised his head and growled  the african lay there for a very long time and the lion kept watch over him i expect that lion had had a good meal just before he saw this man and he was simply saving him up until he got hungry again but fortunately after the hunter had suffered awfully from the heat of the burning sun and had also lain there all night with this dreadful beast keeping watch over him the lion became thirsty before he got hungry and when he went off to a spring to get a drink the african crawled away  if that lion had been a tiger i think he would have killed the man whether he wished to eat him or not  so there is something for the lions reputation     bobs hidingplace  illustration   bob was not a very big boy but he was a lively little fellow and full of fun you can see him there in the picture riding on his brother jims back one evening there happened to be a great many boys and girls at bobs fathers house the grownup folks were having a family party and as they were going to stay all nightyou see this was in the countrysome of them brought their children with them  illustration  it was not long after supper that a game of blindmansbuff was proposed and as it would not do to have such an uproar in the sittingroom as the game would produce the children were all packed off to the kitchen there they have a glorious time jim is the first one blindfolded and as he gropes after the others they go stumbling up against tables and rattling down tinpans and upsetting each other in every direction old grandfather who has been smoking his pipe by the kitchen fire takes as much pleasure in the game as the young folks and when they tumble over his legs or come banging up against his chair he only laughs and warns them not to hurt themselves  i could not tell you how often grandfather was caught and how they all laughed at the blindman when he found out whom he had seized  but after a while the children became tired of playing blindmansbuff and a game of hideandseek was proposed everybody was in favor of that especially little bob it appears that bob had not a very good time in the other game everybody seemed to run up against him and push him about and whenever he was caught the blindman said bob immediately you see there was no mistaking bob he was so little  but in hideandseek he would have a better chance he had always liked that game ever since he had known how to play anything he was a good little fellow for hiding and he knew it  when the game had begun and all the childrenexcept the biggest girl who was standing in a corner with her hands before her face counting as fast as she could and hoping that she would come to one hundred before everybody had hidden themselveshad scampered off to various hidingplaces bob still stood in the middle of the kitchenfloor wondering where in the world he should go to all of a suddenthe girl in the corner had already reached sixtyfourhe thought he would go down in the cellar  there was no rule against thatat least none that he knew ofand so slipping softly to the cellardoor over in the darkest corner of the kitchen he opened it and went softly down the steps  there was a little light on the steps for bob did not shut the door quite tightly after him and if there had been none at all he would have been quite as well pleased he was not afraid of the dark and all that now filled his mind was the thought of getting somewhere where no one could possibly find him so he groped his way under the steps and there he squatted down in the darkness behind two barrels which stood in a corner  now thought bob she wont find meeasy  he waited there a good while and the longer he waited the prouder he became  ill bet mines the hardest place of all he said to himself  illustration  bob heard a great deal of noise and shouting after the big girl came out from her corner and began finding the others and he also heard a bang above his head but he did not know that it was some one shutting the cellardoor after that all was quiet  bob listened but could not hear a step he had not the slightest idea of course that they had stopped playing and were telling stories by the kitchen fire the big girl had found them all so easily that hideandseek had been voted down  bob had his own ideas in regard to this silence i know he whispered to himself theyre all found and theyre after me and keeping quiet to hear me breathe  and to prevent their finding his hidingplace by the sound of his breathing bob held his breath until he was red in the face he had heard often enough of that trick of keeping quiet and listening to breathing you couldnt catch him that way  when he was at last obliged to take a breath you might have supposed he would have swallowed half the air in the cellar he thought he had never tasted anything so good as that long draught of fresh air  cant hold my breath all the time bob thought if i could maybe theyd never find me at all which reflection was much nearer the truth than the little fellow imagined  i dont know how long bob had been sitting under the stepsit may have been five minutes or it may have been a quarter of an hour and he was beginning to feel a little coldwhen he heard the cellardoor open and some one put their foot upon the steps  there they are he thought and he cuddled himself up in the smallest space possible  some one was coming down sure enough but it was not the children as bob expected it was his aunt alice and her cousin tom green they had come down to get some cider and apples for the company and had no thought of bob in fact when bob was missed it was supposed that he had got tired and had gone upstairs where old aunt hannah was putting some of the smaller children to bed  so of course alice and tom green did not try to find him but bob who could not see them thought it was certainly some of the children come down to look for him  in this picture of the scene in the cellar little bob is behind those two barrels in the righthand upper corner but of course you cant see him he knows how to hide too well for that  illustration  but when tom and alice spoke bob knew their voices and peeped out  oh he thought its only aunt alice and he theyve come down for cider and things ive got to hide safe now or theyll tell when they go upstairs  i didnt know all them barrels had apples in i thought some were potatoes i wish they would just go upstairs again and leave that candle on the floor i wonder if they will forget it if they do ill just eat a whole hatfull of those big red apples and some of the streakedy ones in the other barrel too and then ill put my mouth to the spigot of that ciderbarrel and turn it and drink and drink and drinkand if there isnt enough left in that barrel ill go to another one and turn that i never did have enough cider in all my life i wish theyd hurry and go up  kissin whats the good of kissin a cellar aint no place for that i expect they wont remember to forget the candle if they dont look out  oh pshaw just look at em theyre agoing up again and taking the candle along the mean things  poor little bob  there he sat in his corner all alone again in the darkness and silence for tom and alice had shut the cellardoor after them when they had gone upstairs he sat quietly for a minute or two and then he said to himself  i blieve id just as lieve theyd find me as not  and to help them a little in their search he began to kick very gently against one of the barrels  poor bob if you were to kick with all your force and even upset the barrel they would not hear you and what is more they are not even thinking of you for the apples are now being distributed  i wonder said the little fellow to himself if i could find that redapple barrel in the dark but then i couldnt tell the red ones from the streakedy ones but either of em would do i guess i wont try though for i might put my hand on a rat they run about when its dark i hope they wont come in this corner but theres nothin for em to eat in this corner but me and they aint lions i wonder if theyll come down after more cider when thats all drunk up if they do i guess ill come out and let aunt alice tell them all where i am i dont like playin this game when its too long  illustration  and so he sat and waited and listened and his eyelids began to grow heavy and his head began to nod and directly little bob was fast asleep in the dark corner behind the barrels  by ten oclock the children were all put to bed and soon after the old folks went upstairs leaving only tom green alice and some of the young men and women down in the big sittingroom  bobs mother went up into the room where several of the children were sleeping and after looking around she said to the old colored nurse  hannah what have you done with bob  i didnt put him to bed mum i spect miss alice has took him to her bed she knowed how crowded the chilun all was up here  but alice has not gone to bed said bobs mother  dont spect she has mum said hannah but i reckon she put him in her bed till she come  ill go and see said bobs mother  she went and she saw but she didnt see bob and he wasnt in the next room or in any bed in the house or under any bed or anywhere at all as far as she could see and so pretty soon there was a nice hubbub in that house  bobs mother and father and his grandfather and hannah and the young folks in the parlor and nearly all the rest of the visitors ransacked the house from top to bottom then they looked out of doors and some of them went around the yard where they could see very plainly as it was bright moonlight but though they searched and called there was no bob  the housedoors being open snag the dog came in and he joined in the search you may be sure although i do not know that he exactly understood what they were looking for  some one now opened the cellardoor but it seemed preposterous to look down in the cellar for the little fellow  but nothing was preposterous to snag  the moment the cellardoor was opened he shuffled down the steps as fast as he could go he knew there was somebody down there  and when those who followed him with a candle reached the cellarfloor there was snag with his head between the barrels wagging his tail as if he was trying to jerk it off and whining with joy as he tried to stick his cold nose into the rosy face of little sleeping bob  it was tom green who carried bob upstairs and very soon indeed all the folks were gathered in the kitchen and bob sleepily told his story  but tom and i were down in the cellar said his aunt alice and we didnt see you  i guess you didnt said bob rubbing his eyes i was ahidin and you was akissin  what a shout of laughter arose in the kitchen at this speech everybody laughed so much that bob got wide awake and wanted some apples and cake  the little fellow certainly made a sensation that night but it was afterwards noticed that he ceased to care much for the game of hideandseek he played it too well you see     the continental soldier  illustration   did you ever see a continental soldier i doubt it some twenty years ago there used to be a few of them scattered here and there over the country but they must be nearly all gone now about a year ago there were but two of them left those whom some of us can remember were rather mournful old gentlemen they shuffled about their dwellingplaces they smoked their pipes and they were nearly always ready to talk about the glorious old days of the revolution it was well they had those days to fall back upon for they had but little share in the glories of the present when they looked abroad upon the country that their arms and blood perhaps had helped give to that vigorous young america which now swells with prosperity from alaska to florida they could see very little of it which they could call their own  it was difficult to look upon those feeble old men and imagine that they were once full of vigor and fire that they held their old flintlocks with arms of iron when the british cavalry rushed upon their bayonets that their keen eyes flashed a deadly aim along their rusty riflebarrels that with their good swords quivering in their sinewy hands they urged their horses boldly over the battlefield shouting brave words to their advancing men and that they laughed at heat and cold patiently endured hunger and privation strode along bravely on the longest marches and at last stood proudly by when cornwallis gave up his sword  those old gentlemen did not look like anything of that sort their old arms could hardly manage their old canes their old legs could just about carry them on a march around the garden and they were very particular indeed about heat and cold  but history and art will better keep alive the memory of their good deeds and call more vigorously upon the gratitude of their countrymen than those old continentallers could themselves have done it had they lived on for years and years and told generation after generation how once they galloped proudly along the ranks or in humbler station beat with vigorous arm the stirring drumroll that called their comrades to the battlefield  illustration     a judge of music  illustration   it is not well to despise anybody or anything until you know what they can do i have known some very stupidlooking people who could do a sum in the ruleofthree in a minute and who could add up a column of six figures abreast while i was just making a beginning at the righthand bottom corner but stupidlooking beings are often good at other things besides arithmetic i have seen doctors with very dull faces who knew all about castoroil and mustardplasters and above you see a picture of a donkey who understood music  this animal had a very fine ear for music you can see how much ear he had and i have no doubt that he enjoyed the sweet sounds from one end to the other of those beautiful long flaps well he very often had an opportunity of enjoying himself for the lady of the house was a fine musician and she used to sing and play upon the piano nearly every day and as soon as he heard the sweet sounds which thrilled his soul the donkey would come to the parlor window and listen  one day the lady played and sang something which was particularly sweet and touching i never heard the name of the songwhether it was im sitting on the stile mary or a watcher pale and wearybut if it was the latter i am not surprised that it should have overcome even a jackass at any rate the music so moved the soul of mr donkey that he could no longer restrain himself but entering the open door he stepped into the parlor approached the lady and with a voice faltering from the excess of his emotion he joined in the chorus  the lady jumped backwards and gave a dreadful scream and the donkey thinking that the music went up very high in that part commenced to bray at such a pitch that you could have heard him if you had been up in a balloon  that was a lively concert but it was soon ended by the lady rushing from the room and sending her man john to drive out the musical jackass with a big stick  fortunately all donkeys have not this taste for music the nearest that the majority of jackasses come to being votaries of music is when their skins are used for covering cases for musical instruments and if they have any ambition in the cause of harmony that is better than nothing     the sensitive plant   there was never a better name for a plant than this for the delicate leaves which grow on this slender stalk are almost as sensitive to the touch as if they were alive if you place your hand on a growing plant you will soon see all the leaves on the stem that you have touched fold themselves up as tightly as if they had been packed up carefully to be sent away by mail or express in some of the common kinds of this plant which grow about in our fields it takes some time for the leaves to fold after they have been touched or handled but if you watch them long enoughfive or ten minutesyou will see that they never fail to close they are not so sensitive as their cultivated kindred but they still have the family disposition  now this is certainly a wonderful property for a plant to possess but it is not half so strange as another trait of these same pretty green leaves they will shut up when it is dark and open when it is light  it may be said that many other plants will do this but that is a mistake many flowers and leaves close at night and open in the daytime but very few indeed exhibit the peculiar action of the sensitive plant in this respect that plant will open at night if you bring a bright light into the room where it is growing and it will close its leaves if the room is made dark in the daytime  other plants take note of times and seasons the sensitive plant obeys no regular rules of this kind but acts according to circumstances  when i was a boy i often used to go to a greenhouse where there were a great many beautiful and rare plants but i always thought that the sensitive plant was the most wonderful thing in the whole collection and i did not know then how susceptible it was to the influence of light i was interested in it simply because it seemed to have a sort of vegetable reason and understood that it should shut up its leaves whenever i touched it  illustration the sensitive plant  but there were things around me in the vegetable kingdom which were still more wonderful than that and i took no notice of them at all  in the garden and around the house growing everywhere in the most common and ordinary places were vines of various kindsi think there were more morningglories than anything elseand these exhibited a great deal more sense and a much nearer approach to reasoning powers than the sensitive plants which were so carefully kept in the greenhouse  when one of these vines came up out of the earth fresh from its seed the first thing it wanted after its tendrils began to show themselves was something to climb up upon it would like a good high pole now if there was such a pole within a few feet of the little vine it would grow straight towards it and climb up it  it would not grow first in one direction and then in another and then in another until it ran against something to climb on but it would go right straight towards the pole as if it saw it and knew it was a good one for its purpose  i think that there is not much in the vegetable kingdom more wonderful than that     sir marmaduke  illustration   sir marmaduke was a good old english gentleman all of the olden time there you see him in his oldfashioned diningroom with his oldfashioned wife holding her oldfashioned distaff while he is surrounded by his oldfashioned arms pets and furniture  on his hand he holds his hawk and his dogs are enjoying the great wood fire his saddle is thrown on the floor his hat and his pipes lie near it his sword and his crossbows are stood up or thrown down anywhere at all and standing by his great chair is something which looks like a coalscuttle but which is only a helmet  sir marmaduke was certainly a fine old gentleman in times of peace he lived happily with his family and was kind and generous to the poor around him in times of war he fought bravely for his country  but what a different old gentleman would he have been had he lived in our day  then instead of saying rebeck me and ods boddikins when his hawk bit his finger or something else put him out of humor he would have exclaimed oh pshaw or botheration instead of playing with a hawk he would have had a blackandtan terrierif he had any pet at all and his wife would not have been bothering herself with a distaff when linen already spun and woven could be bought for fifty cents a yard had she lived now the good lady would have been mending stockings or crocheting a tidy  instead of a pitcher of ale on his suppertable the good knight would have had some tea or coffee and instead of a chine of beef a mess of pottage and a great loaf of brown bread for his evening meal he would have had some white bread cakes preserves and other trifles of that sort which in the olden days were considered only fit for children and women the good old english gentlemen were tremendous eaters they used to take five meals a day and each one of them was heavy and substantial  if sir marmaduke had any sons or daughters he would have treated them very differently in the present day instead of keeping them at home under the tuition of some young clergyman or ancient scholar until they should be old enough and accomplished enough to become pages to a great lord or companions to some great lady he would have sent them to school and the boysthe younger ones at leastwould have been prepared for some occupation which would support them while the girls would have been taught to play on the piano and to work slippers  in these days instead of that old helmet on the floor you would have seen a hightop hatthat is if the old gentleman should continue to be as careless as the picture shows him instead of a crossbow on the floor and another leaning against the chair you would have seen a doublebarrelled gun and a powderhorn and instead of the picturesque and becoming clothes in which you see sir marmaduke he would have worn some sort of a tightfitting and ugly suit such as old gentlemen nowadays generally wear  there were a great many advantages in the old style of living and also a very great many disadvantages on the whole we should be very thankful indeed that we were born in this century and not in the good old times of yore  a little boy once made a very wise remark on this subject he said i wish i could have seen george washington and israel putnam but im glad i didnt for if id been alive then i should have been dead now  there is enough in that boys remark for a whole composition if any one chose to write it     the giraffe  illustration   some one once called the giraffe a twostory animal and the remark was not altogether inapplicable  as you see him in the picture lying down he seems to be high enough for all ordinary purposes but when he stands up you will see that his legsor his lower storywill elevate him to a surprising height  the ordinary giraffe measures about fifteen feet from the top of his head to the ground but some of them have been known to be over sixteen feet high most of this height is owing to their long necks but their forelegs are also very long the hindlegs seem much shorter although in reality they are as long as the forelegs the legs and neck of the giraffe are made long so that he can eat the leaves from the tops of young trees this tender foliage is his favorite diet but he will eat the foliage from any part of a tree and he is content with the herbage on the ground when there is nothing else  he is not a fighting animal those little horns which you see on his head and which look as if they had been broken offalthough they are really their full sizeare of no use as offensive weapons when danger threatens him he runs away and a funny sight he is then he can run very fast but he is very awkward he goes like a cow on stilts  but when there is no chance for him to run away he can often defend himself for he can kick like a good fellow his hindlegs fly so fast when he is kicking that you can hardly see them and he has been known to drive off a lion by this means of defence  when hunters wish to catch a giraffe alive they generally drive him into a thick woods where his great height prevents him from running very rapidly and as soon as they come up with him they endeavor to entangle him in ropes to throw him down and to put a halter round his neck if they only keep out of the way of his heels there is no need of being afraid of him when they have secured him they lead him off if he will come but if he is an old fellow he will not walk after them and he is too strong to be easily pulled along no matter how many men may be in the hunt so in this case they generally kill him for his skin is valuable and his flesh is very good to eat but if the giraffe is a young one he will follow his captors without difficulty for these animals are naturally very gentle  why the natives of africa should desire to obtain living giraffes unless it is to sell them to people who wish to carry them to other countries travellers do not inform us we have never heard that any domestic use was made of them nor that they were kept for the sake of their meat but we suppose the hunters know their own business  it is probable that the lion is really the greatest enemy of the giraffe it is not often that this crafty and powerful hunter will put himself within reach of his victims heels approaching softly and slowly the lion waits until he is quite near the giraffe and then with one bound he springs upon his back sometimes the giraffe succeeds in shaking him off but generally they both fall togetherthe giraffe dead and the lion with his appetite whetted for an enormous dinner     up in the air  illustration up in a balloon  illustration   we have already taken a journey under the earth and now if you like we will try a trip in the air anything for a novelty we have lived on the surface of the earth ever since we were born  we will make our ascent in a balloon it has been thought by some folks that there were easier methods of ascending into the air than by a cumbrous balloon but their inventions never became popular  for instance look at the picture of a flyingman  this gentleman had an idea that he could fly by the aid of this ingenious machinery you will see that his wings are arranged so that they are moved by his legs and also by cords attached to his arms the umbrella over his head is not intended to ward off the rain or the sun but is to act as a sort of parachute to keep him from falling while he is making his strokes the basket which hangs down low enough to be out of the way of his feet is filled with provisions which he expects to need in the course of his journey  that journey lasted exactly as long as it took him to fall from the top of a high rock to the ground below  but we are not going to trust ourselves to any such haremscarem contrivance as this we are going up in a regular balloon  we all know how balloons are made and this one of ours is like most others it is a great globular bag made of strips of silk sewn together and varnished with a certain composition which renders the balloon airtight the car in which we will travel is made of wickerwork for that is both light and strong and it is suspended from a network of strong cord which covers the whole balloon it would not do you know to attach a cord to any particular part of the silk for that would tear it in the top of the balloon is a valve and a cord from it comes down into the car this valve is to be pulled open when we wish to come down towards the earth the gas then escapes and of course the balloon descends in the car are bags of sand and these are to be emptied out when we think we are too heavy for the balloon and are either coming down too fast or are not as high as we wish to go relieved of the weight of a bag the balloon rises  sand is used because it can be emptied out and will not injure anybody in its descent it would be rather dangerous if ballooning were a common thing for the aëronauts to throw out stones and old iron such as are used for the ballast of a ship if you ever feel a shower of sand coming down upon you through the air look up and you will probably see a balloonthat is if you do not get some of the sand in your eyes  the gas with which our balloon is to be filled is hydrogen gas but i think we will not use the pure hydrogen for it is troublesome and expensive to produce we will get permission of the city gas authorities to take gas from one of their pipes  that will carry us up very well indeed when the balloon is nearly fullwe never fill it entirely for the gas expands when it rises into lighter air and the balloon would explode if we did not leave room for this expansionit is almost as round as a ball and swells out proudly struggling and pulling at the ropes which confine it to the ground  illustration  now we have but to attach the car get in and cut loose but we are going to be very careful on this trip and so we will attach a parachute to the balloon i hope we may not use it but it may save us in case of an accident this is the manner in which the parachute will hang from the bottom of the car  it resembles you see a closed umbrella without a handle and it has cords at the bottom to which a car is attached if we wish to come down by means of this contrivance we must descend from the car of the balloon to that of the parachute and then we must unfasten the rope which attaches us to the balloon we shall then drop like a shot but as soon as the air gets under our parachute it will spread open and our descent will immediately begin to be much more gradual and if nothing unusual occurs to us we shall come gently to the ground this picture shows the manner in which we would come down in a parachute  illustration  this mans balloon has probably burst for we see it is tumbling down and it will no doubt reach the ground before him  when all is ready and we are properly seated in the car with our instruments and extra clothes and ballast and some provisions we will give the word to let her go  there  did you see that  the earth dropped right down and it is dropping but more slowly yet  that is the sensation persons generally experience when they first go up in a balloon not being used to rising in the air they think at first that they are stationary and that the earth and all the people and houses on it are falling below them  now then we are off look down and see how everything gets smaller and smaller and smaller as we pass over a river we can look down to its very bottom and if we were not so high we could see the fishes swimming about the houses soon begin to look like toycottages and the trees like bushes and the creeks and rivers like silvery bands the people now appear as black spots we can just see some of them moving about but if they were to shout very loud we might hear them for sound travels upward to a great distance  illustration moonlight above the clouds  soon everything begins to be mixed up below us we can hardly tell the woods from the fields all seem pretty much alike and now we think it is getting foggy we can see nothing at all beneath us and when we look up and around us we can see nothing but fog  illustration  we are in the clouds yes these are the clouds there is nothing very beautiful about themthey are only masses of vapor but how thick that vapor is now when we look up we cannot even see the balloon above us we are sitting in our little basketwork car and that is all we know we are shut out from the whole world closed up in a cloud  but this foggy atmosphere is becoming thinner and we soon shoot out of it now we can see clearly around us where are the clouds look there they are spread out like a great bed below us  how they glisten and sparkle in the bright sunlight  is not this glorious to ride above the clouds in what seems to us illimitable space the earth is only a few miles below us it is true but up and around us space is illimitable  illustration  but we shall penetrate space no longer in an upward direction it is time we were going back to the world we are all very cold and the eyes and ears of some of us are becoming painful more than that our balloon is getting too large the gas within it is expanding on account of the rarity of the air  we shall pull the rope of the valve  now we are descending we are in the clouds and before we think much about it we are out of them we see the earth beneath us like a great circular plain with the centre a little elevated now we see the rivers the forests begin to define themselves we can distinguish houses and we know that we are falling very rapidly it is time to throw out ballast we do so and we descend more slowly  now we are not much higher than the tops of the trees people are running towards us out with another bag of sand we rise a little now we throw out the anchor it drags along the ground for some distance as the wind carries us over a field and then it catches in a fence and now the people run up and pull us to the ground and the most dangerous part of our expedition is over  illustration  for it is comparatively safe to go up in a balloon but the descent is often very hazardous indeed  on the preceding page is a picture of a balloon which did not come down so pleasantly as ours  with nine persons in it it was driven over the ground by a tremendous wind the anchors were broken the car was bumped against the ground ever so many times and the balloon dashed into trees breaking off their branches it came near running into a railroad train it struck and carried away part of a telegraph line and at last became tangled up in a forest and stopped several of the persons in it had their limbs broken and it is a wonder they were not all killed  the balloon in which we ascended was a very plain commonsense affair but when aerial ascents were first undertaken the balloons were very fancifully decorated  for instance bagnolets balloon and that of le flesselles of which we have given you pictures are much handsomer than anything we have at present but they were not any more serviceable for all their ornamentation and they differed from ours in still another waythey were hotair balloons  other balloons were furnished with all sorts of fans rudders etc for the purpose of steering them or accelerating their motion up or down  on the next page is one of that kind  this balloon ascended from dijon france in 1784 but the steeringapparatus did not prove to be of much use  there were other balloons devised by the early aëronauts which were still stranger than that one which arose from dijon the minerva the picture of which you can examine at your leisure was invented by a mr robertson in the beginning of this century he wished to make a grand aerial voyage of several months with a company of about sixty persons and therefore he had to have a very large balloon to procure this he desired the cooperation of the scientific men throughout europe and sent plans and descriptions of his projected balloon to all the learned societies  illustration  this great ship of the air was to be a regular little town as you may see the balloon was to be one hundred and fifty feet in diameter and was to carry a large ship on which the passengers would be safe if they descended in the water even if it were the middle of the ocean  everything was to be provided for the safety and convenience of the passengers around the upper part of the balloon you will see a platform with sentries and tents these soldiers were to be called the airmarines there is a small balloonabout the common sizewhich could be sent off like a small boat whenever occasion required if any one got tired of the expedition and wanted to go home there was a parachute by which he might descend on the deck of the ship near the stern was to be a little church small houses hung from below reached by ladders of silk which were to be used as medicinerooms gymnasiums etc and under the ship would hang a great hogshead as big as a house which would contain provisions and stores and keep them tight and dry there was also a kitchen and a cannon with which to fire off salutes besides a number of guns which you see projecting from the portholes of the ship these i suppose were to be used against all enemies or pirates of the air sea or land  illustration  illustration  i cannot enumerate all the appendages of this wonderful balloonyou see there are telescopes sails great speakingtrumpets anchors etc but i will merely remark that it was never constructed  one of the safest and sometimes the most profitable methods of using a balloon is that shown in the picture safe ballooning here a battle is going on and the individuals in the balloon safely watching the progress of events and the movements of the enemy transmit their observations to the army with which they are connected of course the men on the ground manage a balloon of this sort and pull it around to any point that they please lowering it by the ropes when the observations are concluded balloons are often used in warfare in this manner  but during the late siege of paris balloons became more useful than they have ever been since their invention a great many aëronauts left the besieged city floated safely over the prussian army and descended in friendly localities some of these balloons were captured but they generally accomplished their purposes and were of great service to the french on one occasion however a balloon from paris was driven by adverse winds to the ocean and its occupants were drowned  it has not been one hundred years since the balloon was invented by the brothers montgolfier of france they used heated air instead of gas and their balloons were of course inferior to those of the present day but we have not improved very much upon the original balloon and what progress will eventually be made in aerial navigation it is difficult to prophesy but there are persons who believe that in time airships will make regular trips in all directions like our present steamboats and railroadtrains  if this is ever the case i hope we may all be living to see it  illustration driven out to sea     the horse of arabia   the arabian horse has long been celebrated as the most valuable of his race he is considered an aristocrat among horses and only those steeds which can trace their descent from arabian ancestors have the right to be called thoroughbred  occasionally an arabian horse is brought to this country but we do not often see them in fact they would not be as valuable here as those horses which besides arabian descent have also other characteristics which especially adapt them to our country and climate  in arabia the horse as an individual especially if he happens to be of the purest breed is more highly prized than in any other part of the world it is almost impossible to buy a favorite horse from an arab and even if he can be induced to sell it the transaction is a very complicated one in the first place all the relations and allies of the owner must give their consent for the parting with a horse to a stranger is a very important matter with them the buyer must then make himself sure that the whole of the horse belongs to the man who is selling him for the arabs when they wish to raise money very often do so by selling to a member of their tribe a foreleg a hindleg or an ear of one of their horses and in this case the person who is a part owner of the animal must have his proportionate share of all profits which may arise from its sale or use this practice is very much like our method of mortgaging our lands  when the horse is finally bought and paid for it had better be taken away as soon as possible for the arabseven those who have no interest whatever in the salecannot endure to see a horse which once belonged to their tribe passing into the hands of strangers and therefore in order to soothe their wounded sensibilities they often steal the animal if they can get a chance before the buyer carries him out of their reach  illustration arabian horse  the arabian horse is generally much more intelligent and docile than those of our country but this is not altogether on account of his good blood the arab makes a friend and companion of his horse the animal so constantly associates with man is talked to so much and treated so kindly that he sometimes shows the most surprising intelligence he will follow his master like a dog come at his call stand anywhere without moving until his master returns to him stop instantly if his rider falls from his back and wait until he mounts again and it has been said that an arabian horse has been known to pick up his wounded master from the field of battle and by fastening his teeth in the mans clothes to carry him to a place of safety  there is no doubt if we were to treat our horses with gentleness and prudence and in a measure make companions of them whenever it was possible that they would come to regard us with much of the affection and obedience which the arabian horse shows to his master     indian puddings pumpkin pies  illustration   some of the good old folks whom i well remember called these things inginpuddins and punkin pies but now we all know what very incorrect expressions those were rut even with such highly improper names these delicacies tasted quiteas well in those days as they do now and if my youthful memory does not mislead me they tasted a little better  there is no stage of the rise and progress of indian puddings and pumpkin pies with which when a youngster i was not familiar in the very beginning of things when the fields were being ploughed we boys were there true we went with no intent to benefit either the corncrop or the pumpkinvines we merely searched in the newly turnedup earth for fishworms but for all that we were there  and when the corn was all planted how zealous we used to be about the crows what benevolent but idiotic old scarecrows we used to construct and how extremely anxious we were to be intrusted with guns that we might disperse at once and forever these black marauders for well we knew that a few dead crows stuck up here and there on stakes would frighten away all the rest of the flock  but we were not allowed the guns and even if we had had them it is probable that the crows would all have died of old age had they depended for an early death upon our powder and shot with their sagacity their long sight and their sentinels posted on the high trees around the field they were not likely to let a boy with a gun approach very near to them i have heardand have no doubt of the truth of the statementthat one of the best ways to shoot crows is to go after them in a wagon keeping your gun of course as much out of sight as possible crows seem to know exactly what guns are intended for but they are seldom afraid of a wagon they expect no danger from it and one can frequently drive along a country road while crows are quietly feeding in the field adjoining quite close to the fence  but if any one goes out to shoot crows in this way he had better be very careful that he has an excessively mild and unimpressible horse for if the horse is frightened at the report of the gun and dashes away and smashes the wagon and breaks his harness and spills everything out of the wagon into the dust mud and bramblebushes and throws the gunner heels over head into a ditch it may be that a dead crow will hardly pay him for his trouble and expense in procuring it  but after a time the corn got so high that it was not afraid of a bird and then we forgot the crows but we liked to watch the corn in all its stages we kept a sharp lookout for the young pumpkinvines and were glad to see the beans which were planted in the hills with the corn in some parts of the field  there is one great advantage in a cornfield which many other fields do not possess you can always walk in it and when the corn is higher than your head and the great long leaves are rustling in the wind and you can hardly see each other a dozen yards away what a glorious thing it is to wander about amidst all this cool greenness and pick out the biggest and the fattest ears for roasting  you have then all the loveliness of nature combined with the hope of a future joy which artthe art of your mother or whoever roasts the cornwill give you  but the triumph of the cornfield is not yet the transformation of its products into indian puddings and pumpkin pies will not occur until the golden autumn days when the sun and the corn and the pumpkins are all yellow alike and goldif it was not so scarcewould be nothing to compare to any of them then come the men with their corncutterspieces of scytheblades with handles fitted to themand down go the cornstalks only one crack apiece and sometimes a big cut will slice off the stalks on a whole hill  how we used to long to wield those corncutters  but our parents thought too much of our legs  when the corn has been cut and carried away the pumpkins are enough to astonish anybody we never had any idea that there were so many  at last when the days were getting short and the mornings were a little cool and the corn was in the cribs and the pumpkins were in the barn and some of us had taken a grist to the mill then were the days of the pudding of indian corn and the pies of pumpkin  then we stayed in the kitchen and saw the whole delightful process from the first mixing of the yellow meal with water and the first cut into the round pumpkins until the swelling pudding and the tranquil pie emerged in hot and savory grandeur from the oven  it is of no use to expect those days to return it is easy enough to get the pies and the puddings but it is very hard to be a boy again     living in smoke  illustration   here is a mosquito of which the bravest man might be afraid but fortunately these insects are not found quite so large as the one in the drawing for he is considerably magnified but when we hear even a very small fellow buzzing around our heads in the darkness of a summer night we are very apt to think that he sounds as if he were at least as big as a bat  in some parts of our country mosquitoes are at certain seasons so plentiful and bloodthirsty that it is impossible to get along comfortably in their company but except in spots where no one would be likely to live whether there were mosquitoes there or not these insects do not exist in sufficient numbers to cause us to give up our ordinary style of living and devote all our energies to keeping them at a distance  in some other countries however the people are not so fortunate in senegal at certain seasons the inhabitants are driven from their habitations by the clouds of mosquitoes which spread over the land and are forced to take refuge on high platforms under which they keep fires continually burning  the smoke from these fires will keep away the mosquitoes but it cannot be very pleasant to the senegalians however they become used to it and during the worst of the mosquito season they eat drink sleep and enjoy themselves to the best of their ability on these platforms which for the time become their houses  illustration a smoky dwelling  it would probably seem to most of us that to breathe an atmosphere constantly filled with smoke and to have it in our eyes and noses all the time would be almost as bad if not quite as suffering the stings of mosquitoes  but then we do not know anything about senegalian mosquitoes and the accounts which dr livingstone and other travellers give of the insects in africa ought to make us feel pretty sure that these woollyheaded folks on the platforms know what is good for them     the cannon of the palais royal  illustration   in the gardens of the palais royal in paris there is a little cannon which stands on a pedestal and is surrounded by a railing every day it is loaded with powder and wadding but no one on earth is allowed to fire it off however far away in the realms of space ninetythree millions of miles from our world there is the great and glorious sun and every day at twelve oclock he fires off that little cannon provided there are no clouds in the way just before noon on bright days the people gather around the railing with their watches in their handsif they are so lucky as to have watchesand precisely at twelve oclock bang she goes  the arrangement which produces this novel artillerypractice is very simple a burningglass is fixed over the cannon in such a manner that when the sun comes to the meridianwhich it does every day at noon you knowits rays are concentrated on the touchhole and of course the powder is ignited and the cannon is fired  most boys understand the power of a burningglass and know how easily dry grass or tinder or a piece of paper may be set on fire by a good glass when the sun is bright but they would find it very difficult to place a glass over a little cannon so that it would infallibly be discharged at any set hour and even if they could do it they would not be sure of their cannonclock being exactly right for the sun does not keep the very best time he varies a little and there is a difference between solar time and true time but the sun is always near enough right for all ordinary intents and purposes  i know boyslazy fellowsand some girls of the same sort for that matterwho if they could would have just outside of their schooldoors one of the largest cannon which should go off every day at the very earliest hour at which school would let out and which should make such a tremendous report that it would be impossible for the teacher to overlook the time and keep them in too long  but if these same boys and girls were putting up a cannon to go off at the hour when school commenced they would get such a little one that it wouldnt frighten a mouse     waters deep and shallow   with such a vast subject before us as the waters of our beautiful world we must be systematic so we will at first confine ourselves to the observation of pleasant waters  illustration  let us begin at the beginning  this pretty little spring with its cool water running day and night into the old barrel and then gurgling over the staves flowing away among the grass and flowers is but a trifling thing perhaps and might be passed with but little notice by people who have always lived in cities but countryfolks know how to value a cool unfailing spring in the hot days of summer the thirsty and tired farmer would rather see that spring than an icecream saloon yes even if he has nothing to drink from but a gourd which may be lying there among the stones he may have a tincup with himand how shocking he may drink out of his hands but let him use what he may he certainly gets a most delicious drink  i once knew a little girl who said she could not bear springwater she did not think it was clean coming out of the ground in that way i asked her if she liked wellwater but she thought that was worse yet especially when it was hauled up in old buckets riverwater she would not even consider for that was too much exposed to all sorts of dirty things to be fit to drink i then wished to know what kind of water she did like and she answered readily enough hydrantwater i dont know where she imagined hydrantwater came from but she may have thought it was manufactured by some clean process out at the waterworks  but let us follow this little stream which trickles from the barrel we cannot walk by its banks all the time for it winds so much and runs through places where the walking is very bad but let us go across the fields and walk a mile or two into the woods and we will meet with it again here it is  what a fine tumbling stream it has grown to be now it is even big enough to have a bridge over it it does not always rush so noisily among the rocks but this is early summer there has been plenty of rain and the brook is full and strong now then if this is a trout country we ought to have our hooks and lines with us among the eddies of this stream we might find many a nice trout and if we were only successful enough to catch some of them after we had found them we would be sure of a reward for our walk even if the beauty of the scene did not repay us  but let us go on this stream does not stop here  after we have walked a mile or so more we find that our noisy friend has quieted down very much indeed it is a little wider and it may be it is a little deeper but it flows along very placidly between its low banks it is doubtful if we should find any trout in it now but there may be catfish and perch and some sunfish and eels  illustration  and now the stream suddenly spreads out widely it is a little lake no it is only a millpond  let us walk around and come out in front of the mill  how the stream has diminished again  illustration  as it comes out of the millrace and joins itself to that portion which flows over the dam it is a considerable creek to be sure but it looks very small compared to the millpond but what it wants in size it makes up in speed like some little morgan horses you may have seen and it goes rushing along quite rapidly again here now is a splendid chance to catch a chub  if we had some little minnows for bait and could stand on the bank there to the left and throw our lines down into the race we ought to be able to hook a chub if there are any there and i think it is very likely that there are a chub if he is a goodsized fellow is a fish worth catching even for people who have been fishing for trout one big chub will make a meal for a small family  but let us follow the creek and see what new developments we shall discover to be sure you may say that following up a stream from its very source involves a great deal of walking but i can answer with certainty that a great deal of walking is a very easy thingin books  so on we go and it is not long before we find that our watery friend has ceased to be a creek and is quite worthy of being called a fine young river but still it is scarcely fit yet for navigation there are rocks in the very middle of the stream and every now and then we come to a waterfall but how beautiful some of those cascades are  what a delightful thing it would be on a warm summer evening to bathe in that deliciously cool water it is deep enough for a good swim and if any of us want a showerbath it would be a splendid thing to sit on the rocks and let the spray from the fall dash over us and there are fish here i am sure it is possible that if we were to sit quietly on the bank and fish we might soon get a string of very nice perch and there is no knowing what else this stream is now just about big enough and little enough to make the character of its fish doubtful i have known pikefellows two feet longcaught in such streams as this and then again in other small rivers very much like it you can catch nothing but catfish roach and eels  if we were to follow up our river we would soon find that it grew larger and larger until rowboats and sloops and then schooners and perhaps large ships sailed upon its surface and at last we might follow it down to its mouth and if it happened to flow into the sea we would probably behold a grand scene some rivers widen so greatly near their mouths that it is difficult to believe that they are rivers at all  illustration  on the next page we see a river which at its junction with the ocean seems almost like a little sea itself  illustration  we can hardly credit the fact that such a great river as the amazon arose from a little spring where you might span the body of the stream with your hand but at its source there is no doubt just such a little spring the great trouble however with these long rivers is to find out where their source really is there are so many brooks and smaller rivers flowing into them that it is difficult to determine the main line you know that we have never settled that matter in regard to the mississippi and missouri there are many who maintain that the source of the mississippi is to be found at the head of the missouri and that the latter is the main river but we shall not try to decide any questions of that sort we are in quest of pleasant waters not difficult questions  illustration falls of gavarni  there is no form which water assumes more grand and beautiful than the cascade or waterfall and these are of very varied shapes and sizes some of the most beautiful waterfalls depend for their celebrity not upon their height but upon their graceful forms and the scenery by which they are surrounded while others like the cascade of gavarni are renowned principally for their great height  there we see a comparatively narrow stream precipitating itself down the side of an enormous precipice in the pyrenees although it appears so small to us it is really a considerable stream and as it strikes upon the jutting rocks and dashes off into showers of spray it is truly a beautiful sight  there are other cascades which are noted for a vast volume of water some of these are well known but there is one perhaps of which you have never heard  when dr livingstone was travelling in africa he was asked by some of the natives if in his country there was any smoke which sounds they assured him that such a thing existed in their neighborhood although some of them did not seem to comprehend the nature of it the doctor soon understood that their remarks referred to a waterfall and so he took a journey to it when he came within five or six miles of the cataract he saw five columns of smoke arising in the air but when he reached the place he found that this was not smoke but the vapor from a great fall in the river zambesi  these falls are very peculiar because they plunge into a great abyss not more than eighty feet wide and over three hundred feet deep then the river turns and flows for many miles at the bottom of this vast crack in the earth dr livingstone thinks these falls are one of the wonders of the world  there is no doubt however about the king of cataracts that is niagara if you have seen it you can understand its grandeur but you can never appreciate it from a written description a picture will give you some idea of it but not a perfect one by any means  illustration falls of zambesi  the indians called these falls thundering water and it was an admirable title the waters thunder over the great precipice as they have done for thousands of years before we were born and will continue to do thousands of years after we are dead  the falls of niagara are divided by an island into two portions called the canadian and the american falls this island lies nearer to the united states shore than to that of canada therefore the american falls are the smallest this island is named goat island and you have a good view of it in the picture  illustration  it seems as if the resistless torrent would some day tear away this lonely promontory as it rushes upon and around it it is not unlikely that in the course of ages the island may be carried away  even now portions of it are occasionally torn off by the rush of the waters  you can cross over to goat island by means of a bridge and when there you can go down under the falls standing in what is called the cave of the winds you can look out at a thick curtain of water from eighteen to thirty feet thick pouring down from the rocks above this curtain dark and glittering is a portion of the great falls  it is necessary to spend days at niagara before its grandeur can be fully appreciated but we must pass on to other waters and not tarry at this glorious cataract until we are carried away by our subject  we will now look at for a short time what may be called profitable waters the waters of the earth are profitable in so many ways that it would be impossible for us to consider them all but we will simply glance at a few scenes where we can easily perceive what advantages man derives from the waters deep or shallow in our own country there is no more common method of making a living out of the water than by fishing with a net  the men in the picture when they have hauled their seine to shore will probably find as good a reward for their labor as if they had been working on the land instead of in the river and if it is shad for which they are fishing their profits will probably be greater  you know that our shad fisheries are very important sources of income to a great many people and the oyster fisheries are still more valuable  when we mention the subject of making a living out of the water we naturally think first of nets and hooks and lines it is true that mills and steamships and packetlines and manufactories are far more important but they require capital as well as water men fish all over the world but on some waters vessels or sawmills are never seen  illustration  the styles of fishing however are very various here is a company of africans fishing with javelins or spears  they build a sort of platform or pier out into the river and on this they stand with their spears in their hands and when a fish is seen swimming in the water down comes the sharppointed javelin which seldom misses him then he is drawn upon the platform by means of the cord which is fastened to the spear a whole family will go out fishing in this way and spend the day on the platform some will spear the fish while others will clean them and prepare them for use one advantage that this party possesses is that if any of them should tumble into the water they would not get their clothes wet  illustration  but sometimes it will not do for the fisherman to endeavor to draw up the treasures of the deep while he remains at the surface of the water very often he must go down after them in this way a great many of the most valuable fisheries are conducted for instance the spongefishers are obliged to dive down to the very bottom of the water and tear off the sponges from the rocks to which they fasten themselves some of the most valuable spongefisheries are on the coast of syria and you may here see how they carry on their operations  illustration  this is a very difficult and distressing business to the divers they have to remain under the water as long as they can possibly hold their breath and very often they are seriously injured by their exertions in this way but when we use the sponges we never think of this and if we did what good would it do all over the world men are to be found who are perfectly willing to injure their health provided they are paid for it  the pearlfisheries are quite as disastrous in their effects upon the divers as those of which we have just been speaking  the pearldiver descends by the help of a long rope to the end of which is attached a heavy stone he stands on the stone holds the rope with one hand and his nose with the other and quickly sinks to the bottom then he goes to work as fast as he can to fill a net which hangs from his neck with the pearloysters when he can stay down no longer the net and stone are drawn up by the cord and he rises to the surface often with blood running from his nose and ears but then those who employ them sometimes get an oyster with as fine pearls as this one contains  illustration  it is perfectly possible however to dive to the bottom of the sea with very valuable results without undergoing all this terrible injury and suffering in this country and europe there are men who clad in what is called submarine armor will go to the bottom of a river or bay or the seawhere it is not very deepand there walk about almost as comfortably as if they were on land air is supplied to them by long pipes which reach to the surface and these divers have been made very useful in discovering and removing wrecks recovering sunken treasure and in many other ways  illustration  for instance you have a picture of some divers at the bottom of the port of marseilles a box of gold had fallen from a steamship and the next day these two men went down after it they found it and it was hauled safely to the surface by means of the ropes which they attached to it  you see how strangely they are dressed an iron helmet like a great iron pot is over each of their heads and a reservoir into which the air is pumped is on their backs they can see through little windows in their masks or helmets and all they have to do is to walk about and attend to their business for men above supply them with a sufficiency of air for all breathing purposes by means of an airpump and a long flexible tube  we have not even alluded to many profitable waters we have said nothing about those vast seas where the great whale is found or of the waters where men catch the valuable little sardine  we have not mentioned corals nor said anything about those codfisheries which are considered of sufficient importance sometimes to go to war about but these with many other subjects of the kind we must leave unnoticed while we cast our eyes upon some dangerous waters  we all know that almost any water if it be a few feet deep is dangerous at certain times and under certain conditions  the creek which in its deepest parts is not up to your chin may be the death of you if you venture upon it in winter when the ice is thin and you break through without help you may be able neither to swim out or climb out  but oceans and seas are the waters where danger may nearly always be expected the sea may be as smooth as glass the skies bright and not a breath of wind be stirring or a gentle breeze just enough to ripple the water may send our vessel slowly before it and in a few hours the winds may be roaring the waves dashing into the air and the skies dark with stormclouds  if we are upon a large and strong steamer we may perhaps feel safe enough among the raging waves but if our vessel be a fishingboat or a small pleasurecraft we have good reason to be afraid yet many a little sloop like this rides bravely and safely through the storms but many other little vessels as strong and as well steered go to the bottom of the ocean every year if the sailor escapes severe storms or sails in a vessel which is so stout and ably managed as to bid defiance to the angry waves he has other dangers in his path he may for instance meet with icebergs if the weather is clear and the wind favorable he need not fear these floating mountains of ice but if it be night or foggy and he cannot see them or if in spite of all his endeavors the wind drives him down upon them then is his vessel lost and in all probability the lives of all upon it sometimes however the passengers and crew may escape in boats and instances have been related where they have taken refuge on the iceberg itself remaining there until rescued by a passing ship  illustration  but be the weather fair or foul a ship is generally quick to leave the company of so dangerous a neighbor as an iceberg sometimes great masses of ice take a notion to topple over and looking at the matter in what light you please i think that they are not to be trusted  then there is the hurricane  a large ship may bravely dare the dangers of an ordinary storm but nothing that floats on the surface of the water can be safe when a whirlwind passes over the sea driving everything straight before it great ships are tossed about like playthings and strong masts are snapped off as if they had been made of glass  illustration  if a ship is then near a coast her crew is seldom able if the wind blows towards the land to prevent her from being dashed upon the rocks and if she is out upon the open sea she is often utterly disabled and swallowed up by the waves  i have known boys who thought that it would be perfectly delightful to be shipwrecked they felt certain that they would be cast very gently no doubt upon a desert island and there they would find everything that they needed to support life and make them comfortable and what they did not get there they would obtain from the wreck of the ship which would be lying on the rocks at a convenient distance from the shore and once on that island they would be their own masters and would not have to go to school or do anything which did not please them  illustration  this is the good old robinson crusoe idea which at one time or another runs in the mind of nearly every boy and many girls too i expect but a real shipwreck is never desired the second time by any person who has experienced one  sometimes even when the crew think that they have safely battled through the storm and have anchored in a secure place the waves dash upon the vessel with such force that the anchor drags the masts go by the board and the great ship with the hundreds of pale faces that crowd her deck is dashed on the great rocks which loom up in the distance  illustration  among other dangers of the ocean are those great tidal waves which often follow or accompany earthquakes and which are almost as disastrous to those living upon the seacoast as to those in ships towns have been nearly destroyed by them hundreds of people drowned and great ships swept upon the land and left there high and dry in tropical latitudes these tremendous upheavals of the ocean appear to be most common but they are known in all regions which are subject to serious shocks of earthquakes  illustration  waterspouts are other terrible enemies of the sailor these however dangerous they may be when they approach a ship are not very common and it is said that they may sometimes be entirely dispersed by firing a cannonball into the midst of the column of water this statement is rather doubtful for many instances have been related where the ball went directly through the waterspout without any effect except to scatter the spray in every direction i have no doubt that sailors always keep as far away from waterspouts as they can and place very little reliance on their artillery for their safety  and now have you had enough water  we have seen how the waters of the earth may be enjoyed how they may be made profitable to us and when we should beware of them  illustration  but before we leave them i wish to show you at the very end of this article something which is a little curious in its appearance let us take a step down to the very bottom of the sea not in those comparatively shallow places where the divers descend to look for wrecks and treasure but in deep water miles below the surface down there on the very bottom you will see this strange thing what do you suppose it is  it is not an animal or a fish or a stone or shell but plants are growing upon it while little animals and fishes are sticking fast to it or swimming around it it is not very thickscarcely an inchand we do not see much of it here but it stretches thousands of miles it reaches from america to europe and it is an atlantic cable there is nothing in the water more wonderful than that     hans the herbgatherer  illustration   many years ago when people had not quite so much sense as they have now there was a poor widow woman who was sick i do not know what was the matter with her but she had been confined to her bed for a long time  she had no doctor for in those days many of the poor people besides having but little money had little faith in a regular physician they would rather depend upon wonderful herbs and simples which were reported to have a sort of magical power and they often used to resort to charms and secret incantations when they wished to be cured of disease  this widow whose name was dame martha was a sensible woman in the main but she knew very little about sickness and believed that she ought to do pretty much as her neighbors told her and so she followed their advice and got no better  there was an old man in the neighborhood named hans who made it a regular business to gather herbs and roots for moral and medical purposes he was very particular as to time and place when he went out to collect his remedies and some things he would not touch unless he found them growing in the corner of a churchyardor perhaps under a gallowsand other plants he never gathered unless the moon was in its first quarter and there was a yellow streak in the northwest about a halfhour after sunset he had some herbs which he said were good for chills and fever others which made children obedient others which caused an old mans gray hair to turn black and his teeth to grow againif he only took it long enough and he had besides remedies which would cure chickens that had the pip horses that kicked old women with the rheumatism dogs that howled at the moon boys who played truant and cats that stole milk  now to our enlightened minds it is very evident that this hans was nothing more than an old simpleton but it is very doubtful if he thought so himself and it is certain that his neighbors did not they resorted to him on all occasions when things went wrong with them whether it was the butter that would not come in their churns or their little babies who had fevers  therefore you may be sure that dame martha sent for hans as soon as she was taken ill and for about a year or so she had been using his herbs making plasters of his roots putting little shells that he brought under her pillow and powwowing three times a day over bunches of dried weeds ornamented with feathers from the tails of yellow hens that had died of old age but all that hans could do for her was of no manner of use in vain he went out at night with his lantern and gathered leaves and roots in the most particular way whether the moon was full or on the wane whether the tail of the great dipper was above the steeple of the old church or whether it had not yet risen as high as the roof whether the bats flew to the east or the west when he first saw them or whether the jack olanterns sailed near the ground when they were carried by a little jack or whether they were high when a tall jack bore them it made no difference his herbs were powerless and dame martha did not get well  about half a mile from the widows cottage there lived a young girl named patsey moore she was the daughter of the village squire and a prettier girl or a better one than patsey is not often met with when she heard of dame marthas illness she sometimes used to stop at the cottage on her way to school and leave with her some nice little thing that a sick person might like to eat  one day in spring when the fields were full of blossoms and the air full of sunshine and delicious odors patsey stopped on her way from school to gather a bunch of wildflowers  they grew so thickly and there were so many different kinds that she soon had a bouquet that was quite fit for a parlor on her way home she stopped at dame marthas cottage  i am sorry dame martha said she that i have nothing nice for you today but i thought perhaps you would like to have some flowers as its springtime and you cant go out  illustration  indeed miss patsey said the sick woman you couldnt have brought me anything that would do my heart more good its like hearing the birds sing and sittin under the hedges in the blossoms to hear you talk and to see them flowers  patsey was very much pleased of course at this and after that she brought dame martha a bouquet every day  and soon the good woman looked for patsey and her beautiful flowers as longingly and eagerly as she looked for the rising of the sun  old hans very seldom came to see her now and she took no more of his medicines it was of no use and she had paid him every penny that she had to spare besides a great many other things in the way of little odds and ends that lay about the house but when patsey stopped in one afternoon a month or two after she had brought the first bunch of flowers she said to the widow  dame martha i believe you are a great deal better  better said the good woman ill tell you what it is miss patsey ive been a thinking over the matter a deal for the last week and ive been atrying my appetite and atrying my eyes and atrying how i could walk about and work and sew and i just tell you what it is miss patsey im well  and so it was the widow was well and nobody could see any reason for it except good dame martha herself she always persisted that it was those beautiful bunches of flowers that patsey had brought her every day  oh miss patsey she said if youd been acoming to me with them violets and buttercups instead of old hans with his nasty bitter yarbs id a been off that bed many a day ago there was nothing but darkness and the shadows of tombstones and the damp smells of the lonely bogs about his roots and his leaves but there was the heavenly sunshine in your flowers miss patsey and i could smell the sweet fields when i looked at them and hear the hum of the bees  it may be that dame martha gave a little too much credit to patseys flowers but i am not at all sure about it certain it is that the daily visits of a bright young girl with her heart full of kindness and sympathy and her hands full of flowers from the fragrant fields would be far more welcome and of far more advantage to many sick chambers than all the old herbgatherers in the world with their bitter graveyard roots and their rank evilsmelling plants that grow down in the swamps among the frogs and snakes  perhaps you know some sick person try patseys treatment     some cunning insects  illustration   we hear such wonderful stories about the sense and ingenuity displayed by insects that we are almost led to the belief that some of them must have a little reasonat least as much as a few men and women that we know  of all these wise insects there is none with more intelligence and cunning than the ant how many astonishing accounts have we had of these little creatures who in some countries build great houses almost large enough for a man to live in who have a regular form of government and classes of societysoldiers workers gentlemen and ladies and who as some naturalists have declared even have handsome funerals on the occasion of the death of a queen it is certain that they build and work and pursue their various occupations according to systems that are wisely conceived and most carefully carried out  illustration  dr ebrard who wrote a book about ants and their habits tells a story of a little black ant who was building an arch at the foundation of a new anthill it was necessary to have some means of supporting this arch which was made of wet mud until the keystone should be put in and all made secure the ant might have put up a couple of props but this is not their habit in building their laws say nothing about props but the arch must be supported and so mr ant thought that it would be a good idea to bend down a tall stalk of wheat which grew near the hill and make it support the arch until it was finished this he did by carrying bits of wet mud up to the end of the stalk until he had piled and stuck so much upon it that the heavy top bent over but as this was not yet low enough and more mud could not be put on the slender stem without danger of breaking it the ant crammed mud in between the stalk at its root and the other stalks so that it was forced over still more then he used the lowered end to support his arch  illustration  some other ants once found a cockchafers wing which they thought would be a capital thing to dry for winter and they endeavored to get it into the entrance of their hill but it was too big so they drew it out and made the hole larger then they tried again but the wing was still too wide they turned it and made several efforts to get it in sideways and upside down but it was impossible so they lifted it away and again enlarged the hole but the wing would not yet go in without losing patience they once more went to work and after having labored for three hours and a half they at last had the pleasure of seeing their dried wing safely pulled into their storeroom  illustration  then there are spiders they frequently show the greatest skill and cunning in the construction of their webs and the capture of their prey and naturalists say that the spider has a very well developed brain they must certainly have a geometrical talent or they could not arrange their webs with such regularity and scientific accuracy some spiders will throw their webs across streams that are quite wide  now to do this they must show themselves to be engineers of no small ability sometimes they fasten one end of a thread to a twig on one side of the stream and hanging on the other end swing over until they can land on the other side but this is not always possible for they cannot in some places get a chance for a fair swing in such a case they often wait until the wind is blowing across the stream from the side on which they are and weaving a long line they let it out until the wind carries it over the stream and it catches in the bushes or grass on the other side of course after one thread is over the spider can easily run backward and forward on it and carry over all the rest of his lines  illustration  bees have so much sense that we ought almost to beg their pardon when we speak of their instinct most of us have read what huber and others have told us of their plans inventions laws and regular habits it is astonishing to read of a beesupervisor going the round of the cells where the larvæ are lying to see if each of them has enough food he never stops until he has finished his review and then he makes another circuit depositing in each cell just enough fooda little in this one a great deal in the next and so on  there were once some bees who were very much disturbed by a number of great moths who made a practice of coming into their hives and stealing their honey do what they could the bees could not drive these strong creatures out  but they soon hit upon a plan to save their honey they blocked up all the doors of the hive with wax leaving only a little hole just big enough for one bee to enter at a time then the moths were completely dumbfounded and gave up the honey business in despair  but the insect to which the epithet of cunning may be best ascribed is i think the flea if you doubt this try to catch one what double backsprings he will turn what fancy dodges he will execute and how at last you will have to give up the game and acknowledge yourself beaten by this little gymnast  illustration  but fleas have been taught to perform their tricks of strength and activity in an orderly and highly proper manner they have been trained to go through military exercises carrying little sticks for guns to work and pull about small cannon although the accounts say nothing about their firing them off and what seems the most wonderful of all two fleas have been harnessed to a little coach while another one sat on the box and drove the whole of this wonderful exhibition was so small that a microscope had to be used in order to properly observe it  the last instance of the intelligence of insects which i will give is something almost too wonderful to believe and yet the statement is made by a dr lincecum who studied the habits of the insect in question for twelve years and his investigations were published in the journal of the linnæan society dr lincecum says that in texas there is an ant called by him the agricultural ant which not only lays up stores of grain but prepares the soil for the crop plants the seed of a certain plant called antrice keeps the ground free from weeds and finally reaps the harvest and separating the chaff from the grain packs away the latter and throws the chaff outside of the plantation in woods bible animals you can read a full account of this ant and i think that after hearing of its exploits we can believe almost anything that we hear about the intelligence of insects     a first sight of the sea  illustration   if you have ever seen the ocean you will understand what a grand thing it is to look for the first time upon its mighty waters stretching away into the distance and losing themselves in the clouds and sky we know it is thousands of miles over to the other shore but for all that we have a pretty good idea of that shore we know its name and have read about the people who live there  but when in the beginning of the sixteenth century vasco nuñez de balboa stood upon the shore of the pacific and gazed over its boundless waters the sight to him was both grand and mysterious he saw that a vast sea lay beneath and before himbut that was all he knew europeans had not visited it before and the indians who had acted as his guides knew but little about it if he had desired to sail across those vast blue waters balboa would have had no idea upon what shores he would land or what wonderful countries and continents he would discover  nowadays any schoolboy could tell that proud brave soldier what lay beyond those billows supposing little johnny green we all know him dont we had been there how quickly he would have settled matters for the spanish chieftain  ah mr balboa johnny would have said you want to know what lies off in that directionstraight across well i can tell you sir if you are standing as i think you are on a point of the isthmus of darien where you can look directly westward you may cast your eyes as far as they will go over a body of water which at this point is about eleven thousand miles wide no wonder you jump sir but such is the fact if you were to sail directly west upon this ocean you would have a very long passage before you came upon any land at all and the first place which you would reach if you kept straight on your westward course would be the mulgrave islands but you would have passed about seven or eight hundred miles to the southward of the sandwich islands which are a very important group where there is an enormous volcano and where captain cook will be killed in about two hundred and fifty years if you then keep on you will pass among the caroline islands which your countrymen will claim some day and if you are not eaten up by the natives who will no doubt coax you to land on some of their islands and will then have you for supper you will at last reach the philippine islands and will probably land for a time at mindanao to get water and things then if you still keep on you will pass to the north of a big island which is borneo and will sail right up to the first land to the west which will be part of a continent or else you will go down around a peninsula which lies directly in your course and sail upon the other side of it into a great gulf and land anywhere you please do you know where you will be then mr balboa dont eh well sir you would be just where columbus hoped he would be when he reached the end of his great voyage across the atlanticin the indies yes sir all among the gold and ivory and spices and elephants and other things  if you can get any ships here and will start off and steer carefully among the islands you wont find anything in your way until you get there but it was different with columbus you see sir he had a whole continent blocking up his road to the indies but for my part im very glad for various reasons that it happened so  illustration  it is probable that if johnny green could have delivered this little speech that vasco nuñez de balboa would have been one of the most astonished men in the world  whether he and his fellowadventurers would ever have set out to sail over those blue waters in search of the treasures of the east is more than i can say but it is certain that if he had started off on such an expedition he would have found things pretty much as johnny green had told him     the largest church in the world  illustration   this is st peters at rome is it possible to look upon such a magnificent edifice without acknowledging it as the grandest of all churches there are some others in the world more beautiful and some more architecturally perfect but there is none so vast so impressive so grand  this great building was commenced in 1506 but it was a century and a half before it was finished among other great architects michael angelo assisted in its construction the building is estimated to have cost simply for its erection about fifty millions of dollars and it has cost a great deal in addition in later years  its dimensions are enormous you cannot understand what a great building it is unless you could see it side by side with some house or church with which you are familiar several of the largest churches in this country could be stood up inside of st peters without touching walls or roof or crowding each other in the least  illustration  there are but three works of man in the whole world which are higher than the little knob which you see on the cupola surmounting the great dome of st peters these more lofty buildings are the great pyramid of egypt the spire of strasbourg and the tower of amiens the highest of these the pyramid is however only fortytwo feet above st peters the great dome is supported by four pillars each of which is seventy feet thick  but let us step inside of this great edifice i think you will be there even more impressed with its height and extent than you were when you stood on the outside  is not here a vast and lofty expanse but even from this favorable point you cannot get a complete view of the interior in front of you you see in the distance the light striking down from above there is the great dome and when you walk beneath it you will be amazed at its enormous height there are four great halls like this one directly before us for the church is built in the form of a cross with the dome at the intersection of the arms there are also openings in various directions which lead into what are called chapels but which are in reality as large as ordinary sized churches  the pavement of the whole edifice is made of colored marble and as you see the interior is heavily decorated with carving and statuary much of this is bronze and gold  but if you should mount and there are stairs by which you may make the ascent into the cupola at the top of the dome and look down into the vast church and see the people crawling about like little insects so far below you you would perhaps understand better than at any other time that it is not at all surprising that this church should be one of the wonders of the world  if we ever go to europe we must not fail to see st peters church at rome     the soft place   there was once a young jaguar he was very intimately related to the panther family as you may remember and he sat upon a bit of hard rock and cogitated the subject of his reflections was very simple indeed for it was nothing more nor less than thiswhere should he get his supper  he would not have cared so much for his supper if it had been that he had had no dinner and even this would not have made so much difference if he had had his breakfast but in truth he had eaten nothing all day  during the summer of that year the meatmarkets in that section of the country were remarkably bad it was sometimes difficult for a panther or a wildcat to find enough food to keep her family at all decently and there were cases of great destitution in years before there had been plenty of deer wild turkey raccoons and all sorts of good things but they were very scarce now this was not the first time that our young jaguar had gone hungry for a whole day  while he thus sat wondering where he should go to get something to eat he fell asleep and had a dream and this is what he dreamed  he dreamed that he saw on the grass beneath the rock where he was lying five fat young deer three of them were sisters and the other two were cousins they were discussing the propriety of taking a nap on the grass by the riverbank and one of them had already stretched herself out now thought the jaguar in his dream shall i wait until they all go to sleep and then pounce down softly and kill them all or shall i spring on that one on the ground and make sure of a good supper at any rate while he was thus deliberating in his mind which it would be best for him to do the oldest cousin cocked up her ears as if she heard something and just as the jaguar was going to make a big spring and get one out of the family before they took to their heels he woke up  illustration  what a dreadful disappointment not a deer or a sign of one to be seen and nothing living within a mile but no there is something moving it isyes it is a big alligator lying down there on the rocks after looking for a few minutes with disgust at the ugly creature the jaguar said to himself he must have come on shore while i was asleep but what matters it an alligator very different indeed from five fat young deer ah me i wish he had not that great horny skin and id see if i could make a supper off of him let me see there is a soft place as ive been told about the alligator if i could but manage and get a grip of that i think that i could settle old mr hardskin in spite of his long teeth ive a mind and a half to try yes ill do it  illustration  so saying the jaguar settled himself down as flat as he could and crept a little nearer to the alligator and then with a tremendous spring he threw himself upon him the alligator was asleep but his nap came to a very sudden close you may be sure and he opened his eyes and his mouth both at the same time but he soon found that he would have to bestir himself in a very lively manner for a strong and hungry jaguar had got hold of him it had never before entered into the alligators head that anybody would want to eat him but he did not stop to think about this but immediately went to work to defend himself with all his might he lashed his great tail around he snapped his mighty jaws at his enemy and he made the dust fly generally but it all seemed of little use the jaguar had fixed his teeth in a certain soft place in his chest under his foreleg and there he hung on like grim death the alligator could not get at him with his tail nor could he turn his head around so as to get a good bite  the alligator had been in a hard case all his life but he really thought that this surprising conduct of the jaguar was something worse than anything he had ever been called upon to bear  does he really think i wonder said the alligator to himself that he is going to have me for his supper  it certainly looked very much as if mr jaguar had that idea and as if he would be able to carry out his intention for he was so charmed at having discovered the soft place of which he had so often been told that he resolved never to let go until his victim was dead and in the midst of the struggle he could not but regret that he had never thought of hunting alligators before  as it may well be imagined the alligator soon began to be very tired of this sort of thing he could do nothing at all to damage his antagonist and the jaguar hurt him keeping his teeth jammed into the very tenderest spot in his whole body so he came to the conclusion that if he could do nothing else he would go home if the jaguar chose to follow him he could not help it of course so gradually he pulled himself jaguar and all down to the river and as the banks sloped quite suddenly at this place he soon plunged into deep water with his bloodthirsty enemy still hanging fiercely to him  as soon as he found himself in the water the alligator rolled himself over and got on top then they both sank down and there was nothing seen on the surface of the water but bubbles  the fight did not last very long after this but the jaguar succeeded perfectly in his intentions he found a soft placein the mud at the bottom of the riverand he stayed there     a few feathered friends  illustration a few feathered friends   whether dressed in broadcloth silk calico homespun or feathers friends are such valuable possessions that we must pay these folks who are now announced as much attention as possible and if we do this and in every way endeavor to make them feel comfortable and entirely at home we will soon perceive a very great difference between them and many of our friends who dress in coats and frocks for the more we do for our feathered friends the more they will do for us now you cant say that of all the men and women and boys and girls that you know i wish most sincerely that you could  the first family who calls upon us and the head of this family makes the very earliest calls that i know anything about are too well known to all of us to need the slightest introduction you will see in an instant that you have met them before  and there is no doubt but that these are among the very best feathered friends we have those hens are liberal with their eggs and those little chickens that are running around like twolegged puffballs are so willing to grow up and be broiled and roasted and stewed that it would now be almost impossible for us to do without them eggs seem to come into use on so many occasions that if there was to be an eggfamine it would make itself felt in every family in the land not only would we miss them when boiled fried and cooked in omelets for breakfast not only without them would ham seem lonely puddings and spongecakes go into decline and poundcake utterly die but the arts and manufactures of the whole country would feel the deprivation merely in the photographic business hundreds of thousands of eggs are needed every year from which to procure the albumen used in the preparation of photographic paper  illustration  do without eggs impossible  and to do without chicken for dinner would seem almost as impossible for some folks to be sure we might live along very comfortably without those delightful broils and roasts and fricassees but it would be a great pity and if we live in the country there is no meat which is so cheap and easily procured all the year round as chicken i wonder what countrypeople would do especially in the summer time when they have little other fresh meat without their chickens very badly i imagine  next to these good old friends comes the pigeon family these are very intimate with many of us  illustration  pigeons are in one respect even more closely associated with man than the domestic fowls because they live with him as readily in cities as in the country city chickens always seem out of place but city pigeons are as much at home as anybody else there are few houses so small that there is not room somewhere for a pigeonbox and there are no roofs or yards so humble that the handsomest and proudest pouters and tumblers and fantails will not willingly come and strut and coo about them as long as they receive good treatment and plenty of food  but apart from the pleasure and profit which these beautiful birds ordinarily afford to their owners some of themthe carriersare often of the greatest value and perform important business that would have to be left undone if it were not for them the late war in france has fully proved this i remember hearing persons say that now since telegraph lines had become so common they supposed carrierpigeons would no longer be held in esteem and that the breed would be suffered to die out  illustration  but that is a mistake there are times especially during wars when telegraphic and railroad lines are utterly useless and then the carrierpigeon remains master of the situation  the doves are such near relations of the pigeons that we might suppose they would resemble them in their character as much as in appearance but they are not very much alike doves are not ambitious they dont pout or tumble or have fantails as to carrying messages or doing anything to give themselves renown they never think of it they are content to be affectionate and happy  and that is a great deal if they did nothing all their lives but set examples to children and to their parents also sometimes the doves would be among our most useful little birds  illustration  i suppose we all have some friends whom we are always glad to see even if they are of no particular service to us and this is right we should not value peoples society in exact proportion to what we think we can get out of them now the swan is a feathered friend and a good one but i must say he is of very little practical use to us but there is something more to be desired than victuals clothes featherbeds and eastereggs we should love the beautiful as well as the useful not so much to be sure but still very much the boy or man who despises a rose because it is not a cabbage is much more nearly related to the cows and hogs than he imagines if we accustom ourselves to look for beauty and enjoy it we will find it after awhile where we never supposed it existedin the caterpillar for instance and in the snakes there is beauty as well as practical value in almost everything around us and we are not the lords of creation that we suppose we are unless we are able to see it  now then i have preached you a little sermon with the swans for a text but they are certainly beautiful subjects  a goose when it is swimming is a very handsome bird and it is most admirable when it appears on the table roasted of a delightful brown with a dish of applesauce to keep it company but for some reason the goose has never been treated with proper consideration it has for hundreds of years i expect been considered as a silly bird but there never was a greater mistake if we looked at the thing in the proper light we would not be at all ashamed to be called a goose if any one were to call you an ostrich i dont believe you would be very angry but in reality it would be much more of an insult than to call you a goose for an ostrich at times is a very silly bird  but geese have been known to do as many sensible things as any feathered creatures of which we know anything i am not going to say anything about the geese which saved rome for we have no record that they intended to do anything of the kind but i will instance the case of a goose which belonged to an old blind woman who lived in germany  every sunday these two friends used to go to church together the goose carefully leading the old woman by her frock  when they reached the church the goose would lead his mistress to her seat and then go outside and eat grass until the services were over when the people began to come out the goose would go in and taking the old woman in charge would lead her home at other times also he was the companion of her walks and her family knew that old blind grandmother was all right if she had the goose with her when she went out  illustration  there was another goose in a town in scotland who had a great attachment for a young gentleman to whom she belonged she would follow him in his walks about the town and always testified her delight when she saw him start for a ramble  when he went into a barbers shop to be shaved she would wait on the pavement until he came out and in many of his visits she accompanied him very decorously remaining outside while her master was enjoying the society of his friends  illustration  ducks too have been known to exhibit sociable and friendly traits there is a story told of a drake who once came into a room where a young lady was sitting and approaching her caught hold of her dress with his bill and commenced to pull vigorously at it the lady was very much surprised at this performance and tried to drive the drake away but he would neither depart or stop tugging at her dress and she soon perceived that he wanted her to do something for him so she rose from her chair and the drake immediately began to lead her towards the door when he had conducted her out on to the lawn he led her to a little lake near the house and there she saw what it was that troubled mr drake a duck very probably his wife had been swimming in the lake and in poking her head about she had caught her neck in the narrow opening of a sluicegate and there she was fast and tight the lady lifted the gate mrs duck drew out her head and went quacking away while mr drake testified his delight and gratitude by flapping his wings and quacking at the top of his voice  illustration  we have also friends among the feathered tribes who are not quite so intimate and sociable as those to which we have already alluded but which still are very well deserving of our friendship and esteem for instance what charming little companions are the canarybirds to be sure they would not often stay with us if we did not confine them in cages but they seem perfectly at home in their little wire houses and sing and twitter with as much glee as if they were flying about in the woods of their native landor rather of the native land of their forefathers for most of our canarybirds were born in the midst of civilization and in cages  illustration  there are some birds however no bigger than canaries which seem to have an attachment for their masters and mistresses and which do not need the restraint of a cage there was once a goldfinch which belonged to a gentleman who lived in a town in picardy france but who was often obliged to go to paris where he also had apartments whenever he was obliged to go to the great city his goldfinch would fly on ahead of him and arriving there some time in advance of the carriage the servants would know that their master was coming in time to have the rooms ready for him and when the gentleman drove up to the door he would generally see his little goldfinch sitting on the finger of a cook or a chambermaid and twittering away as if he was endeavoring to inform the good people of all the incidents of the journey  some of these little birds however which are very friendly and comparatively sociable as long as they are not troubled and annoyed are not only able to distinguish their friends from their foes but are very apt to stand up vigorously in defence of their rights those little sparrows which hop about so cunningly in the streets of many of our cities understand very well that no one will hurt them and that they may pick up crumbs wherever they can find them but let a few boys get into the habit of throwing sticks and stones at them and the little things will leave that neighborhood as quickly as if the rents of all their tiny houses had been raised beyond their means  illustration  magpies too are very companionable in their own way if they are well treated but if a boy should undertake to steal away with one of their nests when it was full of young ones he would run a very great risk of having his eyes picked out  there is a feathered friend of ours who keeps himself so secluded at least during the daytime that he is very apt to escape our notice i refer to the owl  it may not be supposed by some that the owl is a friend of mankind and i am perfectly willing to admit that very often he acts very much like an enemy especially when he kills our young chickens and turkeys but for all that he has his good points and very often behaves in a commendable manner if you have a barn or a house that is overrun with mice there is nothing that will be more certain to drive them out than an owl and he will not be so apt to steal your milk or kill your canary as many of the cats which you have taken into your family without a recommendation  illustration  we once had an owl living in our house he belonged to my young brother who caught him in a trap i believe all day long this solemn little fellow for he was a small brown one would sit on the back of a chair or some such convenient place and if any of us came near him he would turn his head and look at us although he could not see very well in the daytime and if we walked behind him or on different sides of him he would always keep his eyes on us turning his head around exactly as if it was set on a pivot  it was astonishing how easily he could turn his head without moving his body some folks told us that if we walked around and around him he would turn and turn his head until he twisted it off but we never tried that  it was really astonishing how soon the mice found out that there was an owl in the house he had the range of a great part of the house all night and in a very short time he had driven every mouse away and the first time he found a window open he went away himself there is that objection to owls as mousers they are very good so long as they will hold the situation but they are exceedingly apt to leave without giving the family any notice you wont find a cat doing that the trouble with her very often is that she will not go when you give her notice to leave  when we speak of our feathered friends it is hardly fair to exclude all but those which are domesticated with us or which are willing sometimes to come and live in our houses in the country and very often in towns our homes are surrounded at certain seasons by beautiful birds that flutter and twitter about in the trees and sing most charmingly in the bright hours of the early morning making the springtime and the summer tenfold more delightful than they would be without them these birds ask nothing of us but a few cherries or berries now and then and they pay well for these by picking up the worms and grubs from our gardens  i think that these little warblers and twitterers who fill the air with their songs and frolic about on the trees and bushes who build their nests under our eaves and in any little box that we may put up for them who come regularly back to us every spring although they may have been hundreds of miles away during the cold weather and who have chosen of their own accord to live around our houses and to sing in our trees and bushes ought to be called our friends as much as the fowls in our poultryyards  illustration  illustration     in a well   perhaps very few of you have ever seen such an oldfashioned well as this no pump no windlass no arrangement that you are apt to call at all convenient for raising the water nothing but that upright stake on top of which moves a long pole with the bucket hanging from one end of it but the artist does not show in the picture the most important part of this arrangement on the other end of this long pole a heavy stone is fastened and it is easy to see that a bucket of water may be raised without much trouble with the stone bearing down the other end of the pole to be sure the stone must be raised when the bucket is lowered but that is done by pulling downward on the rope which is not so hard as to haul a rope upward when the resistance is equal in both cases try it some time and you will see that the weight of your body will count for a great deal in the operation in old mr naylors yardhe lived in a little town in pennsylvaniathere was one of these wells it had been dug by his father and as it had answered all his needs from his childhood mr naylor very justly considered it would continue to do so until his death and he would listen to no one who proposed to put up a pump for him or make him a windlass  one afternoon in the summertime jenny naylor his granddaughter had company and after they had been playing around the orchard for an hour or two and had slid down the strawstacks to their hearts content the children all went to the well to get a drink a bucket of water was soon hauled up and tommy barrett with a tincup ladled out the refreshment to the company when they had all drank enough they began to play with the wellpole boys and girls will play you know with things that no grown person would imagine could be tortured into means of amusement in less than five minutes they had invented a game that is the boys had i will give the girls the credit of standing by and looking on in a very disapproving manner while this game was going on the pastime was a very simple one when the stoneend of the pole rested on the ground on account of the bucket being empty one of the boys stood by the wellcurb and seizing the rope as high up as he could pulled upon it the other boys lifting the stoneend at the same time when the stone was a foot or two from the ground the boys at that end sat on the pole and endeavored to hoist up the fellow at the other end  a glorious game  the sport went on very nicely until tommy barrett took hold of the rope he was the biggest boy and the little fellows could not raise him no it was no use so they gave it up and jumped off of the pole  but what was their amazement to see the stone rise in the air while at the same time tommy barrett disappeared down the well  the fact was tommy had been trying to show off a little before the girls and when he found the boys could not raise him had stepped on the wellcurb and pushing the bucket off had stood on it trying on his part to raise the boys so when they jumped off down he sank the stone was not nearly so heavy as tommy but it was weighty enough to prevent his going down very fast and he arrived safely at the bottom where the boys and girls saw him when they crowded around the well standing up to his armpits in water  pull me up quick cried tommy who still stood on the bucket and had hold of the rope  the children did not wait to be asked twice they seized the rope and pulled their very best but they could not move tommy one inch the rope hung right down the middle of the well and as they had to reach over a good deal even to touch it they could get no opportunity of exerting their full strength upon it and it is very well that they could not for had they been able to raise tommy it is probable that one or two of them would have been jerked down the well every time he slipped down again which he would have been certain to do a great many times before he reached the top  they soon perceived that they could not draw tommy from the well in that way and the stoneend of the pole was far out of their reach what should they do  there was no one at the house but the two old people and they were scarcely as strong as the children they all said a great deal but jenny naylor who was much older than any of the others saw that something must be done instantly for tommy was crying out that he was nearly frozen to death and she was afraid that he would let go of the rope slip off of the bucket and be drowned  so without a word to anybody she ran to the upright stake and began to climb it this was a very unladylike proceeding perhaps but jenny did not think about anything of that kind she was the oldest and the largest of them all and there was no time to explain matters to the boys up she went as actively as any boy and scrambling to the crotch of the stake she seated herself upon the pole  then she began to work herself slowly up towards the stoneend and as she gradually approached the stone so she gradually began to sink a little and the nearer she got to it the more she sank and the higher tommy barrett rose in the well  she and the stone were heavier than he was and some of the children stood with open mouths looking at jenny slowly coming down while the others crowded around the well to see tommy slowly coming up  when jenny had nearly touched the ground there was tommy hanging above the well  half a dozen little hands seized the bucket and tommy as wet as a dishrag stepped on to the curb  i wish from the bottom of my heart that whenever there is a party of children playing around an open well that there could be a girl like jenny naylor with them     a vegetable gas manufactory  illustration   there is a plant called by botanists the fraxinella which has the peculiar property of giving out from its leaves and stalks a gas which is inflammable sometimes on a very still day when there is no wind to blow it away as fast as it is produced this gas may be ignited by a match when the plant is growing in the open air but this is very seldom the case for the air must be very quiet and the plant very productive for enough gas to be found around it to ignite when a flame is applied  but it is perfectly possible as you may see in the engraving to collect sufficient gas from the fraxinella to produce combustion whenever desired if the plant is surrounded by a glass case the gas as fast as produced is confined in the case and at last there is so much collected in this novel gasometer that it is only necessary to open the case and apply a match to see plantgas burning  it is not at all probable that the least use in the world could be made of this gas but it is certainly a very pretty experiment to collect and ignite it  there are other plants which have this property of exuding illuminating gas in very small quantities but none i believe except the fraxinella will produce enough of it to allow this experiment to be performed     a few words about bears  illustration a company of bears   if you should ever be going up a hill and should meet such a procession as that on the opposite page coming down i would recommend you to get just as far to one side as you can possibly go bears especially when there are so many of them together are by no means pleasant companions in a walk  but it is likely that you might wander about the world for the rest of your lives and never meet so many bears together as you see in the engraving they are generally solitary animals and unless you happened to fall in with a mother and her cubs you would not be likely to see more than one at a time  in our own country in the unsettled parts of many of the states the black bear is still quite common and i could tell you of places where if you pushed carefully up mountainpaths and through lonely forests you might come upon a fine black bear sitting at the entrance of her cave with two or three of her young ones playing about her  if it should so happen that the bear neither heard you saw you or smelt you you might see this great beast fondling her young ones and licking their fur as gently and tenderly as a cat with her kittens  if she perceived you at last and you were at a distance it is very probable that she and her young ones if they were big enough would all scramble out of sight in a very short time for the black bears are very shy of man if circumstances will permit them to get away before he approaches too near to them but if you are so near as to make the old bearmother fearful for the safety of her children you will find that she will face you in a minute and if you are not well able to take care of yourself you will wish you had never seen a bear  illustration  but in the western part of our country especially in the rocky mountain region the grizzly bear is found and he is a very different animal from his black relations  he is the most savage and formidable animal on this continent and very seldom is it that he runs away from a man he is glad enough to get a chance to fight one he is so large and powerful that he is very difficult to kill and the hunter who has slain a grizzly bear may well be proud of the exploit  washington irving tells of a hunter who accidentally fell into a deep hole out in the prairies and he tumbled right on top of a great grizzly bear how the bear got down there is not stated and i dont suppose the hunter stopped to inquire a fight immediately commenced between these two involuntary companions and after a long struggle in which the man had an arm and leg broken and was severely bitten and torn besides he killed the bear  the hunter had a very hard time after that but after passing through adventures of various kinds he floated down the mississippi on a log and was taken in at a fort he recovered but was maimed for life  illustration  i think it is probable that no other man ever killed a grizzly bear in single combat and i also have my doubts about this one having done so it is very likely that his victim was a black bear  few men care to hunt the grizzly bear except on horseback so that if they have to run away they may have better legs than their own under them  the other great bear of this continent is the white or polar bear of which we have all heard so much up in the regions of ice and snow this bear lives just as comfortably as the tiger in the hot jungles of asia and while he is not quite so savage as the tiger he is almost as hard to kill but in speaking of his disposition i have no intention whatever to give him a character for amiability in fact he is very ferocious at times he has often been known to attack parties of men and when wounded can make a most soulstirring defence  the polar bear is a big fellow with long white hair and he lives on seals and fish and almost anything he can pick up sometimes he takes a fancy to have a man or two for his supper as the following story will prove  a ship returning from nova zembla anchored near an island in the arctic ocean and two of the sailors went on land they were standing on the shore talking to each other when one of them cried out stop squeezing me  the other one looked around and there was a white bear very large but very lean and scraggy which had sneaked up behind the sailors and now had clutched one of them whom he very speedily killed and commenced to eat while the other sailor ran away  the whole crew of the ship now landed and came after the bear endeavoring to drive him away from the body of their comrade but as they approached him he quietly looked at them for a minute and then jumped right into the middle of the crowd seized another man and killed him upon this the crew ran away as fast as they could and scuttling into their boats rowed away to the ship  there were three of these sailors however who were too brave to stay there and see a bear devouring the bodies of their friends and they returned to the island  the bear did not move as they approached him and they fired on him without seeming to injure him in the least at length one of them stepped up quite close to him and put a ball into his head just above his eye  illustration  but even this did not kill him although it is probable that it lessened his vigor for he soon began to stagger and the sailors falling upon him with their swords were able to put him to death and to rescue the remains of their comrades  after these stories i think that we will all agree that when we meet a procession of bears be they black white or grizzly we will be very wise to give them the right of way and to endeavor to drive from our minds as far as possible such ideas of the animals as we may have derived from those individuals which we have seen in rural menageries nimbly climbing poles or sedately drinking sodawater  illustration     an old countryhouse  illustration   here is a picture of a handsome summer residence it apparently belongs to a rich man and a man of taste the house is large and commodious the grounds are well laid out there is a garden evidently a fine one close at hand there is shade water fruit flowers and apparently everything that a countryhouse ought to have  but yet there is a certain something strange and unusual about it  there are handsome porticos but they are differently arranged from those to which we have been accustomed such as those in front we have often seen but the upper one which appears to go nearly around the house with short pillars on the sides is different from anything that we see in our country neighborhoods those long pillars at the rear of the house seem very peculiar we have never noticed anything like them in such positions there seems to be scarcely any portico at the back and those slim pillars are certainly useless and to our eyes not very ornamental the windows too are remarkable they are not only very small but they are wider at the bottom than the topa strange idea of the architect to make them in that way the upper story of the house does not appear to have any windows at all but we suppose that they must be in the back and front or the artist may have accidentally left them out even if that floor was used for lumberrooms there ought to be windows  the garden has a very high wall for a private estate it is evident that there must be great fear of thieves in that neighborhood  but it is no wonder that some things about this house and its grounds strike us as peculiar for it was built more than three thousand years ago  it was the country residence of an egyptian gentleman and was no doubt replete with all the modern conveniences of the period even in the present day he might consider himself a very fortunate man who had so good a house and grounds as these if the windows were made a little larger a few changes effected in the interior of the establishment and some chimneys and fireplaces built none of our rich men need be ashamed of such a house  but handsome as it is it is not probable that this house cost the egyptian gentleman very much  it is very likely indeed that it was built under the supervision of an architect by his own slaves and that the materials came from his own estates but he may of course have spent large sums on its decoration and furniture and it is very probable judging from the outside of his house that he did so some of those old egyptians were most luxurious fellows  if you wish to see how his slaves worked while they were building his house just examine this picture  to be sure it is a temple which these men are building but the bricklayers hodcarriers etc worked in the same way when they were putting up a private house  illustration  these poor men whom you see toiling here were probably not born slaves and it is very likely that many of them are equal in birth and education to those who own them  a great proportion of them are captives taken in war and condemned for the rest of their lives to labor for their victorious enemies that will be a vast temple which they are building look at the foundationswhat enormously thick walls it is probable that several generations of slaves will labor upon that temple before it is finished  they do not work exactly as we do in the present day the hodcarrier who is bringing bricks from the background has a very good way of carrying them but those who are bearing a pile of bricks between them seem to make a very awkward business of it and the man who is carrying mortar on his shoulder as he ascends the ladder might very profitably take a lesson from some of our irish hodcarriers an earthen pot with a round bottom is certainly a poor thing in which to carry mortar up a ladder  the man who is apparently squaring a stone and the one who is smoothing or trimming off some bricks are using very peculiar chopping tools but they may have answered their purpose very well at any rate most magnificent edifices were built by the men who used them although it is probable that the poor fellows progressed very slowly with their work  it may be when three thousand years more have elapsed that our countryhouses and our methods of building may appear as strange as this mansion of the egyptian gentleman and the customs of the egyptian bricklayers seem to us  but then we shall be the ancient americans and it will make no sort of difference to us what the future moderns say about us     faraway forests  illustration pine forest   i have no doubt that you all like to wander in the woods but suppose we ramble for an hour or two in forests so far away that it is probable none of you have ever seen them  let us first enter a pine forest  we have plenty of pines in our own country and it is probable that most of you have walked in the pine woods on many a summers day when the soft carpet of needles or pineshatters as some people call them was so pleasant to the feet the aromatic perfume of the leaves and trees was so delicious and everything was so quiet and solemn  but here is a pine forest in the eastern hemisphere  these woods are vast and lonely the ground is torn up by torrents for it is a mountainous district and the branches have been torn and broken by many a storm it is not a pleasant place for those who love cheerful scenery and moreover it is not so safe to ramble here as in our own woods at home companies of bandits inhabit many of these forests especially those that stretch over the mountainous portions of italy it seems strange that in this enlightened era and in one of the civilized countries of europe bandits should still exist to terrify the traveller but so it is  let us get out of this pine forest so gloomy and perhaps so dangerous  here now is a very different place this is a forest in the tropics you will not be likely to meet with bandits here in fact it is very improbable indeed that you will meet with any one there are vast portions of these woods which have never been trodden by the foot of man and which you can never see unless you cut your way hatchet in hand among the thick undergrowth and the interlacing vines  illustration  here are ferns as large as treesgreat masses of flowers that seem as if a whole garden had been emptied down before usvast wildernesses of green which we know extend for miles and miles and which although apparently so thick and impenetrable are full of all kinds of life vegetable and animal the trees are enormous but many of them are so covered with vines and creepers that we can scarcely distinguish the massive trunks and luxuriant foliage every color is here rich green royal purple red yellow lilac brown and gray the vines which overrun everything are filled with gorgeous flowers and hang from the branches in the most graceful forms monkeys chatter among the trees beautiful parrots fly from limb to limb butterflies of the most gorgeous hues flutter about the grasstops and the leaves near the ground and on every log and trunk are myriads of insects lizards and little living things of endless varieties all strange and wonderful to us  illustration  in some parts of this interminable forest where the light breaks through the foliage we see suspended from the trees the wonderful airplants or orchids they seem like hangingbaskets of flowers and are far more beautiful and luxuriant than anything of the kind that we have in our hothouses at home  but we shall not find it easy to walk through all these beauties as i said before we shall often be obliged to cut a path with our hatchets and even then we may be unable to penetrate very far into this jungle of beauties the natives of these countries when they are compelled to pass through these dense forests often take to the small streams and wade along in the water which is sometimes up to their shoulders occasionally finding shallower places or a little space on the banks where they can pick their way along for a few hundred yards before they are obliged to take to the stream again  illustration giant trees of california  everything is lovely and luxuriant here but it will not do to stay too long there are fevers and snakes  let us now go to the greatest woods in the whole world i do not mean the most extensive forest but that one where the trees are the grandest this is the region where the giant trees of california grow  nowhere on the face of the earth are there such trees as these some of them stand over four hundred feet high and are thirty feet in diameter  their age is believed to be about eighteen hundred years think of it they have been growing there during the whole of the christian era  one of them the very largest of all has been lying on the ground for about one hundred and fifty years when it was standing its diameter was about forty feet  another trunk which is lying on the ground has been hollowed out by fire and through this great bore or tube a whole company of horsemen has ridden  one of these trees was cut down some years ago by a party of men who i think should have been sent to prison for the deed it took five men twentyfive days to cut it through with augers and saws and then they were obliged to use a great wedge and a batteringram to make it fall  these are the kings of all trees after such a grand sight we will not want to see any more trees today and we will leave the forests of faraway and sit and think of them under our humble grapevines and honeysuckles     building ships  illustration boat building   it is a grand thing to own great ships and to send them over the ocean to distant countries but i will venture to say that few men have derived so much pleasure from their fine vessels laden with all kinds of valuable freight as many a boy has had in the possession of a little schooner which would be overloaded with a quart of chestnuts and it is not only in the ownership of these little crafts that boys delight they enjoy the building of them quite as much  and a boy who can build a good ship is not to be laughed at by any mechanic or architect no matter how tall or how old he may be  the young shipbuilder who understands his trade when he is about to put a vessel on the stocksto speak technicallyfirst makes up his mind whether it is to be a ship a schooner a sloop or merely a sailboat and determines its size then he selects a good piece of solid but light wood which will be large enough for the hull pine is generally used but if he can get a piece of wellseasoned white willow he will find it to work very easily then he shapes his hull with knife and saw according to the best of his ability on this process the success of the whole undertaking depends if the bottom is not cut perfectly true on both sides if the bow is not shapely and even if the stern is not rounded off and cut up in the orthodox fashion his ship will never sail well no matter how admirably he may execute the rest of his work if there is a ship or boat builders establishment anywhere within reasonable walking distance it will well pay our young shipwright to go there and study the forms of hulls even if he should never build a ship he ought to know how they look out of the water  when the hull is properly shaped it must be hollowed out this is done by means of a gouge or chisel with a curved edge a small vessel can be hollowed by means of a knife or ordinary chisel but it is best to have a gouge if there is much wood to be taken out when he has made the interior of his vessel as deep and wide as he thinks proper he will put a deck on it if it is a ship or a schooner but if it is a sailboat or sloop he will probably only put in seats or thwarts as the sailors call them or else halfdeck it  then comes the most interesting part of the workthe rigging first the masts which must be light and tapering and standing back at a slight angle are set up and the booms and yards are attached a great deal of ingenuity can be displayed in making the booms work well on the masts the bowsprit is a simple matter and the stays or ropes which support and strengthen the masts are very easily attached as they are stationary affairs but the workingtackle and the sails will show whether our young friend has a genius for boatbuilding or not if his vessel has but a single mast and he merely makes a mainsail and a jib he will not have much trouble but if he intends to fit out a schooner a brig or a ship with sails that will work and where is the boy with soul so dead as to have any other kind he will find that he will have a difficult job before him but if he tries hard and examines the construction and working of sails in real ships he will also find that he can do it  if the vessel is a fine one she ought to be painted this of course to be done before the sails are finally fastened to the booms and yards and her name should be tastefully painted on her stern where of course a rudder carefully working on little hooks is already hung  it will be very difficult to tell when the ship will be actually finished there will always be a great deal to do after you think all is done flags must be made and little halyards running nicely through little pulleys or rings ballast must be provided and adjusted conveniences for storing away freight if the ship is large and voyages are contemplated must be provided a crew perhaps a little cannon for salutes an anchor and windlass and i am sure i cannot tell you what else besides will be thought of before the ship is done  but it will be done some time and then comes the happy hour  if the owner is fortunate enough to live near a pond or a brook so that he can send her right across to where his partner stands ready to receive her he is a lucky boy indeed  what a proud moment when with all sails set and her rudder fixed at the proper angle she is launched  how straight she sits in the water and how her little streamer begins to float in the wind now see her sails gradually puff out she moves gently from the shore now she bends over a little as the wind fills her sails and she is off faster and faster she glides along her cutwater rippling the water in front of her and her flags fluttering bravely in the air and her delighted owner with laughing eyes beholds her triumphantly scudding over the surface of the pond  i tell you what it is boys i have built a great many ships and i feel very much like building another     the orangoutang  illustration   the orangoutang and the chimpanzee approach nearer to man in their formation and disposition than any other animals and yet these apes seldom evince as much apparent sense and good feeling as the dog or elephant they imitate man very often but they exhibit few inherent qualities which should raise them to the level of many of mans brute companions  i do not wish however to cast any aspersions on an animal generally so goodtempered and agreeable in captivity as the orangoutang what he might become after his family had been for several generations in a condition of domestic servitude i cannot tell he might then even surpass the dog in his attachment to man and his general intelligence  at all events the orangoutang has a certain sense of humor which is not possessed by animals in general he is very fond of imitating people and sometimes acts in the most grotesque and amusing way but like many human wits of whom we read his manner is always very solemn even when performing his funniest feats  an old gentleman once went to see a very large and fine orangoutang and was very much surprised when the animal approached him and taking his hat and his cane from him put on the hat and with the cane in his hand began to walk up and down the room imitating as nearly as possible the gait and figure of his venerable visitor  there was another orangoutang who belonged to a missionary who performed a trick even more amusing than this his master was preaching one sunday to his congregation when mr orangoutang having escaped from the room where he had been shut up slipped very quietly into the church and climbed up on the top of the organ just over the pulpit where his master was delivering his sermon after looking about him for a minute or two the ape commenced to imitate the preacher making all his gestures and motions of course the people began to smile when they saw this and the minister thinking that they were behaving very improperly rebuked them for their inattention and preached away more earnestly than before the orangoutang of course followed his example and commenced to gesticulate so earnestly and powerfully that the congregation burst into laughter and pointed out the irreverent ape  when he turned and saw the performance of his imitator the preacher could not help laughing himself and the orangoutang after a good deal of time had been spent in catching him was put out of church and the services went on as usual  nobody likes to be made an object of ridicule and it is probable that this disposition of making fun of people which seems so natural to the orangoutang would prevent his becoming a domesticated member of our families no matter how useful and susceptible of training he might prove to be  nearly all of us have some comical peculiarity and we would not want an animal in the house who would be sure at some time to expose us to laughter by his imitative powers  so i am afraid that the orangoutangs intelligent as they are will have to stay in the woods     little bridgets bath   little bridget was a good girl and a pretty one but she had ideas of her own she liked to study her lessons to mind her mother and to behave herself as a little girl should but she did despise to be washed there was something about the very smell of soap and the touch of water which made her shrink and shiver and she would rather have seen the doctor come to her with a teaspoonful of medicine than to have her aunt ann approach with a bowlful of water a towel and a great piece of soap  illustration  for a long time little bridget believed that there was no escape from this terrible daily trial but one bright morning when she awoke very early long before any one else in the house she thought that it was too bad when everything else was so happywhen the birds and butterflies were flying about so gayly in the early sunbeams and the flowers were all so gay and bright and smelling so sweet and contented that she should have to lie there on her little bed until her aunt ann came with that horrible soap and towel she made up her mind she wouldnt stand it she would run away before she came to wash her for one morning she would be happy  so up she jumped and without stopping to dress herself ran out among the birds and flowers  she rambled along by the brook where the sand felt so nice and soft to her bare feet she wandered through the woods where she found blackberries and wild strawberries and beautiful ferns and she wandered on and on among the rocks and the trees and over the grass and the flowers until she sat down by a great tree to rest then without intending anything of the kind she went fast asleep  she had not slept more than five minutes before along came a troop of fairies and you may be assured that they were astonished enough to see a little girl lying fast asleep on the grass at that time in the morning  well i never said the largest fairy who was the principal one  nor i said the next biggest its little bridget and with such a dirty face just look she has been eating blackberries and strawberriesand raspberries too for all i know for you remember brother that a face dirtied with raspberries is very much like one dirtied with strawberries  very like indeed brother said the principal one and look at her feet shes been walking in the wet sand  and her hands cried the very least what hands theyre all smeared over with mixtures of things  well said the next biggest she is certainly a dirty little girl but whats to be done  done said the principal one there is only one thing to be done and that is to wash her there can be no doubt about that  all the fairies agreed that nothing could be more sensible than to wash little bridget and so they gathered around her and with all gentleness some of them lifted her up and carried her down towards the brook while the others danced about her and jumped over her and hung on to long fern leaves and scrambled among the bushes and were as merry as a boxful of crickets  when they approached the brook one of the fairies jumped in to see if the water was warm enough and the principal one and the next biggest held a consultation as to how little bridget should be washed  shall we just souse her in said the next biggest  i hardly think so said the principal one she may not be used to that sort of thing and she might take cold it will be best just to lay her down on the bank and wash her there  so little bridget who had never opened her eyes all this time and no wonder for you will find if you are ever carried by fairies while you are asleep that they will bear you along so gently that you will never know it was brought to the brook and laid softly down by the waters edge  then all the fairies set to work in good earnest some dipped clover blossoms in the water and washed and rubbed her mouth and cheeks until there was not a sign left of strawberry or blackberry stain others gathered fern leaves and soft grass and washed her little feet until they were as white as lambs wool and the very least who had been the one to carry her hand now washed it with ever so many morninggloryblossomfuls of water and rubbed it dry with soft clean moss  other fairies curled her hair around flower stalks while some scattered sweet smelling blossoms about her until there was never such a sweet clean and fragrant little girl in the whole world  and all this time she never opened her eyes but no wonder for if you are ever washed by fairies while you are asleep you will find that you will never know it  when all was done and not a speck of dirt was to be seen anywhere on little bridget the fairies took her gently up and carried her to her mothers house for they knew very well where she lived there they laid her down on the doorstep where it was both warm and shady and they all scampered away as fast as their funny little legs could carry them  it was now about the right time in the morning to get up and very soon the front door opened and out came aunt ann with a bucket on her arm which she was going to fill at the well for the purpose of giving little bridget her morning wash  when aunt ann saw the little girl lying on the door step she was so astonished that she came very near dropping the bucket  well i never said she if it isnt little bridget and just as clean as a new pin i do declare i believe the sweet innocent has jumped out of bed early and gone and washed and combed herself just to save me the trouble  aunt anns voice was nothing like so soft and gentle as a fairys and it woke up little bridget  you lovely dear cried her aunt i hadnt the least idea in the world that you were such a smart little thing and there is no doubt but that you are now old enough to wash and dress yourself and after this you may do it  so after that bridget washed and dressed herself and was just as happy as the birds the butterflies and flowers     some novel fishing  illustration   fishing has one great peculiarity which makes it often vastly more interesting than hunting gunning or many other sports of the kind and that is that you never know exactly what you are going to get  if we fish in waters known to us we may be pretty sure of what we shall not get but even in our most familiar creeks and rivers who can say that the fish which is tugging at our line is certainly a perch a catfish or an eel we know that we shall not pull up a shad or a salmon but there is always a chance for some of those great prizes which are to be found by rare good luck in every river and goodsized stream a rockfish or stripedbass perhaps or a pike or enormous chub  but there are some fish which would not only gratify but astonish most of us if we could be so fortunate as to pull them out of the water for instance here are some fish with both their eyes on one side of their heads  illustration  these are turbots and are accounted most excellent eating they resemble in their conformation but not in their color our flounders or flatfish which some of you may have caught and many of you have eaten these fish lie on one side at the very bottom of the water in which they live and consequently one eye would be buried in the mud and would be of no use if they were formed like common fish but as their enemies and their food must come from above them they need both their eyes placed so that they can always look upwards in the picture at the head of this article you will see some soles lying together at the bottom these are formed in the same way they are white on one side which is always down except when they are swimming about and a very dark green on the other so that they can scarcely be distinguished from the mud when they are lying at the bottom the turbot however as you see is very handsomely spotted  but there are much stranger fish than these flat fellows and we must take a look at some of them what would you say if you were to pull up such a fish as this on your hook  illustration  this is a hippocampus or seahorse he is a little fellow only a few inches in length but he is certainly a curiosity with a head and neck very much like those of a horse he seems to take pleasure in keeping himself in such a position as will enable him to imitate a high mettled charger to the greatest advantage he curves his neck and holds up his head in a manner which few horses adopt unless they are reined up very tightly i have seen these little fellows in aquariums and have always regarded them as the most interesting of fishes  but although it is by no means probable that any of us will ever catch a seahorse we might get even stranger fish upon our hooks if we had a very large hook a long and strong line and a tempting bait it is just possible if we were to go to exactly the right spot and had extraordinary good fortune that we might catch such a beauty as this  illustration  this fellow you will probably recognize as the cuttlefish some persons call it the devilfish but the name is misapplied the devilfish is a different kind of a sea monster but the cuttlefish is bad enough to have the very worst name that could be bestowed upon him those great arms which sometimes grow to a length of several feet he uses to wrap around his prey and they are strong and tough he has two eyes and a little mouth and is about as pugnacious a fish as is to be found anywhere if i should ever haul a cuttlefish into my boat i think i should feel very much like getting out no matter how deep the water might be  there was once a sea captain who was walking on a beach with some of his men when he spied one of these cuttlefish travelling over the sand towards the water he thought it would be a fine thing to capture such a strange fish and he ran after it and caught hold of one of its legs but he soon wished that it had got away from him for the horrid creature turned on him and wrapped several of its long arms or legswhichever they may bearound him and the poor captain soon began to fear that he himself would not be able to escape  nothing that he could do would loosen the hold of the monster upon him and if it had not been for a sailor who ran up with a hatchet and cut the limbs of the cuttlefish from its body the poor captain might have perished in the embrace of this most disagreeable of all fishes there are a great many stories told of this fish and it is very probable that all the worst ones are true canary birds are very fond of pecking at the bones taken from small cuttlefish and indiaink is made from a black substance that it secretes but i would rather do without canary birds altogether and never use indiaink than to be obliged to catch my own cuttlefish  but while we are hauling strange things up from the deep suppose we take something that is not exactly a fish but which is alive and lives in the water what do you think of a living thing like this  this is a polypier and its particular name is the fungia being so called because it resembles a vegetable fungus the animal lives inside of that circular shell which is formed something like the under side of a toadstool between the thin plates or leaves the polypier thrusts out its arms with little suckers at the ends with these it seizes its food and conveys it to its mouth which is situated at the centre of its body  illustration  but there are more strange fish in the sea than we can ever mention and the strange fish are by no means the most profitable still there is a pleasure in fishing no matter what we pull up  the greatest fishers in the world are fish the whale will catch in the course of a day enough herring to last a family for many years and in all the rivers and oceans and lakes fishing is going on so constantly and extensively that the efforts of man in that direction seem ridiculous by contrast  illustration  the tunny a large fish measuring from two to five feet in ordinary length is a great fisher he like the whale is fond of herrings and he likes them fresh not salt smoked or pickled often when the fishermen are busy in their boats setting their nets for herring a troupe of tunnies will come along and chase the herring in every direction swallowing every unfortunate fellow that they can catch  some of the fishers that live in the sea are terrible fellows and are by no means content with such small game as herring the swordfish for instance always appears to prefer large victims and he has such strong tastes of that kind that he has been known to attack ships driving his long sword clean through the bottom of the vessel but he generally comes off second best on such occasions for his sword is very often broken off and left sticking fast in the thick hull  illustration  the swordfish has a better chance when he attacks a whale and this he has often been known to do the whale could probably kill the swordfish if he could get one good crack at him but the smaller fish is generally active enough to keep out of the way of harm while he drives his sword into the whale again and again until the great creature often perishes from loss of blood  the shark as you all know is the most ferocious and dangerous of all the fishers in the sea he considers anything suitable for a meal which will go into his mouth he will eagerly snap at a man a mouse or even a tin coffeepot or a bandbox so savage and relentless is this tiger of the sea as he is sometimes called that it is gratifying to think that he occasionally goes out fishing and gets caught himself many instances have been related of natives of the pacific islands who are accustomed to bathe so much in the ocean that they swim almost like fishes themselves who have successfully given battle to sharks which have pursued them the shark is unable from the peculiar formation of his mouth to seize the man unless he can turn partially over therefore the man takes care to keep below the shark and a few stabs with his long knife are generally sufficient to finish the combat and to slay the monster  illustration  still although it appears so easy to kill a shark in this way i think it will generally be found preferable to try for some other kind of fish  let others go seek the shark the swordfish or the squirming cuttlefish give us the humble perch and the tender trout dont you say so     eagles and little girls  illustration the child and the eagle   many years ago among the mountains of switzerland an eagle pounced down upon a little girl and carried her away her parents were harvesting in the field and they did not notice the danger of their little daughter until the great bird had lifted her up in his talons and was flying away with her to his nest in the mountain crags  i remember having read all the particulars of this remarkable affair but i forget whether the child was rescued alive or not at any rate let us hope that she was  but this incident suggests the following question ought little girls to be allowed to play out of doors in countries where there are eagles  many a child after looking at such a picture as that upon the opposite page might reasonably stand in awe of the national bird of our country but i will state that it is my firm belief that a child runs quite as much risk of being swallowed up by an earthquake as it does of being carried away by an eagle  there have been a few instances where the baldheaded eagle of this countryso called not because its head is bald but because it is grayhas attacked children but these cases are very rare indeed the eagle which carried off the little girl in switzerland was of a very different kind from the national emblem of americamuch more powerful and fierce but even in switzerland if the children all lived until they were carried away by eagles the country would soon become like one great schoolhouse yard  so looking at the matter in all its various aspects i think that we may reasonably conclude that little girls when they play out of doors are in more danger from horses dogs snakes and bad company than of being attacked by eagles and the children may all look upon the picture of the eagle of the alps and its baby prey without a shudder on their own account     climbing mountains  illustration   there is nothing which can give us grander ideas of nature than to stand on the top of a high mountain but it is very hard to get there and yet there are very few mountains in the world which have not been ascended by man  for hundreds of years mont blanc that lofty peak of the alps was considered absolutely inaccessible but it is now frequently ascended even ladies and some of them americans have stood upon its summit  but few persons except those who have actually made the ascent of high and precipitous mountains have any idea of the dangers and difficulties of the undertaking the adventurers are obliged to wear shoes studded with strong iron spikes to prevent slipping they carry long poles with iron points by which they assist themselves up the steep inclines they are provided with ladders and very often the whole party fasten themselves together with a long rope so that if one slips the others may prevent him from falling  where there are steep and lofty precipices crumbling rocks and overhanging cliffs such as those which obstruct the path of the party whose toilsome journey is illustrated in the accompanying engraving the feat of climbing a mountain is hazardous and difficult enough but when heights are reached where the rocks are covered with ice where deep clefts are concealed by a treacherous covering of snow where avalanches threaten the traveller at every step and where the mountainside often seems as difficult to climb as a pane of glass the prospect seems as if it ought to appal the stoutest heart  but some hearts are stouter than we think and up those icy rocks along the edges of bewildering precipices over under and around great masses of rock across steep glaciers where every footstep must be made in a hole cut in the ice brave men have climbed and crept and gradually and painfully worked their way until at last they stood proudly on the summit and gazed around at the vast expanse of mountains plains valleys and forests spread far and wide beneath them  in europe there are regular associations or clubs of mountainclimbers which at favorable periods endeavor to make the ascent of lofty and difficult mountains nearly every peak of the pyrenees and the alps has felt the feet of these adventurers who take as much delight in their dangerous pursuits as is generally found by the happiest of those who are content with the joys of ordinary altitudes  we have very many grand mountains in our country but we have not yet reduced their ascent to such a system as that which these alpine clubs have adopted but very many of our countrymen have climbed to the loftiest peaks of the white mountains the catskills the alleghenies and the rocky mountains  mountainclimbing is certainly dangerous and it is about the hardest labor of which man is capable but the proud satisfaction of standing upon a mountaintop repays the climber for all the labor and makes him forget all the dangers that he has passed through     andrews plan  illustration   oh andy said little jenny murdock im so glad you came along this way i cant get over  cant get over said andrew why whats the matter  the bridge is gone said jenny when i came across after breakfast it was there and now its over on the other side and how can i get back home  why so it is said andrew it was all right when i came over a little while ago but old donald pulls it on the other side every morning after he has driven his cows across and i dont think he has any right to do it i expect he thinks the bridge was made for him and his cows  now i must go down to the big bridge andy and i want you to come with me im afraid to go through all those dark woods by myself said jenny  but i cant go jenny said andrew its nearly school time now  andrew was a scotch boy and a fine fellow he was next to the head of his school and he was as good at play as he was at his books jenny patterson his most particular friend was a little girl who lived very near andrews home she had no brothers or sisters but andrew had always been as good as a brother to her and therefore when she stood by the waters edge that morning just ready to burst into tears she thought all her troubles over when she saw andrew approach he had always helped her out of her difficulties before and she saw no reason why he should not do it now she had crossed the creek in search of wild flowers and when she wished to return had found the bridge removed as andrew supposed by old donald mckenzie who pastured his cows on this side of the creek this stream was not very wide nor very deep at its edges but in the centre it was four or five feet deep and in the spring there was quite a strong current so that wading across it either by cattle or men was quite a difficult undertaking as for jenny she could not get across at all without a bridge and there was none nearer than the wagon bridge a mile and a half below  you will go with me andy wont you said the little girl  and be late to school said he i have never been late yet you know jenny  perhaps dominie black will think you have been sick or had to mind the cows said jenny  he wont think so unless i tell him said andrew and you know i wont do that  if we were to run all the way would you be too late said jenny  if we were to run all the way to the bridge and i was to run all the way back i would not get to school till after copytime i expect every minute to hear the schoolbell ring said andrew  but what can i do then said poor little jenny i cant wait here till schools out and i dont want to go up to the schoolhouse for all the boys to laugh at me  no said andrew reflecting very seriously i must take you home some way or other it wont do to leave you here and no matter where you might stay your mother would be troubled to death about you  yes said jenny she would think i was drowned  time pressed and jennys countenance became more and more overcast but andrew could think of no way in which he could take the little girl home without being late and losing his standing in the school  it was impossible to get her across the stream at any place nearer than the big bridge he would not take her that way and make up a false story to account for his lateness at school and he could not leave her alone or take her with him  what in the world was to be done  while several absurd and impracticable projects were passing through his brain the schoolbell began to ring and he must start immediately to reach the schoolhouse in time  and now his anxiety and perplexity became more intense than ever and jenny looking up into his troubled countenance began to cry  andrew who never before had failed to be at the school door before the first tap of the bell began to despair  was there nothing to be done  yes a happy thought passed through his mind how strange that he should not have thought of it before  he would ask dominie black to let him take jenny home  what could be more sensible and straightforward than such a plan  of course the good old schoolmaster gave andrew the desired permission and everything ended happily but the best thing about the whole affair was the lesson that young scotch boy learned that day  and the lesson was this when we are puzzling our brains with plans to help ourselves out of our troubles let us always stop a moment in our planning and try to think if there is not some simple way out of the difficulty which shall be in every respect perfectly right if we do that we shall probably find the way and also find it much more satisfactory as well as easier than any of our ingenious and elaborate plans     the wild ass  illustration wild asses   if there is any animal in the whole world that receives worse treatment or is held in less esteem than the ordinary jackass i am very sorry for it  with the exception of a few warm countries where this animal grows to a large size and is highly valued the jackass or donkey is everywhere considered a stupid beast a lazy beast an obstinate beast and very often a vicious beast to liken any one to a jackass is to use very strong language  in many cases this character of the donkey with the exception of the stupidity for very few donkeys are stupid although they try to seem so is correct but nevertheless it is doubtful if the animal is much to blame for it there is every reason to believe that the dullness and laziness of the donkey is owing entirely to his association with man  for proof of this assertion we have but to consider the ass in his natural state  there can be no reasonable doubt but that the domestic ass is descended from the wild ass of asia and africa for the two animals are so much alike that it would be impossible by the eye alone to distinguish the one from the other  but except in appearance they differ very much the tame ass is gentle and generally fond of the society of man the wild ass is one of the shyest creatures in the world even when caught it is almost impossible to tame him the tame ass is slow plodding dull and lazy the wild ass is as swift as a racehorse and as wild as a deer the best mounted horsemen can seldom approach him and it is generally necessary to send a rifleball after him if he is wanted very much his flesh is considered a great delicacy which is another difference between him and the tame animal  if any of you were by accident to get near enough to a wild ass to observe him closely you would be very apt to suppose him to be one of those longeared fellows which must be beaten and stoned and punched with sticks if you want to get them into the least bit of a trot and which always want to stop by the roadside if they see so much as a cabbageleaf or a tempting thistle  but you would find yourself greatly mistaken and astonished when as soon as this wild creature discovered your presence he went dashing away bounding over the gullies and brooks clipping it over the rocks scudding over the plains and disappearing in the distance like a runaway cannonball  and yet if some of these fleet and spirited animals should be captured and they and their descendants for several generations should be exposed to all sorts of privations and hardships worked hard as soon as their spirits were broken fed on mean food and very little of it beaten kicked and abused exposed to cold climates to which their nature does not suit them and treated in every way as our jackasses are generally treated they would soon become as slow poky and dull as any donkey you ever saw  if we have nothing else it is very well to have a good ancestry and no nobleman in europe is proportionately as well descended as the jackass     ancient riding   there are a great many different methods by which we can take a ride when we are very young we are generally very well pleased with what most boys and girls call piggyback riding and when we get older we delight in horses and carriages and some of us even take pleasure in the motion of railroad cars  other methods are not so pleasant persons who have tried it say that riding a camel a little donkey or a rail is exceedingly disagreeable until you are used to it and there are various other styles of progression which are not nearly so comfortable as walking  illustration  there were in ancient times contrivances for riding which are at present entirely unknown except among halfcivilized nations and which must have been exceedingly pleasant  when for instance an egyptian princess wished to take the air she seated herself in a palanquin which was nothing but a comfortable chair with poles at the sides and her bearers with the ends of the poles upon their shoulders bore her gently and easily along while an attendant with a threefold fan kept the sun from her face and gently fanned her as she rode  such a method of riding must have been very agreeable for the shoulders of practised walkers impart to the rider a much more elastic and agreeable motion than the best made springs and for a well fed lazy princess nothing could have been more charming than to be borne thus beneath the waving palmtrees and by the banks of the streams where the lotus blossomed at the waters edge and the ibis sniffed the cooling breeze  but when the father or brother of the princess wished to ride especially if it happened to be a time of war he frequently used a very different vehicle from an easygoing palanquin  he sprang into his warchariot and his driver lashed the two fiery horses into a gallop while their master aimed his arrows or hurled his javelin at the foe  riding in these chariots was not a very great luxury especially to those who were not accustomed to that kind of carriage exercise there were no seats nor any springs the riders were obliged to stand up and take all the bumps that stones and roots chose to give them and as they generally drove at full speed these were doubtless many and hard there was in general no back to these chariots and a sudden jerk of the horses would shoot the rider out behind unless he knew how to avoid such accidents  we of the present day would be apt to turn up our noses at these ancient conveyances but there can be no doubt that the egyptian princesses and warriors derived just as much pleasure from their palanquins and roughgoing warchariots as the ladies of today find in an easyrolling barouche or the gentlemen in a light buggy and a fast horse     beautiful bugs  illustration   we are not apti am speaking now of mankind in generalto be very fond of bugs there is a certain prejudice against these little creatures which is in very many cases entirely unwarranted the fact is that most bugs are harmless and a great many of them are positively beautiful if we will but take the trouble to look at them properly and consider their wonderful forms and colors to be sure many insects to which we give the general name of bugs are quite destructive in our orchards and gardens but for all that they are only eating their natural food and although we may be very glad to get rid of our garden bugs as a body we can have nothing to say against any particular bug none of them are more to blame than the robins and other birds which eat our cherries and whatever else we have that they like and we never call a robin horrid because he destroys our fruit true the insects exist in such great numbers that it is absolutely necessary for us to kill as many of them as possible and it is very fortunate that the robins and blackbirds are of so much benefit to us that we are glad to let them live  but all this should not make us despise the bugs any more than they deserve particularly as they are just as beautiful as the birds if we only look at them in the right way a microscope will reveal beauties in some of the commonest insects which will positively astonish those who have never before studied bugs as they ought to be studied the most brilliant colors the most delicate tracery and lacework over the wings and bodies often the most graceful forms and beautifullycontrived limbs and bodies and wingcases and antennæ are to be seen in many bugs when they are placed beneath the glasses of the microscope  illustration transformations of beetles  but there are insects which do not need the aid of magnifying glasses to show us their beauties  some of the beetles especially the large ones are so gorgeously colored and so richly polished that they are imitated as closely as art can imitate nature in precious stones and worn as ornaments  there are few living things more beautiful than a great beetle glittering in resplendent green and gold and the girl or woman either who will hold one of these in her hand or let it crawl upon her arm while she examines its varied colors shows a capacity for perceiving and enjoying the beauties of nature that should be envied by those who would dash the pretty creature upon the floor exclaiming that horrid bug  there are many insects with which we need not desire to be too familiar such as mosquitoes fleas wasps and bees but when a bug is harmless as well as beautiful there is no reason why we should not treat it as a friend who is afraid of a butterfly  and yet a butterfly is really just as much a bug as a beetle is the fact is that the term bug is applied with a certain propriety to many insects which are not at all pleasant although the lightning bug is an exception and we should therefore be very careful about giving what has grown to be a bad name to insects that do not deserve it and should avoid treating such as if they were as ugly and disagreeable as the name would seem to imply     a battle on stilts  illustration a battle on stilts   in the year 1748 the great marshal saxe who was travelling through the low countries came to the town of namur in belgium there the citizens did everything in their power to make his stay pleasant and to do him honor and among other things they got up a battle on stilts these inhabitants of namur were well used to stilts for their town which has a river on each side of it lay very low and was subject to overflows when the people were obliged to use stilts in order to walk about the streets in this way they became very expert in the use of these slim wooden legs and to make their stilts amusing as well as useful they used to have stiltbattles on all holidays and great occasions  the young men of the town two or three hundred on each side would then form themselves into opposing armies and with flags flying and trumpets blowing they would advance to the attack  and they fought hard and well it was against the rule to use any club or similar weapon or to strike with the fists punching with their elbows to push each other down and kicking with their stilts to knock their opponents legs from under them were the methods of assault in this kind of warfare  the battle often lasted for an hour or two the armies fighting and shouting advancing and retreating while their wives and sisters stood around them encouraging them by shouts and handclapping and when an unfortunate fellow was knocked down these women would hasten to his assistance and help him up again as soon as he had recovered from his fall  this was pretty rough sport for the combatants fought as if their lives and fortunes depended upon the victory and although they did not often seriously injure one another there must have been many a sore head and bruised leg and arm after the battle was over  marshal saxe knew all about fighting and on this occasion he declared that if two real armies should engage with as much fury as these young fellows on stilts the battle would be a butchery  at another time when the archduke albert came to namur the citizens had one of these stiltbattles and it proved a very profitable one to them before the fight began the governor of the city promised the archduke to show him a battle between two bodies of men who would be neither on horseback nor on foot and when the engagement was over albert was so much pleased that he gave the town the privilege of being forever exempt from the duties on beer  as the good folks of namur were nearly as good at drinking beer as they were at walking on stilts this was a most valuable present for them  things are different in this country it is said that in 1859 a man walked across the rapids of the niagara river on stilts but i never heard of any of his taxes being remitted on that account     drawing the long bow  illustration   when a man has a bow and arrows as long as those used by some of the natives of brazil so that he has to lie down on his back and hold the bow with his foot when he shoots he may well be said to draw a long bow but it is not of these people that i now intend to speak without describing any particular school of archery i merely wish to give a few instances where the long bow has been drawn in words about feats with the bow and arrows  this expression drawing the long bow does not always mean that a falsehood has been told it often refers to a very wonderful story which may be true enough but which is so marvellous that it requires a firm trust in the veracity of the narrator for us to believe it  so now let us see what long bows have been drawn about bows and arrows  such stories commenced long ago the poet virgil in the Æneid tells of four archers who were shooting for a prize the mark being a pigeon tied by a cord to the mast of a ship the first man struck the mast with his arrow the second cut the cord and the third shot the pigeon while it was flying away there now being nothing for the fourth archer to shoot at he just drew his bow and sent his arrow flying towards the sky with such velocity that the friction of the air set the feathers on fire and it swept on like a fiery meteor until it disappeared in the clouds  it would be very hard even in this progressive age to beat that story  the greeks could tell tall stories too of their archers an historian named zosimus tells of a man who shot at the same time three arrows from the same bow at three different targets and hit them all it is to be hoped that his histories contained some things easier to believe than this  but as we approach the present age we still find wonderful narrations about archers robin hood for instance was a great fellow with the bow it is said that on one occasion he shot an arrow so that it fell a mile from where he was standing a long shot and hard to be equalled by the crack rifles of the present day  sir walter scott in ivanhoe introduces robin hood under the name of locksley and in a shooting match when his opponent had planted his arrow right in the centre of the bullseye and everybody of course thought that nothing better than that could be done master robin just steps up and lets fly his arrow driving it into the arrow that was sticking in the target splitting it from end to end  and then there is that famous story about william tell many persons have their doubts about this performance and either assert that there never was such a person as tell or that no man could have confidence enough in his own skill to shoot at an apple on his sons head but i prefer to believe this good old story and in fact i see no good reason to doubt it there was a dane named foke of whom the same story is told and an englishman named william of cloudesley is said to have shot an apple from his sons head merely to show his expertness  most of the stories of bows and arrows relate to the accurate aim of the archers but here is one which shows the tremendous force by which an arrow may be propelled if the bow is strong and long enough a french gentleman named blaise de vigenère says that he saw a turk named barbarossa an admiral of a ship called the grand solyman send an arrow from his bow right through a cannonball he did not state whether the cannonball had a hole through it or not  but i think that the most wonderful astounding and altogether amazing story about arrowshooting is told of the indians who used to inhabit florida it is stated that these indians were in the habit of assembling in parties of ten or a dozen for the purpose of having some amusement in archery they would form themselves into a circle and one of them throwing an ear of maize or indian corn into the air the rest would shoot at it and would shell it of every grain of corn before it fell to the ground sometimes the arrows would strike it so hard and fast that it would remain suspended in the air for several minutes and the cob never fell until the very last grain had been shot from it  after such a specimen of the drawing of the long bow as this it would not be well to introduce any feebler illustrations and so i will keep the rest of my anecdotal arrows in my quiver     an ancient theatre  illustration   i suppose you are all familiar with pictures of the colosseum at rome but unless you have carefully studied detailed descriptions of this edifice it is impossible for you to properly comprehend the grand style in which the ancients amused themselves  this great theatre the ruins of which are now standing in rome and which will probably stand for hundreds of years longer was built nearly eighteen hundred years ago it is a vast oval building four stories high and capable of containing ninety thousand spectators  seats one row above the other like steps were placed around the walls from top to bottom there was no roof to the building and if the sun was hot or it rained the people were obliged to shelter themselves as well as they could although it is probable that the seats for the emperors and other great dignitaries were protected by awnings in the centre of the building down at the foot of the seats was the great amphitheatre where the performances took place and wonderful performances they were there were sometimes great fights between lions tigers bulls and bears sometimes wild beasts were slain by men and sometimes men were slain by wild beasts there were gladiatorial combats executions of criminals and many other kinds of cruel and barbarous amusements when the colosseum was inaugurated five thousand wild beasts were put to death and afterwards at the celebration of a great victory eleven thousand animals perished under the ground in two vast basement stories the beasts were kept in cages until they were brought up to destroy human life or to be butchered themselves  for six hundred years these barbarous games were celebrated in the colosseum but it afterwards became a fortress and it was used at one time for a hospital when it began to decay many of the inhabitants of rome carried away portions of its materials to build houses for themselves but such depredations have long been forbidden and now the colosseum stands useless and ruined a silent memento of the wickedness of man people are bad enough in our age but the day is past when ninety thousand men women and children could be gathered together to see other men women and children torn and devoured by lions and tigers let us hope that by the time the colosseum has entirely crumbled away men will no longer meet in thousands to kill and mangle each other on the battlefield     bird chat  illustration bird chat   in a faroff country on a summer day it chanced that two cormorants stood on a great rock lazily dozing this rock was by the side of a little river that only a few miles below flowed into the sea for the cormorant is a marine bird and haunts the seacoast it was a lovely place although not very far from the habitations of men and a number of cows had laid themselves down in the grassy field that surrounded an old ruined temple on the gentle slope of a hill above the river the day had been still and hot but now a soft breeze was stirring the long grasses and bending the tassels of the reeds gracefully over the water and the scent of flowers came floating down from the vines clambering over the old ruin and the hum of insects filled the air  but i do not think the cormorants noticed any of these things their long necks were folded so that their heads nearly rested on their backs for as i said before they were dozing the truth is these birds had eaten so much they had made themselves perfectly stupid which is a bad way the cormorant has as no doubt you know for it has probably happened to you some time in your life to have indulged yourself so freely in eating something that you liked that you have been scornfully called a little cormorant  but this state of insensibility was passing away and they were now in a gentle doze and sleeping thinking of the company they were to entertain for these cormorants had come to this spot to meet their cousin the pelican to consult with him on some family matters upon their first arrival at the place they had set to work to get together a good supply of fish for this is the only food of both the cormorant and the pelican in a short time they landed a great number and bestowed them in a safe place and then they set to work catching fish for themselves and eating them greedily  you might suppose such a lazylooking bird would find it impossible to catch anything so active as fish but you should see it when it is fully awake and hungry the bird darts through the water with a speed greater than that of the fishes its wings can be closed so tightly that they do not hinder its progress and the tail serves for a rudder while the broadlywebbed feet act as paddles its long snakelike neck gives it the power of darting its beak with great rapidity and the hook at the end of the beak prevents the prey from escaping the bird is also a diver and can stay a long time under water  illustration  our two cormorants opened their eyes when they heard a slight splashing in the water something was about to invade their retreat they had not long to wait slowly into the stream waded a bittern seeing the cormorants there he stopped and drawing himself up into as small a compass as possible he sunk his head in his shoulders and nothing could be seen of his long neck while his bill was thrust up in the air as if he cared nothing for his neighbors or their affairs the cormorants heartily wished he would go away and they kept their eyes open and watched him for fear he would spy the fish they had carefully hidden in the wet grass for the bittern also lives on fish so the cormorants winked and blinked and thought how different the bittern looked when on the alert for his prey or calling his mate  many a time had they been roused out of their sleep by the terrible nightcry of the bitterna fearful sound something between the neighing of a horse the bellow of a bull and a shriek of savage laughter and so loud and deep it seemed to shake the marshy ground  illustration  soon there appeared hovering over them a snowy cloud as it floated nearer it proved to be a magnificent pelican with its gigantic wings outspread it alighted near the cormorants at the foot of a little grassy hill it was an old male bird very wise and very cunning he greeted his cousin cormorants cordially but ruffling up the crest of curled feathers on his head and shaking his halffolded wings angrily he looked askance at the bittern  now the bittern is a very unsocial bird and as he took not the least notice of the new comer the pelican could not pick a quarrel with him therefore he turned to his cousins and said i have just come from my pleasant home on a rocky island the waters make music there all day long and the green moss gleams through the white foam and gaycolored fish sparkle in the sunlight so that when men behold it they exclaim see what a beautiful spot there are some birds that like dingy pools where only coarse rushes grow where there is nothing but blight and mildew where even carrion crows will not fly and at which men shudder  now this exactly described the places the bittern prefers to all others but as he really considered them very captivating and hated the very sight of mankind he did not feel abashed by the pelicans stinging rebuke and perhaps took it for a compliment and there is no knowing how long he would have staid there if a frisky little hoopoe had not chanced to alight on a tree that had fallen across a foaming brook not very far from the group of birds  not liking so much company the bittern stalked away the hoopoe nodded so often to the birds that its beautiful tall crest trembled as if a breeze stirred it and having preened its prettilybarred feathers for awhile it began to talk as fast as ever it could  i have came from a long distance and only stopped twice on my way to get a meal of insects which i can dig out of decaying wood with my long curved beak very fast i can tell you and what do you think i saw in that place i came from you would never guess why men had some pet cormorants that they had trained to catch fish for them oh it was fun and i heard these men say that in the days of charles i of england i hope you know who he is for im sure i dont cormorants were kept by nobles and kings for the purpose of catching fish and that there was attached to the court an officer called the kings master of the cormorants did you ever hear the like of that  illustration  although this was strictly true the cormorants had never heard of it but before they could answer a loud deep voice cried heigho what is all that  the startled birds turned towards the spot from whence the voice proceeded and there perched on a lonely rock a good distance to the left of them was a great bird with very large bright eyes and powerful curved beak  neither the hoopoe nor pelican had ever before seen him but the cormorants knew him very well he was the peregrine falcon and they knew him because like them he chose rocky ledges high and inaccessible for his nest and although his nests were usually on loftier crags than theirs they were quite neighborly especially as they did not chase the same prey the cormorants drawing theirs from the sea and the falcons finding theirs in the air  illustration  those people you speak of said he sternly to the frightened hoopoe may have had cormorants to catch their fish but i never heard of it before whereas all history is full of the exploits of my ancestors and monarchs and nobles spent immense fortunes in buying and keeping falcons that hunted birds grandly  now the hoopoe knew very well that it was not this falcon but the great gerfalcon his cousin that was formerly held in such high esteem but he did not dare to say so and as he must be saying something he turned to the pelican  i have long wanted to meet with you to ask you if is true that you tear open your breast with your hooked bill and feed your young with your own blood  not a word of truth in it replied the pelican scornfully i am often obliged to gather food in places far from home i do not dive into the water like the cormorant but catch with a sidelong snatch of my bill the fish that rise to the surface this loose skin that is now so folded up under my beak that you can scarcely see it i can distend into an enormous pouch this i fill with fish and my wings being wide and powerful i can easily carry a great weight of fish through the air when i reach home i feed my young by pressing my beak against my breast and thus forcing out the enclosed fish and on the tip of my beak is a little curved hook as red as a drop of blood and now you know the whole story  thank you said the hoopoe i must go and tell the storks all about it and away he darted like a streak of colored light the falcon too lazily spread out his large wings and soared majestically up into the air leaving the pelican and cormorants to discuss their family affairs and their dinner in peace     mummies  illustration   a mummy is not a very pretty thing to look at but considered properly it is certainly interesting that stiff form wrapped up tightly in ever so many dirty cloths with a black shrivelled face which looks as if it had been cut out of a piece of wood and then smoked was once no doubt a very pleasant person to know if it was a woman it played with the children sewed a little perhaps complained of the heat and went to parties if it was a man it probably whistled a little and sang settled up its accounts was fond of horses and took an interest in the vegetable garden  most of the mummies that have been brought from egypt to this country were originally kings princes princesses noblemen and priests for few but those highborn folks could afford to be so well preserved as to last all this time but it is very certain that none of them ever imagined that thousands of years after their death they would be carried away to countries never heard of in their day and be gazed at by people who wore chignons and hightop hats and who were not born until they had been dead three thousand years  when we consider the care and skill with which the dead egyptians used to be embalmed and encased in their sarcophagi it is not surprising that their poor bodies have been so well preserved at the head of this article you see a mummy as it appears when it has been embalmed and wrapped in its bandages here is the stand on which it is then placed  illustration  very often when the body had been a king or some great personage its face was covered with a mask of thin gold and its bandages were ornamented with pictures and inscriptions  illustration  when this work of decoration was completed it was placed in a coffin which was made large enough to hold the stand  this coffin was very handsomely ornamented and then in order to make everything very secure indeed it was enclosed in another or exterior coffin which was also decorated in the highest style known to egyptian artists  illustration  one would now suppose that this great king or priest was safe enough looking at the matter in an ordinary light but the egyptians did not look at these matters in ordinary lights quite otherwise they intended the useless bodies of their grandees to be packed away so that they should not be disturbed as long as the world lasted little dreaming of the americans and europeans who would come along in a few thousand years and buy them for their museums  so they put the mummy with its stand and its two coffins into a great stone box called a sarcophagus and this was fastened and plastered up so as to seem like one solid rock  then if the inmate had ever done anything wonderful or sometimes no doubt if he had not been famous for anything in particular the history of his great achievements real or fancied was sculptured on the stone these hieroglyphics have been deciphered in several instances and we have learned from them a great deal of egyptian history  illustration  dead poor people as well as kings and princes were made into mummies in egypt but they were not preserved by such costly means as those i have mentioned after they had been embalmed they were wrapped up as well as the means of their relatives would allow and were placed in tombs and vaults sometimes with but one coffin and sometimes without any  in many cases the mummy was not buried at all but kept in the house of the family so that the friends and relatives could always have it with them this may have been very consoling to the ancient egyptians but to us it seems a truly mournful custom  and it is by no means distressing to think that though the people who may be in this country three thousand years hence may possibly find some of our monuments they will discover none of our bodies     tame snakes  illustration   we have often heard of the tamed snakes belonging to the serpentcharmers of india and africa but it is seldom that the harmless serpents of civilized countries have been domesticated but the common snake sometimes called the gartersnake which harmlessly shows its dark green and yellow colors among the grass and bushes has been tamed and has shown quite a fair amount of respect and affection for its human friends  a french writer relates that he knew a lady who had a snake which was so tame that it came when it was called followed its mistress about climbed up into her lap and gave many signs of knowing and liking her it would even swim after her when she threw it into the water from a boat but this last feat proved fatal to it for once swimming thus and endeavoring to keep up with the boat the tide became too strong for it and it was carried away and drowned  i am very much afraid that that lady did not deserve even as much affection as the snake gave her  the boys and girls in france sometimes amuse themselves by getting up a snaketeam  illustration  they tie strings to the tails of two common harmless snakes and then they drive them about using a whip i hope gently to make these strange steeds keep together and go along lively  it is said that snakes which have been played with in this way soon begin to like their new life and will allow the children to do what they please with them showing all the time the most amiable disposition  there is nothing very strange in a tamed snake toads tortoises spiders and many other unpromising animals have been known to show a capacity for human companionship and to become quite tame and friendly in fact there are very few animals in the world that cannot be tamed by man if man is but kind enough and patient enough     gymnastics   every one who has a body that is worth anything at all ought to do his best to keep it in good order and there is no better way of attaining this desirable object than by a proper course of gymnastics and to know just what is proper for certain ages and certain individuals demands a great deal of thought and judgment improper gymnastics are much worse than none we can generally however find those who are able to advise us in regard to the exercise one ought to take  this necessity of training the body as well as the mind has been recognized from the earliest ages and the ancient greeks and romans paid as much attention to their gymnasiums as they did to their academies and from their youth their boys and girls were taught those exercises which develop the muscles and ensure good health some of their methods however were not exactly the most praiseworthy for instance they would encourage their youngsters to fight  illustration  this engraving copied from an ancient picture shows how spiritedly the children practised this exercise  it would have been better if the individual with the stick had laid it over the backs of the young combatants instead of using it to direct their struggles  there are three kinds of gymnastics by the first we take exercise simply for the sake of the good we gain from it by the second we combine pleasure with our muscular exertion and the third kind of gymnastics is practised for the sake of making money  the exercises of the first division are carried on in regular gymnasiums or at home and consist of exercises with dumbbells bars suspended rings poles and many other appliances with which most boys and girls are familiar regular practice in a good gymnasium under the direction of a competent teacher is considered by those who best understand the education of young people an exceedingly necessary part of their education and gymnastic instruction both for boys and girls is becoming more popular every year  we need give but little time to this well understood division of gymnastics but will pass at once to the second class where diversion and exercise are combined this is by far the best method of gaining health and strength and should be preferred by all instructors whenever it is possible to adopt it  it is of no use to say anything in favor of this plan to the boys and girls themselves for they never fail to choose that form of exercise which has a good deal of play in it and it is well they like it for they will get more benefit from an hour of good vigorous play than from many lessons in the monotonous exercises in use in the gymnasiums  i shall not now speak of the lively games of boys and girls by which their cheeks grow rosy and their legs and arms grow strong for we all know enough about them but i will describe some of the athletic sports of grownup folks there are a great many of these some of which are of great antiquity wrestling boxing vaulting footracing and similar exercises have been popular for thousands of years and are carried on now with the same spirit as of old  outdoor sports differ very much in different countries in the united states the great game is at present baseball in england cricket is preferred and scotland has athletic amusements peculiar to itself in the latter country a very popular game among the strong folks is called throwing the hammer  illustration  these hammers are not exactly what their name implies being heavy balls of brass or iron fitted to a long handle the hammer is whirled around the head several times and then thrown as far as possible the man who throws it to the greatest distance wins the game  another game very much of this order consists in tossing a heavy stone instead of a hammer the scotch call this game putting the stone sometimes using stones that might be called young rocks and they put or throw them in a different way from the people of other countries where the game is popular in some of the mountainous regions of the continent of europe the game is played in the manner shown in the accompanying engraving  illustration  but it is impossible in a short article like this even to allude to all the different kinds of athletic games and i will now notice some of the gymnastics by which people make a living  ropewalkers circusriders and acrobats of every kind are now so common that a description of their ordinary performances is unnecessary they are found on every portion of the globe some of the most proficient being now seen in china and japan  if any of you have seen the japanese troupe of acrobats with which little allright was connected you will understand to what a high state of perfection physical exercises may be brought by people who give up their whole lives to the study and practice of their various feats  illustration  in europe and this country very remarkable gymnastic performers have appeared before the public  about the middle of the last century there lived in derby england a man by the name of thomas topham who performed in public some wonderful feats of strength at one time he lifted by a band passed over his shoulders three great casks of water which collectively weighed 1836 pounds  he had a platform built for this performance which was constructed in such a way that he could use the whole power of his body and limbs in this feat however he has been surpassed by dr winship of boston who has lifted in public heavier weights than topham ever attempted  the latter however was enormously strong and performed a great many feats which made him quite famous throughout england  a favorite exhibition of public acrobats is that of pyramids pillars and other tall edifices built of men instead of bricks and stones the venetians used to be very expert and artistic in their arrangement of these exhibitions and the men composing the human edifice stood as immovably and gracefully as if they had been carved out of solid stone instead of being formed of flesh and blood  illustration  this performance has been made quite common in late years and i have seen the celebrated arabs and other acrobats pile themselves up in a most astonishing manner  illustration  one of the most popular and at the same time dangerous of all public gymnastic exhibitions is that of ropewalking and most marvellous feats on the tightrope have been performed in many parts of the world even in greece and rome men practised this form of gymnastics in later days no one has become more famous than blondin who crossed the niagara river on a tightrope performing all sorts of eccentric feats while balanced on his slender support he carried a man over on his shoulders he wheeled a wheelbarrow across he walked the rope blindfolded and did many other things which would be very difficult to most people even if they were standing on solid ground instead of being poised on a slender rope stretched high above the waters of a rapid river in this country however the taste for outdoor and dangerous ropewalking is not so general as it is in some countries of europe where it is quite common to see acrobats walking on ropes stretched from the top of one high building or steeple to another in venice for instance ropedancers have often skipped and played on ropes reaching from the summits of two of the loftiest towers of that beautiful city  the turks were once noted for their great proficiency in rope walking but they have been equalled by japanese european and american performers many women have been famous in this line and a madame sacqui a frenchwoman was such an expert artist that one of her countrymen likened her to a homeric goddess although i do not know how juno or minerva would have looked on a tightrope and asserted that her boldness and agility were the glory of the first empire this infatuated frenchman must have considered glory to have been very scarce in his country in madame sacquis day there was a french baby however who surpassed this lady for the little one walked on the tightrope before she could walk on the ground and afterwards became famous enough to perform in 1814 before an assembly of kingsthe allied sovereigns of europe  the public performers of different kinds of gymnastic feats often make a great deal of money but they sometimes break their necks and frequently injure their health by overexertion  so that exercises for health and amusement are the only kinds of gymnastics that i recommend     buying the mirror   miss harper came into the room where george and mary conly and ella lee were playing with jackstraws they had played everything else they could think of and feeling tired had quietly settled themselves down to jackstraws they could have amused themselves from morning until night out of doors without being weary but mr conlys house was in the city and had such a tiny bit of a yard that only fairies could have got up a frolic in it when they were in the country there were so many things they could do and when they were tired running about there was the seesaw on the big log under the old elm  illustration  but they were not in the country now and children have not the spirit to keep up their sports in the house as they do out of doors so when miss harper appeared with a book in her hand george and mary sprang up from the table in delight and exclaimed  oh cousin fanny are you going to read to us  yes said miss harper i thought you would like to hear some more of those pretty stories i read to you yesterday  that we will cried george skipping about the room while mary with eyes sparkling with pleasure hastily raked the jackstraws into a pile  we can both get into this big chair ella she said and then we can hear cumfible  now ella would much rather have played jackstraws for she thought listening to reading was very dull business indeed but she was a polite little girl which is pretty much the same thing as saying she was not selfish and seeing that george and mary were so pleased and expected her to be so also she made no objection and climbed up into the big chair and found it cumfible as mary had said  it will be awfully stupid she thought and this chair is so nice i am afraid ill go to sleep and mamma says that is very rude when any one is reading or talking to you  you see ella had not learned to be fond of books her parents had not been in the habit of reading to her and although in school she could read books that had quite long words in them still she could not read with sufficient ease to make it a pleasure to her  but she did not go to sleep but on the contrary got wider and wider awake the stories were all short so that when the end came she remembered the beginning perfectly and they were such lovely stories about little fairies and how they helped children to be good that ella was very sorry when the servant came to take her home  i thank you very much miss harper for reading to us she said will you please tell me the name of the book  it is the mirror said miss harper and i will read to you often if you will come to see us  ella thought about the book all the way home but she was so tired she was glad to go to bed after supper and the next morning she had no time before school to say anything to her mother about the wonderful mirror  but after dinner there was a pleasant surprise for her her father called her into his study and taking her up kissed her tenderly and said i saw your teacher yesterday and she gave me such a good account of my little girl that i am very much pleased with her and now if there is anything you would particularly like to have i will get it for you if it does not cost too much think a moment now dont be in a hurry  oh papa exclaimed ella i dont need to think a bit i know what i want i do so want to have a mirror  a what said mr lee suddenly putting ella down on the floor  a mirror papa when will you get it for me oh i am so glad and she clapped her little hands softly together  you are a very little girl to be so vain said mr lee gravely but as i said you should have what you wanted i will keep my promise go and dress yourself and we will get it this very afternoon  ella was so full of her own happy thoughts that she did not notice what he said about her being vain or that he looked displeased and she skipped merrily away to be dressed in a short time she had hold of her fathers hand and was walking down broadway looking in at the shop windows and talking as fast as her little tongue could go  mr lee who knew nothing about the book with such a queer title and supposed his daughter wanted a mirror in which to look at herself began to hope that as ella stopped so often to admire the pretty things in the windows she would see something she would prefer for a present for though it is a very proper thing to look in the glass to see that ones face is clean and hair smooth he did not like it that his daughter should want a lookingglass above everything in the world  o papa isnt that a lovely baby and ella paused in admiration before a wax doll  yes said mr lee eagerly would not you rather have that pretty baby than a mirror  ella considered for a moment she had a dolly she loved though she was not as pretty as this one  no papa id rather have a mirror it will be so nice to have one of my own i hope you know where to go to get it she added anxiously  certainly said mr lee rather sharply i know just where to go  and so they went on by windows filled with floating ribbons and shining silks and others where there were glittering jewels and some of the rings small enough for ellas fingers and others where there were white fur capes spread out with muffs that had such gay linings and tassels and windows hung to the very top with toys and some of them such cunning onesmice that could be made to run and squeak and jumping frogsbut none of these things would ella have at last they came to one all filled with flowers and with this ella was in raptures  what a very good man must live here she said to put all these things out for us to see i can smell them through the glass  they are put here to sell said mr lee and i know you will like that beautiful pink rosebush a great deal better than a mirroror that great white lily  no no papa said ella moving impatiently away when will we come to the place  here it is said mr lee as they stopped at a store where then were two huge windows filled with mirrors of all sizes now which one will you have not a very large one for such a very little lady but there is a nice little one that will just suit you and it has a very pretty frame  where where papa i dont see it and ella looked about the window in a very bewildered manner  there in that corner leaning against the windowframe  why papa thats a lookingglass  and is not that what you want  no sir i want a mirrora book  oh thats it said mr lee with a brighter face i expect you want a book called the mirror  yes sir said ella laughing as they walked on how funny that you should think i wanted a lookingglass there it is now she cried excitedly pointing into the window of a bookstore  it was a large sheet of paper ella saw called a poster but it had the mirror on it in very big letters so mr lee and ella went in and the shopman brought her the book but it was red and she did not want it and then he took down a green one and then a brown but ella would only have a blue one after some trouble a blue one was found and ella walked off hugging it close up to her the book miss harper read had a blue cover and i believe that ella was afraid that any other color would not contain the same stories     big game   when a man or a boy goes huntingin a bookhe might just as well go after good big game as after these little things that you see about home so let us leave chipmunks rabbits and titbirds to those poor fellows who have to shoot with real guns and are obliged to be home in time for supper and let us go out into the wide world to hunt the very largest and most savage beasts we can find it is perfectly safein a book  as we can go wherever we please suppose we try our skill in hunting the wild boar he will be a good beast to begin with because he is tolerably convenient being found in southern europe palestine and neighboring countries and also because he is such a destructive rascal when he comes into the neighborhood of civilization that every one will be much obliged to us for killing him if he chances to get into a vineyard in company with a set of his reckless fellows there is small chance for a vintage that year he tears down the vines devours the grapes green and ripe and breaks and ruins trellises and everything within his reach  if we are so fortunate as to get sight of him we will find that he is no easy game to bag very different is he from his tame brethren with which we are acquaintedold grunters who wallow about the mudpuddles and sleep serenely for hours with their fat sides baking in the sun the wild boar is as fast as a horse and as savage as the crossest bull he can run so that you can scarcely catch up to him with your nag at the top of his speed and when you do reach him he will be very apt if you are not watchful to rip up your horse with his tusks and cut some terrible gashes in your own legs besides  illustration wild boar  we must shoot this fellow as soon as we can get a good chance for those sharp tusks will be ready for us if we come too close and if he increases the distance between us he may get among the rocks and hills where he will surely escape for our horses cannot go over those rough ascents at the rate the boar would gallop  when at last he is shot the boar is capital eating his flesh is far superior to common pork possessing the peculiar delicate flavor which belongs to most wild meat if we could shoot a wild boar every few days we would be sure to fare very well during our hunting expedition  but we must press on after other game and we will now try and get a shot at a muskox we shall have to go somewhat out of our way to find this animal for he lives in the upper portions of north america but an ocean and a continent or two are not at all difficult to crossin a book  the muskox is about as large as a small cow he has very short legs and horns which are very large and heavy they extend over his forehead and seem as if they were parted in the middle like a dandys front hair it is probable if we get near enough to one of them that we shall have no trouble in shooting him but there is sometimes danger in this sport a sailor once went out to hunt muskoxen and to his great surprise soon found that they intended to hunt him a herd got after him and one big fellow was on the point of crushing him with his great horns when he dodged behind a rock against which the furious animal came like a batteringram  in the fall and winter the flesh of the muskox is very good indeed but in the spring it is not so nice it then smells like your sisters glovebox if she uses musk only about one hundred times as strong if we were to cut up one of these animals when his flesh is in this condition we would find it almost impossible to get the smell off of our knives the winter is certainly the time to shoot this game for then not only is his flesh very good but his skin is covered with very long and warm hair and we would find it even better to keep us warm than a buffalo robe  illustration the muskox and the sailor  while we are thinking of skins we might as well get a variety of them and we will find the fur of the brown bear very valuable  so now for a brown bear he too is found in the regions of ice and snow and in the north of europe he is hunted by the peasants in a way which we will not imitate when they find a den or cave in the rocks in which they think a bear is concealed these sturdy hunters make all sorts of noises to worry him out and when at last the bear comes forth to see what is the matter he finds a man standing in front of his den armed with a short lance with a long sharp head and a bar of iron placed crosswise on the handle just below the head now a fullgrown brown bear is not afraid of a man who is armed with a little weapon like this and so he approaches the hunter and rearing on his hind legs reaches forth his arms to give the man a good hug if he comes any nearer  illustration hunting the brown bear  the man does come nearer and to the bears great surprise he thrusts forth his lance which is longer than it looked and drives the head of it into the animals breast the iron bar prevents the lance from entering too far into the body of the beara very necessary precaution for if it was not there the bear would push himself up along the handle of the lance and have his great paws on the man in a minute or two but the bar keeps the bear back and the loss of blood soon renders him so weak that the hunter can throw him down and despatch him it is strange that the bear never tries to pull the lance out of his body he keeps pressing it in trying all the time to get over it at his enemy  this may be a good way to kill a bear but i dont like it it is cruel to the animal and decidedly dangerous to the hunter if i could not get a bear skin in any other way than by killing the animal with a spear i would let the bear keep his fur if we see any brown bears we will shoot them with our rifles a much safer and more humane method than the pike fashion  after the bears what shall we hunt what do you say to a hippopotamus that will be something that we are not accustomed to at any rate so away we go to the waters of africa if we travel along the shores of the nile and other african rivers we shall no doubt see some of these great creatures but we must not expect to get a good sight of any of them unless we are very careful to hide ourselves somewhere near where they are in the habit of coming out of the water to take a walk on land ordinarily all that can be seen of a hippopotamus is his head or his back sticking up out of the water they can stay under water for a long time occasionally sticking up their noses to get a breath of air  at night they often come on shore to see what they can find to eat they live on grass and grains which they find in the water and on land these animals are generally shot or harpooned at night when they come out of the water but occasionally a hunter sees one on shore in the daytime and he seldom finds any difficulty in shooting it if he can hit it in the ear which is its most vulnerable spot  the hippopotamus is naturally a timid animal and seldom turns on its hunters but sometimes it shows a courageous disposition some hunters having shot a young but apparently a tolerably wellgrown hippopotamus were running up to their prize when they were astounded by the old mother beast coming up out of the water and charging towards them with tremendous roars  illustration a brave hippopotamus  the hunters fired at her and then took to their heels but having found her offspring she stayed with it and did not pursue the men if she had overtaken them she would have been a terrible enemy to encounter  if during our nightwatches on the riverbanks we are so fortunate as to shoot a hippopotamus we shall find that we have a good supply of very fine meat and what we cannot eat the natives will be delighted to get they consider a hippopotamus a most valuable prize and as the meat is good and there is so very much of it their joy when they kill one is not at all surprising the only thing that troubles them after a successful hunt is that there are so few hippopotami killed and so many negroes to eat them  illustration a rhinoceros turning the tables  and now let us try a rhinoceros hunt this animal is found in the same regions that the hippopotamus inhabits but he also lives in asia he is rather a dangerous animal to hunt he is a savage fellow when provoked he has a great horn on his nose and a skin so thick that it is almost bulletproof and besides that he is the largest and strongest animal on the earth excepting the elephant so no wonder he is a little unsafe to hunt  the rhinoceros lives on grass and herbs and makes his home entirely on the land his flesh like that of the hippopotamus is very good to eat but rhinocerosbeef ought to be dear if the trouble and danger in getting it is taken into consideration when the price is fixed he very often turns and charges on the hunters and if he gets his horn under a man or a horse he is likely to cause trouble  it is said that a rhinoceros can kill an elephant by ripping him up with his horn and that the lion and all wild beasts are afraid of him i am not at all surprised that this is the case for i have examined the skin of a rhinoceros which i saw in a menagerie and it was so thick and heavy that scarcely any animal could tear it with teeth or claws so as to get at the enemy within it the rhinoceros which i saw in a cage was not quite fullgrown his horn was not more than an inch or two above his nose but he was an enormous fellow and his great hide which was as hard as the sole of your shoe hung on him in great folds as if it had been made large so as to give him room to grow he was gentle enough and let me put my hand through the bars of his cage and take hold of his horn without making the slightest objection but we will not find that kind of rhinoceros on the plains of africa and if we hunt one we must kill him very soon or be prepared to get out of his way  after a rhinoceros hunt we will not be apt to be easily frightened no matter what beast we pursue so we might as well go to india and hunt the bengal tiger  there is no animal more graceful in its movements handsomer in shape and color or more bloody and ferocious in its nature than the royal bengal tiger even in a cage he is a magnificent creature when i go to a menagerie i always look first for the bengal tigers  if we go to hunt these animals we had better ride upon elephants for we must go into the jungles where the tall reeds through which the tigers roam are higher than our heads  illustration a tiger hunt  when we are well in the jungle we must be careful it is sometimes very difficult to see a tiger even if you are quite near to him for the stripes on his skin are very much like the reeds and leaves of the jungle and we must keep a very sharp lookout and as soon as we see one we must be ready with our rifles for a tiger is very apt to begin the fight and he will think nothing of springing on the back of an elephant and dragging one of us to the ground sometimes the elephants are not used to hunting tigers and when they see the savage beasts they turn and run in that case there is often great danger for no one can fire coolly and with certain aim from the back of a bounding elephant  if we find a tiger and we get a good shotor perhaps many good shotsat him and he falls wounded or apparently dead we must still be very careful about approaching him for he is very hard to kill often when pierced with many balls a tiger is considered to have breathed his last he springs up all of a sudden seizes one of his hunters in his great jaws tears him with his claws and then falls back dead  hunters accustomed to the pursuit of tigers always make sure that a tiger is dead before they come near his fallen body and they often put many balls into him after he is stretched upon the ground  we must by this time be so inured to danger in the pursuit of our big game that we will go and hunt an animal which is i think the most dangerous creature with which man can contend i mean the gorilla  this tremendous ape as tall as a man and as strong as a dozen men has been called the king of the african forests for many years travellers in africa had heard from the natives wonderful stories of this gigantic and savage beast the negroes believed that the gorilla or pongo as he was called by some tribes was not only as ferocious and dangerous as a tiger but almost as intelligent as a man some of them thought that he could talk and that the only reason that he did not do so was because he did not wish to give himself the trouble  notwithstanding the stories of some travellers it is probable that no white man ever saw a gorilla until paul du chaillu found them in africa where he went in 1853 for the purpose of exploring the country which they inhabit  as mr chaillu has written several books for young folks in which he tells his experience with gorillas i shall not relate any of his wonderful adventures with these animals in which he killed some enormous fellows and at different times captured young ones all of which however soon died but the researches of this indefatigable and intrepid explorer have proved that the gorilla is as the negroes reported him to be a most terrible animal to encounter when found he often comes forward to meet the hunter roaring like a great lion and beating his breast in defiance if a rifleball does not quickly put an end to him he will rush upon his assailants and one blow from his powerful arm will be enough to stretch a man senseless or dead upon the ground  illustration fight with a gorilla  in a handtohand combat with a gorilla a man even though armed with a knife has not the slightest chance for his life  if we should be fortunate enough to shoot a gorilla we may call ourselves great hunters even without counting in the bears the rhinoceroses the tigers and the other animals  and when we return proud and satisfied with our endeavors we will prove to the poor fellows who were obliged to stay at home and shoot titbirds and rabbits with real guns what an easy thing it is to hunt the biggest kind of gamein a book     the bootblacks dog  illustration   once upon a time there lived in paris a bootblack he was not a boy but a man and he had a family to support the profits of his business would have been sufficient for his humble wants and those of his family had it not been for one circumstance which made trade very dull with him and that disastrous circumstance was this nearly every one who passed his stand had their boots and shoes already blackened now this was hard upon our friend there was nothing to astonish him in the fact of so many persons passing with polished boots for his stand was in the middle of a block and there were bootblacks at each corner but all he could do was to bear his fate as patiently as possible and black the few boots which came to him and talk to his dog his only companion as he sat all day on the sidewalk by his box  one day when he had just blackened his own boots he did not charge himself anythinghe only did it so as to have the air of being busy his dog came running up to him from the muddy street and accidentally put his dirty paw on his masters bright boots the man who was of an amiable disposition did not scold much but as he was brushing off the mud he said  you little rascal i wish it had been the boots of some other man that you had covered with dirt that would have been sensible  just at that moment a thought struck the bootblack  he would teach his dog to muddy other peoples boots  the man immediately acted on this idea and gave his dog lessons every day in the art of muddying boots in a week or two no gentleman with highly polished boots could pass the bootblacks stand without seeing a dog rush into the street and gutter and then come and jump on his feet spattering his boots with mud and water and making it necessary for him to go immediately to the nearest bootblackwhich was of course the dogs master  the bootblack now had constant custom and his circumstances began rapidly to improve his children being better fed grew round and chubby his wife had three good meals a day and some warm flannels and she soon lost the wan and feeble look which she had worn so long as for the man himself he and his dog were gay and busy all the day long  but people began to suspect something after a while one gentleman who had his boots muddied regularly every day once questioned the bootblack very closely for he saw that the dog belonged to him and the man was obliged to confess that he had taught the dog the trick the gentleman pleased with the smartness of the dog and perhaps desirous of ridding his fellowcitizens of annoyance and expense purchased the animal and took him home  but he did not keep him long in a few days the dog escaped and came back to his old master and his muddy trade  but i do not think that that bootblack always prospered people who live by tricks seldom do i have no doubt that a great many people found out his practices and that the authorities drove him away from his stand and that he was obliged to give up his business and perhaps go into the army while his wife supported the family by taking in washing and going out to scrub i am not sure that all this happened but i would not be at all surprised if it turned out exactly as i say     going after the cows  illustration   if there is anything which a little countryboy likes and which a big countryboy dislikes it is to go after the cows there is no need of giving the reasons why the big boy does not like this duty it is enough to say that it is a small boys business and the big boy knows it the excitement of hunting up and driving home a lot of slow meandering cattle is not sufficient for a mind capable of grappling with the highest grade of agricultural ideas and the youth who has reached the mature age of fifteen or sixteen is very apt to think that his mind is one of that kind  but it is very different with the little boy to go down into the fields with a big stick and a fixed purpose to cross over the ditches on boards that a few years ago he would not have been allowed to put his foot upon to take down the bars of the fences just as if he was a real man and when he reaches the pasture to go up to those great cows and even to the old bull himself and to shake his stick at them and shout go along there nowthese are proud things to do  and then what a feeling of power it gives him to make those big creatures walk along the very road he chooses for them and to hurry them up or let them go slowly just as he pleases  if on the way a wayward cow should make a sudden incursion over some low bars into a forbidden field the young director of her evening course is equal to the emergency  he is over the fence in an instant and his little legs soon place him before her and then what are her horns her threatening countenance and her great body to his shrill voice and brandished stick admitting his superior power she soon gallops back to the herd with whack after whack resounding upon her thick hide  when at last the great gentle beasts file one by one into the barnyard there is a consciousness of having done something very important in the air of the little fellow who brings up the rear of the procession and who shuts the gate as closely as possible on the heels of the hindmost cow  there are also many little outside circumstances connected with a small boys trip after the cows which make it pleasant to him sometimes there are tremendous bullfrogs in the ditch there are ripe wildcherriessplendid bitter and scarceon the tree in the corner of the field the pears on the little tree by old mrs hopkinss dont draw your mouth up so very much if you peel the skins off with your knife there is always a chance of seeing a rabbit and although there is no particular chance of getting it the small boy does not think of that now although it would hardly be worth while to walk very far for any of these things they are very pleasant when you are going after the cows  so i think it is no wonder that the little boys like to go after the cows and i wish that hundreds and thousands of palefaced and thinlegged little fellows had cows to go after     the reflective stag   the more we study the habits and natures of animals the more firmly are we convinced that in many of them what we call instinct is very much like what we call reason  in the case of a domestic animal we may attribute perhaps a great deal of its cleverness to its association with man and its capability of receiving instruction but wild animals have not the advantages of human companionship and what they know is due to the strength and quality of their own understanding and some of them appear to know a great deal  there are few animals which prove this assertion more frequently than the stag as his home is generally somewhere near the abodes of men and as his flesh is so highly prized by them it is absolutely necessary that he should take every possible precaution to preserve his life from their guns and dogs accordingly he has devised a great many plans by which he endeavorsoften successfullyto circumvent his hunters and to do this certainly requires reflection and a good deal of it too he even finds out that his scent assists the dogs in following him how he knows this i have not the slightest idea but he does know it  therefore it is that when he is hunted he avoids running through thick bushes where his scent would remain on the foliage and if possible he dashes into the water and runs along the beds of shallow streams where the hounds often lose all trace of him when this is impossible he bounds over the ground making as wide gaps as he can between his tracks sometimes too he runs into a herd of cattle and so confuses the dogs and he has been known to jump up on the back of an ox and take a ride on the frightened creature in order to get his own feet partly off of the ground for a time and thus to break the line of his scent when very hard pressed a stag has suddenly dropped on the ground and when most of the dogs unable to stop themselves dash over him he springs to his feet and darts off in an opposite direction  illustration  he will also run back on his own track and employ many other means of the kind to deceive the dogs showing most conclusively that he understands the theory of scent and the dogs power of perceiving it and also that he has been able to devise the very best plans to elude his pursuers  not only do stags reflect in this general manner in regard to their most common and greatest danger but they make particular reflections suited to particular places and occasions the tricks and manoeuvres which would be very successful in one forest and in one season would not answer at all in another place and at another time and so they reflect on the subject and lay their plans to suit the occasion  there are many animals which possess great acuteness in eluding their hunters but the tricks of the stag are sufficient to show us to what an extent some animals are capable of reflection     when we must not believe our eyes   there are a great number of marvellous things told us of phantom forms and ghostly apparitionsof spectres that flit about lonely roads on moonlight nights or haunt peaceful people in their own homes of funeral processions with long trains of mourners watched from a distance but which on nearer approach melt into a line of mist of wild witchdances in deserted houses and balls of fire bounding out of doors and windowsstories which cause the flesh of children to creep upon their bones and make cowards of them where there is no reason for fear for you may lay it down as a fact established beyond dispute that not one of these things is a reality the person who tells these marvels has always what seems the best of reasons for his belief he either saw these things himself or knew somebody strictly truthful who had seen them he did not know what i am going to prove to you that a thing may be true and yet not be real in other words that there are times when we do actually see marvels that seem supernatural but that on such occasions we must not believe our own eyes but search for a natural cause and if we look faithfully we are sure to find one  once a vessel was sailing over a northern ocean in the midst of the short arctic summer the sun was hot the air was still and a group of sailors lying lazily upon the deck were almost asleep when an exclamation of fear from one of them made them all spring to their feet the one who had uttered the cry pointed into the air at a little distance and there the awestricken sailors saw a large ship with all sails set gliding over what seemed to be a placid ocean for beneath the ship was the reflection of it  illustration  the news soon spread through the vessel that a phantomship with a ghostly crew was sailing in the air over a phantomocean and that it was a bad omen and meant that not one of them should ever see land again the captain was told the wonderful tale and coming on deck he explained to the sailors that this strange appearance was caused by the reflection of some ship that was sailing on the water below this image but at such a distance they could not see it there were certain conditions of the atmosphere he said when the suns rays could form a perfect picture in the air of objects on the earth like the images one sees in glass or water but they were not generally upright as in the case of this ship but reversedturned bottom upwards this appearance in the air is called a mirage he told a sailor to go up to the foretop and look beyond the phantomship the man obeyed and reported that he could see on the water below the ship in the air one precisely like it just then another ship was seen in the air only this one was a steamship and was bottomupwards as the captain had said these mirages generally appeared soon after the steamship itself came in sight the sailors were now convinced and never afterwards believed in phantomships  a french army marching across the burning sands of an egyptian desert fainting with thirst and choked with fine sand were suddenly revived in spirit by the sight of a sheet of water in the distance in it were mirrored the trees and villages gardens and pretty houses of a cultivated land all reversed the blue sky was mirrored there too just as you can see the banks of a lake and the sky that bends over it in its calm waters the soldiers rushed towards the place frantic with joy but when they got there they found nothing but the hot sands again they saw the lake at a distance and made another headlong rush only to be again disappointed this happened frequently until the men were in despair and imagined that some demon was tormenting them but there happened to be with this army a wise man who did not trust entirely to his own eyes and although he saw exactly what the others did he did not believe that there was anything there but air he set to work to investigate it and found out that the whole thing was an illusionit was the reflection of the gardens and villages that were on the river nile thrown up into the air like the ships the sailors saw only in the clear atmosphere of egypt these images are projected to a long distance and demons had nothing whatever to do with it  people used to believe in a fairy called fata morgana wonderful things were said of her and her dominions were in the air where she had large cities which she sometimes amused herself by turning into a variety of shapes the cities were often seen by dwellers on the mediterranean seacoast sometimes one of them would be like an earthly city with houses and churches and nearly always with a background of mountains in a moment it would change into a confused mass of long colonnades lofty towers and battlements waving with flags and then the mountains reeling and falling a long row of windows would appear glowing with rainbow colors and perhaps in another instant all this would be swept away and nothing be seen but gloomy cypress trees  illustration  these things can be seen now occasionally as of old but they are no longer in fairyland now we know that they are the images of cities and mountains on the coast and the reason they assume these fantastic forms is that the layers of air through which the rays of light pass are curved and irregular  illustration  a gigantic figure haunts the vosges mountains known by the name of the spectre of the brocken the ignorant peasants were in former times in great fear of it thinking it a supernatural being and fancying that it brought upon them all manner of evil and it must be confessed it was a fearful sight to behold suddenly upon the summit of a lofty mountain an immense giant sometimes pointing in a threatening attitude to a village below as if dooming it to destruction sometimes with arms upraised as if invoking ruin upon all the country and sometimes stalking along with such tremendous strides as to make but one step from peak to peak often dwarfing himself to nothingness and again stretching up until his head is in the clouds then disappearing entirely for a moment only to reappear more formidable than before  but now the spectre of the brocken is no longer an object of fear why because men have found him out and he is nothing in the world but a shadow when the sun is in the right position an ordinarysized man on a lower mountain will see a gigantic shadow of himself thrown upon a cloud beyond the brocken though it appears to be on the mountain itself and it is so perfect a representation that it is difficult to believe it is only a shadow but it can be easily proved if the man stoops to pick up anything down goes the spectre if he raises his hand so does the spectre if he takes a step of two feet the spectre takes one of miles if he raises his hat the spectre politely returns his salute  when you behold anything marvellous and your eyes tell you that you have seen some ghostly thing dont believe them but investigate the matter closely and you will find it no more a phantom than the mirage or the spectre of the brocken     a city under the ground   under the bright skies of italy in a picturesque valley with the mountains close at hand and the blue waves of the mediterranean rolling at a little distanceat the foot of wonderful vesuvius green and fertile and covered with vines to its very top from which smoke is perpetually escaping and in whose heart fires are eternally raging in this beautiful valley stands the city of pompeii  illustration clearing out a narrow street in pompeii  you might however remain upon the spot a long time and never find out that there was a city there all around you would see groves and vineyards and cultivated fields and villas for the city is beneath your feet under the vineyards and orchards are temples filled with statues houses with furniture pictures and all homelike things nothing is wanting there but life for pompeii is a buried city and fully twothirds of it has not yet been excavated  but a short walk from this place will bring you to the spot where excavations have been made and about onethird of the ancient city lies once more under the light of heaven it is doubtful whether you can see it when you get to it for the mounds of ashes and rubbish piled around but clambering over these you will pay forty cents for admission and pass through a turnstile into a street where you will see long rows of ruined houses and empty shops and broken temples and niches which have contained statues of heathen gods and goddesses as you wander about you will come across laborers busily employed in clearing away rubbish in obstructed streets it is a very lively scene as you can see in the picture men are digging zealously into the heaps of earth and rubbish and filling baskets which the barefooted peasantgirls carry to the cars at a little distance a railroad has been built expressly to carry away the earth the cars are drawn by mules the girls prefer carrying their baskets on their heads the men have to dig carefully for there is no knowing when they may come across some rare and valuable work of art  the excavations are conducted in this manner among the trees and in the cultivated fields there can be traced little hillocks which are pretty regular in form and size these indicate the blocks of houses in the buried city and of course the streets run between them after the land is bought from the owners these streets are carefully marked out the vines are cleared away the trees cut down and the digging out of these streets is commenced from the top the work is carried on pretty steadily at present but it is only within the last few years that it has been conducted with any degree of enterprise and skill  illustration a cleared street in pompeii  let us leave this rubbish and go into a street that has already been cleared the first thing you will observe is that it is very narrow it is evidently not intended for a fashionable drive but few of the streets are any wider than this one the greatest width of a street in pompeii is seven yards and some are only two and a half yards sidewalks and all the middle of the street is paved with blocks of lava the sidewalks are raised and it is evident the owners of the houses were allowed to put any pavement they pleased in front of their dwellings in one place you will see handsome stone flags the next pavement may be nothing but soil beaten down while the next will be costly marble  the upper stories of the houses are in ruins it is probable therefore that they were built of wood while the lower stories being of stone still remain they had few windows on the street as the pompeiians preferred that these should look out on an inner square or court to the right of the picture is a small monument and in the lefthand corner is a fountain or rather the stone slabs that once enclosed a fountain  as we walk slowly up the solitary street we think of the busy restless feet that trod these very stones eighteen hundred years ago our minds go back to the year of our lord 79 when there was high carnival in the little city of pompeii with its thirty thousand people when the town was filled with strangers who had come to the great show at the time of an election when politicians were scheming and working to get themselves or their friends into power when gayly dressed crowds thronged the streets on their way to the amphitheatre to see the gladiatorial fight when there was feasting and revelry in every house when merchants were exulting in the midst of thriving trade when the pagan temples were hung with garlands and filled with gifts when the slaves were at work in the mills the kitchens and the baths when the gladiators were fighting the wild beasts of the arenathen it was that a swift destruction swept over the city and buried it in a silence that lasted for centuries  vesuvius the volcano so near them but which had been silent so many years that they had ceased to dread it suddenly woke into activity and threw out of its summit a torrent of burning lava and ashes and in a few short hours buried the two cities of herculaneum and pompeii so completely that two centuries after no one could tell the precise place where they had stood and men built houses and cultivated farms over the spot never dreaming that cities lay beneath them  illustration the atrium in the house of pansa restored  but here we are at the house of pansa let us go in we do not wait for any invitation from the owner for he left it nearly two thousand years ago and his descendants if he have any are totally ignorant of their illustrious descent first we enter a large hall called the atrium you can see from the magnificence of this apartment in what style the rich pompeiians lived the floor is paved in black and white mosaic with a marble basin in the centre the doors opening from this hall conduct us to smaller apartments two reception rooms a parlor the library and six diminutive bedrooms only large enough to contain a bedstead and with no window it must have been the fashion to sleep with open doors or the sleepers must inevitably have been suffocated  at the end of the atrium you see a large court with a fountain in the middle this was called the peristyle around it was a portico with columns to the left were three bedchambers and the kitchen and to the right three bedchambers and the diningroom behind the peristyle was a grand saloon and back of this the garden the upper stories of this house have entirely disappeared this is a spacious house but there are some in the city more beautifully decorated with paintings and mosaics  when the rubbish was cleared out of this house much of pansas costly furniture was found to be in perfect preservation and also the statues in the library were found a few books not quite destroyed in the kitchen the coal was in the fireplaces and the kitchen utensils of bronze and terracotta were in their proper places nearly all of the valuable portable things found in pompeii have been carried away and placed in the museum at naples  this pansa was candidate for the office of ædile or mayor of the city at the time of the eruption of vesuvius we know this from the placards that were found posted in various parts of the city and which were as fresh and clean as on the day they were written these placards or posters were very numerous and there seem to have been a great many candidates for the various city offices and it is very evident from the inscriptions on the houses on the walls of public buildings and the baths that party feeling ran quite as high in this luxurious city of ancient times as it does now in any city in america for these pompeiians had no newspaper and expressed their sentiments on the walls and they have consequently come down to us of the present day  these inscriptions not only related to politics but referred often to social and domestic matters and taken in connection with the pictures of home scenes that were painted on the walls of the houses give us such accurate and vivid accounts of the people that it is easy to imagine them all back in their places and living the old life over again pansa and paratus and sallust and diomed and julia and sabina seem to be our own friends with whom we have often visited the forum or the theatre and gone home to dine  that curiouslooking pin with a cupid on it is a ladys hairpin the necklaces are in the form of serpents which were favorite symbols with the ancients the stands of their tables candelabra c were carved into grotesque or beautiful designs and even the kitchen utensils were made graceful with figures of exquisite workmanship and were sometimes fashioned out of silver  among the pretty things found in pompeiian houses i will mention the following  a bronze statuette of a dancing faun with head and arms uplifted every muscle seems to be in motion and the whole body dancing another of a boy with head bent forward and the whole body in the attitude of listening then there is a fine group of statuary representing the mighty hercules holding a stag bent over his knee another of the beautiful apollo with his lyre in his hand leaning against a pillar there are figures of huntsmen in full chase and of fishermen sitting patiently and quietly waiting for a bite a very celebrated curiosity is the large urn or vase of blue glass with figures carved on it in half relief in white for the ancients knew how to carve glass these white figures look as if made of the finest ivory instead of being carved in glass they represent masks enveloped in festoons of vine tendrils loaded with clusters of grapes mingled with other foliage on which birds are swinging children plucking grapes or treading them under foot or blowing on flutes or tumbling over each other in frolicsome glee this superb urn which is like nothing we have nowadays is supposed to have been intended to hold the ashes of the dead for it was a custom of ancient days to burn the bodies of the dead and place the urns containing their ashes in magnificent tombs  illustration ornaments from pompeii  instead of hanging pictures as we do the pompeiians generally had them painted upon the smoothly prepared walls of their halls and saloons the ashes of vesuvius preserved these paintings so well that when first exposed to the light the coloring on them is fresh and vivid and every line and figure clear and distinct but the sunlight soon fades them they are very beautiful and teach us much about the beliefs and customs of the old city  lovely and graceful as were these pictures the floors of the houses are much more wonderful they are marvels of art not only are flowers and running vines and complicated designs there laid in mosaics but pictures that startle with their lifelike beauty there are many of these but perhaps the finest of all is the one found in the same house with the dancing faun it represents a battle a squadron of victorious greeks is rushing upon part of a persian army the latter are turning to flee those around the vanquished persian king think only of their safety but the king with his hand extended towards his dying general turns his back upon his flying forces and invites death every figure in it seems to be in motion you seem to hear the noise of battle and to see the rage fear triumph and pity expressed by the different faces think of such wonderful effects being produced by putting together pieces of glass and marble colored enamel and various stones but leaving all these beauties and descending to homely everyday life we will go into a bakery here is one in a good state of preservation  illustration discoveries of loaves of bread baked eighteen hundred years ago  it is a mill and bakery together the pompeiians sent their grain to the baker and he ground it into flour and making it into dough baked it and sent back loaves of bread the mills look like huge hourglasses they are made of two coneshaped stones with the small ends together the upper one revolved and crushed the grain between the stones they were worked sometimes by a slave but oftenest by a donkey there is the trough for kneading the bread the arched oven the cavity below for the ashes the large vase for water with which to sprinkle the crust and make it shiny and the pipe to carry off the smoke in one of these ovens were found eightyone loaves weighing a pound each whole hard and black in the order in which they had been placed on the 23d of november 79 suppose the baker who placed them there had been told that eighteen hundred years would elapse before they would be taken out  having wandered about the city and looked at all the streets monuments and dwellings and having seen very much more than i have here describedthe forum or town hall the theatres baths stores temples the street where the tombs areand having looked at the rude cross carved on a wall showing that the religion of christ had penetrated to this pagan cityhaving examined all these you will visit the amphitheatre  to do this we must leave the part of the city that has interested us so much and passing once more through the vineyards and orchards that still cover a large portion of the city descend again into a sort of ravine where we will find the amphitheatre it was quite as the end of the city next to the wall it is a circus the large open space in the centre was called the arena here there were fierce and bloody fights wild beasts fought with each other or with men trained to the business and called gladiators and these gladiators often fought with each otherall for the amusement of the people who were never satisfied unless a quantity of blood was shed and many were killed this arena was covered with sand and a ditch filled with water separated it from the seats  the seats arose from this arena tier above tier there were three divisions of them separating the rich from the middle class and these again from the slaves it was well arranged for the comfort of the audience having wide aisles and plenty of places of exit the whole was covered with an awning in the wall around the arena are the holes where thick iron bars were inserted as a precaution against the bounds of the panthers to the right of the principal entrance are two square rooms with gratings where the wild beasts were kept this amphitheatre would hold twenty thousand persons  illustration the amphitheatre of pompeii  we visit this place last because it was while the amphitheatre was crowded with people intent upon the bloody spectacle while wild beasts and men more cruel than the beasts were fighting together and spectators less pitiful than either were greedily enjoying it that suddenly the ground trembled violently this perhaps was not perceived in the circus on account of the excitement all were in and the noise that was going on in the arena but it was soon followed by a whirlwind of ashes and lurid flashes of flame darted across the sky the beasts were instantly tamed and cowered down in abject terror and the gladiators for the first time in their lives grew pale with fear then the startled crowd within the vast building heard from the streets the fearful cry vesuvius is on fire in an instant the spectacle is forgotten the terrified crowd rush out of the building and happy is it for them that the architects have provided so many places of exit some fled towards the sea and some to the open country those who reached the ships were saved but woe to those who went to their homes to collect their valuables to take with them or who took refuge under cover in the cellars  after the rain of ashes came a shower of blazing stones which fell uninterruptedly setting fire to all parts of the city and blocking up the streets with burning masses and then a fresh storm of ashes sweeping down would partly smother the flames but blocking up the doorways would stifle those within the houses and to add to the horror the volumes of smoke that poured from the mountain caused a darkness deeper than night to settle on the doomed city through which the people groped their way except when lighted by the burning houses what horror and confusion in the streets friends seeking each other with faces of utter despair the groans of the dying mingled with the crash of falling buildings the pelting of the fiery stones the shrieks of women and children the terrific peals of thunder  so ended the day and the dreadful scene went on far into the night in a few hours the silence of death fell upon the city the ashes continued to pour steadily down upon it and drifting into every crevice of the buildings and settling like a closelyfitting shroud around the thousands and thousands of dead bodies preserved all that the flames had spared for the eyes of the curious who should live centuries after and a gray ashy hill blotted out pompeii from the sight of that generation  hundreds of skeletons have already been found and their expressive attitudes tell us the story of their death we know of the pitiful avarice and vanity of many of the rich ladies who went to their homes to save their jewels and fell with them clutched tightly in their hands one woman in the house of the faun was loaded with jewels and had died in the vain effort to hold up with her outstretched arms the ceiling that was crushing down upon her but women were not the only ones who showed an avaricious disposition in the midst of the thunders and flames of vesuvius men had tried to carry off their money and the delay had cost them their lives and they were buried in the ashes with the coins they so highly valued diomed one of the richest men of pompeii abandoned his wife and daughters and was fleeing with a bag of silver when he was stifled in front of his garden by noxious vapors in the cellar of his house were found the corpses of seventeen women and children  a priest was discovered in the temple of isis holding fast to an axe with which he had cut his way through two walls and died at the third in a shop two lovers had died in each others arms a woman carrying a baby had sought refuge in a tomb but the ashes had walled them tightly in a soldier died bravely at his post erect before a city gate one hand on his spear and the other on his mouth as if to keep from breathing the stifling gases  thus perished in a short time over thirty thousand citizens and strangers in the city of pompeii now a city under the ground     the coachman  illustration   when a boy sees a coachman driving two showy highstepping horses along the street or better still over a level country road with his long whip curling in the air which whip he now and then flirts so as to make a sharp cracking noise over the horses heads and occasionally brings down with a light flick upon the flanks of the right or left horsethe carriage shining with varnish and plate rolling along swiftly and smoothlythe little boy is apt to think that coachman must be a very happy mortal  if the man on the carriagebox sees the boy looking at him with so much admiration he will probably throw him a jolly little laugh and a friendly nod and gathering up the reins and drawing them in tightly so as to arch the horses necks and make them look prouder and more stately than before he will give a loud crack with his curling whiplash and the horses will start off at a rapid trot and the carriage will sweep around a curve in the road so gracefully that the boys heart will be filled with envynot of the persons in the carriageoh no riding in a close carriage is a very tame and dull affair but he will envy the driver an ambition springs up in his mind at that instant of all things in the world he would rather be a coachman that shall be his business when he grows up to be a man and the chances are that when he goes home he tells his father so  but if the little boy instead of lying tucked in his warm bed should be set down at twelve oclock at night upon the pavement in front of that great house with the tall lamps on the steps he would see this same coachman under conditions that he would not envy at all  the empty carriage is close to the curbstone with the door swinging open as if to urge the owners to hurry and take possession the highstepping trotters are covered with blankets to protect them from the piercing cold and with their heads drooping are either asleep or wondering why they are not put into the stable to take their nights rest and the coachman is dancing about on the pavement to keep his feet warmnot by any means a merry kind of dance although he moves about pretty briskly he has taken off his gloves for they seem to make his hands colder and now he has thrust one hand into his pocket and is blowing on the other with all his might his whip that curled so defiantly in the air is now pushed under his arm and the lash is trailing limp and draggled on the stones he is warmly clad and his greatcoat has three capes but all cannot put sufficient heat into his body for it is a bitter cold night and the wind comes howling down the street as if it would like to bite off everybodys ears and noses it shakes the leafless branches of the trees until they all seem to be moaning and groaning together the moon is just rising over the church and the coachman is standing right in a broad patch of its light but moonlight though very beautiful when you are where you can comfortably admire it never warmed anybody yet and so the poor coachman gets no good out of that  there is a party in the great house the boy is standing where he can only see the lower steps and the tall lamps but the coachman can see that it is lighted from garret to cellar he knows that it is warm as summer in there there are stands of flowers all the way up the stairways baskets of them are swinging from the ceilings and vines are trailing over the walls  who in there could ever guess how bleak and cold it is outside ladies in shimmering silks and satins and glittering with jewels are flitting about the halls and floating up and down the rooms in graceful dances to the sound of music that only comes out to the coachman in fitful bursts  he has amused himself watching all this during part of the evening but now he is looking in at the sidelight of the door to see if there are any signs of the breaking up of the party or if those he is to take home are ready to go away he is getting very impatient and let us hope they will soon come out and relieve him     geysers and how they work  illustration the grand geyser of iceland   geysers or fountains of hot water or mud are found in several parts of the world iceland possesses the grandest one but in california there are a great many of these natural hot fountains most of which throw forth mud as well as water some of the american geysers are terrible things to behold they are generally found near each other in particular localities and any one wandering about among them sees in one place a great pool full of black bubbling contents so hot that an egg thrown in the spring will be boiled in a minute or two there he sees another spring throwing up boiling mud a few feet in the air there another one quiet now but which may at any time burst out and send its hot contents high above the heads of the spectators here a great hole in the ground out of which constantly issues a column of steam and everywhere are cracks and crevices in the earth out of which come little jets of steam and which give the idea that it would not require a very heavy blow to break in at any point the crust of the earth and let the adventurous traveller drop down into the boiling mass below  in iceland the geysers are not quite so terrible in their aspect as those in california but they are bad enough their contents are generally water some hot and bubbling and some hot and still while the great geyser the grandest work of the kind in the world bursts forth at times with great violence sending jets of hot water hundreds of feet into the air  these wonderful hot springs wherever they have been found have excited the greatest attention and interest in travellers and scientific men and their workings have been explained somewhat in this way  water having gradually accumulated in vast underground crevices and cavities is heated by the fires which in volcanic regions are not very far from the surface of the earth if there is a channel or tube from the reservoir to the surface the water will expand and rise until it fills the basin which is generally found at the mouth of hot springs but the water beneath being still further heated will be changed into steam which will at times burst out with great force carrying with it a column of water high into the air when this water falls back into the basin it is much cooler on account of its contact with the air and it cools the water in the basin and also condenses the steam in the tube or channel leading from the reservoir the spring is then quiet until enough steam is again formed to cause another eruption a celebrated german chemist named bunsen constructed an apparatus for the purpose of showing the operations of geysers here it is  illustration the artificial geyser  you see that the two fires in the engravingone lower and larger than the other because the heat of the earth increases as we get farther from the surfacewill heat the water in the iron tube very much as water is heated in a real geyser and when steam enough is formed a column of hot water is thrown out of the basin the great subterranean reservoir is not imitated in this apparatus but the action is the same as if the tube arose from an iron vessel there is a great deal in bunsens description of this contrivance in regard to the difference in the temperature of the water in that part of the tube between the two fires and that in the upper portion which explains the intermittent character of the eruptions of a geyser but it is not necessary for us to go into all his details  when we know that under a geyser the water is boiling in a great reservoir which communicates with the surface by a natural tube or spout we need not wonder that occasionally a volume of steam bursts forth sending a column of water far into the air     a giant puffball  illustration   i suppose you have all seen puffballs which grow in the fields like mushrooms and toadstools but i am quite sure that you never saw anything of the kind quite so large as that one in the picture and yet that engraving was made from a drawing from the puffball itself so we need not suppose that there is anything fanciful about it  the vegetable in question is a kind of fungi called the giganti lycoperdon and it attains its enormous size in one night it springs from a seed so small that you could not see it and grows while you are asleep to be bigger perhaps than you are yourself  think of that how would you like to plant the whole garden some afternoon with that kind of seed would not your father and mother and everybody else be astounded when they woke up and saw a couple of hundred of those things as big as barrels filling up every bed  they would certainly think it was the most astonishing crop they had ever seen and there might be people who would suppose that fairies or magicians had been about  the great trouble about such a crop would be that it would be good for nothing  i cannot imagine what any one would do with a barnful of lycoperdons  but it would be wonderfully interesting to watch the growth of such a fungus you could see it grow in one night you could see its whole life from almost nothing at all to that enormous ball in the picture nature could hardly show us a more astonishing sight than that     tickled by a straw  illustration       from his dreams of tops and marbles       where the soaring kites he saw     is that little urchin wakened       tickled by a wheaten straw      how do you suppose he likes it       young one with annoying paw     if i only were your mother       id tickle you with birchen straw      soon enough from pleasant dreaming       youll be wakened by the law     which provides for every vision       some sort of provoking straw      in dreams of play or hope or loving       when plans of happiness you draw     underneath your nose may wiggle       lifes most aggravating straw     the light in the castle   on a high hill in a lonely part of europe there stood a ruined castle no one lived there for the windows were destitute of glass there were but few planks left of the floors the roof was gone and the doors had long ago rotted off their hinges so that any persons who should take up their residence in this castle would be exposed to the rain when there was a storm to the wind when it blew and to robbers if they should come besides running the risk of breaking their necks by falling between the rafters every time they attempted to walk about the house  it was a very solemn lonely and desolate castle and for many and many a year no human being had been known to set foot inside of it  it was about ten oclock of a summer night that hubert flamry and his sister hulda were returning to their home from an errand to a distant village where they had been belated their path led them quite near to the ruined castle but they did not trouble themselves at all on this account for they had often passed it both by night and day but tonight they had scarcely caught sight of the venerable structure when hubert started back and seizing his sisters arm exclaimed  look hulda look a light in the castle  little hulda looked quickly in the direction in which her brother was pointing and sure enough there was a light moving about the castle as if some one was inside carrying a lantern from room to room the children stopped and stood almost motionless  what can it be hubert whispered hulda  i dont know said he it may be a man but he could not walk where there are no floors im afraid its a ghost  would a ghost have to carry a light to see by asked hulda  i dont know said hubert trembling in both his knees but i think he is coming out  it did seem as if the individual with the light was about to leave the castle at one moment he would be seen near one of the lower windows and then he would pass along on the outside of the walls and directly hubert and hulda both made up their minds that he was coming down the hill  had we better run said hulda  no replied her brother lets hide in the bushes  so they hid  in a few minutes hubert grasped his sister by the shoulder he was trembling so much that the bushes shook as if there was a wind  hulda he whispered hes walking along the brook right on top of the water  is he coming this way said hulda who had wrapped her head in her apron  right straight cried hubert give me your hand hulda and without another word the boy and girl burst out of the bushes and ran away like rabbits  when hulda breathless fell down on the grass hubert also stopped and looked behind him they were near the edge of the brook and there coming right down the middle of the stream was the light which had so frightened them  ohh bother said hubert  what asked poor little hulda looking up from the ground  why its only a jackolantern said hubert lets go home hulda  as they were hurrying along the path to their home hubert seemed very much provoked and he said to his sister  illustration  hulda it was very foolish for you to be frightened at such a thing as that  me said hulda opening her eyes very wide i guess you were just as much frightened as i was  you might have known that no real person would be wandering about the castle at night and a ghost couldnt carry anything for his fingers are all smoke  you ought to have known that too i should say mr hubert answered hulda  and then i dont believe the light was in the castle at all it was just bobbing about between us and the castle and we thought it was inside you ought to have thought of that hulda  me exclaimed little hulda her eyes almost as big as two silver dollars  it always seems to me a great pity that there should be such boys as hubert flamry     the oak tree  illustration   i really dont know which liked the great oak best harry or his grandfather harry was a sturdy little fellow seven years old and could play ball and fly kites and all such things when he had anybody to play with but his fathers house was a long distance from the village and so he did not often have playmates and it is poor sport to play marbles or ball by ones self he did sometimes roll his hoop or fly his kite when alone but he would soon get tired and then if it was a clear day he would most likely say  grandpa dont you want to go to the big oak  and grandpa would answer  of course child we will go i am always glad to give you that pleasure  this he said but everybody knew he liked to go for his own pleasure too so harry would bring grandpa his cane and hat and away they would go down the crooked path through the field when they got to the drawbars harry took them down for his grandpa to pass through and then put them carefully up again so that the cows should not get out of the pasture and when this was done there they were at the oaktree  this was a very large tree indeed and its branches extended over the road quite to the opposite side right at the foot of the tree was a clear cold spring from which a little brook trickled and lost itself in the grass a dipper was fastened to a projecting root above the spring that thirsty travellers might drink the road by the side of which the oak stood was a very public one for it led to a city twenty miles away so a great many persons passed the tree and stopped at the spring to drink and that was the reason why little harry and his grandpa were so fond of going there it was really quite a lively place carriages would bowl along all glittering with plate and glass and with drivers in livery market wagons would rattle by with geese squawking ducks quacking and pigs squealing horsemen would gallop past on splendid horses hay wagons would creak slowly by drawn by great oxen and best of all the stage would dash furiously up with the horses in a swinging trot and the driver cracking his whip and the bright red stage swaying from side to side  it generally happened that somebody in the stage wanted a drink from the spring and harry would take the cup handed out of the window and dip it full of the cold sparkling water and then there would be a few minutes of friendly chat  but the most of the talk was with the footpassengers the old man sat on a bench in the cool shade and the child would run about and play until some one came along then he would march up to the tree and stand with his hands in his pockets to hear what was said very often having a good deal to say himself sometimes these people would stay a long time under the shade of the tree and there were so many different people and they had so many different kinds of things to say that harry thought it was like hearing a book read only a great deal better  at one time it would be a soldier who had wonderful things to tell of the battles he had fought another day it would be a sailor who while smoking his pipe would talk about the trackless deserts of burning sands and of the groves of cinnamon and all sweet spices where brightcolored parrots are found and of the great storms at sea when the waves dashed ships to pieces another time a foreigner would have much to say about the strange people and customs of other lands and sometimes they talked in a strange language and could not be understood and that was very amusing  the organgrinders were the best for they would play such beautiful tunes and perhaps there would be children who would tinkle their tambourines and sing the songs that the girls sing in italy when they tread out the grapes for wine and sometimes there would beoh joy a monkey and then what fun harry would have  and sometimes there were poor men and women tired and sick who had nothing to say but what was sad  occasionally an artist would stop under the tree he would have a great many of his sketches with him which he would show to harry and grandpa and then he would go off to a distance and make a picture of the splendid oak with the old man and child under it and perhaps he would put into it some poor woman with her baby who happened to be there and some poor girl drinking out of the spring and harry and grandpa always thought this better than any of the other pictures he showed them  illustration     the seaside   the ocean is so wonderful itself that it invests with some of its peculiar interest the very sands and rocks that lie upon its edges there is always something to see at the seaside whether you walk along the lonely coast go down among the fishermen and their nets and boats or pass along the sands lively with crowds of manycolored bathers  but if there was nothing but the grand old ocean itself it would be enough whether it is calm and quiet just rolling in steadily upon the shore in long lines of waves which come sweeping and curling upon the beach and then breaking spread far out over the sandor whether the stormwaves tossing high their lofty heads come rushing madly upon the coast dashing themselves upon the sands and thundering up against the rocks the sea is grand  what a tremendous thing an ocean is ever in powerful motion so wonderful and awful in its unknown depths and stretching so far far far away  but even on the coasts of this great ocean our days seem all too short as we search among the rocks and in the little pools for the curiosities of the seaside here are shells and shells and shellsfrom the great conch which you put up to your ear to hear the sound of the sea within to the tiny things which we find stored away in little round cases which are all fastened together in a string like the rattles of a snake  in the shallow pools that have been left by the tide we may find a crab or two perhaps some jellyfish starfish and those wonderful living flowers the seaanemones and then we will watch the great gulls sweeping about in the air and if we are lucky we may see an army of little fiddlercrabs marching along each one with one claw in the air we may gather seaside diamonds we may perhaps go in and bathe and who can tell everything that we may do on the shores of the grand old ocean  illustration  and if we ever get among the fishermen then we are sure to have good times of still another kind then we shall see the men who live by the sea and on the sea we shall wander along the shore and look at their fishingvessels which seem so small when they are on the water but which loom up high above our heads when they are drawn up on the shoresome with their clumsylooking rudders hauled up out of danger and others with rudder and keel resting together on the rough beach anchors buoys bits of chains and hawsers lie about the shore while nets are hanging at the doors of the fishermens cottages some hung up to dry and some hung up to mend  here we may often watch the fishermen putting out to sea in their dirty but strong little vessels which go bouncing away on the waves their big sails appearing so much too large for the boats that it seems to us every now and then as if they must certainly topple over and then at other times we will see the fishermen returning and will be on the beach when the boats are drawn up on the sand and the fish some white some gray some black but all glittering and smooth are tumbled into baskets and carried up to the houses to be salted down or sent away fresh for the markets  then the gulls come circling about the scene and the ducks that live at the fishermens houses come waddling down to see about any little fishes that may be thrown away upon the sand and men with tarpaulin coats and flannel shirts sit on old anchors and lean up against the boats smoking short pipes while they talk about cod and mackerel and mainsails and booms and best of all the delightful seabreeze comes sweeping in browning our cheeks reddening our blood and giving us such a splendid appetite that even the fishermen themselves could not throw us very far into the shade at mealtimes  as for bathing in the sea plunging into the surf with the waves breaking over your head and the water dashing and sparkling all about you i need not say much about that i might as well try to describe the pleasure of eating a saucer of strawberriesandcream and you know i could not do it  there are nations who never see the ocean nor have anything to do with it they have not even a name for it  they are to be pitied for many things but for nothing more than this     the sick pike   there is no reason why a pike should not be sick everything that has life is subject to illness but it is very seldom that any fish has the good sense and the good fortune of the pike that i am going to tell you about  this pike was a goodsized fellow weighing about six pounds and he belonged to the earl of stamford who lived near durham england his story was read by dr warwick to the literary and philosophical society of liverpool i am particular about these authorities because this story is a little out of the common run  dr warwick was walking by a lake in the earls park and the pike was lying in the water near the shore probably asleep at any rate when it saw the doctor it made a sudden dart into deep water and dashed its head against a sunken post this accident seemed to give the fish great pain for it pitched and tossed about in the lake and finally rushed up to the surface and threw itself right out of the water on to the bank  the doctor now stooped to examine it and to his surprise the fish remained perfectly quiet in his hands he found that the skull was fractured and one eye was injured by the violence with which the fish had struck the post with a silver toothpick he had not his instruments with him the doctor arranged the broken portion of the pikes skull and when the operation was completed he placed the fish in the water for a minute or two the pike seemed satisfied but then it jumped out of the water on to the bank again the doctor put the fish back but it jumped out again and repeated this performance several times it seemed to know and how i am sure i have not the least idea that that man was a doctor and it did not intend to leave him until it had been properly treatedjust as if it was one of his best patients  the doctor began to see that something more was expected of him and so he called a gamekeeper to him and with his assistance he put a bandage around the pikes head  illustration  when this surgical operation had been completed the pike was put back into the water and this time it appeared perfectly satisfied and swam away  the next day as dr warwick was sitting by the lake the pike with the bandage around its head swam up and stuck its head out of the water near the doctors feet the good physician took up the fish examined the wound and finding that it was getting on very well replaced the bandage and put mr pike into the lake again  this was a very grateful pike after the excellent surgical treatment it received from dr warwick it became very fond of him and whenever he walked by the side of the lake it would swim along by him and although it was quite shy and gloomy when other people came to the waterside it was always glad to see the doctor and would come when he whistled and eat out of his hand  i suppose in the whole ocean and in all the rivers and lakes of the world there are not more than two or three fish as sensible and grateful as this pike in fact it was very well for dr warwick that there were no more such on the earl of stamfords estate a large practice in the lake must soon have made a poor man of him for i do not suppose that even that sensible pike would have paid a doctors bill if it had been presented to him     two kinds of blossoms  illustration   when the winter has entirely gone and there is not the slightest vestige left of snow or ice when the grass is beginning to be beautifully green and the crocuses and jonquils are thrusting their pretty heads up out of the ground when the sun is getting to be quite warm and the breezes very pleasant then is the time for blossoms  then it is especially the time for appleblossoms not that the peach and the pear and the cherry trees do not fill their branches with pink and white flowers and make as lovely a spring opening as any appletrees in the land oh no it is only because there are so many appletrees and so many appleorchards that the peaches and pears are a little overlooked in blossomtime  a sweet place is the appleorchard when the grass is green the trees are full of flowers the air full of fragrance and when every breeze brings down the most beautiful showers of flowery snow  and how beautiful and delicate is every individual flower we are so accustomed to looking at blossoms in the massat treesful and whole orchardsfulthat we are not apt to think that those great heaps of pink and loveliness are composed of little flowers each one perfect in itself  and not only is each blossom formed of the most beautiful white petals shaded with pink not only does each one of them possess a most pleasant and delicate perfume but every one of these little flowersevery one which comes to perfection i meanis but the precursor of an apple this one may be a golden pippin that one which looks just like it may be the forerunner of a belleflower while the little green speck at the bottom of this one may turn into a russet with his sober coat  the birds that are flying among the branches do not think much about the apples that are to come i reckon and neither do the early butterflies that flutter about looking very much like falling blossoms themselves and for that matter we ourselves need not think too much about the coming apple crop we ought sometimes to think of and enjoy beauty for its own sake without reference to what it may do in the future for our pockets and our stomachs  there are other kinds of blossoms than appleblossoms or those of any tree whatever there are little flowers which bloom as well or better in winter than in summer and which are not in fact flowers at all  these are iceblossoms  perhaps you have never seen any of them and i think it is very likely for they can only be formed and perceived by the means of suitable instruments and so here is a picture of some iceblossoms  illustration  these curious formations some of which appear like stars others like very simple blossoms while others are very complex and some of which take the form of fernleaves are caused to appear in the centre of a block of ice by means of concentrated rays of lights which are directed through the ice by means of mirrors and lenses sometimes they are observed by means of a magnifyingglass and in other experiments their images are thrown upon a white screen  illustration  we may consider these iceflowers as very beautiful and very wonderful but they are not a whit more so than our little blossoms of the appleorchard  the latter are more common and have to produce apples while the iceflowers are uncommon and of no possible use  that is the difference between them     about glass   glass is so common and so cheap that we never think of being grateful for it but if we had lived a few centuries ago when the richest people had only wooden shutters to their windows which of course had to be closed whenever it was cold or stormy making the house as dark as night and had then been placed in a house lighted by glass windows we would scarcely have found words to express our thankfulness it would have been like taking a man out of a dreary prison and setting him in the bright world of gods blessed sunshine after a time men made small windows of stones that were partly transparent and then they used skins prepared something like parchment and finally they used sashes similar to ours but in them they put oiled paper and when at last glass came into use it was so costly that very few were able to buy it and they had it taken out of the windows and stored carefully away when they went on a journey as people now store away pictures and silverplate  now when a boy wants a clear white glass vial for any purpose he can buy it for five cents and for a few pennies a little girl can buy a large box of colored beads that will make her a necklace to go several times around her neck and bracelets besides these her elder sister regards with contempt but there was a time when queens were proud to wear such the oldest article of glass manufacture in existence is a bead it has an inscription on it but the writing instead of being in letters is in tiny little pictures  here you see the bead and the funny little pictures on it the pictures mean this the good queen ramaka the loved of athor protectress of thebes this queen ramaka was the wife of a king who reigned in thebes more than three thousand years ago which is certainly a very long time for a little glass bead to remain unbroken the great city of thebes where it was made has been in ruins for hundreds of years no doubt this bead was part of a necklace that queen ramaka wore and esteemed as highly as ladies now value their rubies it was found in the ruins of thebes by an englishman  illustration  it may be thought that this bead contradicts what has been said about there being a time when glass was unknown and that time only a few centuries ago but it is a singular fact that a nation will perfectly understand some art or manufacture that seems absolutely necessary to mens comfort and convenience and yet this art in time will be completely lost and things that were in common use will pass as completely out of existence as if they had never been until in after ages some of them will be found among the ruins of cities and in old tombs in this way we have found out that ancient nations knew how to make a great many things that enabled them to live as comfortably and luxuriously as we do now but these things seem to have perished with the nations who used them and for centuries people lived comfortlessly without them until in comparatively modern times they have all been revived  glassmaking is one of these arts it was known in the early ages of the worlds history there are pictures that were painted on tombs two thousand years before christs birth which represent men blowing glass pretty much as it is done now while others are taking pots of it out of the furnaces in a melted state but in those days it was probably costly and not in common use but the rich had glass until the first century after christ when it disappeared and the art of making it was lost  illustration  the city of venice was founded in the fifth century and here we find that glassmaking had been revived you will see by this picture of a venetian bottle how well they succeeded in the manufacture of glass articles  venice soon became celebrated for this manufacture and was for a long time the only place where glass was made the manufacturers took great pains to keep their art a secret from other nations and so did the government because they were all growing rich from the money it brought into the city  in almost any part of the world to which you may chance to go you will find silica you may not know it by that name but it is that shining flinty substance you see in sand and rockcrystal it is found in a very great number of things besides these two but these are the most common  lime is also found everywherein earth in stones in vegetables and bones and hundreds of other substances  soda is a common article and is very easily produced by artificial means potash which has the same properties as soda exists in all ashes  now silica and lime and soda or potash when melted together form glass so you see that the materials for making this substance which adds so much to our comfort and pleasure are freely given to all countries and after venice had set the example other nations turned their attention to the study of glassmaking and soon found out this fact in spite of the secrecy of the venetians after a time the germans began to manufacture glass and then the bohemians the latter invented engraving on glass which art had also been known to the ancients and then been lost they also learned to color glass so brilliantly that bohemian glass became more fashionable than venetian and has been highly thought of down to the present day  on the next page we see an immense drinkingglass of german manufacture but this one was made many years after glassmaking was first started there  this great goblet which it takes several bottles of wine to fill was passed around at the end of a feast and every guest was expected to take a sip out of it this was a very social way of drinking but i think on the whole it is just as well that it has gone out of fashion  the old egyptians made glass bottles and so did the early romans and used them just as we do for a very great variety of things their winebottles were of glass sealed and labelled like ours we might suppose that having once had them people would never be without glass bottles but history tells a different story there evidently came a time when glass bottles vanished from the face of the earth for we read of wooden bottles and those of goatskin and leather but there is no mention of glass and men were satisfied with these clumsy contrivances because in process of time it had been forgotten that any other were ever made  illustration  hundreds of years rolled away and then behold glass bottles appeared again now there is such a demand for them that one country alonefrancemakes sixty thousand tons of bottles every year to make bottleglass oxide of iron and alumina is added to the silica lime and soda it seems scarcely possible that these few common substances melted over the fire and blown with the breath can be formed into a material as thin and gossamer almost as a spiders web and made to assume such a graceful shape as this jug  illustration  this is how glass bottles vases etc are made when the substances mentioned above are melted together properly a man dips a long hollow iron tube into a pot filled with the boiling liquid glass and takes up a little on the end of it this he passes quickly to another man who dips it once more and having twirled the tube around so as to lengthen the glass ball at the end gives it to a third man who places this glass ball in an earthen mould and blows into the other end of the tube and soon the shapeless mass of glass becomes a bottle but it is not quite finished for the bottom has to be completed and the neck to have the glass band put around it the bottom is finished by pressing it with a coneshaped instrument as soon as it comes out of the mould a thick glass thread is wound around the neck and if a name is to be put on fresh glass is added to the side and stamped with a seal  illustration  this is also the process of making the beautiful jug just mentioned except that three workmen are engaged at the same time on the three partsone blows the vase itself another the foot and the third the handle they are then fastened together and the top cut into the desired shape with shears for glass can be easily cut when in a soft state  you see how clearly and brightly and yet with what softness the windows of the room are reflected in that exquisite jug it was made only a few years ago  i will now show you an old venetian goblet but you will have to handle it very carefully or you will certainly break off one of the delicate leaves or snap the stem of that curious flower  such glasses as these were certainly never intended for use they were probably put upon the table as ornaments the bowl is a white glass cup with wavy lines of light blue the spiral stem is red and white and has projecting from it five leaves of yellow glass separated in the middle by another leaf of a deep blue color the large flower has six paleblue petals  illustration  and now we will look at some goblets intended for use they are of modern manufacture and are plain and simple but have a beauty of their own the righthand one is of a very graceful shape and the one in the middle is oddlooking and ingeniously made with rollers and all of them have a transparent clearness and are almost as thin as the fragile soapbubbles that children blow out of pipebowls they do not look unlike these and one can easily fancy that like them they will melt into air at a touch  illustration  because the ancients by some means discovered that the union of silica lime and soda made a perfectly transparent and hard substance it by no means follows that they knew how to make lookingglasses for this requires something behind the glass to throw back the image but vanity is not of modern invention and people having from the beginning of time had a desire to look at themselves they were not slow in providing the means  the first mirrors used were of polished metal and for ages nobody knew of anything better but there came a time when the idea entered the mind of man that glass lined with a sheet of metal will give back the image presented to it for these are the exact words of a writer who lived four centuries before christ and you may be sure that glassmakers took advantage of this suggestion if they had not already found out the fact for themselves so we know that the ancients did make glass mirrors it is matter of history that lookingglasses were made in the first century of the christian era but whether quicksilver was poured upon the back as it is now or whether some other metal was used we do not know  but these mirrors disappeared with the bottles and other glass articles and metal mirrors again became the fashion for fourteen hundred years we hear nothing of lookingglasses and then we find them in venice at the time that city had the monopoly of the glass trade metal mirrors were soon thrown aside for the images in them were very imperfect compared with the others  these venetian glasses were all small because at that time sheet glass was blown by the mouth of man like bottles vases etc and therefore it was impossible to make them large two hundred years afterward a frenchman discovered a method of making sheet glass by machinery which is called founding and by this process it can be made of any size  but even after the comparatively cheap process of founding came into use lookingglasses were very expensive and happy was the rich family that possessed one a french countess sold a farm to buy a mirror queens had theirs ornamented in the most costly manner here is a picture of one that belonged to a queen of france the frame of which is entirely composed of precious stones  illustration  i have told you how the venetians kept glassmaking a secret and how at last the germans learned it and then the french and their work came to be better liked than that of the venetians but these last still managed to keep the process of making mirrors a profound secret and the french were determined to get at the mystery several young glassmakers went from france to venice and applied to all the lookingglass makers of venice for situations as workmen that they might learn the art but all positively refused to receive them and kept their doors and windows tightly closed while they were at work that no one might see what they did the young frenchmen took advantage of this and climbed up on the roofs and cautiously made holes through which they could look and thus they learned the carefullykept secret and went back to france and commenced the manufacture of glass mirrors twenty years after a frenchman invented founding glass which gave france such a great advantage that the trade of venice in lookingglasses was ruined  you would be very much interested in watching this process of founding glass this is the way it is done as soon as the glass is melted to the proper consistency the furnaces are opened and the pots are lifted into the air by machinery and passed along a beam to an immense table of cast iron a signal is given and the brilliant transparent liquid glass falls out and spreads over the table at a second signal a roller is passed by machinery over the redhot glass and twenty men stand ready with long shovels to push the sheet of glass into an oven not very hot where it can slowly cool when taken out of the oven the glass is thick and not perfectly smooth and it has to be rubbed with sand imbedded in plaster of paris smoothed with emery and polished by rubbing it with a woollen cloth covered with red oxide of iron all of which is done by machinery  we know that cut glass is expensive and the reason is that cutting it is a slow process four wheels have to be used in succession iron sandstone wood and cork sand is thrown upon these wheels in such a way that the glass is finely and delicately cut but this is imitated in pressed glass which is blown in a mould inside of which the design is cut this is much cheaper than the cut glass  illustration  a higher art than cutting is engraving on glass by which the figures are brought out in relief distinguished artists are employed to draw the designs and then skilful engravers follow the lines with their delicate tools if you will examine carefully the engraving on this bohemian goblet you will see what a wonderful piece of workmanship it is  it seems almost a pity that so much time and labor skill and genius should be given to a thing so easily broken and yet we have seen that a good many glass articles have been preserved for centuries the engraving on the bohemian goblet is ingenious and curious and faithful in detail but the flowers on this modern french flagon are really more graceful and beautiful  illustration  about four hundred years ago there was found in a marble coffin in a tomb near rome a glass vase which is now famous throughout the world there is good reason for supposing it to have been made one hundred and thirtyeight years before christ consequently it is now about two thousand years old for many years this was in the barberini palace in rome and was called the barberini vase then it was bought by the duchess of portland of england for nine thousand dollars and since then has been known as the portland vase  she loaned it to the british museum and everybody who went to london wanted to see this celebrated vase  illustration  one day a crazy man got into the museum and with a smart blow of his cane laid in ruins the glass vase that had survived all the worlds great convulsions and changes for two thousand years this misfortune was supposed to be irreparable but it has been repaired by an artist so cleverly that it is impossible to tell where it is joined together  illustration  this vase is composed of two layers of glass one over the other the lower is of a deep blue color and the upper an opaque white so that the figures stand out in white on a deep blue background  illustration  the picture on it represents the marriage of peleus and thetis the woman seated holding a serpent in her left hand is thetis and the man to whom she is giving her right hand is peleus the god in front of thetis is neptune and a cupid hovers in the air above on the reverse side are thetis and peleus and a goddess all seated at the foot of the vase is a bust of ganymede and on each side of this in the picture are copies of the masks on the handles  now i have shown you a few of the beautiful things that have been made of glass but there are very many other uses to which glass is applied that have not even been alluded to steam engines that work like real ones have been made of glass palaces have been built of it great telescopes by which the wonders of the heavens have been revealed owe their power to it and in fact it would seem to us today as if we could as well do without our iron as without our glass     carl   in the middle of a dark and gloomy forest lived carl and greta their father was a forester who when he was well was accustomed to be away all day with his gun and dogs leaving the two children with no one but old nurse heine for their mother died when they were very little now carl was twelve years old and greta nine carl was a finelooking boy but nurse heine said that he had a melancholy countenance greta however was a pretty brightfaced merry little girl they were allowed to wander through a certain part of the forest where their father thought there was no especial danger to fear  in truth carl was not melancholy at all but was just as happy in his way as greta was in hers in the summer while she was pulling the wood flowers and weaving them into garlands or playing with her dogs or chasing squirrels carl would be seated on some root or stone with a large sheet of coarse cardboard on his knee on which he drew pictures with a piece of sharpened charcoal he had sketched in his rough way every pretty mass of foliage and every picturesque rock and waterfall within his range and in the winter when the icicles were hanging from the cliffs and the snow wound white arms around the dark green cypress boughs carl still found beautiful pictures everywhere and greta plenty of play in building snowhouses and statues and moreover carl had lately discovered in the brooks some colored stones which were soft enough to sharpen sufficiently to give a blue tint to his skies and green to his trees and thus he made pictures that nurse heine said were more wonderful than those in the chapel of the little village of evergode  i have said that the forest was dark and gloomy because it was composed chiefly of pines and cypresses but it never seemed so to the children they knew how to read but had no books that told them of any lands brighter and sunnier than their own and then too beyond the belt of pines in which was their home there was a long stretch of forest of oaks and beeches and in this the birds liked to build their nests and sing and there were such splendid vines and lovely flowers and right through the pine forest not more than half a mile from their cottage there was a broad road it is true it was a very rough one and but little used but it represented the world to carl and greta for it did sometimes happen that loaded wagons would jolt over it or a rough soldier gallop along and more rarely still a gay cavalier would prance by the wondering children  for there was a war in the land and when after a time the armies came near enough to the forest for the children to hear occasionally the roll of the heavy guns a strange thing happened  one evening when they arrived at home they found in their humble little cottage one of the gaylooking cavaliers they had sometimes seen on the forest road and with him was a very beautiful lady old nurse heine was getting the spare room ready by beating up the great feather bed and laying down on the floor the few strips of carpet they possessed their father was talking with the strangers and he told them that carl and greta were his children but they took no notice of them for they were completely taken up with each other for the gentleman it appeared was going away and to leave the lady there carl greatly admired this cavalier and had no doubt he was the noblestlooking man in the world and studied him so closely that he would have known him among a thousand presently the forester led his children out of the cottage and soon after the cavalier came out and springing upon his horse galloped away among the dark pines  illustration  the strange lady was at the cottage several weeks and the children soon learned to love her dearly she was fond of rambling about with them and was seldom to be found within the house when the weather was fair she never went near the road but preferred the oak wood and sometimes when the children were amusing themselves she would sit for hours absorbed in deep thought or singing to herself in a sad and dreamy way  at other times she would interest herself in the children and tell them of things in the world outside the forest she praised carls pictures and showed him how to work in his colors so as to more effectively bring out the perspective and tried to educate his taste as far as she could by describing the pictures of the great masters she often said afterwards that she could never have lived through those dark days but for the comfort she found in the children  carl saw that she was sorrowful and he understood that her sadness was not because of the plain fare and the way of living at the foresters cottage which he knew must seem rough indeed to her but because of some great grief what this grief was he could not guess for the children had been told nothing about the beautiful lady except that her name was lady clarice she never complained but the boys wistful eyes would follow her as she moved among the trees and his heart would swell with pity and how he would long to do something to prove to her how he loved her  the forester told carl that the cavalier was with the army but he did not come to the cottage and there was no way for the lady clarice to hear from him and she shuddered at the sound of the great guns and finally she fell sick nurse heine did what she could for her but the lady grew worse she felt that she should die and it almost broke carls heart to hear her moaning oh if i could but see him once more he knew she meant the noble cavalier but how should he get word to him the old forester was just then stiff with rheumatism and could scarcely move from his chair  i will go myself said carl to himself one day or she will die with grief  without saying a word to anybody about the matter for fear that he would not be allowed to go he stole out of the house in the gray of the morning while all were asleep and making his way to the open road he turned in the direction from whence at times had come the sound of the cannon as long as he was in the part of the road that he knew he kept up a stout heart but when he left that he began to grow frightened the road was so lonely and strange sounds seemed to come out of the forest that stretched away so black and thick on each side he wondered if any fierce beasts were there or if robbers were lurking behind the rocks but he thought of the beautiful lady his kind friend sick and dying and that thought was more powerful than his fear at noon he rested for awhile and ate a few dry biscuits he had put in his pockets  it was near sunset when he saw that the trees stood less closely together the road looked more travelworn and there came with the wind a confused and continuous noise then carl was seized with terror i am now near the camp he thought suppose a battle is going on and i am struck with a ball i shall die and father and little greta will not know what became of me and the beautiful lady will never know that i died in her service or if i meet a soldier and he dont believe my story maybe hell run a bayonet through me  it was not too late then to turn back and flee swiftly up the forest road and carl paused  but in a few moments he went on animated by the noblest kind of couragethat which feels there is danger but is determined to face it in the cause of duty affection and humanity  at last he stepped out of the forest and there before him was spread out the vast encampment of the army there was not time to wonder at the sight before he was challenged by a sentinel carl had made up his mind what to say and that he would not mention the lady so he promptly replied that he wanted to see a noble lord who had a sick friend at a cottage in the forest  as the boy could not tell the name or rank of the noble lord the sentinel sent him to an officer and to him carl told the same story but he described the man of whom he was in search so accurately that the officer sent him at once to the proper person and carl found that he was a very great personage indeed and held a high command in the army he did not recognize carl but as soon as the boy told his errand he became very much agitated  i will go at once he said but i cannot leave you here my brave boy can you ride  now carl knew how to sit on a horse and how to hold the bridle for he had ridden the woodcutters horses sometimes so he answered that he thought he could ride the duke for such was his title ordered some refreshments set before the boy and then went out to make his arrangements choosing his gentlest horse for carl  in half an hour they were in the forest speeding like the wind carl felt as if he was flying the horse chose his own gait and tried to keep up with the one that the duke was riding but finally finding this impossible he slackened his pace greatly to carls relief but the duke was too anxious about his lady to accommodate himself to the slower speed of the boy and soon swept out of sight around a bend in the road his cloak and the long feathers of his hat streamed on the night wind for a moment longer then they vanished and carl was alone  carl was somewhat afraid of the horse for he was not used to such a highmettled steed but on the whole he was glad he was mounted on it for if the woods had seemed lonely in the daylight they were ten times more so in the night and the noises seemed more fearful than before and carl thought if any furious beast or robber should dart upon him he could make the horse carry him swiftly away as it was he let the horse do as he pleased and as carl sat quietly and did not worry him in any way he pleased to go along very smoothly and rather slowly so it was past midnight when they reached home  illustration  carl found that the duke had been there a long time that the lady was overjoyed to see him and nurse heine said she began to grow better from that moment  the next morning the duke went away but before he left he thanked carl for the great service he had done him and gave him a piece of gold but carl was better pleased when the lady called him into her room and kissed him and cried over him and praised him for a kind brave boy and said he had saved her life  and when she got well carl noticed that she was brighter and happier than she had been before  in a short time however she went away with the duke in a grand coach with servants and outriders and carl and greta watched them as they were whirled up the forest road and then walked home through the pines with sad hearts  then the forester told his children that the duke had married this lady secretly against the kings command and he had so many bitter and cruel enemies that he was afraid they would do her some evil while he was away in the war she knew of the forester because his wife had been a maid of her mothers so she came to this lonely place for safety but now the king was pleased and it was all right  the winter came and went the war was over and then lady clarice whom the children never expected to see again sent for them and the forester and nurse heine to her castle she provided for them all and greta grew up into a pretty and wellbred young lady  lady clarice had not forgotten the brave act of the boy and also remembered what he liked best in the world so she had him taught to draw and paint and in process of time he became a great artist and all the world knew of his name and fame     schools out  illustration   what a welcome and joyful sound in the winter when the days are short and the sun near the end of the six school hours sinks so low that the light in the room grows dim and gray with what impatience my dear child do you wait for this signal but it is in the long summer days that you find school most tiresome the air in the room is hot and drowsy and outside you can see there is a breeze blowing for the trees are gently tossing their green boughs as if to twit you with having to work out sums in such glorious weather and there come to your ears the pleasant sounds of the buzzing of insects and twittering of birds and the brook splashing over the stones then the four walls of the schoolroom look very dreary and the maps glare at you and the blackboards frown darkly and the benches seem very hard and the inkbespattered desks appear more grimy than ever  this was the time when the heart of the dominie would be touched with pity and he would say in his bright way now children i am going to read you something  instantly the halfclosed eyes would open the drooping heads would be raised the vacant faces would brighten and the little cramped legs would be stretched out with a sigh of relief and then the dominie would read them something that was not only instructive but very entertaining sometimes instead of reading to them he would set them to declaiming or reciting poetry or they would choose sides and have a spelling match they would get so interested that they would forget all about the birds and sunshine without they did not even know that they were learning all this time  for the dominie had all sorts of pleasant ways of teaching his scholars not but what they had to work hard too for nobody can accomplish anything worth having without putting a good deal of hard work in it  you see the dominies portrait in the picture the fringe of hair around his bald head was as white as snow his black eyes were bright and merry and he had a kindly face his name was morris harvey but everybody called him dominie and he liked that name best all the village people respected and loved the old man and every child in the village school that he taught from the largest boy whose legs were so long that he did not know what to do with them down to bessie gay who could scarcely reach up to the top of a desk were very fond indeed of him  but even under the dominies kindly rule schools out was always a welcome sound what a noise there would be in the schoolroom for a minute and then such a grand rush out into the open air and such merry shouts the dominie would look after them with a smile he wanted them to study but he was glad that it was natural for them to love to play  if little charlie lane had known this he would not have had such a cry the morning he went to school for the first time he thought his mother very cruel to make him go and i am sorry to say not only cried before he started but all the way to the schoolhouse the dominie took no notice of this and charlie soon found that school was not such a very dreadful place and there was the nice playtime in the middle of the day and when school was out the dominie took him on his knee and gave him a big apple and showed him a book full of bright pictures and told him a story about every one of them  you can see the little fellow on the dominies lap looking earnestly at a picture in the book and the old man is pleased that the child is pleased the dominie is sitting in his big chair and his dinnerbag is hanging on the back of it on the blackboard over his head you see little charlies lesson for that day it is on the right and consists of the letters a b c which the child has been staring at until he knows them perfectly in any book that is given to him on the left is a sum and somebody has tried to draw an almanac sun on the lower part of the board across the top the dominie has written a copy you can read it plainly it was a favorite saying of his and a very good one too  have we not all of us a great deal to make us happy what pleasure is it to you to go about with a cross or melancholy face try to think of something pleasant and call up a smile put the illnatured feelings out of your heart and then the brightness will come to your face without further trouble if you have a hard task to do being cross wont help you along one bit go to work at it with a will and you will be surprised to find how soon it will be done then with a clear conscience and a glad heart you can sit waiting for the welcome sound schools out     nestbuilders   birds in their little nests agree but they do not at all agree in their manner of building the said nests  they have all sorts of ideas on this subject nearly every species of bird has a nest peculiar to itself and the variety is astonishing there are nests like cups and nests like saucers nests which are firmly fixed among the solid rocks and nests which wave about on the ends of slender branches nests which are perched on the very tops of the tallest trees and nests which are hidden in the ground there are great nests which will hold a bushel or two of eggs and little bits of things into which you could scarcely put half a dozen peas  in mentioning some of these nests it will be needless for us to say much of those with which we are all familiar in our rambles together we must try and see as many novelties as possible for we may not always have the chance of wandering freely into any part of the world to which our fancy may lead us i remember a little girl who used to come to our house when i was a boy and who never cared for anything at table that was not something of a novelty to her when offered potatoes she would frankly say no thank you i can get them at home  so we will not meddle with hens nests robins nests and all the nests big and little that we find about our homes for they are the potatoes of a subject like this but will try and find some nests that are a little out of the way and curious  but we must stopjust one momentbefore we leave home and look at a wrens nest  the wren although a very common little bird with us does not build a common nest she makes it round like a ball or a woolly orange with a little hole at one side for a door inside it is just as soft and comfortable as anything can be being such a little bird herself she could not cover and protect her young ones from cold and danger so well as the larger catbirds and robins and her nest is contrived so that there will not be much covering to do  illustration  that beautiful bird the baltimore oriole which may be familiar to some of you makes its nest somewhat on the plan of the wren the similarity consisting in the fact that the structure is intended to shelter both parent and young the oriole which is a great deal larger than a wren builds a much larger nest forming it like a bag with a hole in one end and hangs it on the branch of a tree  illustration  it is scarcely possible for any harm to come to the young orioles when they are lying snugly at the bottom of the deep nest and their mother is sitting on a twig near by ready to protect them at the hazard of her life  but for all the apparent security of this nest so deep so warm so firmly secured to the twigs and branches the little orioles are not entirely safe their mother may protect them from rain and cold from winged enemies and creeping serpents but she cannot defend them against the attacks of boys and men an orioles nest is such a curious structure and the birds are known to be of such fine form and gorgeous plumage that many boys cannot resist the temptation of climbing up after them and if there are young ones within of carrying the whole affair away in order to try and raise the young birds sometimes the nest is put in a cage where the old bird can come and feed its young and in other cases the captor undertakes to do the feeding himself i have seen experiments of this kind tried but never knew the slightest success to follow them and the attempt generally useless is always cruel  but we must positively get away from home and look at some nests to which few or none of us are accustomed  there for instance is the nest of the burrowingowl a native of south america and the regions west of the rocky mountains this little bird much smaller than our common owls likes to live in the ground but not having been provided by nature with digging appendages he cannot make a hole or burrow for himself and so he takes up his abode in the underground holes made by the little prairiedogs for their own homes it is not at all certain that these owls should be called usurpers or thieves they may in some cases get entire possession of the holes but very often they live very sociably with the prairiedogs and may for all we know pay for their lodgings by bringing in grain and seeds along with the worms and insects which they reserve for their own table any one who does not possess a habitation of his own must occasionally expect to be thrown among strange companions and this very often happens to the burrowingowl travellers tell us that not only do the prairiedogs and owls live together in these burrows but that great rattlesnakes sometimes take up their residence thereinall three families seeming to live together in peace and unity i think that it is probable however that the little dogs and owls are not at all pleased with the company of the snakes a prairiedog will not eat an owl and without the dog is very young indeed an owl will not eat him but a great snake would just as soon swallow either of them as not if he happened to be hungry which fortunately is not often the case for a good meal lasts a snake a long time but the owls and the prairiedogs have no way of ridding themselves of their unwelcome roommates and like human beings they are obliged to patiently endure the ills they cannot banish perhaps like human beings again they become so accustomed to these ills that they forget how disagreeable they are  illustration  there is a birdand it is a flamingowhich builds a nest which looks to me as if it must be very unpleasant to sit upon and yet it suits the bird very well in fact on any other kind of a nest the flamingo might not know what to do with its legs  illustration  it would appear as if there had been a waste of material in making such a large high nest when only two or three moderatesized eggs are placed in the slight depression at the top but when we consider that the flamingo uses this tall affair as a seat as well as a nest we can easily understand that flamingoes like most other birds understand how to adapt their nests to their own convenience and peculiarities sitting astraddle on one of these tall nests which look something like peachbaskets turned upside down with her head stuck as far under her wing as she can get it the flamingo dozes away during the long sultry hours of day as comfortably and happily as if she was a little wren snugly curled up inside of its cosey nest it is not mere situation which makes us happy some people enjoy life in cottages others in palaces and some birds sit in a pile of hard sticks and think themselves quite as cosey as those which repose upon the softest down  it is almost impossible to comprehend the different fancies of birds in regard to their nests for instance why should any bird want to sail about in its nest yet there is onecalled the little grebewhich builds a watertight nest in which she lays her eggs and while she is hatching them she paddles herself around on the water  it seems to me that these birds must have a very pleasant time during the setting season to start out some fine morning after it has had its breakfast of bugs and things to gently push its nest from shore to jump on board to sit down comfortably on the eggs and sticking out its webfooted legs on each side to paddle away among the waterlilies and the beautiful green rushes in company with other little grebes all uniting business and pleasure in the same way must be indeed quite charming to an appreciative duck  illustration  if it were to happen to storm however when the grebe was at a distance from shore her little craft might be upset and her cargo of eggs go to the bottom but i expect the grebes are very good sailors and know when to look for bad weather  a nest full of young grebes just hatched with the mother swimming behind pushing them along with her beak or towing them by the loose end of a twig must be a very singular and interesting sight  illustration  an ostrich has very different views in regard to a nest from a little grebe instead of wishing to take its nest about with it wherever it goes the ostrich does not care for a great deal of nestwork  it is however a bird of more domestic habits than some writers would have us believe for although it does cover up its eggs in the sand and then let the sun help hatch them it is not altogether inattentive to its nest the ostrich makes a large nest in the sand where it is said the eggs of several families are deposited these eggs are very carefully arranged in the great hole or basin that has been formed in the soft sand and during the daytime they are often covered up and left to be gently heated by the rays of the sun but the ostrich sits upon her nest at night and in many cases the male bird has been known to sit upon the eggs all day an ostrich nest is a sort of a wholesale establishment there are not only a great many eggs in the nest but dozens of them are often found lying about on the sand around it  this apparent waste is explained by some naturalists by the statement that these scattered eggs are intended for the food of the young ones when they are hatched this may be true but in that case young ostriches cannot be very particular about the flavor of the eggs they eat a few days in the hot sun of the desert would be very likely to make eggs of any kind taste rather strongly but ostrich eggs are so large and their shells are so thick that they may keep better than the eggs to which we are accustomed  from nests which are built flat on the ground let us now go to some that are placed as high from the earth as their builders can get them the nests of the storks are of this kind  a pair of storks will select as a site for their nest a lofty place among the rocks the top of some old ruins or when domesticated as they often are the top of a chimney but when there are a number of storks living together in a community they very often settle in a grove of tall trees and build their nests on the highest branches  illustration the nest of a stork  in these they lay their eggs and hatch out their young ones soon after the time when these young storks are able to fly the whole community generally starts off on its winter pilgrimage to warm countries but the old storks always return in the spring to the same nest that they left while the young ones if they choose to join that community at all must make nests for themselves although these nests are nothing but rude structures of sticks and twigs made apparently in the roughest manner each pair of storks evidently thinks that there is no home like its own  the stork is a very kind parent and is in fact more careful of the welfare of its young than most birds but it never goes to the length of surrendering its homestead to its children  the young storks will be carefully nurtured and reared by their parents when they grow old enough they will be taught to fly and encouraged in the most earnest way to strengthen and develop their wings by exercise and in the annual expedition to the south they are not left to themselves but are conducted to the happy lands where all good storks spend their winters but the young storks cannot have everything if they wish to live in the nest in which they were born they must wait until their parents are dead  it may be that we have now seen enough of birds nests and so i will not show you any more  the next nest which we will examine  but i thought you were not going to show us any more birds nests you will say  that is true i did say so and this next one is not a birds nest but a fishs nest  it is probably that very few of you if any ever saw a fishs nest but there certainly are such things  illustration  the fish which builds them is called the stickleback it is a little fish but it knows how to make a good nest the male stickleback is the builder and when he thinks of making a nest he commences by burrowing a hole in the mud at the bottom of the stream where he lives when with his nose and body he has made this hole large enough he collects bits of grass roots and weeds and builds his nest over this hole which seems to be dug for the purpose of giving security to the structure the grass and other materials are fastened to the mud and earth by means of a sticky substance which exudes from the body of the fish and every part of the nest is stuck together and interlaced so that it will not be disturbed by the currents there are generally two openings to this nest which is something like a ladys muff although of course it is by no means so smooth and regular the fish can generally stick its head out of one end and its tail out of the other  when the eggs have been laid in the nest and the young sticklebacks have been born the male fish is said to be very strict and particular in the government of his children for some timewhile they are yet very smalland the father himself is a very little fellow he makes them stay in the nest and if any of them come swimming out he drives them back again and forces them to stay at home until they are of a proper age to swim about by themselves  we have now seen quite a variety of nests and i think that we may come to this conclusion about their buildersthe bird or other creature which can carefully select the materials for the home of its young can decide what is most suitable for the rough outside and what will be soft and nice for the inner lining and can choose a position for its nest where the peculiar wants and habits of its little ones can be best provided for must certainly be credited with a degree of intelligence which is something more than what is generally suggested by the term instinct  illustration     the boomerang   civilized folks are superior in so very many respects to their barbarous brethren that it is well when we discover anything which a savage can do better than we can to make a note of it and give the subject some attention  and it is certain that there are savages who can surpass us in one particularthey can make and throw boomerangs  it is very possible that an american mechanic could imitate an australian boomerang so that few persons could tell the difference but i do not believe that boomerang would work properly either in the quality of the wood or in the seasoning or in some particular which we would not be apt to notice it would in all probability differ very much from the weapon carved out by the savage if the american mechanic was to throw his boomerang away from him i think it would stay away there is no reason to believe that it would ever come back  and yet there is nothing at all wonderful in the appearance of the real boomerang it is simply a bent club about two feet long smooth on one side and slightly hollowed out on the other no one would imagine merely from looking at it that it could behave in any way differently from any other piece of stick of its size and weight  but it does behave differently at least when an australian savage throws it i have never heard of an american or european who was able to make the boomerang perform the tricks for which it has become famous throwing this weapon is like pianoplaying you have to be brought up to it in order to do it well  in the hands of the natives of australia however the boomerang performs most wonderful feats sometimes the savage takes hold of it by one end and gives it a sort of careless jerk so that it falls on the ground at a short distance from him as soon as it strikes the earth it bounds up into the air turns twists and pitches about in every direction knocking with great force against everything in its way it is said that when it bounds in this way into the midst of a flock of birds it kills and wounds great numbers of them at other times the boomerangthrower will hurl his weapon at an object at a great distance and when it has struck the mark it will turn and fall at the feet of its owner turning and twisting on its swift and crooked way this little engraving shows how the boomerang will go around a tree and return again to the thrower the twisted line indicates its course  most astonishing stories are told of the skill with which the australians use this weapon they will aim at birds or small animals that are hidden behind trees and rocks and the boomerang will go around the trees and rocks and kill the game they are the only people who can with any certainty shoot around a corner not only do they throw the boomerang with unerring accuracy but with tremendous force and when it hits a man on the head giving him two or three terrible raps as it twists about him it is very apt to kill him to ward off these dangerous blows the natives generally carry shields when they go out to fight sometimes an australian throws two boomerangs at once one with his right hand and one with his left and then the unfortunate man that he aims at has a hard time of it  many persons have endeavored to explain the peculiar turning and twisting properties of the boomerang but they have not been entirely successful for so much depends not only on the form of the weapon but on the skill of the thrower but it is known that the form of the boomerang and the fact that one of its limbs is longer and heavier than the other gives its centre of gravity a very peculiar situation and when the weapon is thrown by one end it has naturally a tendency to rotate and the manner of this rotation is determined by the peculiar impetus given it by the hand of the man who throws it  it is well that we are able to explain the boomerang a little for that is all we can do with it the savage cannot explain it at all but he can use it  but after all i do not know that a boomerang would be of much service to us even if we could use it there is only one thing that i can now think of that it would be good for it would be a splendid to knock down chestnuts with  just think of a boomerang going twirling into a chestnuttree twisting turning banging and cracking on every side knocking down the chestnuts in a perfect shower and then coming gently back into your hand all ready for another throw  it would be well worth while to go out chestnuting if we had a boomerang to do the work for us                                       now our ramblings must come to an end we cannot walk about the world for ever you know no matter how pleasant it may be  and i wish i was quite sure that you have all found these wanderings pleasant  as for me there were some things that i did not like so well as others and i suppose that that was the case with all of you  but it could not be helped in this world some things will be better than others do what we may  one of these days perhaps we may ramble about again until then goodby   the end     charles scribners sons books for young readers                                       written and illustrated by howard pyle  a new book just
