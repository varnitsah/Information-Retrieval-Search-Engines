48645227	gascoyne the sandalwood trader by rm ballantyne   an exciting story set in the pacific  is gascoyne a pirate or isnt he  quite a gripping tale and well worth reading   gascoyne the sandalwood trader by rm ballantyne    chapter one  the schooner  the great pacific is the scene of our story  on a beautiful morning many years ago a little schooner might have been seen floating light and graceful as a seamew on the breast of the slumbering ocean  she was one of those low blackhulled vessels with raking taper masts trimly cut sails and elegant form which we are accustomed to associate with the idea of a yacht or a pirate  she might have been the former as far as appearance went for the sails and decks were white as snow and every portion of brass and copper above her waterline shone in the hot sun with dazzling brilliancy  but pleasureseekers were not wont in those days to take such distant flights or to venture into such dangerous seasdangerous alike from the savage character of the islanders and the numerous coralreefs that lie hidden a few feet below the surface of the waves  still less probable did it seem that the vessel in question could belong to the lawless class of craft to which we have referred for although she had what may be styled a wicked aspect and was evidently adapted for swift sailing neither large guns nor small arms of any kind were visible  whatever her nature or her object she was reduced at the time we introduce her to the reader to a state of inaction by the dead calm which prevailed  the sea resembled a sheet of clear glass  not a cloud broke the softness of the sky in which the sun glowed hotter and hotter as it rose towards the zenith  the sails of the schooner hung idly from the yards her reflected image was distorted but scarcely broken by the long gentle swell her crew with the exception of the watch were asleep either on deck or down below and so deep was the universal silence that as the vessel rose and fell with a slow quiet motion the pattering of the reef points on her sails forcibly attracted the listeners attention as does the ticking of a clock in the deep silence of night  a few seabirds rested on the water as if in the enjoyment of the profound peace that reigned around and far away on the horizon might be seen the tops of the palmtrees that grew on one of those coral islands which lie scattered in thousands like beautiful gems on the surface of that bright blue sea  among the men who lay sleeping in various easy offhand attitudes on the schooners deck was one who merits special attentionnot only because of the grotesque appearance of his person but also because he is one of the principal actors in our tale  he was a large powerful man of that rugged build and hairy aspect that might have suggested the idea that he would be difficult to kill  he was a fair man with red hair and a deeply sunburned face on which jovial goodhumour sat almost perpetually enthroned  at the moment when we introduce him to the reader however that expression happened to be modified in consequence of his having laid him down to sleep in a sprawling manner on his backthe place as well as the position being apparently one of studied discomfort  his legs lay over the heel of the bowsprit his big body reposed on a confused heap of blocks and cordage and his neck rested on the stock of an anchor so that his head hung down over it presenting the face to view with the large mouth wide open in an upside down position  the man was evidently on the verge of choking but being a strong man and a rugged man and a healthy man he did not care  he seemed to prefer choking to the trouble of rousing himself and improving his position  how long he would have lain in this state of felicity it is impossible to say for his slumbers were rudely interrupted by a slight lurch of the schooner which caused the blocks and cordage attached to the sheet of the jib to sweep slowly but with rasping asperity across his face any ordinary man would have been seriously damagedat least in appearanceby such an accident but this particular seadog was tough in the skinhe was only awakened by itnothing more  he yawned raised himself lazily and gazed round with that vacant stare of unreasonable surprise which is common to man on passing from a state of somnolence to that of wakefulness  gradually the expression of habitual goodhumour settled on his visage as he looked from one to another of his sleeping comrades and at last with a bland smile he broke forth into the following soliloquy  wot a goose wot a grampus youve bin john bumpus firstly for goin to sea secondly for remainin at sea thirdly for not forsakin the sea fourthly for bein worried about it at all now that youve made up your mind to retire from the sea and fifthly  here john bumpus paused as if to meditate on the full depth and meaning of these polite remarks or to invent some new and powerful expression wherewith to deliver his fifth head  his mental efforts seemed to fail however for instead of concluding the sentence he hummed the following lines which we may suppose were expressive of his feelings as well as his intentions    so goodbye to the mighty ocean   and adoo to the rollin sea   for its nobody has no notion   wot a grief it has bin to me  ease off the sheets and square the topsail yards was at that moment said or rather murmured by a bass voice so deep and rich that although scarcely raised above a whisper it was distinctly heard over the whole deck  john bumpus raised his bulky form with a degree of lithe activity that proved him to be not less agile than athletic and with several others sprang to obey the order  a few seconds later the sails were swelled out by a light breeze and the schooner moved through the water at a rate which seemed scarcely possible under the influence of so gentle a puff of air  presently the breeze increased the vessel cut through the blue water like a knife leaving a long track of foam in her wake as she headed for the coralisland before referred to  the outer reef or barrier of coral which guarded the island was soon reached  the narrow opening in this natural bulwark was passed  the schooner stood across the belt of perfectly still water that lay between the reef and the shore and entered a small bay where the calm water reflected the strip of white sand green palms and tropical plants that skirted its margin as well as the purple hills of the interior  here she swept round in a sudden but graceful curve until all her canvas fluttered in the breeze and then dropt anchor in about six fathoms water    chapter two  bumpus is fiery and philosophicalmurderous designs frustrated  the captain of the schooner whose deep voice had so suddenly terminated the meditations of john bumpus was one of those men who seem to have been formed for the special purpose of leading and commanding their fellows  he was not only unusually tall and powerfulphysical qualities which in themselves are by no means sufficient to command respectbut as we have said he possessed a deep fulltoned bass voice in which there seemed to lie a species of fascination for its softest tones riveted attention and when it thundered forth commands in the fiercest storms it inspired confidence and a feeling of security in all who heard it the countenance of the captain however was that which induced men to accord to him a position of superiority in whatever sphere of action he chanced to move  it was not so much a handsome as a manly and singularly grave face in every line of which was written inflexible determination  his hair was short black and curly  a small moustache darkened his upper lip but the rest of his face was closely shaven so that his large chin and iron jaw were fully displayed  his eyes were of that indescribable blue colour which can exhibit the intensest passion or the most melting tenderness  he wore a sombre but somewhat picturesque costumea darkcoloured flannel shirt and trousers which latter were gathered in close round his lower limbs by a species of drab gaiter that appeared somewhat incongruous with the profession of the man  the only bit of bright colour about him was a scarlet belt round his waist from the side of which depended a long knife in a brown leather sheath  a pair of light shoes and a small round cap resembling what is styled in these days a porkpie completed his costume  he was about forty years of age  such was the commander or captain or skipper of this suspiciouslooking schoonera man preeminently fitted for the accomplishment of much good or the perpetration of great evil  as soon as the anchor touched the ground the captain ordered a small boat to be lowered and leaping into it with two men one of whom was our friend john bumpus rowed towards the shore  have you brought your kit with you john inquired the captain as the little boat shot over the smooth waters of the bay  wots of it sir replied our rugged seaman holding up a small bundle tied in a red cotton handkerchief  i spose our cruise ashore wont be a long one  it will be long for you my man at least as far as the schooner is concerned for i do not mean to take you aboard again  not take me aboard agin exclaimed the sailor with a look of surprise which quickly degenerated into an angry frown and thereafter gradually relaxed into a broad grin as he continuedwhy capting wot do you mean to do with me then for im a heavy piece of goods dye see and cant be easily moved about without a small touch o my own consent you know  jo bumpus as he was fond of styling himself said this with a seriocomic air of sarcasm for he was an exception to the general rule of his fellows  he had little respect for and no fear of his commander  indeed to say truth for truth must be told even though the character of our rugged friend should suffer jo entertained a most profound belief in the immense advantage of muscular strength and vigour in general and of his own prowess in particular  although not quite so gigantic a man as his captain he was nearly so and being a bold selfreliant fellow he felt persuaded in his own mind that he could thrash him if need were  in fact jo was convinced that there was no living creature under the sun human or otherwise that walked upon two legs that he could not pommel to death with more or less ease by means of his fists alone  and in this conviction he was not far wrong  yet it must not be supposed that jo bumpus was a boastful man or a bully far from it  he was so thoroughly persuaded of his invincibility that he felt there was no occasion to prove it  he therefore followed the natural bent of his inclinations which led him at all times to exhibit a mild amiable and gentle aspectexcept of course when he was roused  as occasion for being roused was not wanting in the south seas in those days jos amiability was frequently put to the test  he sojourned while there in a condition of alternate calm and storm but riotous joviality ran like a rich vein through all his chequered life and lit up its most sombre phases like gleams of light on an april day  you entered my service with your own consent replied the captain to jos last remark and you may leave it with the same consent whenever you choose but you will please to remember that i did not engage you to serve on board the schooner  back there you do not go either with or without your consent my fine fellow and if you are bent on going to sea on your own accountyouve got a pair of good arms and legsyou can swim  besides continued the captain dropping the tone of sarcasm in which this was said and assuming a more careless and goodnatured air you were singing something not long since if i mistake not about farewell to the rolling sea which leads me to think you will not object to a short cruise on shore for a change especially on such a beautiful island as this is  im your man capting cried the impulsive seaman at the same time giving his oar a pull that wellnigh spun the boat round  and to say wots the plain truth dye see im not sorry to ha done with your schooner for although she is as tight a little craft as any man could wish for to go to sea in i cant say much for the crewsaving your presence dickhe added glancing over his shoulder at the surlylooking man who pulled the bow oar of all the rascally set i ever clapped eyes on they seems to me the worst  if i didnt know you for a sandalwood trader i do believe id take ye for a pirate  dont speak ill of your messmates behind their backs jo said the captain with a slight frown  no good and true man ever does that  no more i do replied john bumpus while a deep red colour suffused his bronzed countenance  no more i do leastwise if they wos here id say it to their faces for theyre a set of as illtongued villains as i ever had the misfortune to  silence exclaimed the captain suddenly in a voice of thunder  few men would have ventured to disobey the command given by such a man but john bumpus was one of those few  he did indeed remain silent for two seconds but it was the silence of astonishment  capting said he seriously i dont mean no offence but id have you to know that i engaged to work for you not to hold my tongue at your bidding dye see  there aint the man living asll make jo bumpus shut up wen hes got a mind to  the captain put an abrupt end to the remarks of his refractory seaman by starting up suddenly in fierce anger and seizing the tiller apparently with the intent to fell him  he checked himself however as suddenly and breaking into a loud laugh criedcome jo you must admit that there is at least one living man who has made you shut up before you had finished what youd got to say  john bumpus who had thrown up his left arm to ward off the anticipated blow and dropped his oar in order to clench his right fist quietly resumed his oar and shook his head gravely for nearly a minute after which he made the following observation  capting ive seed in my experience o life that there are some constitootions as dont agree with jokin an yours is one on em now if youd take the advice of a plain man youd never try it on youre a grave man by natur and youre so bad at a joke that a feller cant quite tell wen youre adoin of it  see now i do declare i wos as near drivin you right over the stern o your own boat as could be only by good luck i seed the twinkle in your eye in time  pull away my lad said the captain in the softest tones of his deep voice at the same time looking his reprover straight in the face  there was something in the tone in which that simple command was given and in the look by which it was accompanied that effectually quelled john bumpus in spite of himself  violence had no effect on john because in most cases he was able to meet it with superior violence and in all cases he was willing to try  but to be put down in this mild way was perplexing  the words were familiar the look straightforward and common enough  he could not understand it at all and being naturally of a philosophical turn of mind he spent the next three minutes in a futile endeavour to analyse his own feelings  before he had come to any satisfactory conclusion on the subject the boats keel grated on the white sand of the shore  now while all that we have been describing in the last and present chapters was going on a very different series of events was taking place on the coralisland for there under the pleasant shade of the cocoanut palms a tall fair and handsome youth was walking lightly down the green slopes towards the shore in anticipation of the arrival of the schooner and a naked darkskinned savage was dogging his steps winding like a hideous snake among the bushes and apparently seeking an opportunity to launch the short spear he carried in his hand at his unsuspecting victim  as the youth and the savage descended the mountainside together the former frequently paused when an opening in the rich foliage peculiar to these beautiful isles enabled him to obtain a clear view of the magnificent bay and its fringing coral reef on which the swell of the great pacificso calm and undulating out beyondfell in tremendous breakers with a long low solemn roar like distant thunder  as yet no object broke the surface of the mirrorlike bay within the reef  each time the youth paused the savage stopped also and more than once he poised his deadly spear while his glaring eyeballs shone amid the green foliage like those of a tiger  yet upon each occasion he exhibited signs of hesitation and finally lowered the weapon and crouched into the underwood  to any one ignorant of the actors in this scene the indecision of the savage would have appeared unaccountable for there could be no doubt of his desire to slay the fair youthstill less doubt of his ability to dart his formidable spear with precision  nevertheless there was good reason for his hesitating for young henry stuart was well known alike by settlers and savages as possessing the swiftest foot the strongest arm and the boldest heart in the island and keona was not celebrated for the possession of these qualities in any degree above the average of his fellows although he did undoubtedly exceed them in revenge hatred and the like  on one occasion young stuart had while defending his mothers house against an attack of the savages felled keona with a welldirected blow of his fist  it was doubtless out of revenge for this that the latter now dogged the former through the lonely recesses of the mountainpass by which he had crossed the island from the little settlement in which was his home and gained the sequestered bay in which he expected to find the schooner  up to this point however the savage had not summoned courage to make the attack although with the exception of a huntingknife his enemy was altogether unarmed for he knew that in the event of missing his mark the young mans speed of foot would enable him to outstrip him while his strength of frame would quickly terminate a single combat  as the youth gained the more open land near the beach the possibility of making a successful cast of the spear became more and more doubtful finally the savage shrunk into the bushes and abandoned the pursuit  not here yet master gascoyne muttered henry as he sat down on a rock to rest for although the six miles of country he had crossed was a trifle as regarded distance to a lad of nineteen the rugged mountainpath by which he had come would have tried the muscles of a red indian and the nerve of a goat  you were wont to keep to time better in days gone by  truly it seems to me a strange thing that i should thus be made a sort of walking post between my mothers house and this bay all for the benefit of a man who seems to me no better than he should be and whom i dont like and yet whom i do like in some unaccountable fashion that i dont understand  whatever the youths thoughts were after giving vent to the foregoing soliloquy he kept them to himself  they did not at first appear to be of an agreeable nature for he frowned once or twice and struck his thigh with his clenched hand but gradually a pleasant expression lit up his manly face as he gazed out upon the sleeping sea and watched the gorgeous clouds that soon began to rise and cluster round the sun  after an hour or so spent in wandering on the beach picking up shells and gazing wistfully out to sea henry stuart appeared to grow tired of waiting for he laid himself down on the shore turned his back on the ocean pillowed his head on a tuft of grass and deliberately went to sleep  now was the time for the savage to wreak his vengeance on his enemy but fortunately that villain despite his subtlety and cunning had not conceived the possibility of the youth indulging in such an unnatural recreation as a nap in the forenoon  he had therefore retired to his native jungle and during the hour in which henry was buried in repose and in which he might have accomplished his end without danger or uncertainty he was seated in a dark cave moodily resolving in his mind future plans of villany and indulging the hope that on the youths returning homewards he would be more successful in finding a favourable opportunity to take his life  during this same hour it was that our lowhulled little schooner hove in sight on the horizon ran swiftly down before the breeze cast anchor in the bay and sent her boat ashore as we have seen with the captain the surly man called dick and our friend john bumpus  it happened that just as the boat ran under the shelter of a rocky point and touched the strand keona left his cave for the purpose of observing what young stuart was about  he knew that he could not have retraced his homeward way without passing within sight of his place of concealment  a glance of surprise crossed his dark visage as he crept to the edge of the underwood and saw the schooner at anchor in the bay  this was succeeded by a fiendish grin of exultation as his eye fell on the slumbering form of the youth  he instantly took advantage of the opportunity and so deeply was he engrossed with his murderous intention that he did not observe the captain of the schooner as he turned a projecting rock and suddenly appeared upon the scene  the captain however saw the savage and instantly drew back signing at the same time to his two men to keep under cover  a second glance shewed him the sleeping form of henry and almost before he had time to suspect that foul play was going on he saw the savage glide from the bushes to the side of the sleeper raise his spear and poise it for one moment as if to make sure of sending it straight to the youths heart  there was not a moment to lose  the captain carried a short carbine in his hand with which he took aim at the savagegoing down on one knee to make a surer shot for the carbine of those days was not to be depended on at a distance much beyond a hundred yards and as the actors in this scene were separated by even more than that distance there was a considerable chance of missing the savage and hitting the young man  this however was not a moment to calculate chances  the captain pulled the trigger and the crash of the shot was followed by a howl from the savage as his uplifted arm dropt to his side and the spear fell across the face of the sleeper  henry instantly awoke and sprang up with the agility of a panther  before he could observe what had occurred keona leapt into the bushes and disappeared  henry at once bounded after him and the captain giving vent to a lusty cheer rushed across the beach and sprang into the forest closely followed by surly dick and john bumpus whose united cheers of excitement and shouts of defiance awoke the echoes of the place with clamorous discords    chapter three  a rough walk enlivened by rambling talkbumpus is agreeable  it is said in the proverbial philosophy of nautical men that a stern chase is a long one  the present instance was an exception to the general rule  keona was wounded  young stuart was fleet as the antelope and strong as a young lion  in these circumstances it is not surprising that after a run of less than a quarter of a mile he succeeded in laying his hands on the neck of the savage and hurling him to the ground where he lay panting and helpless looking up in the face of his conqueror with an expression of hopeless despairfor savages and wicked men generally are wont to judge of others by themselves and to expect to receive such treatment from their enemies as they themselves would in similar circumstances accord  the fear of instant death was before his eyes and the teeth of keona chattered in his head while his face grew more hideous than ever by reason of its becoming livid  his fears were groundless  henry stuart was not a savage  he was humane by nature and in addition to this he had been trained under the influence of that book which teaches us that the most philosophical because the most effective method of procedure in this world is to overcome evil with good  so you scoundrel said henry placing his knee on keonas chest and compressing his throat with his left hand while with his right he drew forth a long glittering knife and raised it in the airso you are not satisfied with what i gave you the last time we met but you must needs take the trouble to cross my path a second time and get a taste of cold steel must you  although keona could speak no english he understood it sufficiently to appreciate the drift of the youths words even though he had failed to comprehend the meaning of the angry frown and the glittering knife but however much he might have wished to reply to the question henry took care to render the attempt impossible by compressing his windpipe until he became blue in the face and then black  at the same time he let the sharp point of his knife touch the skin just over the region of the heart  having thus convinced his vanquished foe that death was at the door he suddenly relaxed his iron gripe arose sheathed his knife and bade the savage get up  the miserable creature did so with some difficulty just as the captain and his men arrived on the scene  well met henry cried the former extending his hand to the youth had i been a moment later my lads i fear that your lifes blood would have been on the sea shore  then it was you who fired the shot captain gascoyne  this is the second time i have to thank you for saving my life said the young man returning the grasp of the captains hand  truly it is but a small matter to have to thank me for  doubtless if my stout man john bumpus had carried the carbine he would have done you as good service  and methinks henry that you would have preferred to owe your life to either of my men rather than to me if i may judge by your looks  you should not judge by looks captain replied the youth quicklyespecially the looks of a man who has just had a hand to hand tussle with a savage  but to tell the plain truth captain gascoyne i would indeed rather have had to thank your worthy man john bumpus than yourself for coming to my aid for although i owe you no grudge and do not count you an enemy i had rather see your back than your faceand you know the reason why  you give me credit boy for more knowledge than i possess replied gascoyne while an angry frown gathered for a moment on his brow but passed away almost as quickly as it came i know not the cause of your unreasonable dislike to one who has never done you an injury  never done me an injury cried henry starting and turning with a look of passion on his companion then checking himself by a strong effort he added in a milder tonebut a truce to such talk and i ask your forgiveness for my sharp words just after your rendering me such good service in the hour of need  you and i differ in our notions on one or two pointsthat is all there is no need for quarrelling  see here is a note from my mother who sent me to the bay to meet you  during this colloquy dick and bumpus had mounted guard over the wounded savage just out of earshot of their captain  neither of the sailors ventured to hold their prisoner because they deemed it an unmanly advantage to take of one who was so completely as they imagined in their power  they kept a watchful eye on him however and while they affected an easy indifference of attitude held themselves in readiness to pounce upon him if he should attempt to escape  but nothing seemed farther from the mind of keona than such an attempt  he appeared to be thoroughly exhausted by his recent struggle and loss of blood and his body was bent as if he were about to sink down to the ground  there was however a peculiar glance in his dark eyes that induced john bumpus to be more on his guard than appearances seemed to warrant  while gascoyne was reading the letter to which we have referred keona suddenly placed his left leg behind surly dick and with his unwounded fist hit that morose individual such a tremendous backhanded blow on the nose that he instantly measured his length on the ground  john bumpus made a sudden plunge at the savage on seeing this but the latter ducked his head passed like an eel under the very arms of the sailor and went off into the forest like a deer  hold shouted captain gascoyne as john turned in a state of mingled amazement and anger to pursue  hold on bumpus let the miserable rascal go  john stopped looked over his shoulder hesitated and finally came back with a rolling air of nautical indifference and his hands thrust into his breeches pockets  you know best capting said he but i think it a pity to let sich a dirty varmint go clear off to dodge about in the bushes and mayhap treat us to a pisoned arrow or a spearthrust on the sly howsomedever it aint no consarn wotever to jo bumpus  hows your beak dick my boy  none the better for your askin replied the surly mariner who was tenderly stroking the injured member of his face with the fingers of both hands  come dick it is none the worse of being inquired after said henry laughing  but tis as well to let the fellow go  he knows best how to cure his wound by the application of a few simples and by thus making off has relieved us of the trouble and responsibility of trying our hands at civilised doctoring  besides john bumpus if thats your namethough i do think your father might have found you a better your long legs would never have brought you within a mile of the savage  young man retorted jo gravely id have you to know that the family of the bumpuses is an old and a honourable one  they comed over with the conkerer to ireland where they picked up a deal o their good manners after which they settled at last on their own estates in yorkshire  though they have comed down in the world and the last of the bumpusesthats meis takin a pleasure trip round the world before the mast i wont stand by and hear my name made game of dye see and id have ye to know farther my buck that the bumpuses has a pecooliar gift for fightin and although you are a strappin young feller youd better not cause me for to prove that youre conkerable  having delivered himself of this oration the last of the bumpuses frowned portentously on the youth who had dared to risk his anger and turning with a bland smile to surly dick asked him if his beak was any better now  there seems to be bad news in the letter i think observed henry as captain gascoyne perused the epistle with evident signs of displeasure  bad enough in these times of war boy replied the other folding the note and placing it in a pouch inside the breast of his flannel shirt it seems that that pestiferous british frigate the talisman lies at anchor in the bay on the other side of the island  nothing in that to cause uneasiness to an honest trader said henry leading the way up the steep path by which he had descended from the mountain region of the interior  that speech only shews your ignorance of the usages of ships of war know you not that the nature of the trade in which i am engaged requires me to be stronghanded and that the opinion of a commander in the british navy as to how many hands are sufficient for the navigation of a trading schooner does not accord with minea difference of opinion which may possibly result in his relieving me of a few of my best men when i can ill afford to spare them  and by the way said gascoyne pausing as they gained the brow of an eminence that commanded a view of the rich woodland on one side and the sea on the other i had better take precautions against such a mischance  here dick taking the man aside and whispering to him go back to the schooner my lad and tell the mate to send ten of the best hands ashore with provisions and arms let them squat where they choose on land only let them see to it that they keep well out of sight and hearing until i want them  and now master henry lead the way john bumpus and i will follow at your heel like a couple of faithful dogs  the scene through which young henry stuart now led his seafaring companions was of that rich varied and beautiful character which is strikingly characteristic of those islands of the pacific which owe their origin to volcanic agency  unlike the low coral islets this island presented every variety of the boldest mountain scenery and yet like them it displayed all the gorgeous beauty of a rich tropical vegetation  in some places the ground had been cracked and riven into great fissures and uncouth caverns of the wildest description by volcanoes apparently long since extinct  in others the landscape presented the soft beauty of undulating grovelike scenery in which amid a profusion of bright green herbage there rose conspicuous the tall stems and waving plumes of the cocoanut palm the superb and umbrageous koa with its laurelgreen leaves and sweet blossoms the kukui or candlenut tree the fragrant sandalwood and a variety of other trees and shrubs for which there are no english names  hundreds of green paroquets with blue heads and red breasts turtledoves woodpigeons and other birds enlivened the groves with sound if not with melody and the various lakelets and pools were alive with wild ducks and waterhens  the route by which the party travelled led them first across a country of varied and beautiful aspect then it conducted them into wild mountain fastnesses among which they clambered at times with considerable difficulty  ere long they passed into a dreary region where the ancient fires that upheaved the island from the deep seemed to have scorched the land into a condition of perpetual desolation blackened and bare lava rocks steep volcanic ridges and gorges irregular truncated coves deepmouthed caves and fissures overhanging arches natural bridges great tunnels and ravines surrounded them on every side and so concealed the softer features of the country that it was scarcely possible to believe in the reality of the verdant region out of which they had just passed  in another hour this chaotic scenery was left behind the highest ridge of the mountains was crossed and the travellers began to descend the green slopes on the other side of the island  these slopes terminated in a beach of white sand while beyond lay the calm waters of the enclosed lagoon the coral reef with its breakers and the mighty sea  tis a pretty spot said henry interrogatively as the party halted on the edge of a precipice whence they obtained an uninterrupted view of the whole of that side of the island  ay pretty enough replied gascoyne in a somewhat sad tone of voice i had hoped to have led a quiet life here oncebut that was not to be  how say you bumpus could you make up your mind to cast anchor here for a year or so  wots that you say capting inquired honest john who was evidently lost in admiration of the magnificent scene that lay spread out before him  i ask if you have no objection to come to an anchor here for a time repeated the captain  objection  ill tell ye wot it is capting i never seed sich a place afore in all my born days  why its a slice out o paradise  i do believe if adam and eve wos here theyd think theyd got back again into eden  its more beautifuller than the blue ocean by a long chalk an if you wants a feller thats handy at amost anything after a fashiona jack of all trades and master of none except seamanship which aint o no use herejo bumpus is your man  im glad to hear you say that jo said henry laughing for we are greatly in need of white men of your stamp in these times when the savages are so fierce against each other that they are like to eat us up altogether merely by way of keeping their hands in practice  white men of my stamp remarked bumpus surveying complacently his deeplybronzed hands which were only a shade darker than his visage well i would like to know what ye call black if im a white man  blood and not skin is what stamps the colour of the man jo  if it were agreeable to captain gascoyne to let you off your engagement to him i think i could make it worth your while to engage with me and would find you plenty of work of all kinds including a little of that same fighting for which the bumpuses are said to be so famous  gentlemen said jo gravely im agreeable to become a good and chattel for this occasion only as the playbills say and hold myself up to the highest bidder  nay you are sold to me bumpus said gascoyne and must do as i bid you  wery good then bid away as fast as you like  come captain dont be hard said henry what will you take for him  i cannot afford to sell him at any price replied the other for i have brought him here expressly as a gift to a certain mary stuart queen of women if not of scotlanda widow who dwells in sandy cove  what my mother interrupted henry while a shade of displeasure crossed his countenance at what he deemed the insolent familiarity with which gascoyne mentioned her name  the same  on my last visit i promised to get her a manservant who could do her some service in keeping off the savages when they take a fancy to trouble the settlement and if bumpus is willing to try his luck on shore i promise him hell find her a good mistress and her house pleasant quarters  so exclaimed the stout seaman stopping short in his rolling walk and gazing earnestly into his captains face im to be sold to a woman  with your own consent entirely master bumpus said gascoyne with a smile  come jo cried henry gaily i see you like the prospect and feel assured that you and i shall be good friends  give us your flipper my boy  john bumpus allowed the youth to seize and shake a flipper which would have done credit to a walrus both in regard to shape and size after a short pause he said whether you and me shall be good friends young man depends entirely on the respect which you shew to the family of the bumpusessaid family havin comed over to ireland with the conkerer in the year ah  i misremember the year but that dont matter bein a subject of no consarn wotiver xcept to schoolboys wholl get their licks if they cant tell and sarve em right too  but if youre willin im agreeable and theres an end o the whole affair  so saying john bumpus suffered a bland smile to light up his ruddy countenance and resumed his march in the wake as he expressed it of his companions  half an hour later they arrived at sandy cove a small native settlement and mission station and were soon seated at the hospitable board of widow stuart    chapter four  the missionarysuspicions surprises and surmises  sandy cove was a small settlement inhabited partly by native converts to christianity and partly by a few european traders who having found that the place was in the usual track of south sea whalers and frequently visited by that class of vessels as well as by other ships had established several stores or trading houses and had taken up their permanent abode there  the island was one of those the natives of which were early induced to agree to the introduction of the gospel  at the time of which we write it was in that transition state which renders the work of the missionary one of anxiety toil and extreme danger as well as one of love  but the reverend frederick mason was a man eminently fitted to fill the post which he had selected as his sphere of labour  bold and manly in the extreme he was more like a soldier in outward aspect than a missionary  yet the gentleness of the lamb dwelt in his breast and beamed in his eye and to a naturally indomitable and enthusiastic disposition was added burning zeal in the cause of his beloved master  six years previous to the opening of our tale he had come to sandy cove with his wife and child the latter a girl of six years of age at that time  in one year death bereaved the missionary of his wife and about the same time war broke out in the island between the chiefs who clung to the idolatrous rites and bloody practices peculiar to the inhabitants of the south sea islands and those chiefs who were inclined to favour christianity  this war continued to rage more or less violently for several years frequently slumbering sometimes breaking out with sudden violence like the fitful eruptions of the still unextinct volcanoes in those distant regions  during all this period of bloodshed and alarms the missionary stuck to his post  the obstinacy of hatred was being gradually overcome by the superior pertinacity of zeal in a good cause and the invariable practiceso incomprehensible to the savage mindof returning good for evil the result was that the sabbath bell still sent its tinkling sound over the verdant slopes above sandy cove and the hymn of praise still arose morning and evening from the little church which composed partly of wood partly of coral rock had been erected under the eye and to a large extent by the hands of the missionary  but false friends within the camp were more dangerous and troublesome to mr mason than avowed enemies without  some of the european traders especially who settled on the island a few years after the missionary had made it habitable were the worst foes he had to contend with  in the same vessel that brought the missionary to the island there came a widow mrs stuart with her son henry then a stout lad of thirteen the widow was not however a member of the missionarys household  she came there to settle with her son who soon built her a rudely constructed but sufficiently habitable hut which in after years was enclosed and greatly improved so that it at last assumed the dimensions of a rambling picturesque cottage whitewashed brilliant and neat in its setting of bright green  the widow although not an official assistant to the missionary was nevertheless a most efficient one  she taught in his schools being familiar with the native tongue and when the settlement grew in numbers both of white and black she became known as the good angel of the placethe one who was ever ready with sympathy for the sorrowful and comfort for the dying  she was fair and fragile and had been exceedingly beautiful but care had stamped his mark deeply in her brow neither care nor time however could mar the noble outline of her fine features or equal the love that beamed in her gentle eyes  the widow was a great mystery to the gossips of sandy cove for there are gossips even in the most distant isles of the sea  some men we refer of course to white men thought that she must have been the wife of an admiral at least and had fallen into distressed circumstances and gone to these islands to hide her poverty  others said she was a female jesuit in disguise sent there to counteract the preaching of the gospel by the missionary  a few even ventured to hint their opinion that she was an outlaw or something of that sort and shrewdly suspected that mr mason knew more about her than he was pleased to tell  but no one either by word or look had ever ventured to express an opinion of any kind to herself or in the hearing of her son the latter indeed displayed such uncommon breadth of shoulders and such unusual development of muscle that it was seldom necessary for him even in those savage regions and wild timesto display anything else in order to make men respectful  while our three friends were doing justice to the bacon and breadfruit set before them by widow stuart the widow herself was endeavouring to repress some strong feeling which caused her breast to heave more than once and induced her to turn to some trifling piece of household duty to conceal her emotion  these symptoms were not lost upon her son whose suspicions and anger had been aroused by the familiarity of gascoyne  making some excuse for leaving the room towards the conclusion of the meal he followed his mother to an outhouse whither she had gone to fetch some fresh milk  mother said henry respectfully yet with an unwonted touch of sternness in his voice there is some mystery connected with this man gascoyne that i feel convinced you can clear up  dear henry interrupted the widow and her cheek grew pale as she spoke do not i beseech you press me on this subject  i cannot clear it up  say you will not mother answered henry in a tone of disappointment  i would if i dared continued the widow  the time may come when i  but why not now urged the youth hastily  i am old enough surely to be trusted  during the four visits this man has paid to us i have observed a degree of familiarity on his part which no man has a right to exhibit towards you and which did i not see that you permit it no man would dare to shew  why do you allow him to call you mary  no one else in the settlement does so  he is a very old friend replied the widow sadly  i have known him from childhood  we were playmates long ago  humph thats some sort of reason no doubt but you dont appear to like him and his presence always seems to give you pain  why do you suffer yourself to be annoyed by him  only say the word mother and ill kick him out of the house neck and crop  hush boy you are too violent  too violent  why it would make a coward violent to see his mother tormented as you are by this fellow and not be allowed to put a stop to it  i suspect  henry said the widow again interrupting her exasperated son do you think your mother would do what is wrong  mother exclaimed the youth seizing her hand and kissing her brow almost violently i would as soon think that the angels above would do wrong but i firmly believe that you are suffering wrong to be done to you andjust listen to the fellow i do believe hes howling for more bacon at this moment  there could be no doubt whatever about the fact for just then the deep tones of gascoynes voice rang through the cottage as he reiterated the name of the widow who hastened away followed by her son  henry scarcely took the trouble to conceal the frown that darkened his brow as he reentered the apartment where his companions were seated  why mary your bacon surpasses anything i have tasted for the last six months lets have another rasher like a good woman  that mountain air sharpens the appetite amazingly especially of men who are more accustomed to mount the rigging of a ship than the hills on shore  what say you john bumpus  john bumpus could not at that moment say anything in consequence of his mouth being so full of the bacon referred to that there was no room for a single word to pass his lips  in the height of his goodhumour however he did his best by signs to express his entire approval of the widows provender and even attempted to speak  in so doing he choked himself and continued in convulsions for the next five minutes to the immense delight of the captain who vowed he had never before seen such a blue face in the whole course of his life  while this scene was enacting and ere jo bumpus had effectually wiped away the tears from his eyes and cleared the bacon out of his windpipe the door opened and the commander of hms talisman entered  edmund montague was a young man to hold such a responsible position in the navy but he was a bold vigorous little englishmana sort of gentlemanly and welleducated john bull terrier of frank address agreeable manners and an utterly reckless temperament which was qualified and curbed however by good sense and hardearned experience  good day to you mrs stuart i trust you will forgive my abrupt intrusion but urgent business must be my excuse  i have called to have a little further conversation with your son respecting that rascally pirate who has given me so much trouble  if he will have the goodness to take a short walk with me i shall be much indebted  by all means said henry rising and putting on his cap  perhaps said gascoyne as they were about to leave the room if the commander of the talisman would condescend to take a little information from a stranger he might learn something to the purpose regarding the pirate durward for he it is i presume of whom you are in search  i shall be happy to gain information from any source replied montague eyeing the captain narrowly  are you a resident in this island  no i am not my home is on the sea and has been since i was a lad  ah you have fallen in with this pirate then on your native ocean i fancy and have disagreeable cause to remember him perchance said montague smiling  has he given you much trouble  ay that he has replied gascoyne with a sudden scowl of ferocity no one in these seas has received so much annoyance from him as i have any one who could rid them of his presence would do good service to the cause of humanity  but he added while a grim smile overspread his handsome face it is said that few vessels can cope with his schooner in speed and i can answer for it that he is a bold man fond of fighting with plenty of reckless cutthroats to back him and more likely to give chase to a sloopofwar than to shew her his heels  i trust you are well manned and armed captain montague for this durward is a desperate fellow i assure you  the young commanders countenance flushed as he replied your anxiety on my account sir is quite uncalled for  had i nothing but my own longboat wherewith to attack this pirate it would be my duty to do so i had scarcely expected to find unmanly fears exhibited in one so stalwart in appearance as you are  perhaps it may relieve you to know that i am both well manned and armed  it is not usual for a british manofwar to cruise in distant seas in a less suitable condition to protect her flag  and yet methinks one who has spent so many years of his life on salt water might know the difference between a frigate and a sloopofwar  be not so hasty young man answered gascoyne gravely you are not on your own quarterdeck just now  there ought to be civility between strangers  i may indeed be very ignorant of the cut and rig of british war vessels seeing that i am but a plain trader in seas where ships of war are not often wont to unfurl their flags but there can be no harm and there was meant no offence in warning you to be on your guard  a tinge of sarcasm still lingered in captain montagues tone as he replied well i thank you for the caution  but to come to the point what know you of this piratethis durward as he calls himself though i have no doubt he has sailed under so many aliases that he may have forgotten his real name  i know him to be a villain replied gascoyne  that much i know as well as you said montague  and yet it is said he takes fits of remorse at times and would fain change his way of life if he could continued gascoyne  that i might guess returned the other most wicked men have their seasons of remorse  can you tell me nothing of him more definite than this friend  i can tell you that he is the very bane of my existence said gascoyne the angry expression again flitting for a moment across his countenance  he not only pursues and haunts me like my own shadow but he gets me into scrapes by passing his schooner for mine when he is caught  the young officer glanced in surprise at the speaker as he uttered these words  indeed said he that is a strange confusion of ideas  so then the two schooners bear so strong a resemblance as to be easily mistaken for each other  they are twins  they were built at the same time from the same moulds and were intended for the sandalwood trade between these islands and calcutta manilla and australia  one of them the avenger was seized on her first voyage by this durward then mate of the schooner and has ever since scoured the south seas as a pirate the other named the foam which i have the misfortune to command still continues the traffic for which she was originally built  ha exclaimed montague turning suddenly round with an inquiring gaze at the stalwart figure of the sandalwood trader it is most fortunate that i have met with you mr gascoyne  i doubt not that you can conduct me to this vessel of yours so that i may know the pirate when i fall in with him  if the two vessels resemble each other so closely a sight of the foam will be of great service to me in my search after the avenger  you are most welcome to a sight of my craft replied gascoyne  the only difference between the two is that the figurehead of the pirate is a griffins head painted scarlet that of my schooner is a female painted white  there is also a red streak round the sides of the pirate the hull of the foam is entirely black  will you come on board my vessel and accompany me in one of my boats to yours inquired montague  that is impossible replied gascoyne i came here on urgent business which will not brook delay but my schooner lies on the other side of the island if you pull round my mate will receive you  you will find him a most intelligent and hospitable man  he will conduct you over the vessel and give you all the information you may desire  meanwhile added the captain of the foam rising and putting on his cap i must bid you adieu  nay but you have not yet told me when or where you last saw or heard of this remarkable pirate who is so clever at representing other people perhaps i should rather say misrepresenting them said montague with a meaning smile  i saw him no longer ago than this morning replied gascoyne gravely he is now in these waters with what intent i know not unless from his unnatural delight in persecuting me or perhaps because fate has led him into the very jaws of the lion  humph he will find that i bite before i roar if he does get between my teeth said the young officer  surely you are mistaken gascoyne interposed henry stuart who along with john bumpus had hitherto been silent listeners to the foregoing conversation  several of our people have been out fishing among the islands and have neither seen nor heard of this redoubted pirate  that is possible enough boy but i have seen him nevertheless and i shall be much surprised if you do not see and hear more of him than you desire before many days are out  that villain does not sail the seas for pastime you may depend on it  as gascoyne said this the outer door of the house was burst violently open and the loud voice of a boy was heard in the porch or short passage that intervened between it and the principal apartment of the cottage shouting wildlyho hallo hurrah  i say widow stuart henry heres a businesssich fun only think the pirates turned up at last and murdered half the niggers in  there was an abrupt stoppage both of the voice and the muscular action of this juvenile tornado as he threw open the door with a crash and instead of the widow or her son met the gaze of so many strangers  the boy stood for a few seconds on the threshold with his curly brown hair dishevelled and his dark eyes staring in surprise first at one then at another of the party until at length they alighted on john bumpus the mouth which up to that moment had formed a round o of astonishment relaxed into a broad grin and with sudden energy exclaimed  what a grampus  having uttered this complimentary remark the urchin was about to retreat when henry made a sudden dart at him and caught him by the collar  where got you the news will corrie said henry giving the boy a squeeze with his strong hand  oh please be merciful henry and ill tell you all about it  but pray dont give me over to that grampus cried the lad pretending to whimper  i got the news from a feller that said hed got it from a feller that saw a feller who said hed heard a feller tell another feller that he saw a black feller in the bush somewhere or other tween this and the other end o the island with a shot hole in his right arm running like a cogolampus with ten pirates in full chase ah oh have mercy henry really my constitution will break down if you  silence you chatterbox and give me a reasonable account of what you have heard or seen if you can  the volatile urchin who might have been about thirteen years of age became preternaturally grave all of a sudden and looking up earnestly in his questioners face said really henry you are becoming unreasonable in your old age to ask me to give you a reasonable account of a thing and at the same time to be silent  ill tell you what corrie ill throttle you if you dont speak said henry  ah you couldnt pleaded corrie in a tone of deep pathos  praps observed john bumpus praps if you hand over the young genlmn to the grampus hell make him speak  on hearing this the boy set up a howl of affected despair and suffered henry to lead him unresistingly to within a few feet of bumpus but just as he was within an inch of the huge fist of that nautical monster he suddenly wrenched his collar out of his captors grasp darted to the door turned round on the threshold hit the side of his own nose a sounding slap with the forefinger of his right hand uttered an inexpressively savage yell vanished from the scene and    like the baseless fabric of a vision   left not a wreck behind  except the wreck of the milksaucer of the household cat which sagacious creature had wisely taken to flight at the first symptom of war  the boy was instantly followed by henry but so light was his foot that the fastest runner in the settlement had to penetrate the woods immediately behind his mothers house for a quarter of a mile before he succeeded in again laying hold of the refractory lads collar  what do you mean corrie by such conduct said his captor shaking him vigorously  i have half a mind to give you a wallopping  never do anything by halves henry said the boy mildly  i never do  its a bad habit always go the whole length or none  now that we are alone ill give you a reasonable account of what i know if youll remove your hand from my collar  you forget that im growing and that when i am big enough the day of reckoning between us will surely come  but why would you not give me the information i want in the house  the people you saw there are as much interested in it as i am  oh are they returned corrie with a glance of peculiar meaning perhaps they are more interested than you are  how so  why how do i know and how do you know that these fellows are not pirates in disguise  because said henry one of them is an old friendthat is an acquaintanceat least a sort of intimate who has been many and many a time at our house before and my mother knows him well  i cant say i like himthat is to say i dont exactly like some of his waysthough i dont dislike the man himself  a most unsatisfactory style of reply henry for a manah beg pardon a boyof your straightforward character  which o the three are you speaking ofthe grampus  no the other big handsomelooking fellow  and youre sure youve known him long continued the boy while an expression of perplexity flitted over his face  quite sure why  because i have seen you often enough and your house and your mother not to mention your cat and your pigs and hens but ive never seen him before today  thats because he usually comes at night and seldom stays more than an hour or two  a most uncomfortable style of acquaintance said corrie trying to look wise which was an utterly futile effort seeing that his countenance was fat and round and rosy and very much the reverse of philosophical  but how do you know that the grampus is not the pirate  because he is one of gascoynes men  oh his name is gascoyne is ita most piratical name it is however since he is your friend henry its all right whats tothers name  bumpusjohn bumpus  on hearing this the boy clapped both hands to his sides expanded his eyes and mouth shewed his teeth and finally gave vent to roars of uncontrollable laughter swaying his body about the while as if in agony  oh clear he cried after a time john bumpus ha ha ha what a namejohn bumpus ha ha the grampuswhy its magnificent ha ha and again the boy gave free vent to his merriment while his companion looked on with a quiet grin of amusement  presently corrie became grave and said but what of the third the little chap all over gold lace  praps hes the pirate  he looked bold enough amost for anything  why you goose thats the commander of his britannic majestys frigate talisman  indeed  i hope his britannic majesty has many more like him  plenty more like him  but come boy what have you heard of this pirate and what do you mean about a wounded nigger  i just mean this answered the lad suddenly becoming serious that when i was out on the mountain this morning i thought i would cross the ridge and when i did so the first thing i saw was a schooner lying in the bay at the foot of the hill where you and i have so often gone chasing pigs together well being curious to know what sort of a craft she was i went down the hill intendin to go aboard but before id got half way through the cocoanut grove i heard a horrible yell of a savage so thinks i here comes them blackguard pagans again to attack the settlement and before i could hide out of the way a naked savage almost ran into my arms  he was seagreen in the face with fright and blood was running over his right arm  the moment he saw me instead of splitting me up with his knife and eating me alive as these fellers are so fond of doin he gave a start and another great cry and doubled on his track like a hare  his cry was answered by a shout from half a dozen sailors who burst out of the thicket at that moment and i saw they were in pursuit of him  down i went at once behind a thick bush and the whole lot o the blind bats passed right on in full cry within half an inch of my nose  and i never saw sich a set o piraticallooking villains since i was born  i felt quite sure that yon schooner is the pirate that has been doing so much mischief hereabouts so i came back as fast as my legs could carry me to tell you what i had seen  there you have got all that i know of the matter now  you are wrong boythe schooner you saw is not the pirate it is the foam  strange very strange muttered henry  whats strange inquired the lad  not the appearance of the wounded nigger answered the other i can explain all about him but the sailorsthat puzzles me  henry then related the mornings adventure to his young companion  but continued he after detailing all that the reader already knows i cannot comprehend how the pirates you speak of could have landed without their vessel being in sight and that nothing is to be seen from the mountain tops except the talisman on the one side of the island and the foam on the other i can vouch for  boats might lie concealed among the rocks on the shore no doubt  but no boats would venture to put ashore with hostile intentions unless the ship to which they belonged were within sight  as for the crew of the foam they are ordinary seamen and not likely to amuse themselves chasing wounded savages even if they were allowed to go ashore which i think is not likely for gascoyne knows well enough that that side of the island is inhabited by the pagans who would as soon kill and eat a man as they would a pig  soonerthe monsters exclaimed the boy indignantly for he had on more than one occasion been an eyewitness of the horrible practice of cannibalism which prevails even at the present day among some of the south sea islanders  there is mystery here said henry starting up and the sooner we alarm the people of the settlement the better  come corrie we shall return to the house and let the british officer hear what you have told me  when the lad had finished relating his adventure to the party in widow stuarts cottage gascoyne said quietly i would advise you captain montague to return to your ship and make your preparations for capturing this pirate for that he is even now almost within range of your guns i have not the slightest doubt  as to the men appearing piraticallooking fellows to this boy i dont wonder at that most men are wild enough when their blood is up  some of my own men are as savage to look at as one would desire  but i gave strict orders this morning that only a few were to go ashore and these were to keep well out of sight of the settlement of the savages  doubtless they are all aboard by this time  if you decide upon anything like a hunt among the mountains i can lend you a few hands  thank you i may perhaps require some of your hands said montague with a dash of sarcasm in his tone meanwhile since you will not favour me with your company on board i shall bid you good afternoon  he bowed stiffly and leaving the cottage hastened on board his ship where the shrill notes of the boatswains whistle and the deep hoarse tones of that officers gruff voice quickly announced to the people on shore that orders had been promptly given and were in course of being as promptly obeyed  during the hour that followed these events the captain of the foam was closeted with widow stuart and her son and the youthful corrie was engaged in laying the foundations of a nevertodie friendship with john bumpus or as that eccentric youngster preferred to style him jo grampus    chapter five  the pastors householdpreparations for war  when the conference in the widows cottage closed henry stuart and gascoyne hastened into the woods together and followed a narrow footpath which led towards the interior of the island  arriving at a spot where this path branched into two henry took the one that ran round the outskirts of the settlement towards the residence of mr mason while his companion pursued the other which struck into the recesses of the mountains  come in cried the missionary as henry knocked at the door of his study  ah henry im glad to see you  you were in my thoughts this moment  i have come to a difficulty in my drawings of the spire of our new church and i want your fertile imagination to devise some plan whereby we may overcome it  but of that i shall speak presently  i see from your looks that more important matters have brought you hither nothing wrong at the cottage i trust  no nothingthat is to say not exactly wrong but things i fear are not altogether right in the settlement  i have had an unfortunate rencontre this morning with one of the savages which is likely to lead to mischief for blood was drawn and i know the fellow to be revengeful  in addition to this it is suspected that durward the pirate is hovering among the islands and meditates a descent on us how much truth there may be in the report i cannot pretend to guess but gascoyne the captain of the foam has been over at our cottage and says he has seen the pirate and that there is no saying what he may venture to attempt for he is a bold fellow and as you know cannot have a goodwill to missionary settlements  im not so sure of that said the pastor in answer to the last remark  it is well known that wherever a christian settlement is founded in these islands that place becomes a safe port for vessels of all sortspirates as well as others if they sail under false colours and pretend to be honest traderswhile in all the other islands it is equally well known the only safety one can count on in landing is superior force  but i am grieved to hear of your affray with the native  i hope that life will not be sacrificed  no fear of that the rascal got only a flesh wound  here the young man related his adventure of the morning and finished by asking what the pastor advised should be done in the way of precaution  it seems to me said mr mason gravely that our chief difficulty will be to save ourselves from our friends  would friends harm us father asked a sweet soft voice at the pastors elbow  next moment alice mason was seated on her fathers knee gazing up in his face with an expression of undisguised amazement  alice was a fair delicate gentle child  twelve summers and winters had passed over her little head without a cloud to obscure the sunshine of her life save onebut that one was a terribly dark one and its shadow lingered over her for many years  when alice lost her mother she lost the joy and delight of her existence and although six years had passed since that awful day and a fond christian father had done his best to impress on her young mind that the beloved one was not lost for ever but would one day be found sitting at the feet of jesus in a bright and beautiful world the poor child could not recover her former elasticity of spirits  doubtless her isolated position and the want of suitable companions had something to do with the prolonged sadness of her little heart  it is almost unnecessary to say that her love for her father was boundless  this was natural but it did not seem by any means so natural that the delicate child should give the next place in her heart to a wild little boy a black girl and a ragged little dog  yet so it was and it would have been difficult for the closest observer to tell which of these three alice liked best  no one could so frequently draw forth the merry laugh that in former days had rung so sweetly over the hillsides of the verdant isle as our young friend will corrie  nothing could delight the heart of the child so much as to witness the mad gambols not to mention the mischievous deeds of that ragged little piece of an old doormat which in virtue of its being possessed of animal life was named toozle  and when alice wished to talk quietlyto pour out her heart and sometimes her tearsthe bosom she sought on which to lay her head next to her fathers was that of her youthful nurserymaid a good kind and gentle but an awfully stupid native girl named kekupoopi  this name was of course reduced in its fair proportions by little alice who however retained the latter part thereof in preference to the former and styled her maid poopy  young master corrie on the other hand called her kickup or puppy indifferently according to the humour he chanced to be in when he met her or to the word that rose most readily to his lips  mr mason replied to the question put by alice at the beginning of this somewhat lengthy digression no my lamb friends would not willingly do us harm but there are those who call themselves friends who do not deserve the name who pretend to be such but who are in reality secret enemies  but go dearest to your room i am busy just now talking with henryhe at least is a trusty friend  when i have done you shall come back to me  alice kissed her father and getting off his knee went at once in search of her friend poopy  that darkskinned and curly blackheaded domestic was in the kitchen seated on the bottom of an overturned iron pot inside the dingy niche in which the domestic fire was wont to burn when anything of a culinary nature was going on  at the time when her mistress entered nothing of the kind was in progress and the fire had subsided to extinction  the girl who might have been any age between twelve and sixteennearer the latter perhaps than the formerwas gazing with expressionless eyes straight before her and thinking evidently of nothing  she was clothed in a white tunic from which her black legs arms neck and head protrudedforming a startling contrast therewith  oh  poopy what a bad girl you are cried alice laughing as she observed where her maid was seated  poopys visage at once beamed with a look of good humour a wide gash suddenly appeared somewhere near her chin displaying a double row of brilliant teeth surrounded by red gums at the same time the whites of her eyes disappeared because being very plump it was a physical impossibility that she should laugh and keep them uncovered  hee hee exclaimed poopy  we are really sorry to give the reader a false impression as we feel that we have done of our friend kekupoopi but a regard for truth compels us to shew the worst of her character first  she was not demonstrative and the few words and signs by which she endeavoured to communicate the state of her feelings to the outward world were not easily interpreted except by those who knew her well  there is no doubt whatever that poopy waswe scarcely like to use the expression but we know of no other more appropriatea donkey  we hasten to guard ourselves from misconstruction here  that word if used in an illnatured and passionate manner is a bad one and by no means to be countenanced but as surgeons may cut off legs at times without thereby sanctioning the indiscriminate practice of amputation in a miscellaneous sort of way as a pastime to this otherwise objectionable word may we think be used to bring out a certain trait of character in full force  holding this opinion and begging the reader to observe that we make the statement gravely and in an entirely philosophical way we repeat that poopy wasfiguratively speakinga donkey  yet she was an amiable affectionate good girl for all that with an amount of love in her heart for her young mistress which words cannot convey and which it is no wonder therefore that poopy herself could not adequately express either by word or look  its all very well for you to sit there and say hee hee cried alice advancing to the fireplace but you must have made a dreadful mark on your clean white frock  get up and turn round  hee hee exclaimed the girl as she obeyed the mandate  the oh oh oh that burst from alice on observing the pattern of the pot neatly printed off on poopys garment was so emphatic that the girl became impressed with the fact that she had done something wrong and twisted her head and neck in a most alarming manner in a series of vain attempts to behold the extent of the damage  what a figure exclaimed alice on recovering from the first shock  it vill vash said poopy in a deprecatory tone  i hope it will replied alice shaking her head doubtfully for her experience in the laundry had not yet been so extensive as to enable her to pronounce at once on the eradicability of such a frightfully deep impression  while she was still shaking her head in dubiety on this point and while poopy was still making futile attempts to obtain a view of the spot the door of the kitchen opened and master corrie swaggered in with his hands thrust into the outer pockets of his jacket his shirt collar thrown very much open and his round straw hat placed very much on the back of his head for having seen some of the crew of the talisman he had been smitten with a strong desire to imitate a manofwarsman in aspect and gait  at his heels came that scampering mass of ragged doormat toozle who feeling that a sensation of some kind or other was being got up for his amusement joined heartily in the shout of delight that burst from the youthful corrie when he beheld the extraordinary figure in the fireplace  well i say kickup cried the youth picking up his hat which had fallen off in the convulsion and drying his tears youre a sweet lookin creetur you are  is this a new frock youve got to go to church with  come i rather like that pattern but theres not quite enough of em  suppose i lend a hand and print a few more all over you theres plenty of pots and pans here to do it and if alice will bring down her white frock ill give it a touch up too  how can you talk such nonsense corrie said alice laughing  down toozle silence sir  go my dear poopy and put on another frock and make haste for ive something to say to you  thus admonished the girl ran to a small apartment that opened off the kitchen and speedily reappeared in another tunic  meanwhile corrie had seated himself on the floor with toozle between his knees and alice on a stool at his side  poopy in a fit of absence of mind was about to resume her seat on the iron pot when a simultaneous shriek bark and roar recalled her scattered faculties produced a hee hee varied with a faint ho and induced her to sit down on the floor beside her mistress  now tell me poopy said alice did you ever hear of friends who were not really friends but enemies  the girl stared with a vacant countenance at the bright intelligent face of the child and shook her head slowly  why dont you ask me inquired corrie  you might as well ask toozle as that potato kickup  eh  puppy dont you confess that you are no better than a vegetable  come now be honest  hee hee replied poopy  humph  i thought so  but thats an odd question of yours alice what do you mean by it  i mean that my papa thinks there are friends in the settlement who are enemies  does he though  now thats mysterious said the boy becoming suddenly grave  that requires to be looked to  come alice tell me all the particulars  dont omit anythingour lives may depend on it  the deeply serious manner in which corrie said this so impressed and solemnised the child that she related word for word the brief conversation she had had with her father and all that she had heard of the previous converse between him and henry  when she had concluded master corrie threw a still more grave and profoundly philosophical expression into his chubby face and asked in a hollow tone of voice your father didnt say anything against the grampus did he  the what inquired alice  the grampusthe man at least whom i call the grampus and who calls hisself jo bumpus  i did not hear such names mentioned but henry spoke of a wounded nigger  ay theyre all a set of false rascals together said corrie  niggers ob dis here settlement is good mans ebery von said poopy promptly  hallo  kickup wots wrong  i never heard ye say so much at one time since i came to this place  niggers is good peepils reiterated the girl  so they are puppy and youre the best of em but i was speakin of the fellers on the other side of the island dye see  hee hee ejaculated the girl  well but what makes you so anxious said alice looking earnestly into the boys face  corrie laid his hand on her head and stroked her fair hair as he replied  this is a serious matter alice i must go at once and see your father about it  he rose with an air of importance as if about to leave the kitchen  oh but please dont go till you have told me what it is im so frightened said alice do stay and tell me about it before you go to papa  well i dont mind if i do said the boy sitting down again  you must know then that its reported there are pirates on the island  oh exclaimed alice  dye know what pirates are puppy  hee hee answered the girl  i do believe she dont know nothin said the boy looking at her with an air of compassion wot a sad thing it is to belong to a lower species of human natur  well i spose it cant be helped  a pirate kickup is a searobber  dye understand  ho ho  ay i thought so  well alice i am told that theres been a lot o them landed on the island and took to chasin and killin the niggers and henry was all but killed by one o the niggers this very morning an was saved by a big feller thats a mystery to me and by the grampus who is the best feller i ever meta regular trump he is and theres all sorts o doubts and fears and rumours and things of that sort with a captain of the british navy that you and i have read so much about trying to find this pirate out and suspectin everybody he meets is him  i only hope he wont take it into his stupid head to mistake me for himnot so unlikely a thing after all  and the youthful corrie shook his head with much gravity as he surveyed his rotund little legs complacently  what are you laughing at he added suddenly on observing that a bright smile had overspread alices face  at the idea of you being taken for a pirate said the child  hee hee ho ho remarked poopy  silence you lump of black putty thundered the aspiring youth  come dont be cross to my maid said alice quickly  corrie laughed and was about to continue his discourse on the events and rumours of the day when mr masons voice was heard the other end of the house  ho  corrie  thats me cried the boy promptly springing up and rushing out of the room  here my boy i thought i heard your voice  i want you to go a message for me  run down like a good lad to ole thorwald and tell him to come up here as soon as he conveniently can  there are matters to consult about which will not brook delay  ay ay sir answered corrie sailor fashion as he touched his forelock and bounded from the room  off on pressing business cried the sanguine youth as he dashed through the kitchen frightening alice and throwing toozle into convulsions of delighthorribly important business that wont brook delay but what brook means is more than i can guess  before the sentence was finished corrie was far down the hill leaping over every obstacle like a deer  on passing through a small field he observed a native bending down as if picking weeds with his back towards him  going softly up behind he hit the seminaked savage a sounding slap and exclaimed as he passed on hallo  jackolu important business my boyhurrah  the native to whom this rough salutation was given was a tall stalwart young fellow who had for some years been one of the best behaved and most active members of frederick masons darkskinned congregation  he stood erect for some time with a broad grin on his swarthy face and a twinkle in his eye as he gazed after the young hopeful muttering to himself ho yesbery wicked boy dat bery but hims capital chap for all dat  a few minutes later master corrie burst in upon the sturdy middleaged merchant named ole thorwald a norwegian who had resided much in england and spoke the english language well and who prided himself on being entitled to claim descent from the old norwegian seakings  this man was uncle and protector to corrie  ho uncle ole heres a business  sich a to dowounds blood and murder or at least an attempt at itthe whole settlement in arms and the parson sends for you to take command  what means the boy exclaimed ole thorwald who in virtue of his having once been a private in a regiment of militia had been appointed to the chief command of the military department of the settlement  this consisted of about thirty white men armed with fourteen fowlingpieces twenty daggers fifteen swords and eight cavalry pistols and about two hundred native christians who when the assaults of their unconverted brethren were made armed themselvesas they were wont to do in days gone bywith formidable clubs stone hatchets and spears  what means the boy exclaimed ole laying down a book which he had been reading and thrusting his spectacles up on his broad bald forehead  exactly what the boy says replied master corrie  then add something more to it pray  thorwald said this in a mild tone but he suddenly seized the handle of an old pewter mug which the lad knew from experience would certainly reach his head before he could gain the door if he did not behave so he became polite and condescended to explain his errand more fully  so so observed the descendant of the seakings as he rose and slowly buckled on a huge old cavalry sabre there is double mischief brewing this time  well we shall seewe shall see  go corrie my boy and rouse up terrence and hugh and  the whole army in short cried the boy hastilyyoure so awfully slow uncle you should have been born in the last century i think  farther remark was cut short by the sudden discharge of the pewter mug which however fell harmlessly on the panel of the closing door as the impertinent corrie sped forth to call the settlement to arms    chapter six  suspicions allayed and reawakened  gascoyne followed by his man jo bumpus sped over the rugged mountains and descended the slopes on the opposite side of the island soon after nightfall and long before captain montague in his large and wellmanned boat could pull half way round in the direction of the sequestered bay where the foam lay quietly at anchor  there was not a breath of wind to ruffle the surface of the glassy sea as the captain of the sandalwood trader reached the shore and uttered a low cry like the hoot of an owl  the cry was instantly replied to and in a few minutes a boat crept noiselessly towards the shore seeming in the uncertain light more like a shadow than a reality  it was rowed by a single man  when within a few yards of the shore the oars ceased to move and the deep stillness of the night was scarcely broken by the low voice of surly dick demandingwho goes there  all right pull in replied gascoyne whose deep bass voice sounded sepulchral in the almost unearthly stillness  it was one of those dark oppressively quiet nights which make one feel a powerful sensation of loneliness and a peculiar disinclination by word or act to disturb the prevailing quiescence of naturesuch a night as suggests the idea of a coming storm to those who are at sea or of impending evil to those on land  is the mate aboard inquired gascoyne  he is sir  are any of the hands on shore  more than half of em sir  nothing more was said and in a few minutes gascoyne was slowly pacing the quarterdeck of his little vessel in earnest consultation with his first mate  there seemed to be some difference of opinion between the captain and his officer for their words which at first were low at length became audible  i tell you manton it wont do said gascoyne sternly  i can only suggest what i believe to be for the good of the ship replied the other coldly  even if you succeed in your attempt you will be certain to lose some of our hands for although the best of them are on shore the commander of the talisman will think those that remain too numerous for a sandalwood trader and you are aware that we are sufficiently shorthanded in such dangerous seas  the latter part of this speech was uttered in a slightly sarcastic tone  what would you have me do then demanded gascoyne whose usual decision of character seemed to have deserted him under the influence of conflicting feelings which the first mate could plainly perceive agitated the breast of his commander but which he could by no means account for  certainly he had no sympathy with them for mantons was a hard stern naturenot given to the melting mood  do exclaimed the mate vehemently i would mount the red and get out the sweeps  an hours pull will place the schooner on the other side of the reef  a shot from long tom will sink the best boat in the service of his britannic majesty and we could be off and away with the land breeze before morning  what sink a manofwars boat exclaimed gascoyne why that would make them set us down as pirates at once and we should have to run the gauntlet of half the british navy before this time next year  manton received this remark with a loud laugh which harshly disturbed the silence of the night  that is true said he yet i scarcely expected to see captain gascoyne shew the white feather  possibly not retorted the other grimly yet methinks that he who counsels flight shews more of the white feather than he who would shove his head into the very jaws of the lion  it wont do manton i have my own reasons for remaining here  the white lady must in the meantime smile on the british commander  besides it would be difficult if not impossible to do all this and get our fellows on board again before morning  the landbreeze will serve to fill the sails of the talisman just as well as those of the foam and theyre sure to trip their anchor tonight for youll scarcely believe it this mad little fellow montague actually suspects me to be the pirate durward  again the harsh laugh of manton disturbed the peaceful calm and this time he was joined by gascoyne who seemed at length to have overcome the objections of his mate for their tones again sank into inaudible whispers  shortly after this conversation the moon broke out from behind a bank of clouds and shone brightly down on land and sea throwing into bold relief the precipices pinnacles and gorges of the one and covering the other with rippling streaks of silver  about the same time the oars of the manofwars boat were heard and in less than half an hour captain montague ascended the side of the foam where to his great surprise he was politely received by gascoyne  captain gascoyne has reason to be proud of his pedestrian powers said the young commander he must have had urgent reason for making such good use of his legs since we last met  to do the honours of his own ship when he expects a visit from a british officer is surely sufficient reason to induce a poor skipper to take an extra walk of a fine evening replied gascoyne blandly besides i know that menofwar are apt to take a fancy to the crews of merchantmen sometimes and i thought my presence might be necessary here tonight  how exclaimed montague quickly  do you fancy that your single arm stout though it be could avail to prevent this evil that you dread if i think proper to act according to established usage in time of war  nay that were extreme vanity indeed returned the other but i would fain hope that the explanations which i can give of the danger of our peculiar trade and the necessity we have for a strong crew will induce captain montague to forego his undoubted privilege and right on this occasion  im not sure of that replied montague it will depend much on your explanations being satisfactory  how many men have you  twentytwo  so many that is much more than enough to work so small a vessel  but not more than enough to defend my vessel from a swarm of bloody savages  perhaps not returned montague on whom the urbanity and candour of the captain of the foam were beginning to have a softening influence you have no objection to let me see your papers and examine your ship i suppose  none in the world replied gascoyne smiling and if i had it would make little difference i should imagine to one who is so well able to insist on having his will obeyedhe glanced at the boat full of armed men as he spokepray come below with me  in the examination that ensued captain montague was exceedingly strict although the strength of his first suspicions had been somewhat abated by the truthful tone and aspect of gascoyne and the apparent reasonableness of all he said but he failed to detect anything in the papers or in the general arrangements of the foam that could warrant his treating her otherwise than as an honest trader  so said he on returning to the deck this is the counterpart of the noted pirate is it  you must pardon my having suspected you sir of being this same durward sailing under false colours  come let me see the points of difference between you else if we happen to meet on the high seas i may chance to make an unfortunate hole in your timbers  the sides of my schooner are altogether black as you see returned gascoyne  i have already explained that a narrow streak of red distinguishes the pirate and this fair lady leading montague to the bow guides the foam over the waves with smiling countenance while a scarlet griffin is the more appropriate figurehead of durwards vessel  as he spoke the low boom of a far distant gun was heard  montague started and glanced inquiringly in the face of his companion whose looks expressed a slight degree of surprise  what was that think you said montague after a momentary pause  the commander of the talisman ought i think to be the best judge of the sound of his own guns  true returned the young officer somewhat disconcerted but you forget that i am not familiar with the eruptions of those volcanic mountains of yours and at so great a distance from my ship with such hills of rock and lava between us i may well be excused feeling a little doubt as to the bark of my own bulldogs  but that signal betokens something unusual  i must shorten my visit to you i fear  pray do not mention it said gascoyne with a peculiar smile under the circumstances i am bound to excuse you  but continued montague with emphasis i should be sorry indeed to part without some little memorial of my visit  be so good as to order your men to come aft  by all means said gascoyne giving the requisite order promptly for having sent all his best men on shore he did not much mind the loss one or two of those that remained  when they were mustered the british commander inspected them carefully and then he singled out surly dick and ordered him into the boat  a slight frown rested for a moment on gascoynes countenance as he observed the look of illconcealed triumph with which the man obeyed the order  the expression of surly dick however was instantly exchanged for one of dismay as his captain strode up to him and looked in his face for one moment with a piercing glance at the same time thrusting his left hand into the breast of his red shirt  goodbye he said suddenly in a cheerful tone extending his right hand and grasping that of the sailor  goodbye lad if you serve the king as well as you have served me hell have reason to be proud of you  gascoyne turned on his heel and the man slunk into the boat with an aspect very unlike that of a bold british seaman  here is another man i want said montague laying his hand on the shoulder of john bumpus  i trust sir that you will not take that man said gascoyne earnestly  i cannot afford to lose him i would rather you should take any three of the others  your liberality leads me to think that you could without much difficulty supply the place of the men i takebut three are too many i shall be satisfied with this one  go into the boat my lad  poor john bumpus whose heart had been captivated by the beauties of the island obeyed the order with a rueful countenance and gascoyne bit his lip and turned aside to conceal his anger  in two minutes more the boat rowed away from the schooners side  not a word was spoken by any one in the boat until a mile had separated it from the schooner  they had just turned a point which shut the vessel out of view when surly dick suddenly recovered his selfpossession and his tongue and starting up in an excited manner exclaimed to montague  the schooner you have just left sir is a pirate  i tell the truth though i should swing for it  the crew of the boat ceased rowing and glanced at each other in surprise on hearing this  ha say you so exclaimed montague quickly  its a fact sir ask my comrade there and hell tell you the same thing  hell do nothin o the sort sharply returned honest bumpus who having been only a short time previously engaged by gascoyne could perceive neither pleasure nor justice in the idea of being hanged for a pirate and who attributed dicks speech to an illnatured desire to get his late commander into trouble  which of you am i to believe said montague hastily  wich ever you please observed bumpus with an air of indifference  its no business o mine said dick sulkily if you choose to let the blackguard escape thats your own look out  silence you scoundrel cried montague who was as much nettled by a feeling of uncertainty how to act as by the impertinence of the man  before he could decide as to the course he ought to pursue the report of one of the guns of his own vessel boomed loud and distinct in the distance  it was almost immediately followed by another  ha that settles the question give way my lads give way  in another moment the boat was cleaving her way swiftly through the dark water in the direction of the talisman    chapter seven  master corrie caught nappingsnakes in the grass  the sabbath morning which succeeded the events we have just narrated dawned on the settlement of sandy cove in unclouded splendour and the deep repose of nature was still unbroken by the angry passions and the violent strife of man although from the active preparations of the previous night it might have been expected that those who dwelt on the island would not have an opportunity of enjoying the rest of that day  everything in and about the settlement was eminently suggestive of peace  the cattle lay sleepily in the shade of the trees the sea was still calm like glass  men had ceased from their daily toil and the only sounds that broke the quiet of the morning were the chattering of the parrots and other birds in the cocoanut groves and the cries of seafowl as they circled in the air or dropt on the surface of the sea in quest of fish  the british frigate lay at anchor in the same place which she had hitherto occupied and the foam still floated in the sequestered bay on the other side of the island  in neither vessel was there the slightest symptom of preparation and to one who knew not the true state of matters the idea of war being about to break forth was the last that would have occurred  but this deceitful quiet was only the calm that precedes the storm  on every hand men were busily engaged in making preparation to break that sabbath day in the most frightful manner or were calmly but resolutely awaiting attack  on board the shipofwar indeed there was little doing for her business being to fight she was always in a state of readiness for action  her signal guns fired the previous night had recalled montague to tell him of the threatened attack by the savages  a few brief orders were given and they were prepared for whatever might occur  in the village too the arrangements to repel attack having been made white men and native converts alike rested with their arms placed in convenient proximity to their hands  in a wild and denselywooded part of the island far removed from those portions which we have yet had occasion to describe a band of fiendishlooking men were making arrangements for one of those unprovoked assaults which savages are so prone to make on those who settle near them  they were all of them in a state of almost complete nudity but the complicated tattooing on their dark skins gave them the appearance of being more clothed than they really were  their arms consisted chiefly of enormous clubs of hardwood spears and bows and in order to facilitate their escape should they chance to be grasped in a handtohand conflict they had covered their bodies with oil which glistened in the sunshine as they moved about their village  conspicuous among these truly savage warriors was the form of keona with his right arm bound up in a sort of sling  pain and disappointed revenge had rendered this mans face more than usually diabolical as he went about among his fellows inciting them to revenge the insult and injury done to them through his person by the whites  there was some reluctance however on the part of a few of the chiefs to renew a war that had been terminated or rather been slumbering only for a few months  keonas influence too was not great among his kindred and had it not been that one or two influential chiefs sided with him his own efforts to relight the still smoking torch of war would have been unavailing  as it was the natives soon worked themselves up into a sufficiently excited state to engage in any desperate expedition  it was while all this was doing in the native camp that keona having gone to the nearest mountain top to observe what was going on in the settlement had fallen in with and been chased by some of those men belonging to the foam who had been sent on shore to escape being pressed into the service of the king of england  the solitary exception to this general state of preparation for war was the household of frederick mason  having taken such precautionary steps the night before as he deemed expedient and having consulted with ole thorwald the general commanding who had posted scouts in all the mountain passes and had seen the warcanoes drawn up in a row on the strand the pastor retired to his study and spent the greater part of the night in preparing to preach the gospel of peace on the morrow and in committing the care of his flock and his household to him who is the god of battles as well as the prince of peace  it is not to be supposed that mr mason contemplated the probable renewal of hostilities without great anxiety  for himself we need scarcely say he had no fears but his heart sank when he thought of his gentle alice falling into the hands of savages  as the night passed away without any alarms his anxiety began to subside and when sunday morning dawned he lay down on a couch to snatch a few hours repose before the labours of the day began  the first object that greeted the pastors eyes on awaking in the morning was a black visage and a pair of glittering eyes gazing at him through the half open door with an expression of the utmost astonishment  he leaped up with lightning speed and darted towards the intruder but checked himself suddenly and smiled as poor poopy uttered a scream and falling on her knees implored for mercy  my poor girl i fear i have frightened you by my violence said he sitting down on his couch and yawning sleepily but i was dreaming poopy and when i saw your black face peeping at me i took you at first for one of the wild fellows on the other side of the mountains  you have come to sweep and arrange my study i suppose  why massr you no hab go to bed yet said poopy still feeling and expressing surprise at her masters unwonted irregularity  is you ill  not at all my good girl only a little tired  it is not a time for me to take much rest when the savages are said to be about to attack us  when is they coming inquired the girl meekly  the pastor smiled as he repliedthat is best known to themselves poopy  do you think it likely that murderers or thieves would send to let us know when they were coming  hee hee laughed poopy with an immense display of teeth and gums  is alice awake inquired mr mason  no her be sound sleep wid her two eye shut tight up dis fashion and her mout wide openso  the representations of alices condition as given by her maid although hideously unlike the beautiful object they were meant to call up to the fathers mind were sufficiently expressive and comprehensible  go wake her my girl and let us have breakfast as soon as you can has will corrie been here this morning  hims bin here all night replied the girl with a broad grinand the breadth of poopys broad grin was almost appalling  what mean you has he slept in this house all night  yeseh no said poopy  yes no exclaimed mr mason  come poopy dont be stupid explain yourself  hee hee hee yes ho ho laughed poopy as if the idea of explaining herself was about the richest joke she had listened to since she was born  hee hee me no can splain but you com here and see  so saying she conducted her wondering master to the front door of the cottage where across the threshold directly under the porch lay the form of the redoubted corrie fast asleep and armed to the teeth  in order to explain the cause of this remarkable apparition we think it justifiable to state to the reader in confidence that young master corrie was deeply in love with the fair alice  with all his reckless drollery of disposition the boy was intensely romantic and enthusiastic and feeling that the unsettled condition of the times endangered the welfare of his ladylove he resolved like a true knight to arm himself and guard the threshold of her door with his own body  in the deep silence of the night he buckled on a sabre the blade of which by reason of its having been broken was barely eight inches long and the hilt whereof was battered and rusty  he also stuck a huge brassmounted cavalry pistol in his belt in the virtue of which he had great faith having only two days before shot with it a greenheaded parrot at a distance of two yards  the distance was not great to be sure but it was enough for his purposeintending as he did to meet his foe when the moment of action should come in close conflict and thrust the muzzle of his weapon down the said foes throat before condescending to draw the trigger  thus prepared for the worst he sallied out on tiptoe intending to mount guard at the missionarys door and return to his own proper couch before the break of day  but alas for poor corries powers of endurance no sooner had he extended his chubby form on the doormat earnestly wishing but not expecting that alice would come out and find him there than he fell fast asleep while engaged in the hopeless task of counting the starry hosta duty which he had imposed on himself in the hope that he might thereby be kept awake  once asleep he slept on as a matter of course with his broad little chest heaving gently his round little visage beaming upwards like a terrestrial moon his left arm under his head in lieu of a pillow by consequence of which it was fast asleep also and his right hand grasping the hilt of the broken sabre  as for corries prostrate body affording protection to alicethe entire savage population might have stepped across it one by one and might have stepped back again bearing away into slavery the fair maiden with her father and all the household furniture to boot without in the least disturbing the deep slumbers of the youthful knight  at least we may safely come to this conclusion from the fact that mr mason shook him first gently and then violently for full five minutes before he could get him to speak and even then he only gave utterance in very sleepy tones and halfformed words to the remark  oh don borer me  it aint bkfusttm yet  ho  corrie corrie shouted mr mason giving the victim a shake that threatened to dislocate his neck get up my boyrouse up  hallo hy murder  come on you villeh  mr masoni beg pardon sir stammered corrie as he at length became aware of his condition and blushed deeply ii really mr mason i merely came to watch while you were all asleep as there are savages about you knowand ha ha haoh dear me  corrie exploded at this point unable to contain himself at the sight of the missionarys gaze of astonishment wot a sight for a sunday mornin too  the hilarity of the boy was catching for at this point a vociferous hee hee burst from the sable poopy the clear laugh of alice too came ringing through the passage and mr mason himself finally joined in the chorus  come sir knight exclaimed the latter on recovering his gravity this is no guise for a respectable man to be seen in on sunday morning come in and lay down your arms  you have done very well as a soldier for this occasion let us see if you can do your duty equally well as a churchofficer  have you the keys  no they are at home  then run and get them my boy and leave your pistol behind you  i dare say the savages wont attack during the daytime  corrie did as he was desired and the pastor went after breakfast to spend a short time with alice on a neighbouring eminence from which could be obtained a fine view of the settlement with its little church and the calm bay on which floated the frigate sheltered by the encircling coral reef from the swell of the ocean  here it was mr masons wont to saunter with alice every sunday morning to read a chapter of the bible together and converse about that happy land where one so dear to both of them now dwelt with their saviour here also the childs maid was sometimes privileged to join them  on this particular morning however they were not the only spectators of the beautiful view from that hill for closely hidden in the bushes not fifty yards from the spot where they satlay a band of armed savages who had escaped the vigilance of the scouts and had come by an unguarded pass to the settlement  they might easily have slain or secured the missionary and his household without alarming the people in the village but their plan of attack forbade such a premature proceeding  the trio therefore finished their chapter and their morning prayer undisturbed little dreaming of the number of glittering eyes that watched their proceedings    chapter eight  a surprisea battle and a fire  the sound of the sabbath bell fell sweetly on the pastors ear as he descended to his dwelling to make a few final preparations for the duties of the day and from every hut in sandy cove trooped forth the native christiansyoung and oldto assemble in the house of god  with great labour and much pains had this church been built and pastor and people alike were not a little proud of their handiwork  the former had drawn the plans and given the measurements leaving it to henry stuart to see them properly carried out in detail while the latter did the work  they cut and squared the timbers gathered the coral burnt it for lime and plastered the building  the women and children carried the lime from the beach in baskets and the men dragged the heavy logs from the mountainsin some cases for several milesthe timber in the immediate neighbourhood not being sufficiently large for their purpose  the poor natives worked with heart and soulfor love and the desire to please and to be pleased had been awakened within them  besides this the work had for them all the zest of novelty  they wrought at it with somewhat of the feelings of children at playpausing frequently in the midst of their toil to gaze in wonder and admiration at the growing edifice which would have done no little credit to a professional architect and to more skilled workmen  the white men of the place also lent a willing hand for although some of them were bad men yet they were constrained to respect the consistent character and blameless life of the missionary who not unfrequently experienced the fulfilment of that word  when a mans ways please the lord he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him  besides this all of them however unwilling they might be to accept christianity for themselves were fully alive to the advantages they derived from its introduction among the natives  with so many willing hands at work the little church was soon finished and at the time when the events we are describing occurred there was nothing to be done to it except some trifling arrangements connected with the steeple and the glazing of the windows  this latter piece of work was in such a climate of little importance  long before the bell had ceased to toll the church was full of natives whose dark eager faces were turned towards the door in expectation of the appearance of their pastor  the building was so full that many of the people were content to cluster round the door or the outside of the unglazed windows  on this particular sunday there were strangers there who roused the curiosity and attracted the attention of the congregation  before mr mason arrived there was a slight bustle at the door as captain montague with several of his officers and men entered and were shewn to the missionarys seat by master corrie who with his round visage elongated as much as possible and his round eyes expressing a look of inhuman solemnity in consequence of his attempt to affect a virtue which he did not possess performed the duties of doorkeeper  montague had come on shore to ascertain from mr mason what likelihood there was of an early attack by the natives  wheres alice whispered the boy to poopy as the girl entered the church and seated herself beside a little midshipman who looked at her with a mingled expression of disgust and contempt and edged away  got a little headache hee hee  dont laugh in church you monster said corrie with a frown  ise not larfin retorted poopy with an injured look  just then the boy caught sight of a gigantic figure entering the church and darted away to usher the stranger into the pastors seat but gascoyne for it was he took no notice of him  he passed steadily up the centre of the church and sat down beside the widow stuart whose face expressed anxiety and surprise the moment she observed who was seated there  the countenance of henry who sat on the other side of his mother flushed and he turned with an angry glance towards the captain of the foam but the look was thrown away for gascoyne had placed his arms on the back of the seat in front of him and rested his head on them in which position he continued to remain without motion while the service was going on  mr mason began with a short earnest prayer in english then he read out a hymn in the native tongue which was sung in good tune and with great energy by the whole congregation  this was followed by a chapter in the new testament and another prayer but all the service with the exception of the first prayer was conducted in the native language the text was then read outthough thy sins be as scarlet they shall be white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool  frederick mason possessed the power of chaining the attention of an audience and a deep breathless silence prevailed as he laboured with intense fervour to convince his hearers of the love of god and the willingness and ability of jesus christ to save even the chief of sinners  during one part of the service a deep low groan startled the congregation but no one could tell who had uttered it  as it was not repeated it was soon forgotten by most of the people  while the pastor was thus engaged a pistolshot was heard and immediately after a loud fierce yell burst from the forest causing the ears of those who heard it to tingle and their hearts for a moment to quail  in less than ten minutes the church was empty and the males of the congregation were engaged in a desperate handtohand conflict with the savages who having availed themselves of the one unguarded pass had quietly eluded the vigilance of the scouts and assembled in force on the outskirts of the settlement  fortunately for the worshippers that morning the anxiety of master corrie for the welfare of his fair alice induced him to slip out of the church just after the sermon began  hastening to the pastors house he found the child sound asleep on a sofa and a savage standing over her with a spear in his hand  the boy had approached so stealthily that the savage did not hear him  remembering that he had left his pistol on the kitchen table he darted round to the back door of the house and secured it just as alice awoke with a scream of surprise and terror on beholding who was near her  next moment corrie was at her side and before the savage could seize the child he levelled the pistol at his head and fired  the aim was sufficiently true to cause the ball to graze the mans forehead while the smoke and fire partially blinded him  it was this shot that first alarmed the natives in church and it was the yell uttered by the wounded man as he fell stunned on the floor that called forth the answering yell from the savage host and precipitated the attack  it was sufficiently premature to give the people of the settlement time to seize their arms which as has been said they had placed so as to be available at a moments notice  the fight that ensued was a desperate and almost indiscriminate melee the attacking party had been so sure of taking the people by surprise that they formed no plan of attack but simply arranged that at a given signal from their chief a united rush should be made upon the church and a general massacre ensue  as we have seen corries pistol drew forth the signal sooner than had been intended  in the rush that immediately ensued a party dashed through the house the boy was overturned and a savage gave him a passing blow with a club that would have scattered his brains on the floor had it taken full effect but it was hastily delivered it glanced off his head and spent its force on the shoulder of the chief who was thus unfortunate enough to be wounded by friends as well as foes  on the first alarm gascoyne sprang up and darted through the door  he was closely followed by henry  stuart and the captain of the talisman with his handful of officers and men who were all armed as a matter of course  sit where you are cried henry to his trembling mother as he sprang after gascoyne the church is the safest place youll find  the widow fell on her knees and prayed to god while the fight raged without  among the first to leave the church was the pastor  the thought of his child having been left in the house unprotected filled him with an agony of fear  he sought no weapon of war but darted unarmed straight into the midst of the savage host that stood between him and the object of his affection  his rush was so impetuous that he fairly overturned several of his opponents by dashing against them  the numbers that surrounded him however soon arrested his progress but he had pressed so close in amongst them that they were actually too closely packed for a few seconds to be able to use their heavy clubs and long spears with effect  it was well for the poor missionary at that moment that he had learned the art of boxing when a boy  the knowledge so acquired had never induced him to engage in dishonourable and vulgar strife but it had taught him how and where to deliver a straightforward blow with effect and he now struck out with tremendous energy knocking down an adversary at every blowfor the thought of alice lent additional strength to his powerful arm  success in such warfare however was not to be expected still mr masons activity and vigour averted his own destruction for a few minutes and these minutes were precious for they afforded time for captain montague and his officers to cut their way to the spot where he fought just as a murderous club was about to descend on his head from behind  montagues sword unstrung the arm that upheld it and the next instant the pastor was surrounded by friends  among their number was john bumpus who was one of the crew of montagues boat and who now rushed upon the savages with a howl peculiarly his own felling one with a blow of his fist and another with a slash of his cutlass  you must retire said montague hastily to frederick mason who stood panting and inactive for a few moments in order to recover breath  you are unarmed sir besides your profession forbids you taking part in such work as this  there are men of war enough here to keep these fellows in play  montague spoke somewhat sharply for he erroneously fancied that the missionarys love of fighting had led him into the fray  my profession does not forbid me to save my child exclaimed the pastor wildly  he turned in the direction of his cottage which was full in view and at that moment smoke burst from the roof and windows  with a cry of despair mr mason once more launched himself on the host of savages but these were now so numerous that instead of making head against them the little knot of sailors who opposed them at that particular place found it was as much as they could do to keep them at bay  the issue of the conflict was still doubtful when a large accession to their numbers gave the savages additional power and courage  they made a sudden onset and bore back the small band of white men  in the rush the pastor was overthrown and rendered for a time insensible  while this was going on in one part of the field in another stout ole thorwald with several of the white settlers and the greater part of the native force was guarding the principal approach to the church against immensely superior numbers  and nobly did the descendant of the norse seakings maintain the credit of his warlike ancestors that day  with a sword that might have matched that of goliath of gath he swept the way before him wherever he went and more than once by a furious onset turned the tide of war in favour of his party when it seemed about to overwhelm them  in a more distant part of the field on the banks of a small stream which was spanned by a bridge about fifty paces farther down gascoyne and henry stuart contended almost alone with about thirty savages these two had rushed so impetuously forward at the first onset as to have been separated from their friends and with four christian natives had been surrounded  henry was armed with a heavy claymore the edge of which betokened that it had once seen much service in the wars of the youths scottish ancestors  gascoyne not anticipating this attack had returned to the settlement armed only with his knife  he had seized the first weapon that came to hand which chanced to be an enormous iron shovel and with this terrific implement the giant carried all before him  it was quite unintentionally that he and henry had come together  but the nature and power of the two men being somewhat similar they had singled out the same point of danger and had made their attack with the same overwhelming vehemence  the muscles of both seemed to be made of iron for as increasing numbers pressed upon them they appeared to deliver their terrible blows with increasing rapidity and vigour and the savages despite their numbers began to quail before them  just then keonawho although wounded hovered about doing as much mischief as he could with his left hand which by the way seemed to be almost as efficient as his rightcaught sight of this group of combatants on the banks of the stream  he with a party had succeeded in forcing the bridge and now uttering a shout of wild delight at the sight of his two greatest enemies within his poweras he thoughthe rushed towards them and darted his spear with unerring aim and terrible violence  the mans anger defeated his purpose for the shout attracted the attention of gascoyne who saw the spear coming straight towards henrys breast  he interposed the shovel instantly and the spear fell harmless to the ground  at the same time with a backhanded sweep he brained a gigantic savage who at the moment was engaging henrys undivided attention  bounding forward with a burst of anger gascoyne sought to close with keona  he succeeded but too well however for he could not check himself sufficiently to deliver an effective blow but went crashing against his enemy and the two fell to the ground together  in an instant a rush was made on the fallen man but henry leaped forward and sweeping down two opponents with one cut of his claymore afforded his companion time to leap up  come we are quits said henry with a grim smile as the two darted again on the foe  at that moment ole thorwald having scattered the party he first engaged came tearing down towards the bridge whirling the great sword round his head and shouting victory in the voice of a stentor  hah here is more work he cried as his eye fell on gascoynes figure  thorwald to the rescue hurrah  in another moment the savages were flying pellmell across the bridge with gascoyne and henry close on their heels and the stout merchant panting after them with his victorious band as fast as his less agile limbs could carry him  it was at this moment that gascoyne and henry noticed the attack made on the small party of sailors and observed the fall of mr mason  thorwald to the rescue shouted gascoyne in a voice that rolled deep and loud over the whole field like the roar of a lion  ay ay my noisy stranger its easy for your tough limbs to carry you up the hill gasped ole but the weight of ten or fifteen years will change your step  hurrah  the cry of the bold norseman coupled with that of gascoyne had the double effect of checking the onset of the enemy and of collecting their own scattered forces around them  the battle was now drawing to a point  men who were skirmishing in various places left off and hastened to the spot on which the closing scene was now evidently to be enacted and for a few minutes the contending parties paused as if by mutual consent to breathe and scan each other before making the final attack  it must not be supposed that during the light which we have described the crew of the talisman were idle  at the first sign of disturbance on shore the boats were lowered and a wellarmed force rowed for the landingplace as swiftly as the strong and willing arms of the men could pull  but the distance between the vessel and the shore was considerable and the events we have recounted were quickly enacted so that before the boats had proceeded half the distance the fight was nearly over and the settlement seemed about to be overwhelmed  these facts were not lost upon the first lieutenant of the talisman mr mulroy who with telescope in hand watched the progress of the fight with great anxiety  he saw that it was impossible for the boats to reach the shore in time to render efficient aid  he also observed that a fresh band of savages were hastening to reinforce their comrades and that the united band would be so overpoweringly strong as to render the chances of a successful resistance on the part of the settlers very doubtful indeed almost hopeless  in these circumstances he adopted a course which was as bold as it was dangerous  observing that the savages mustered for the final onset in a dense mass on an eminence which just raised their heads a little above those of the party they were about to attack he at once loaded three of the largest guns with round shot and pointed them at the mass of human beings with the utmost possible care  there was the greatest danger of hitting friends instead of foes but mr mulroy thought it his duty to incur the responsibility of running the risk  montague to whom the command of the united band of settlers had been given by general consent had thrown them rapidly into some sort of order and was about to give the word to charge when the savage host suddenly began to pour down the hill with frantic yells  mulroy did not hear the shouts but he perceived the movement suddenly as if a thunderstorm had burst over the island the echoes of the hills were startled by the roar of heavy artillery and one after another the three guns hurled their deadly contents into the centre of the rushing mass through which three broad lanes were cut in quick succession  the horrible noise and the dreadful slaughter in their ranks seemed to render the affrighted creatures incapable of action for they came to a dead halt  well done mulroy shouted montague forward boyscharge  a true british cheer burst from the tars and white settlers which served farther to strike terror into the hearts of the enemy  in another moment they rushed up the hill led on by montague gascoyne henry and thorwald  but the savages did not await the shock  seized with a complete panic they turned and fled in utter confusion  just as this occurred mr mason began to recover consciousness recollecting suddenly what had occurred he started up and followed his friends who were now in hot pursuit of the foe in the direction of his own cottage  quickly though they ran the anxious father overtook and passed them but he soon perceived that his dwelling was wrapt in flames from end to end  darting through the smoke and fire to his daughters room he shouted her name but no voice replied  he sprang to the bedit was empty  with a cry of despair and blinded by smoke he dashed about the room grasping wildly at objects in the hope that he might find his child  as he did so he stumbled over a prostrate form which he instantly seized raised in his arms and bore out of the blazing house round which a number of the people were now assembled  the form he had thus plucked from destruction was that of the poor boy who would willingly have given his life to rescue alice and who still lay in the state of insensibility into which he had been thrown by the blow from the savages heavy club  the missionary dropped his burden turned wildly round and was about to plunge once again into the heart of the blazing ruin when he was seized in the strong arms of henry stuart who with the assistance of ole thorwald forcibly prevented him from doing that which would have resulted in almost certain death  the pastors head sunk on his breast the excitement of action and hope no longer sustained him with a deep groan he fell to the earth insensible    chapter nine  baffled and perplexedplans for a rescue  while the men assembled round the prostrate form of mr mason were attempting to rescue him from his state of stupor poor corrie began to shew symptoms of returning vitality  a can of water poured over him by henry did much to restore him  but no sooner was he enabled to understand what was going on and to recall what had happened than he sprang up with a wild cry of despair and rushed towards the blazing house  again henrys quick arm arrested a friend in his mad career  oh shes there  alice is there shrieked the boy as he struggled passionately to free himself  you can do nothing corrie said henry trying to soothe him  coward gasped the boy in a paroxysm of rage as he clenched his fist and struck his captor on the chest with all his force  hold him said henry turning to john bumpus who at that moment came up  bumpus nodded intelligently and seized the boy who uttered a groan of anguish as he ceased a struggle which he felt was hopeless in such an iron gripe  now friendsall of you shouted henry the moment he was relieved of his charge little alice is in that housewe must pull it down who will lend a hand  he did not pause for an answer but seizing an axe rushed through the smoke and began to cut down the doorposts  the whole party there assembled numbering about fifty rushed forward as one man to aid in the effort  the attempt was a wild one  had henry considered for a moment he would have seen that in the event of their succeeding in pulling down the blazing pile they should in all probability smother the child in the ruins  the shell is in the outhouse said corrie eagerly to the giant who held him  wot shell inquired bumpus  the shell that they blow like a horn to call the people to work with  ah youre sane again said the sailor releasing him go find it lad and blow till yer cheeks crack  corrie was gone long before jo had concluded even that short remark  in another second the harsh but loud sound of the shell rang over the hillside  the settlers black and white immediately ceased their pursuit of the savages and from every side they came trooping in by dozens  without waiting to inquire the cause of what was being done each man as he arrived fell to work on the blazing edifice and urged on by henrys voice and example toiled and moiled in the midst of fire and smoke until the pastors house was literally pulled to pieces  fortunately for little alice she had been carried out of that house long before by keona who being subtle as well as revengeful knew well how to strike at the tenderest part of the white mans heart  while her friends were thus frantically endeavouring to deliver her from the burning house in which they supposed her to be alice was being hurried through the woods by a steep mountain path in the direction of the native village  happily for the feelings of her father the fact was made known soon after the house had been pulled down by the arrival of a small party of native settlers bearing one of the childs shoes  they had found it they said sticking in the mud about a mile off and had tracked the little footsteps a long way into the mountains by the side of the prints made by the naked feet of a savage  at length they had lost the tracks amid the hard lava rocks and had given up the chase  we must follow them up instantly said mr mason who had by this time recovered no time is to be lost  ay time is precious who will go cried henry who begrimed with fire and smoke and panting vehemently from recent exertion had just at that moment come towards the group  take me  oh take me henry cried corrie in a beseeching tone as he sprang promptly to his friends side  at any other time henry would have smiled at the enthusiastic offer of such a small arm to fight the savages but fierce anger was in his breast at that momenthe turned from the poor boy and looked round with a frown as he observed that although the natives crowded round him at once neither gascoyne nor thorwald nor captain montague shewed any symptom of an intention to accompany him  nay be not angry lad said gascoyne observing the frown your blood is young and hot as it should be but it behoves us to have a council of war before we set out on this expedition which believe me will be no trifling one if i know anything of savage ways and doings  mr gascoyne is right said montague turning to the missionary who stood regarding the party with anxious looks quite unable to offer advice on such an occasion and clasping the little shoe firmly in both hands it seems to me that those who know the customs of savage warfare should give their advice first  you may depend on all the aid that it is in my power to give  ole thorwald is our leader when we are compelled to fight in selfdefence said mr mason would god that it were less frequently we were obliged to demand his services  he knows what is best to be done  i know what is best to do said thorwald when i have to lead men into action or to shew them how to fight  but to say truth i dont plume myself on possessing more than an average share of the qualities of the terrier dog  when niggers are to be hunted out of holes in the mountains like rabbits i will do what in me lies to aid in the work but i would rather be led than lead if you can find a better man  thorwald said this with a rueful countenance for he had hoped to have settled this war in a pitched battle and there were few things the worthy man seemed to enjoy more than a standup fight on level ground a fair field and no favour was his delight but climbing the hills was his mortal aversion  he was somewhat too corpulent and short of wind for that  come gascoyne said henry you know more about the savages than anybody here and if i remember rightly you have told me that you are acquainted with most of the mountain passes  with all of them lad interposed gascoyne i know every pass and cavern on the island  what then would you advise asked montague  if a british officer can put himself under a simple trading skipper said gascoyne i may perhaps shew what ought to be done in this emergency  i can cooperate with any one who proves himself worthy of confidence retorted montague sharply  well then continued the other it is in vain to think of doing any good by a disorderly chase into mountains like these  i would advise that our forces be divided into three  one band under mr thorwald should go round by the goats pass to which i will guide him and cut off the retreat of the savages there  another party under my friend henry stuart should give chase in the direction in which little alice seems to have been taken and a third party consisting of his majestys vessel the talisman and crew should proceed round to the north side of the island and bombard the native village  the goats pass growled thorwald sounds unpleasantly rugged and steep in the ears of a man of my weight and years mister gascoyne  but if theres no easier style of work to be done i fancy i must be content with what falls to my lot  and truly added montague methinks you might have assigned me a more useful as well as more congenial occupation than the bombardment of a mud village full of women and childrenfor i doubt not that every ablebodied man has left it to go on this expedition  you will not find the goats pass so bad as you think good thorwald returned gascoyne for i propose that the talisman or her boats should convey you and your men to the foot of it after which your course will be indeed rugged but it will be shortmerely to scale the face of a precipice that would frighten a goat to think of and then a plain descent into the valley where i doubt not these villains will be found in force and where certainly they will not look for the appearance of a stout generalissimo of half savage troops  as for the bombarding of a mud village mr montague i should have expected a welltrained british officer ready to do his duty whether that duty were agreeable or otherwise  my duty certainly interrupted the young captain hotly but i have yet to learn that your orders constitute my duty  the bland smile with which gascoyne listened to this tended rather to irritate than to soothe montagues feelings but he curbed the passion which stirred his breast while the other went on  no doubt the bombarding of a defenceless village is not pleasant work but the result will be important for it will cause the whole army of savages to rush to the protection of their women and children thereby disconcerting their planssupposing them to have anyand enabling us to attack them while assembled in force  it is the nature of savages to scatter and so to puzzle trained forcesand no doubt those of his majesty are well trained  but one touch of nature makes the whole world kin says a great authority and it is wonderful how useful a knowledge of the various touches of nature is in the art of war  it may not have occurred to mr montague that savages have a tendency to love and protect their wives and children as well as civilised men and that  pray cease your irrelevant remarks they are illtimed said montague impatiently  let us hear the remainder of your suggestions i shall judge of their value and act accordingly  you have not yet told us what part you yourself intend to play in this game  i mean to accompany captain montague if he will permit me  how go with me in the talisman said montague surprised at the mans coolness and puzzled by his impudence  even so said gascoyne  well i have no objection of course but it seems to me that you would be more useful at the head of a party of your own men  perhaps i might replied gascoyne but the coral reefs are dangerous on the north side of the island and it is important that one well acquainted with them should guide your vessel  besides i have a trusty mate and if you will permit me to send my old shipmate john bumpus across the hills he will convey all needful instructions to the foam  this was said in so quiet and straightforward a tone that montagues wrath vanished  he felt ashamed of having shewn so much petulance at a time when affairs of so great importance ought to have been calmly discussed so he at once agreed to allow bumpus to go  meanwhile henry stuart who had been fretting with impatience at this conversation suddenly exclaimed  it seems to me sirs that you are wasting precious time just now  i at least am quite satisfied with the duty assigned to me so im off ho who will join me  im your man cried corrie starting up and flourishing the broken sabre above his head  at the same moment about a hundred natives ranged themselves round the youth thus indicating that they too were his men  well lad away you go said gascoyne smiling but master corrie must remain with me  ill do nothing of the sort said corrie stoutly  oh yes you will my boy  i want you to guide my man bumpus over the mountains  you know the passes and he dont  its all for the good of the cause you knowthe saving of little alice  corrie wavered  the idea of being appointed as it were to a separate command and of going with his new friend was a strong temptation and the assurance that he would in some way or other be advancing the business in hand settled the matter  he consented to become obedient  in about half an hour all gascoynes plans were in course of being carried out  ole thorwald and his party proceeded on board the talisman which weighed anchor and sailed with a light breeze towards the north end of the islandguided through the dangerous reefs by gascoyne  henry and his followers were toiling nimbly up the hills in the direction indicated by the little footprints of alice and john bumpus proceeding into the mountains in another direction pushed under the guidance of corrie towards the bay where the foam still lay quietly at anchor  it was evening when these different parties set out on their various expeditions  the sun was descending to the horizon in a blaze of lurid light  the slight breeze which wafted his britannic majestys ship slowly along the verdant shore was scarcely strong enough to ruffle the surface of the sea  huge banks of dark clouds were gathering in the sky and a hot unnatural closeness seemed to pervade the atmosphere as if a storm were about to burst upon the scene  everything above and below seemed to presage waralike elemental and humanand the various leaders of the several expeditions felt that the approaching night would tax their powers and resources to the uttermost  it was then natural that in such circumstances the bereaved father should be distracted with anxiety as to which party he should join and it was also natural that one whose life had been so long devoted to the special service of his god should before deciding on the point ask on his knees his heavenly fathers guidance  he finally resolved to accompany the party under command of henry stuart    chapter ten  the pursuitpoopy led on by love and hate rushes to the rescue  the shades of night had begun to descend upon the island when master corrie reached the summit of the mountain ridge that divided the bay in which the foam was anchored from the settlement of sandy cove  close on his heels followed the indomitable jo bumpus who panted vehemently and perspired profusely from his unwonted exertions  wot an object you are exclaimed corrie gazing at the hot giant with a look of mingled surprise and gleefor the boys spirit was of that nature which cannot repress a dash of fun even in the midst of anxiety and sorrow  we would not have it understood that the boy ever deliberately mingled the two thingsjoy and sorrowat one and the same time but he was so irresistibly alive to the ludicrous that a touch of it was sufficient at any time to cause him to forget for a brief apace his anxieties whatever these might be  jo bumpus smiled benignantly and said that he was glad to hear it for jo had conceived for the boy that species of fondness which large dogs are frequently known to entertain for small onespermitting them to take outrageous liberties with their persons which they would resent furiously were they attempted by other dogs  presently the warm visage of bumpus elongated and his eyes opened uncommonly wide as he stared at a particular spot in the ground insomuch that corrie burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter  o grampus youll kill me if you go on like that said he i cant stand it  indeed i cant  sich a face  dye know what its like  jo expressed no desire to become enlightened on this point but continued to gaze so earnestly that corrie started up and exclaimedwhat is it jo  a fut replied jo  a footprint i declare shouted the boy springing forward and examining the print which was pretty clearly defined in a little patch of soft sand that lay on the bare rock  why jo its poopys  id know it anywhere by the bigness of the little toe  how can she have come up here  i say lad hist said bumpus in a hoarse whisper heres another fut that dont belong towhats her namepuppy did ye say  why its alices whispered the boy his face becoming instantly grave while an unwonted expression of anxiety crossed it and heres that of a savage beside it  he must have changed his intention or perhaps he came this way to throw the people who were chasing them off the scent  corrie was right  finding that he was hotly pursued keona had taken advantage of the first rocky ground he reached to diverge abruptly from the route he had hitherto followed in his flight and the farther to confuse his pursuers he had taken the almost exhausted child up in his arms and carried her a considerable distance so that if his enemies should fall again on his track the absence of the little footprints might induce them to fancy they were following up a wrong scent  in this he was so far successful for the native settlers as we have seen soon gave up the chase and returned with one of the childs shoes which had fallen off unobserved by the savage  but there was one of the pursuers who was far ahead of the others and who was urged to continue the chase by the strongest of all motives love  poor kekupoopi had no sooner heard of the abduction of her young mistress than she had set off at the top of her speed to a wellknown height in the mountains whence from a great distance she could observe all that went on below  on the wings of affection she had flown rather than walked to this point of observation and to her delight saw not only the pursuers but the fugitives in the valley below  she kept her glowing eyes fixed on them hastening from rock to rock and ridge to ridge as intervening obstacles hid them from view until she saw the stratagem just referred to practised by keona then feeling that she had no power of voice to let the pursuers know what had occurred and seeing that they would certainly turn back on being baffled she resolved to keep up the chase herselftrusting to accident to afford her an opportunity of rendering aid to alice or rather trusting to god to help her in her great difficulty for the poor child had been well trained in the missionarys house and love had been the teacher  taking a short cut down into the valleyfor she was well acquainted with all the wild and rugged paths of the mountains in the immediate neighbourhood of the settlementshe was so fortunate as to reach a narrow pass through which keona and alice must needs go  arriving there a short time before they did she was able to take a few minutes rest before resuming the chase  little did the wily savage think that a pair of eyes as dark and bright though not so fierce as his own were gazing at him from behind the bushes as he sped up that narrow gorge  poor alice was running and stumbling by his side for the monster held her by the hand and dragged her along although she was scarcely able to stand  the heart of the black girl wellnigh burst with anger when she observed that both her shoes and stockings had been torn off in the hasty flight and that her tender feet were cut and bleeding  just as they reached the spot near which poopy was concealed the child sank with a low wail to the ground unable to advance another step keona seized her in his arms and uttering a growl of anger as he threw her rudely over his shoulder bore her swiftly away  but quick though his step was it could not outrun that of the poor little dark maiden who followed him like his shadow carefully keeping out of view however while her mind was was busy with plans for the deliverance of her young mistress  the more she thought the more she felt how utterly hopeless would be any attempt that she could make either by force or stratagem to pluck her from the grasp of one so strong and subtle as keona  at length she resolved to give up thinking of plans altogether and take to prayer instead  on reaching the highest ridge of the mountains keona suddenly stopped placed alice on a flat rock and went to the top of a peak not more than fifty yards off  here he lay down and gazed long and earnestly over the country through which they had just passed evidently for the purpose of discovering if possible the position and motions of his enemies  poopy whose wits were sharpened by love at once took advantage of her opportunity  she crept on all fours towards the rock on which alice lay in such a manner that it came between her person and the savage  missy alice  oh missy alice quick look up its mepoopy said the girl raising her head cautiously above the edge of the rock  alice started up on one elbow and was about to utter a scream of delight and surprise when her sable friend laid her black paw suddenly on the childs pretty mouth and effectually shut it up  hush  alice no cry  savage hear and come backkill poopy bery much quick  listen  me all alone  you bery clibber  dry up eyes no cry any more  look happy  god will save you  poopy nebber leave you as long as got her body in her soul  just at this point keona rose from his recumbent position and the girl who had not suffered her eyes to move from him for a single instant at once sunk behind the rock and crept so silently away that alice could scarcely persuade herself that she had not been dreaming  the savage returned took the childs hand led her over the brow of the mountain and began to descend by a steep rugged path to the valleys lying on the other side of the island  but before going a hundred yards down the dark gorgewhich was rendered all the darker by the approach of nighthe turned abruptly aside entered the mouth of a cavern and disappeared  poopy was horrified at this unexpected and sudden change in the state of things  for a long time she lay closely hid among the rocks within twenty yards of the caves mouth expecting every moment to see the fugitives issue from its dark recesses  but they did not reappear  all at once it occurred to the girl that there might possibly be an exit from the cavern at the other end of it and that while she was idly waiting there her little mistress and her savage captor might be hastening down the mountain far beyond her reach  rendered desperate by this idea she quitted her place of concealment and ran recklessly into the cavern  but the place was dark as erebus and the ground was so rugged that she tripped and fell before she had advanced into it more than fifty yards  bruised by the fall and overawed by the gloom of her situation the poor girl lay still for some time where she had fallen with bated breath and listening intently but no sound struck her ear save the beating of her own heart which appeared to her unnaturally loud  under an impulse of terror she rose and ran back into the open air  here it occurred to her that she might perhaps find the other outlet to the cavesupposing that one really existedby going round the hill and carefully examining the ground on the other side  this however was a matter requiring considerable time and it was not until a full hour had expired that she returned to the mouth of the cave and sat down to rest and consider what should be done next  to enter the dark recesses of the place without a light she knew would be impossible as well as useless and she had no means of procuring a light  besides even if she had what good could come of her exploration  the next impulse was to hasten back to the settlement at full speed and guide a party to the place but was it likely that the savage would remain long in the cave  this question suggested her former idea of the possible existence of another outlet and as she thought upon alice being now utterly beyond her reach she covered her face with her hands and burst into tears  after a short time she began to pray  then as the minutes flew past and her hopes sank lower and lower she commencedlike many a child of adam who thinks himself considerably wiser than a black girlto murmur at her hard lot  this she did in an audible voice having become forgetful of as well as indifferent to the chance of discovery  oh wat for was me born she inquired somewhat viciously and not being able apparently to answer this question she proceeded to comment in a wildly sarcastic tone on the impropriety of her having been brought into existence at all  me should be dead  wats de use o life wen ums nothin to live for alice gone  darling alice  oh dear  me wish i wasnt never had been born yes me do  dont care for meself  wouldnt give nuffin for meself  only fit to tend missy alice  not fit for nuffin else and now alice gonewhar to nobody nose an nobody care xcept poopy whos not worth a brass button  having given utterance to this last expression which she had acquired from her friend corrie the poor girl began to howl in order to relieve her insupportable feelings  it was at this point in our story that master corrie and his companion the grampus having traced the beforementioned footprints for a considerable distance became cognisant of sundry unearthly sounds on hearing which never having heard anything like them before these wanderers stood still in attitudes of breathless attention and gazed at each other with looks of indescribable amazement not altogether unmixed with a dash of consternation    chapter eleven  a ghosta terrible combat ending in a dreadful plunge  corrie said jo bumpus solemnly with a troubled expression on his grave face ive heerd amany a cry in this life both ashore and afloat but since i was half as long as a marlinespike ive never heerd the likes o that there screech nowhere  at any other time the boy would have expressed a doubt as to the possibility of the grampus having at any period of his existence been so short as half the length of a marlinespike but being very imaginative by nature and having been encouraged to believe in ghosts by education he was too frightened to be funny  with a face that might very well have passed for that of a ghost and a very pale ghost too he said in a tremulous voice  oh dear bumpus what shall we do  dun know replied jo very sternly for the stout mariner also believed in ghosts as a matter of course although he would not admit it and being a man of iron mould and powerful will there was at that moment going on within his capacious breast a terrific struggle between natural courage and supernatural cowardice  lets go back whispered corrie  i know another pass over the hills its a longer one to be sure but we can run you know to make for  he was struck dumb and motionless at this point by the recurrence of the dreadful howling louder than ever as poor poopys despair deepened  dont speak to me boy said bumpus still more sternly while a cold sweat stood in large beads on his pale forehead  heres wot i calls somethin new an it becomes a man specially a british seaman dye see to inquire into new things in a reasonable sort of way  jo caught his breath and clutched the rock beside him powerfully as he continued  it aint a ghost in course it cant be that  cause why theres no sich a thing as a ghost  aint there whispered corrie hopefully  the hideous yell that poopy here set up seemed to give the lie direct to the sceptical seaman but he went on deliberately though with a glazed eye and a deathlike pallor on his face  no there aint no ghostsnever wos an never will be  all ghosts is sciencrific dolusions nothing more and its only the hignorant an supercilious as blieves in em  i dont an wots more added jo with tremendous decision i wont  at this point the sciencrific dolusion recurred to her former idea of alarming the settlement and with this view began to retrace her steps howling as she went  of course as jo and his small companion had been guided by her footsteps it followed that poopy in retracing them gradually drew near to the terrified pair  the short twilight of those regions had already deepened into the shades of night so that the poor girls form was not at first visible as she advanced from among the dark shadows of the overhanging cliffs and the large masses of spattered rock that lay strewn about that wild mountain pass  now although john bumpus succeeded by an almost supernatural effort in calming the tumultuous agitation of his spirit while the wild cries of the girl were at some distance he found himself utterly bereft of speech when the dreadful sounds unmistakably approached him  corrie too became livid and both were rooted to the spot in unutterable horror but when the ghost at length actually came into view and owing to poopys body being dark and her garments white presented the appearance of a dimly luminous creature without head arms or legs the last spark of endurance of man and boy went out  the one gave a roar the other a shriek of horror and both turned and fled like the wind over a stretch of country which in happier circumstances they would have crossed with caution  poopy helped to accelerate their flight by giving vent to a cry of fear and thereafter to a yell of delight as from her point of view she recognised the wellknown outline of corries figure clearly defined against the sky  she ran after them in frantic haste but she might as well have chased a couple of wild cats  either terror is gifted with better wings than hope or males are better runners than females perhaps both propositions are true but certain it is that poopy soon began to perceive that the succour which had appeared so suddenly was about to vanish almost as quickly  in this new dilemma the girl once more availed herself of her slight knowledge of the place and made a detour which enabled her to shoot ahead of the fugitives and intercept them in one of the narrowest parts of the mountaingorge  here instead of using her natural voice she conceived that the likeliest way of making her terrified friends understand who she was would be to shout with all the strength of her lungs  accordingly she planted herself suddenly in the centre of their path just as the two came tearing blindly round a corner of rock and set up a series of yells the nature of which utterly beggars description  the result was that with one short wild cry of renewed horror bumpus and corrie turned sharp round and fled in the opposite direction  there is no doubt whatever that they would have succeeded in ultimately escaping from this pertinacious ghost and poor poopy would have had to make the best of her way to sandy cove alone but for the fortunate circumstance that corrie fell and being only a couple of paces in advance of his companion bumpus fell over him  the ghost took advantage of this to run forward crying out corrie corrie  corrieits me me  me with all her might  eh  i do believe it knows my name cried the boy scrambling to his feet and preparing to renew his flight but bumpus laid his heavy hand on his collar and held him fast  wot did it speak  yes listen  oh dear come fly  instead of flying the seaman heaved a deep sigh and sitting down on a rock took out a reddish brown cotton handkerchief wherewith he wiped his forehead  my boy said he still panting it aint a ghost  no ghost wos ever known to speak  they looks an they runs an they yells an they vanishes but they never speaks dye see  i told ye it was a sciencrific dolusion though im bound for to confess i never heerd o von o them critters speakin no more than the ghosts howsomedever thats wot it is  corrie who still hesitated and held himself in readiness to bolt at a moments notice suddenly cried  why i do believe itsno it cant beyesi say its poopy  wots poopy inquired the seaman in some anxiety  what dont you know poopy alices black maid who keeps her company and looks after her besides doin her and undoin her as she calls it night and morning and putting her to bed  hooray  poopy my lovely black darling where have you come from  youve frightened bumpus here nearly out of his wits  i do believe hed have bin dead by this time but for me  so saying corrie in the revulsion of his suddenly relieved feelings actually threw his arms round poopy and hugged her  o corrie exclaimed the girl submitting to the embrace with as much indifference as if she had been a lamppost wat troble you hab give me  why you run so sure you know me voice  know it my sweet lump of charcoal id know it among a thousand if yed only use it in its own pretty natural tones but if you will go and screech like a bottleimp you know said corrie remonstratively how can you expect a stupid feller like me to recognise it  there aint no sich things as bottleimps no more nor ghosts observed bumpus but hold your noise you chatterbox and lets hear wot the gals got to say  mayhap she knows summat about alice  at this poopy manufactured an expression on her sable countenance which was meant to be intensely knowing and suggestive  dont i  yes me do said she  out with it then at once you pot of shoeblacking cried the impatient corrie  the girl immediately related all that she knew regarding the fugitives stammering very much from sheer anxiety to get it all out as fast as she could and delaying her communication very much in consequencebesides rendering her meaning rather obscuresometimes unintelligible  indeed the worthy seaman could scarcely understand a word she said  he sat staring at the whites of her eyes which with her teeth were the only visible parts of her countenance at that moment and swayed his body to and fro as if endeavouring by a mechanical effort to arrive at a philosophical conception of something exceedingly abstruse  but at the end of each period he turned to corrie for a translation  at length both man and boy became aware of the state of things and corrie started up crying  lets go into the cave at once  hold on boy cried bumpus not quite so fast as the monkey said to the barrelorgan wen it took to playin scotch reels we must have a council of war dye see  that black monster keona may have gone right through the cave and comed out at t other end of it in wich case its all up with our chance o findin em tonight  but if theyve gone in to spend the night there why weve nothin to do but watch at the mouth of it till mornin an nab em as they comes out  yes but how are we to know whether theyre in the cave or not said corrie impatiently  ah thats the puzzler replied bumpus in a meditative way but of course we must look out for puzzlers ahead sometimes wen we gets into a land storm dye see just as we looks out ahead for breakers in a storm at sea  suppose now that i creeps into the cave and listens for em  theyd never hear me cause id make no noise  you might as well try to sail into it in a big ship without making noise you grampus  to this the grampus observed that if the cave had only three fathoms of water in the bottom of it he would have no objection whatever to try  but added he suppose you go in  corrie shook his head and looked anxiously miserable  well then said bumpus suppose we light two torches  ill take one in one hand and this here cutlash in the other and youll take tother torch in one hand and your pistol in the other and clap that bit of a broken sword tween yer teeth and well give a horrid screech and rush in pellmellall of a heap like  you could fire yer pistol straight before you on chance its wonderful wot a chance shot will do sometimes an if it dont do nothin fling it right into the blackguards facea brassmounted tool like that ketchin him right on the end of his beak would lay him flat over like a ship in a white squall  and suppose said corrie in a tone of withering sarcasm suppose all this happened to alice instead of the dirty nigger  ah to be sure  thats a puzzlerpuzzler number two  here poopy who had listened with great impatience to the foregoing conversation broke in energetically  an spose said she dat keona and missy alice comes out ob cave wen you two be talkerin sich a lot of stuff  it may as well be remarked in passing that poopy had acquired a considerable amount of her knowledge of english from master corrie  her remark although not politely made was sufficiently striking to cause bumpus to start up and exclaim  thats true gal come shew us the way to this here cave  there was a fourth individual present at this council of war who apparently felt a deep interest in its results although he took no part in its proceedings  this was no other than keona himself who lay extended at full length among the rocks not two yards from the spot where bumpus sat listening intently and grinning from ear to ear with fiendish malice  the series of shrieks howls and yells to which reference has been made had naturally attracted the attention of that wily savage when he was in the cave  following the sounds with quick noiseless step he soon found himself within a few paces of the deliberating trio  the savage did not make much of the conversation but he gathered sufficient to assure himself that his hidingplace had been discovered and that plans were being laid for his capture  it would have been an easy matter for him to have leaped suddenly on the unsuspecting bumpus and driven a knife to his heart after which poor corrie and the girl could have been easily dealt with but fortunately at least for his enemies if not for himself indecision in the moment of action was one of keonas besetting sins  he suspected that other enemies might be near at hand and that the noise of the scuffle might draw them to the spot  he observed moreover that the boy had a pistol which besides being a weapon that acts quickly and surely even in weak hands would give a loud report and a bright flash that might be heard and seen at a great distance  taking these things into consideration he thrust back the knife which he had half unsheathed and retreating with the slow gliding motion of a serpent got beyond the chance of being detected just as bumpus rose to follow poopy to the cave  the savage entered its yawning mouth in a few seconds and glided noiselessly into its dark recesses like an evil spirit  soon after the trio reached the same spot and stood for some time silently gazing upon the thick darkness within  a feeling of awe crept over them as they stood thus and a shudder passed through corries frame as he thought of the innumerable ghosts that mightprobably didinhabit that dismal place  but the thought of alice served partly to drive away his fears and to steel his heart  he felt that the presence of such a sweet and innocent child must somehow or other subdue and baffle the power of evil spirits and it was with some show of firmness that he said  come bumpus lets go in we are better without a torch it would only show that we were coming and as they dont expect us the savage may perhaps kindle a light which will guide us  bumpus who was not sustained by any thoughts of the supposed power or influence of the little girl and whose superstitious fears were again doing furious battle with his natural courage heaved a deep sigh ground his teeth together and clenched his fists  even in that dreadful hour the seamans faith in his physical invincibility and in the terrible power of his fists did not altogether fail  although he wore a cutlass and had used it that day with tremendous effect he did not now draw it  he preferred to engage supernatural enemies with the weapons that nature had given him and entered the cave on tiptoe with slow cautious steps his fists tightly clenched and ready for instant action yet thrust into the pockets of his coatee in a deceptively peaceful way as if he meant to take the ghosts by surprise  corrie followed him also on tiptoe with the broken sabre in his right hand and the cocked pistol in his left his forefinger being on the trigger and the muzzle pointing straight at the small of the seamans backif one may be permitted to talk of such an enormous back having any small about it  poopy entered last also on tiptoe trembling violently holding on with both hands to the waistband of corries trousers and only restrained from instant flight by her anxieties and her strong love for little alice  thus step by step with bated breath and loudly beating hearts pausing often to listen and gasping in a subdued way at times the three friends advanced from the gloom without into the thick darkness within until their gliding forms were swallowed up  now it so happened that the shouts and yells to which we have more than once made reference in this chapter attracted a band of savages who had been put to flight by henry stuarts party  these rascals not knowing what was the cause of so much noise up on the heights and being much too well acquainted with the human voice in all its modifications to fancy that ghosts had anything to do with it cautiously ascended towards the cavern just a few minutes after the disappearance of john bumpus and his companions  here they sat down to hold a palaver  while this was going on keona carried alice in his unwounded arm to the other end of the cave and making his exit through a small opening at its inner extremity bore his trembling captive to a rocky eminence shaped somewhat like a sugarloaf on the summit of which he placed her  so steep were the sides of this cone of lava that it seemed to alice that she was surrounded by precipices over which she must certainly tumble if she dared to move  here keona left her having first however said in a low stern voice  if you moves you dies  the poor child was too much terrified to move even had she dared for she too had heard the unaccountable cries of poopy although owing to distance and the wild nature of these cries she had failed to recognise the voice  when therefore her jailer left her with this threat she coiled herself up in the smallest possible space and began to sob quietly  meanwhile keona reentered the cavern with a diabolical grin on his sable countenance which although it savoured more of evil than of any other quality had in it nevertheless a strong dash of ferocious jovialty as if he were aware that he had got his enemies into a trap and could amuse himself by playing with them as a cat does with a mouse  soon the savage began to step cautiously partly because of the rugged nature of the ground and the thick darkness that surrounded him and partly in order to avoid alarming the three adventurers who were advancing towards him from the other extremity of the cavern  in a few minutes he halted for the footsteps and the whispering voices of his pursuers became distinctly audible to him although all three did their best to make as little noise as possible  wot a orrid place it is exclaimed bumpus in a hoarse angry whisper as he struck his shins violently for at least the tenth time against a ledge of rock  i do blieve boy that theres nobody here and that wed as well bout ship and steer back the way weve comed tho it is a orrible coast for rocks and shoals  to this corrie not being in a talkative humour made no reply  dye hear me boy said jo aloud for he was somewhat shaken again by the dead silence that followed the close of his remark  all right im here said corrie meekly  then why dont ye speak said jo tartly  id advise you not to speak so loud retorted the boy  is the dark un there inquired bumpus  what dye say  the dark un the lump o charcoal you know  oh shes all safe replied corrie i only hope she wont haul the clothes right off my body she grips at my waistband like a  here he was cut short by keona who gave utterance to a low dismal wail that caused the blood and marrow of all three to freeze up and their hearts for a moment to leap into their throats and all but choke them  poopys gone gasped corrie after a few seconds had elapsed  there was no doubt of the fact for besides the relief experienced by the boy from the relaxing of her grip on his waistband the moment the wail was heard the sound of the girls footsteps as she flew back towards the entrance of the cave was distinctly heard  keona waited a minute or two to ascertain the exact position of his enemies then he repeated the wail and swelled it gradually out into a fiendish yell that awoke all the echoes of the place  at the same time guessing his aim as well as he could he threw a spear and discharged a shower of stones at the spot where he supposed they stood  there is no understanding the strange workings of the human mind  the very thing that most people would have expected to strike terror to the heart of bumpus was that which infused courage into his soul  the frightful tones of the savages voice in such a place did indeed almost prostrate the superstitious spirit of the seaman but when he heard the spear whiz past within an inch of his ear and received a large stone full on his chest and several small ones on other parts of his person that instant his strength returned to him like that of samson when the philistines attempted to fall upon him  his curiously philosophical mind at once leaped to the conclusion that although ghosts could yell and look and vanish they could not throw spears or fling stones and that therefore the man they were in search of was actually close beside them  acting on this belief with immense subtlety bumpus uttered a cry of feigned terror and fled followed by the panting corrie who uttered a scream of real terror at what he supposed must be the veritable ghost of the place  but before he had run fifty yards john bumpus suddenly came to a dead halt seized corrie by the collar dragged him down behind a rock and laid his large hand upon his mouth as being the shortest and easiest way of securing silence without the trouble of explanation  as he had anticipated the soft tread of the savage was heard almost immediately after as he passed on in fall pursuit  he brushed close past the spot where bumpus crouched and received from that ablebodied seaman such a blow on the shoulder of his wounded arm as had it been delivered in daylight would have certainly smashed his shoulder blade as it was it caused him to stagger and sent him howling with pain to the mouth of the cavern whither he was followed by the triumphant jo who now made sure of catching him  but there is many a slip twixt the cup and the lip  when keona issued from the cave he was received with a shout by the band of savages who instantly recognised him as their friend by his voice poor poopy was already in their hands having been seized and gagged when she emerged before she had time to utter a cry  and now they stood in a semicircle ready to receive all who might come forth into their arms or on their spearpoints as the case might be  bumpus came out like an insane thunderbolt and corrie like a streak of lightning  instantaneously the flash of the pistol accompanied by its report and a deep growl from bumpus increased the resemblance to these meteorological phenomena and three savages lay stunned upon the ground  this way corrie cried the excited seaman leaping to a perpendicular rock against which he placed his back and raised his fists in a pugilistic attitude  keep one or two in play with your broken toothpick an ill floor em one after another as they comes up  now then ye black baboons come onall at once if ye likean jo bumpusll shew ye wot hes made of  not perceiving very clearly in the dim light caused by a few stars that flickered among the black and gathering clouds the immense size and power of the man with whom they had to deal the savages were not slow to accept this free and generous invitation to come on  they rushed forward in a body intending no doubt to take the man and boy prisoners for if they had wished to slay them nothing would have been easier than to have thrown one or two of their spears at their defenceless breasts  bumpus experienced a vague feeling that he had now a fair opportunity of testing and proving his invincibility yet the desperate nature of the case did not induce him to draw his sword  he preferred his fists as being superior and much more handy weapons  he received the first two savages who came within reach on the knuckles of his right and left hands rendering them utterly insensible and driving them against the two men immediately behind with such tremendous violence that they also were put hors de combat  this was just what bumpus had intended and hoped for  the sudden fall of so many gave him time to launch out his great fists a second time they fell with the weight of sledgehammers on the faces of two more of his opponents flattening their noses and otherwise disfiguring their features besides stretching them on the ground  at the same time corrie flung his empty pistol in the face of a man who attempted to assault his companion on the right flank unawares and laid him prone on the earth  another savage who made the same effort on the left received a gash on the thigh from the broken sabre that sent him howling from the scene of conflict  thus were eight savages disposed of in about as many seconds  but there is a limit to the powers and the prowess of man  the savages on seeing the fall of so many of their companions rushed in on bumpus before he could recover himself for another blow  that is to say the savages behind pushed forward those in front whether they would or no and falling en masse on the unfortunate pair wellnigh buried them alive in black human flesh  bumpuss last cry before being smothered was down with the black varmints and corries last shout was hooray  thus felldespite the undignified manner of their falla couple of as great heroes as were ever heard of in the annals of war not excepting even those of homer himself  now good reader this may be all very well for us to describe and for you to read but it was a terrible thing for poopy to witness  being bound hand and foot she was compelled to look on and to say truth she did look on with uncommon interest  when her friends fell however she expressed her regrets and fears in a subdued shriek for which she received a sounding slap on the cheek from a young savage who had chosen for himself the comparatively dangerous post of watching her while his less courageous friends were fighting  strange to say poopy did not shed more tears as one might have expected on receiving such treatment  she had been used to that sort of thing poor child  before coming to the service of her little mistress she had been brought upit would be more strictly correct to say that she had been kicked and cuffed and pinched and battered upby a stepmother whose chief delight was to pull out handfuls of her woolly hair beat her nose flat which was adding insult to injury for it was too flat by nature and otherwise to maltreat her  when therefore poopy received the slap referred to she immediately dried her eyes and looked humble  but she did not by any means feel humble no a regard for truth compels us to state that on this particular occasion poopy acted the part of a hypocrite  if her hands had been loose and she had possessed a knife just thenwe are afraid to think of the dreadful use to which she would have put it  the natives spent a considerable time in securely binding their three captives after which they bore them into the cavern  here they kindled a torch and held a long palaver as to what was to be done with the prisoners  some counselled instant death others advised that they should be kept as hostages  the debate was so long and fierce that the day had begun to break before it was concluded  it was at length arranged that they should be conveyed alive to their village there to be disposed of according to the instructions of their chiefs  feeling that they had already delayed too long they placed the prisoners on their shoulders and bore them swiftly away  poor corrie and his sable friend were easily carried coiled up like sacks each on the shoulders of a stalwart savage but bumpus who had required eight men to bind him still remained unconvinced of his vincibility  he struggled so violently on the shoulders of the four men who bore him that keona in a fit of passion tinged no doubt with revenge hit him such a blow on the head with the handle of an axe as caused his brains to sing and a host of stars to dance before his eyes  these stars were however purely imaginary for at that time the dawn had extinguished the lesser lights  ere long the bright beams of the rising sun suffused the eastern sky with a golden glow  on passing the place where alice had been left a couple of the party were sent by keona to fetch her  they took the unnecessary precaution of binding the poor child and speedily rejoined their comrades with her in their arms  the amazement of her friends on seeing alice was only equalled by her surprise on beholding them  but they were not permitted to communicate with each other  presently the whole party emerged from the wild mountain gorges through which they had been passing for some time and proceeded in single file along a narrow path that skirted the precipices of the coast  the cliffs here were nearly a hundred feet high  they descended sheer down into deep water in some places even overhung the sea  here john bumpus having recovered from the stunning effects of the blow dealt him by keona renewed his struggles and rendered the passage of the place not only difficult but dangerous to himself as well as to his enemies  just as they reached a somewhat open space on the top of the cliffs jo succeeded by almost superhuman exertion in bursting his bonds  keona foaming with rage gave an angry order to his followers who rushed upon bumpus in a body as he was endeavouring to clear himself of the cords  although john struck out manfully the savages were too quick for him  they raised him suddenly aloft in their arms and hurled him headlong over the cliff  the horror of his friends on witnessing this may easily be imagined but every other feeling was swallowed up in terror when the savages apparently rendered bloodthirsty by what they had done ran towards alice and raising her from the ground hastened to the edge of the cliff evidently with the intention of throwing her over also  before they accomplished their fiendish purpose however a sound like thunder burst upon their ears and arrested their steps  this was immediately followed by another crash and then came a series of single reports in rapid succession which were multiplied by the echoes of the heights until the whole region seemed to tremble with the reverberation  at first the natives seemed awestricken  then on becoming aware that the sounds which originated all this tumult came from the direction of their own village they dropped alice on the ground fled precipitately down the rugged path that led from the heights to the valley and disappeared leaving the three captives bound and helpless on the cliffs    chapter twelve  dangerous navigation and doubtful pilotagemontague is hot gascoyne sarcastic  we turn now to the talisman which it will be remembered we left making her way slowly through the reefs towards the northern end of the island under the pilotage of gascoyne  the storm which had threatened to burst over the island at an earlier period of that evening passed off far to the south  the light breeze which had tempted captain montague to weigh anchor soon died away and before night a profound calm brooded over the deep  when the breeze fell gascoyne went forward and seating himself on a forecastle carronade appeared to fall into a deep reverie  montague paced the quarterdeck impatiently glancing from time to time down the skylight at the barometer which hung in the cabin and at the vane which drooped motionless from the masthead  he acted with the air of a man who was deeply dissatisfied with the existing state of things and who felt inclined to take the laws of nature into his own hands fortunately for nature and himself he was unable to do this  ole thorwald exhibited a striking contrast to the active impatient commander of the vessel  that portly individual having just finished a cigar which the first lieutenant had presented to him on his arrival on board threw the fag end of it into the sea and proceeded leisurely to fill a largeheaded german pipe which was the constant companion of his waking hours and the bowl of which seldom enjoyed a cool moment  ole having filled the pipe lighted it then leaning over the taffrail he gazed placidly into the dark waters which were so perfectly calm that every star in the vault above could be compared with its reflection in the abyss below  ole thorwald excepting when engaged in actual battle was phlegmatic and constitutionally lazy and happy  when enjoying his german pipe he felt inexpressibly serene and did not care to be disturbed  he therefore paid no attention to the angry manner of montague who brushed past him repeatedly in his hasty perambulations but continued to gaze downwards and smoke calmly in a state of placid felicity  you appear to take things coolly mister thorwald said montague half in jest yet with a touch of asperity in his manner  i always do puff when the weathers not warm  puff puff  humph ejaculated montague but the weather is warm just now at least it seems so to meso warm that i should not be surprised if a thunder squall were to burst upon us ere long  not a pleasant place to be caught in a squall returned the other gazing through the voluminous clouds of smoke which he emitted at several coral reefs whose ragged edges just rose to the level of the calm sea without breaking its mirrorlike surface ive seen one or two fine vessels caught that way just hereabouts and go right down in the middle of the breakers  montague smiled and the commanderinchief of the sandy cove army fired innumerable broadsides from his mouth with redoubled energy  that is not a cheering piece of information said he especially when one has reason to believe that a false man stands at the helm  montague uttered the latter part of his speech in a subdued earnest voice and the matteroffact ole turned his eyes slowly towards the man at the wheel but observing that he who presided there was a short fat commonplace and uncommonly jollylooking seaman he merely uttered a grunt and looked at montague inquiringly  nay i mean not the man who actually holds the spokes of the wheel but he who guides the ship  thorwald glanced at gascoyne whose figure was dimly visible in the fore part of the ship and then looking at montague in surprise shook his head gravely as if to say  im still in the darkgo on  can mr thorwald put out his pipe for a few minutes and accompany me to the cabin  i would have a little converse on this matter in private  ole hesitated  well then said the other smiling you may take the pipe with you although it is against rules to smoke in my cabinbut ill make an exception in your case  ole smiled bowed and thanking the captain for his courtesy descended to the cabin along with him and sat down on a sofa in the darkest corner of it  here he smoked vehemently while his companion assuming a rather mysterious air said in an under tone  you have heard of course that the pirate durward has been seen or heard of in those seas  ole nodded  has it ever struck you that this gascoyne as he calls himself knows more about the pirate than he chooses to tell  never replied ole  indeed nothing ever did strike the stout commanderinchief of the forces  all new ideas came to him by slow degrees and did not readily find admission to his perceptive faculties but when they did gain an entrance into his thick head nothing was ever known to drive them out again  as he did not seem inclined to comment on the hint thrown out by his companion montague continued in a still more impressive tone  what would you say if this gascoyne himself turned out to be the pirate  the idea being a simple one and the proper course to follow being rather obvious ole replied with unwonted promptitudeput him in irons of course and hang him as soon as possible  montague laughed  truly that would be a vigorous way of proceeding but as i have no proof of the truth of my suspicions and as the man is my guest at present as well as my pilot it behoves me to act more cautiously  not at all by no means youre quite wrong captain which is the natural result of being youngall young people go more or less it is clearly your duty to catch a pirate anyhow you can as fast as you can and kill him without delay  here the sanguinary thorwald paused to draw and puff into vitality the pipe which was beginning to die down and montague asked  but how dyou know he is the pirate  because you said so replied his friend  nay i said that i suspected him to be durwardnothing more  and what more would you have cried ole whose calm spirit was ruffled with unusual violence at the thought of the hated durward being actually within his reach  for my part i conceive that you are justified in taking him up on suspicion trying him in a formal way just to save appearances on suspicion and hanging him at once on suspicion  quite time enough to inquire into the matter after the villain is comfortably sewed up in a hammock with a thirtypound shot at his heels and sent to the bottom of the sea for the sharks and crabs to devour  suspicion is nine points of the law in these regions captain montague and we never allow the tenth point to interfere with the course of justice one way or another  hang him or shoot him if you prefer it at once that is what i recommend  just as thorwald concluded this amiable piece of advice the deep strong tones of gascoynes voice were heard addressing the first lieutenant  you had better hoist your royals and skyscrapers mr mulroy we shall have a light air off the land presently and it will require all your canvas to carry the ship round the north point so as to bring her guns to bear on the village of the savages  the distance seems to me very short replied the lieutenant and the talisman sails faster than you may suppose with a light wind  i doubt not the sailing qualities of your good ship though i could name a small schooner that would beat them in light wind or storm but you forget that we have to land our stout ally mr thorwald with his men at the goats pass and that will compel us to lose time too much of which has been lost already  without reply the lieutenant turned on his heel and gave the necessary orders to hoist the additional sails while the captain hastened on deck leaving thorwald to finish his pipe in peace and ruminate on the suspicions which had been raised in his mind  in less than half an hour the light wind which gascoyne had predicted came off the land first in a series of what sailors term cats paws and then in a steady breeze which lasted several hours and caused the vessel to slip rapidly through the still water  as he looked anxiously over the bow captain montague felt that he had placed himself completely in the power of the suspected skipper of the foam for coral reefs surrounded him on all sides and many of them passed so close to the ships side that he expected every moment to feel the shock that would wreck his vessel and his hopes at the same time  he blamed himself for trusting a man whom he supposed he had such good reason to doubt but consoled himself by thrusting his hand into his bosom and grasping the handle of a pistol with which in the event of the ship striking he had made up his mind to blow out gascoynes brains  about an hour later the talisman was hoveto off the goats pass and ole thorwald was landed with his party at the base of a cliff which rose sheer up from the sea like a wall  are we to go up there inquired ole in a rueful tone of voice as he surveyed a narrow chasm to which gascoyne guided him  that is the way  its not so bad as it looks  when you get to the top follow the little path that leads along the cliffs northward and you will reach the brow of a hill from which the native village will be visible  descend and attack it at once if you find men to fight with if not take possession quietly  mind you dont take the wrong turn it leads to places where a wildcat would not venture even in daylight  if you attend to what i have said you cant go wrong  good night  shove off  the oars splashed in the sea at the word and gascoyne retained to the ship leaving ole to lead his men up the pass as he best might  it seemed as if the pilot had resolved to make sure of the destruction of the ship that night for not content with running her within a foot or two of innumerable reefs he at last steered in so close to the shore that the beetling cliffs actually seemed to overhang the deck  when the sun rose the breeze died away but sufficient wind continued to fill the upper sails and to urge the vessel gently onward for some time after the surface of the sea was calm  montague endeavoured to conceal and repress his anxiety as long as possible but when at length a line of breakers without any apparent opening presented themselves right ahead he went up to gascoyne and said in a stern under tone  are you aware that you forfeit your life if my vessel strikes  i know it replied gascoyne coolly throwing away the stump of his cigar and lighting a fresh one but i have no desire either to destroy your vessel or to lose my life although to say truth i should have no objection in other circumstances to attempt the one and to risk the other  say you so said montague with a sharp glance at the countenance of the other where however he could perceive nothing but placid good humour that speech sounds marvellously warlike methinks in the mouth of a sandalwood trader  think you then said gascoyne with a smile of contempt that it is only your fireeating men of war who experience bold impulses and heroic desires  nay but traders are not wont to aspire to the honour of fighting the ships that are commissioned to protect them  truly if i had sought protection from the warships of the king of england i must have sailed long and far to find it returned gascoyne it is no childs play to navigate these seas where bloodthirsty savages swarm in their canoes like locusts  moreover i sail as i have told you before in the china seas where pirates are more common than honest traders  what would you say if i were to take it into my head to protect myself  that you were well able to do so answered montague with a smile but when i examined the foam i found no arms save a few cutlasses and rusty muskets that did not seem to have been in recent use  a few bold men can defend themselves with any kind of weapons  my men are stout fellows not used to flinch at the sound of a round shot passing over their heads  the conversation was interrupted here by the ship rounding a point and suddenly opening up a view of a fine bay at the head of which embosomed in trees and dense underwood stood the native village of which they were in search  just in front of this village lay a small but high and thickly wooded island which as it were filled up the head of the bay sheltering it completely from the ocean and making the part of the sea which washed the shores in front of the houses resemble a deep and broad canal  this stripe of water was wide and deep enough to permit of a vessel of the largest size passing through it but to any one approaching the place for the first time there seemed to be no passage for any sort of craft larger than a native canoe  the island itself was high enough to conceal the talisman completely from the natives until she was within half gunshot of the shore  gascoyne still stood on the fore part of the ship as she neared this spot which was so beset with reefs and rocks that her escape seemed miraculous  i think we are near enough for the work that we have to do suggested montague in some anxiety  just about it mr montague said gascoyne as he turned towards the stern and shouted  port your helm  port it is answered the man at the wheel  steady  back the topsails mr mulroy  the sails were backed at once and the ship became motionless with her broadside to the village  what are we to do now mr gascoyne inquired montague smiling in spite of himself at the strange position in which he found himself  fire away at the village as hard as you can replied gascoyne returning the smile  what do you really advise me to bombard a defenceless place in which as far as i can see there are none but women and children  even so returned the other carelessly at the same time i would advise you to give it them with blank cartridge  and to what purpose such waste of powder inquired montague  the furthering of the plans which i have been appointed to carry out answered gascoyne somewhat stiffly as he turned on his heel and walked away  the young captain reddened and bit his lip as he gave the order to load the guns with blank cartridge and made preparation to fire this harmless broadside on the village  the word to fire had barely crossed his lips when the rocks around seemed to tremble with the crash of a shot that came apparently from the other side of the island for its smoke was visible although the vessel that discharged it was concealed behind the point  the talismans broadside followed so quickly that the two discharges were blended in one    chapter thirteen  doings on board the foam  the nature of this part of our story requires that we should turn back repeatedly in order to trace the movements of the different parties which cooperated with each other  while the warlike demonstrations we have described were being made by the british cruiser the crew of the foam were not idle  in consequence of the capture of bumpus by the savages gascoynes message was of course not delivered to manton and the first mate of the sandalwood trader would have known nothing about the fight that raged on the other side of the island on the sunday but for the three shots fired by the first lieutenant of the talisman which decided the fate of the day  being curious to know the cause of the firing manton climbed the mountains until he gained the dividing ridgewhich however he did not succeed in doing till late in the afternoon the way being rugged as well as long  here he almost walked into the midst of a flying party of the beaten savages but dropping suddenly behind a rock he escaped their notice  the haste with which they ran and the wounds visible on the persons of many of them were sufficient to acquaint the mate of the foam with the fact that a fight had taken place in which the savages had been beaten and his knowledge of the state of affairs on the island enabled him to jump at once to the correct conclusion that the christian village had been attacked  a satanic smile played on the countenance of the mate as he watched the savages until they were out of sight then quitting his place of concealment he hurried back to the schooner which he reached some time after nightfall  immediately on gaining the deck he gave orders to haul the chain of the anchor short to shake out the sails and to make other preparations to avail himself without delay of the light breeze off the land which his knowledge of the weather and the locality taught him to look for before morning  while his orders were being executed a boat came alongside with that part of the crew which had been sent ashore by gascoyne to escape the eye of the british commander  it was in charge of the second matea short but thickset and extremely powerful man of the name of scraggswho walked up to his superior the moment he came on board and in a tone somewhat disrespectful asked what was going to be done  dont you see growled manton were getting ready to sail  of course i see that retorted scraggs between whom and his superior officer there existed a feeling of jealousy as well as of mutual antipathy for reasons which will be seen hereafter but i should like to know where we are going and why we are going anywhere without the captain  i suppose i am entitled to ask that much  its your business to obey orders said manton angrily  not if they are in opposition to the captains orders replied scraggs firmly but in a more respectful tone for in proportion as he became more mutinous he felt that he could afford to become more deferential  the captains last orders to you were to remain where you are i heard him give them and i do not feel it my duty to disobey him at your bidding  youll find too that the crew are of my way of thinking  mantons face flushed crimson and for a moment he felt inclined to seize a handspike and fell the refractory second mate therewith but the looks of a few of the men who were standing by and had overheard the conversation convinced him that a violent course of procedure would do him injury  swallowing his passion therefore as he best could he said  come mr scraggs i did not expect that you would set a mutinous example to the men and if it were not that you do so out of respect for the supposed orders of the captain i would put you in irons at once  scraggs smiled sarcastically at this threat but made no reply and the mate continued  the captain did indeed order me to remain where we are but i have since discovered that the black dogs have attacked the christian settlement as it is called and you know as well as i do that gascoyne would not let slip the chance to pitch into the undefended village of the niggers and pay them off for the mischief they have done to us more than once  at any rate i mean to go round and blow down their log huts with long tom so you can go ashore if you dont like the work  manton knew well when he made this allusion to mischief formerly done to the crew of the foam that he touched a rankling sore in the breast of scraggs who in a skirmish with the natives some time before had lost an eye and the idea of revenging himself on the defenceless women and children of his enemies was so congenial to the mind of the second mate that his objections to act willingly under mantons orders were at once removed  ha said he commencing to pace to and fro on the quarterdeck with his superior officer while the men made the necessary preparations for the intended assault that alters the case mr manton  i dont think however that gascoyne would have taken advantage of the chance to give the brutes what they deserve for i must say he does seem to be unaccountably chickenhearted perhaps its as well that hes out of the way  do you happen to know where he is or what hes doing  not i  no doubt he is playing some sly game with this british cruiser and i dare say he may be lending a hand to the settlers for hes got some strange interests to look after there you know here both men laughed and i shouldnt wonder if he was beforehand with us in pitching into the niggers  he is always ready enough to fight in selfdefence though we can never get him screwed up to the assaulting point  ay we saw something of the fighting from the hill tops but as it is no business of ours i brought the men down in case they might be wanted aboard  quite right scraggs  youre a judicious fellow to send on a dangerous expedition  im not sure however that gascoyne would thank you for leaving him to fight the savages alone  manton chuckled as he said this and scraggs grinned maliciously as he replied  well it cant exactly be said that ive left him seeing that i have not been with him since we parted aboard of this schooner and as to his fightin the niggers alonehasnt he got ever so many hundred christian niggers to help him to lick the others  true said manton while a smile of contempt curled his lip  but here comes the breeze and the sun wont be long behind it  all the better for the work weve got to do  mind your helm there  here lads take a pull at the topsail halyards and some of you get the nightcap off long tom  i say mr scraggs should we shew them the red by way of comforting their hearts  scraggs shook his head dubiously  you forget the cruiser  she has eyes aboard and may chance to set them on that same red in which case its likely she would shew us her teeth  and what then demanded manton are you also growing chickenhearted  besides he added in a milder tone the cruiser is quietly at anchor on the other side of the island and theres not a captain in the british navy who could take a pinnace much less a ship through the reefs at the north end of the island without a pilot  well returned scraggs carelessly do as you please  its all one to me  while the two officers were conversing the active crew of the foam were busily engaged in carrying out the orders of manton and the graceful schooner glided swiftly along the coast before the same breeze which urged the talisman to the north end of the island  the former having few reefs to avoid approached her destination much more rapidly than the latter and there is no doubt that she would have arrived first on the scene of action had not the height and form of the cliffs prevented the wind from filling her sails on two or three occasions  meanwhile in obedience to mantons orders a great and very peculiar change was effected in the outward aspect of the foam  to one unacquainted with the character of the schooner the proceedings of her crew must have seemed unaccountable as well as surprising  the carpenter and his assistants were slung over the sides of the vessel upon which they plied their screwdrivers for a considerable time with great energy but apparently with very little result  in the course of a quarter of an hour however a long narrow plank was loosened which when stripped off discovered a narrow line of bright scarlet running quite round the vessel a little more than a foot above the waterline  this having been accomplished they next proceeded to the figurehead and unscrewing the white lady who smiled there fixed in her place a hideous griffins head which like the ribbon was also bright scarlet  while these changes were being effected others of the crew removed the boat that lay on the deck bottom up between the masts and uncovered a long brass pivotgun of the largest calibre which shone in the saffron light of morning like a mass of burnished gold  this gun was kept scrupulously clean and neat in all its arrangements the rammers sponges screws and other apparatus belonging to it were neatly arranged beside it and four or five of its enormous iron shot were piled under its muzzle  the traversing gear connected with it was well greased and in short everything about the gun gave proof of the care that was bestowed on it  but these were not the only alterations made in the mysterious schooner round both masts were piled a number of muskets boardingpikes cutlasses and pistols all of which were perfectly clean and bright and the menfierce enough and warlike in their aspect at all timeshad now rendered themselves doubly so by putting on broad belts with pistols therein and tucking up their sleeves to the shoulders thereby displaying their brawny arms as if they had dirty work before them this strange metamorphosis was finally completed when manton with his own hands ran up to the peak of the mainsail a bright scarlet flag with the single word avenger on it in large black letters  during one of those lulls in the breeze to which we have referred and while the smooth ocean glowed in the mellow light that ushered in the day the attention of those on board the avenger as we shall call the doublefaced schooner when under red colours was attracted to one of the more distant cliffs on the summit of which human beings appeared to be moving  hand me that glass said manton to one of the men beside him  i shouldnt wonder if the niggers were up to some mischief there  ah just so he exclaimed adjusting the telescope a little more correctly and again applying it to his eye  they seem to be scuffling on the top of yonder precipice  now theres one fellow down but its so far off that i cant make out clearly what theyre about  i say mr scraggs get the other glass and take a squint at themyou are farther sighted than i am  youre right they are killin one another up yonder observed scraggs surveying the group on the cliffs with calm indifference  here comes the breeze exclaimed manton with a look of satisfaction now look alive lads we shall be close on the nigger village in five minutesits just round the point of this small island close ahead come mr scraggs weve other business on hand just now than squinting at the scrimmages of these fellows  hold on cried scraggs with a grin i do believe theyre going to pitch a feller over that cliff  what a crack hell come down into the water with to be sure  its to be hoped the poor man is dead for his own sake before he takes that flight  hallo added scraggs with an energetic shout and a look of surprise i say thats one of our men i know him by his striped flannel shirt  if he would only give up kicking for a second id make out hishumph its all up with him now poor fellow whoever he is  as he said the last words the figure of a man was seen to shoot out from the cliff and descending with ever increasing rapidity to strike the water with terrific violence sending up a jet of white foam as it disappeared  stand by to lower the gig shouted manton  ay ay sir was the hearty response of the men as some of them sprang to obey  lower away  the boat struck the water and its crew were on the thwarts in a moment at the same time the point of the island was passed and the native village opened up to view  load long tomdouble shot roared manton whose ire was raised not so much at the idea of a fellowcreature having been so barbarously murdered as at the notion of one of the crew of his schooner having been so treated by contemptible niggers  away lads and pick up that man  its of no use remonstrated scraggs hes done for by this time  i know it said manton with a fierce oath bring him in dead or alive if the sharks leave an inch of him bring it to me  ill make the black villains eat it raw  this ferocious threat was interlarded with and followed by a series of terrible oaths which we think it inadvisable to repeat  starboard he shouted to the man at the helm as soon as the boat shot away on its mission of mercy  starboard it is  steady  while he gave these orders manton sighted the brass gun carefully and just as the schooners head came up to the wind he applied the match  instantly a cloud of smoke obscured the centre of the little vessel as if her powder magazine had blown up and a deafening roar went ringing and reverberating from cliff to cliff as two of the great iron shot were sent groaning through the air and pitched right into the heart of the village  it was this tremendous shot from long tom followed almost instantaneously by the entire broadside of the talisman that saved the life of alice possibly the lives of her young companions also that struck terror to the hearts of the savages causing them to converge towards their defenceless homes from all directions and that apprised ole thorwald and henry stuart that the assault on the village had commenced in earnest    chapter fourteen  greater mysteries than evera bold move and a clever escape  we return now to the talisman  the instant the broadside of the cruiser burst with such violence and in such close proximity on mantons ears he felt that he had run into the very jaws of the lion and that escape was almost impossible  the bold heart of the pirate quailed at the thought of his impending fate but the fear caused by conscious guilt was momentary his constitutional courage returned so violently as to render him reckless  it was too late to put about and avoid being seen for before the shot was fired the schooner had already almost run into the narrow channel between the island and the shore  a few seconds later she sailed gracefully into view of the amazed montague who at once recognised the pirate vessel from gascoynes faithful description of her and hurriedly gave orders to load with ball and grape while a boat was lowered in order to slew the ship round more rapidly so as to bring her broadside to bear on the schooner  to say that gascoyne beheld all this unmoved would be to give a false impression of the man  he knew the ring of his great gun too well to require the schooner to come in sight in order to convince him that his vessel was near at hand  when therefore she appeared and montague turned to him with a hasty glance of suspicion and pointed to her he had completely banished every trace of feeling from his countenance and sat on the taffrail puffing his cigar with an air of calm satisfaction nodding to montagues glance of inquiry he said  ay thats the pirate  i told you he was a bold fellow but i did not think he was quite so bold as to attempt this  to do gascoyne justice he told the plain truth here for having sent a peremptory order to his mate by john bumpus not to move from his anchorage on any account whatever he was not a little surprised as well as enraged at what he supposed was mantons mutinous conduct  but as we have said his feelings were confined to his breastthey found no index in his grave face  montague suspected nevertheless that his pilot was assuming a composure which he did not feel for from the manner of the meeting of the two vessels he was persuaded that it was as little expected on the part of the pirates as of himself  it was with a feeling of curiosity therefore as to what reply he should receive that he put the question  what would mr gascoyne advise me to do now  blow the villains out of the water was the quick answer i would have done so before now had i been you  perhaps you might but not much sooner retorted the other pointing to the guns which were ready loaded while the men stood at their stations matches in hand only waiting for the broadside to be brought to bear on the little vessel when an iron shower would be sent against her which must at such short range have infallibly sent her to the bottom  the mate of the pirate schooner was quite alive to his danger and had taken the only means in his power to prevent it  close to where his vessel lay a large rock rose between the shore of the large island and the islet in the bay which has been described as separating the two vessels from each other  owing to the formation of the coast at this place a powerful stream ran between the rock and this islet at low tide  it happened to be flowing out at that time like a millrace manton saw that the schooner was being sucked into this stream  in other circumstances he would have endeavoured to avoid the danger for the channel was barely wide enough to allow even a small craft to pass between the rocks but now he resolved to risk it  he knew that any attempt to put the schooner about would only hasten the efforts of the cruiser to bring her broadside to bear on him  he also knew that in the course of a few seconds he would be carried through the stream into the shelter of the rocky point  he therefore ordered the men to lie down on the deck while in a careless manner he slewed the big brass gun round so as to point it at the manofwar  gascoyne at once understood the intended manoeuvre of his mate and in spite of himself a gleam of triumph shot from his eyes  montague himself suspected that his prize was not altogether so sure as he had deemed it and he urged the men in the boat to put forth their utmost efforts  the talisman was almost slewed into position when the pirate schooner was observed to move rapidly through the water stern foremost in the direction of the point  at first montague could scarcely credit his eyes but when he saw the end of the mainboom pass behind the point he became painfully alive to the fact that the whole vessel would certainly follow in the course of a few seconds  although the most of his guns were still not sufficiently well pointed he gave the order to fire them in succession  the entire broadside burst in this manner from the side of the talisman with a prolonged and mighty crash or roar and tore up the waters of the narrow channel  most of the iron storm passed close by the head of the pirate  however only one ball took effect it touched the end of the bowsprit and sent the jibboom into the air in splinters  manton applied the match to the brass gun almost at the same moment and the heavy ringing roar of her explosion seemed like a prolonged echo of the broadside  the gun was well aimed but the schooner had already passed so far behind the point that the ball struck a projecting part of the cliff dashed it into atoms and glancing upwards passed through the cap of the talismans mizzenmast and brought the lower yard with all its gear rattling down on the quarterdeck  when the smoke cleared away the avenger had vanished from the scene  to put the ship about and follow the pirate schooner was the first impulse of montague but on second thoughts he felt that the risk of getting on the rocks in the narrow channel was too great to be lightly run  he therefore gave orders to warp the ship about and steer round the islet on the other side of which he fully expected to find the pirate  but time was lost in attempting to do this in consequence of the wreck of the mizzenmast having fouled the rudder  when the talisman at last got under way and rounded the outside point of the islet no vessel of any kind was to be seen  amazed beyond measure and deeply chagrined the unfortunate captain of the manofwar turned to gascoyne who still sat quietly on the taffrail smoking his cigar  does this pirate schooner sport wings as well as sails said he for unless she does and has flown over the mountains i cannot see how she could disappear in so short a space of time  i told you the pirate was a bold man and now he has proved himself a clever fellow  whether he sports wings or no is best known to himself perhaps he can dive  if so we have only to watch until he comes to the surface and shoot him leisurely  well he is off there is no doubt of that returned montague  and now mr gascoyne since it is vain for me to chase a vessel possessed of such mysterious qualities you will not object i daresay to guide my ship to the bay where your own little schooner lies  i have a fancy to anchor there  by all means said gascoyne coolly  it will afford me much pleasure to do as you wish and to have you alongside of my little craft  montague was surprised at the perfect coolness with which the other received this proposal  he was persuaded that there must be some mysterious connexion between the pirate schooner and the sandalwood trader although his ideas on this point were somewhat undefined and confused and he had expected that gascoyne would have shewn some symptoms of perplexity on being thus ordered to conduct the talisman to a spot where he suspected no schooner would be found or if found would appear under such a changed aspect as to warrant his seizing it on suspicion  as gascoyne however shewed perfect willingness to obey the order he turned away and left his strange pilot to conduct the ship through the reefs having previously given him to understand that the touching of a rock and the termination of his gascoynes life would certainly be simultaneous events  meanwhile the avenger alias the foam had steered direct for the shore into which she apparently ran and disappeared like a phantomship  the coast of this part of the island where the events we are narrating occurred was peculiarly formed  there were several narrow inlets in the high cliffs which were exceedingly deep but barely wide enough to admit of the passage of a large boat or a small vessel many of these inlets or creeks which in some respects resembled the narrow fjords of norway though on a miniature scale were so thickly fringed with trees and the luxuriant undergrowth peculiar to southern climes that their existence could not be detected from the sea indeed even after the entrance to any one of them was discovered no one would have imagined it to extend so far inland  two of those deep narrow inlets opening from opposite sides of the cape which lay close to the islet above referred to had approached so close to each other at their upper extremities that they had at last met in consequence of the sea undermining and throwing down the cliff that separated them  thus the cape was in reality an island and the two united inlets formed a narrow strait through which the avenger passed to her former anchorage by means of four pair of powerful sweeps or oars  this secret passage was well known to the pirates and it was with a lurking feeling that it might some day prove of use to him that gascoyne invariably anchored near to it when he visited the island as a sandalwood trader  during the transit the carpenters of the schooner were not idle  the red streak and flag and griffins head were removed the big gun was covered with the long boat and the vessel which entered the one end of the channel as the warlike avenger issued from the other side as the peaceful foam and rowing to her former anchorage dropt anchor  the shattered jibboom had been replaced by a spare one and part of the crew were stowed away under the cargo in an empty space of the hold reserved for this special purpose and for concealing arms  a few of them were also landed not far from the cliff over which poor bumpus had been thrown with orders to remain concealed and be ready to embark at a moments notice  soon after the schooner anchored the boat which had been sent off in search of the body of our unfortunate seaman returned having failed to discover the object for which it was sent out  the breeze had by this time died away almost entirely so that three hours elapsed before the talisman rounded the point stood into the bay and dropt anchor at a distance of about two miles from the suspected schooner    chapter fifteen  remarkable doings of poopyextraordinary case of resuscitation  it is time now to return to our unfortunate friends corrie alice and poopy who have been left long enough exposed on the summit of the cliffs from which they had expected to be tossed by the savages when the guns of the talisman so opportunely saved them  the reader will observe that these incidents which have taken so long to narrate were enacted in a very brief space of time  only a few hours elapsed between the firing of the broadside already referred to and the anchoring of the talisman in the bay where the foam had cast anchor some time before her yet in this short space of time many things occurred on the island which are worthy of particular notice  as we have already remarked corrie and his two companions in misfortune had been bound and in this condition were left by the savages to their fate  their respective positions were by no means enviable  poor alice lay near the edge of the cliff with her wrists and ankles so securely tied that no effort of which she was capable could set her free  poopy lay about ten yards farther up the cliff flat on her sable back with her hands tied behind her and her ankles also secured so that she could by no means attain to a sitting position although she made violent and extraordinary efforts to do so  we say extraordinary because poopy being ingenious hit upon many devices of an unheard of nature to accomplish her object  among others she attempted to turn heels over head hoping thus to get upon her knees and there is no doubt whatever that she would have succeeded in this had not the formation of the ground been exceedingly unfavourable for such a manoeuvre  corrie had shewn such an amount of desperate vindictiveness in the way of kicking hitting biting scratching and pinching when the savages were securing him that they gave him five or six extra coils of the rope of cocoanut fibre with which they bound him  consequently he could not move any of his limbs and he now lay on his side between alice and poopy gazing with much earnestness and no little astonishment at the peculiar contortions of the latter  youll never manage it poopy he remarked in a sad tone of voice on beholding the poor girl balanced on the small of her back preparatory to making a spring that might have reminded one of the leaps of a trout when thrown from its native element upon the bank of a river  and youll break your neck if you go on like that he added on observing that having failed in these attempts she recurred to the heelsoverhead processbut all in vain  oh me sighed poopy as she fell back in a fit of exhaustion  its be all hup wid us  dont say that you goose whispered corrie youll frighten alice you will  will me whispered poopy in a tone of selfreproach then in a loud voice oh no it not all hup yet miss alice  see me go at it agin  and go at it she did in a way that actually alarmed her companions at any other time corrie would have exploded with laughter but the poor boy was thoroughly overwhelmed by the suddenness and the extent of his misfortune  the image of bumpus disappearing headlong over that terrible cliff had filled his heart with a feeling of horror which nothing could allay and grave thoughts at the desperate case of poor little alice for he neither thought of nor cared for poopy or himself sank like a weight of lead upon his spirit  dont try it any more dear poopy said alice entreatingly youll only hurt yourself and tear your frock  i feel sure that some one will be sent to deliver us  dont you corrie  the tone in which this question was put shewed that the poor child did not feel quite so certain of the arrival of succour as her words implied  corrie perceived this at once and with the heroism of a true lover he crushed back the feelings of anxiety and alarm which were creeping over his own stout little heart in spite of his brave words and gave utterance to encouraging expressions and even to slightly jovial sentiments which tended very much to comfort alice and poopy too  sure he exclaimed rolling on his other side to obtain a view of the child for owing to his position and his fettered condition he had to turn on his right side when he wished to look at poopy and on his left when he addressed himself to alice sure why of course im sure dye think your father would leave you lying out in the cold all night  no that i am certain he would not cried alice enthusiastically but then he does not know we are here and will never think of looking for us in such an unlikely place  humph that only shews your ignorance said corrie  well i dare say i am very ignorant replied alice meekly  no no  i dont mean that cried corrie with a feeling of selfreproach  i dont mean to say that youre ignorant in a general way you know but only about what men are likely to do dye see when theyre hard put to it you understand  our feelings are so different from yours you know andand  here corrie broke down and in order to change the subject abruptly he rolled round towards poopy and cried with considerable asperity  what on earth dye mean kickup by wriggling about your black body in that fashion  if you dont stop it youll fetch way down the hill and go slap over the precipice carrying alice and me along with you  give it up now dye hear  no me wont cried poopy with great passion while tears sprang from her large eyes and coursed over her sable cheeks  me will bust dem ropes  more likely to do that to yourself if you go on like that returned corrie  but i say alice cheer up here he rolled round on his other side ive been pondering a plan all this time to set us free and now im going to try it  the only bother about it is that these rascally savages have dropt me beside a pool of half soft mud that i cant help sticking my head into if i try to move  oh then dont move dear corrie said alice in an imploring tone of voice we can lie here quite comfortably till papa comes  ah yes said corrie that reminds me that i was saying we men feel and act so different from you women  now it strikes me that your father will go to all the most unlikely parts of the island first knowin very well that niggers dont hide in likely places  but as it may be a long time before he finds ushe sighed deeply here not feeling much confidence in the success of the missionarys searchi shall tell you my plan and then try to carry it out  here he sighed again more deeply than before not feeling by any means confident of the success of his own efforts  and what is your plan inquired alice eagerly for the child had unbounded belief in corries ability to do almost anything he chose to attempt and corrie knew this and was proud as a peacock in consequence  ill get up on my knees said he and then once on them i can easily rise to my feet and hop to you and free you  on this explanation of his elaborate and difficult plan alice made no observation for some time because even to her faculties which were obtuse enough on mechanical matters it was abundantly evident that the boys hands being tied firmly behind his back he could neither cut the ropes that bound her nor untie them  what dye think alice  i fear it wont do your hands are tied corrie  oh thats nothing  the only difficulty is how to get on my knees  surely that cannot be very difficult when you talk of getting on your feet  ha that shews youre ai mean dye see that the difficulty lies here my elbows are lashed so fast to my side that i cant use them to prop me up but if poopy will roll down the hill to my side and shove her pretty shoulder under my back when i raise it perhaps i may succeed in getting up  what say you kickup  hee hee laughed the girl dats fuss rate  look out  poopy although sluggish by nature was rather abrupt and violent in her impulses at times  without further warning than the above brief exclamation she rolled herself towards corrie with such goodwill that she went quite over him and would certainly have passed onward to where alice layperhaps over the cliff altogetherhad not the boy caught her sleeve with his teeth and held her fast  the plan was eminently successful  by a series of jerks on the part of corrie and proppings on the part of poopy the former was enabled to attain to a kneeling position not however without a few failures in one of which he fell forward on his face and left a deep impression of his fat little nose in the mud  having risen to his feet corrie at once hopped towards alice after the fashion of those country wights who indulge in sack races and going down on his knees beside her began diligently to gnaw the rope that bound her with his teeth  this was by no means an easy or a quick process  he gnawed and bit at it long before the tough rope gave way at length alice was freed and she immediately set to work to undo the fastenings of the other two but her delicate fingers were not well suited to such rough work and a considerable time elapsed before the three were finally at large  the instant they were so corrie said now we must go down to the foot of the cliff and look for poor bumpus  oh dear me i doubt he is killed  the look of horror which all three cast over the stupendous precipice shewed that they had little hope of ever again seeing their rugged friend alive  but without wasting time in idle remarks they at once hastened to the foot of the cliff by the shortest route they could find here after a short time they discovered the object of their solicitude lying apparently dead on his back among the rocks  when bumpus struck the water after being tossed over the cliff his head was fortunately downward and his skull being the thickest and hardest bone in his body had withstood the terrible shock to which it had been subjected without damage though the brain within was for a time incapacitated from doing duty  when john rose again to the surface after a descent into unfathomable water he floated there in a state of insensibility  fortunately the wind and tide combined to wash him to the shore where a higher swell than usual launched him among the coral rocks and left him there with only his feet in the water  oh here he is hurrah shouted corrie on catching sight of the prostrate form of the seaman  but the boys manner changed the instant he observed the colour of the mans face from which all the blood had been driven leaving it like a piece of brown leather  hes dead said alice wringing her hands in despair  prhaps not suggested poopy with a look of deep wisdom as she gazed on the upturned face  anyhow we must haul him out of the water said corrie whose chest heaved with the effort he made to repress his tears  catching up one of bumpuss huge hands the boy ordered alice to grasp the other  poopy without waiting for orders seized hold of the hair of his head and all three began to haul with might and main  but they might as well have tried to pull a lineofbattle ship up on the shore the mans bulky form was immovable  seeing this they changed their plan and all three grasping his legs slewed him partially round and thus drew his feet out of the water  now we must warm him said corrie eagerly for the first shock of the discovery of the supposed dead body of his friend being over the sanguine boy began to entertain hopes of resuscitating him  ive heard that the best thing for drowned people is to warm them so alice do you take one hand and arm poopy will take the other and i will take his feet and well all rub away till we bring him toofor we must we shall bring him round  corrie said this with a fierce look and a hysterical sob  without more words he drew out his claspknife and ripping up the cuffs of the mans coat laid bare his muscular arm  meanwhile alice untied his neckcloth and poopy tore open his guernsey frock and exposed his broad brown chest  we must warm that at once said corrie beginning to take off his jacket which he meant to spread over the seamans breast  stay my petticoat is warmer cried alice hastily divesting herself of a flannel garment of bright scarlet the brilliant beauty of which had long been the admiration of the entire population of sandy cove the child spread it over the seamans chest and tucked it carefully down at his sides between his body and the wet garments  then the three sat down beside him and each seizing a limb began to rub and chafe with a degree of energy that nothing could resist  at any rate it put life into john bumpus for that hardy mariner gradually began to exhibit signs of returning vitality  there he comes cried corrie eagerly  eh exclaimed poopy in alarm  who where inquired alice who thought that the boy referred to some one who had unexpectedly appeared on the scene  i saw him wink with his left eyelook  all three suspended their labour of love and stretching forward their heads gazed with breathless anxiety at the claycoloured face of jo  i must have been mistaken said corrie shaking his head  go at him agin cried poopy recommencing her work on the right arm with so much energy that it seemed marvellous how she escaped skinning that limb from fingers to shoulder  poor alice did her best but her soft little hands had not much effect on the huge mass of brown flesh they manipulated  there he comes again shouted corrie  once more there was an abrupt pause in the process and the three heads were bent eagerly forward watching for symptoms of returning life  corrie was right  the seamans left eye quivered for a moment causing the hearts of the three children to beat high with hope  presently the other eye also quivered then the broad chest rose almost imperceptibly and a faint sigh came feebly and broken from the cold blue lips  to say that the three children were delighted at this would be to give but a feeble idea of the state of their feelings  corrie had even in the short time yet afforded him of knowing bumpus entertained for him feelings of the deepest admiration and love  alice and poopy out of sheer sympathy had fallen in love with him too at first sight so that his horrible death as they had supposed coupled with his unexpected restoration and revival through their unaided exertions drew them still closer to him and created within them a sort of feeling that he must in common reason and justice regard himself as their special property in all future time  when therefore they saw him wink and heard him sigh the gush of emotion that filled their respective bosoms was quite overpowering  corrie gasped in his effort not to break down alice wept with silent joy as she continued to chafe the mans limbs and poopy went off into a violent fit of hysterical laughter in which her hee hees resounded with terrible shrillness among the surrounding cliffs  now then lets to work again with a will said corrie what dye say to try punching him  this question he put gravely and with the uncertain air of a man who feels that he is treading on new and possibly dangerous ground  what is punching inquired alice  why that replied the boy giving a practical and by no means gentle illustration on his own fat thigh  wouldnt it hurt him said alice dubiously  hurt him hurt the grampus cried corrie with a look of surprise you might as well talk of hurting a hippopotamus  come ill try  accordingly corrie tried  he began to bake the seaman as it were with his fists  as the process went on he warmed to the work and did it so energetically in his mingled anxiety and hope that it assumed the character of hitting rather than punchingto the dismay of alice who thought it impossible that any human being could stand such dreadful treatment  whether it was to this process or to the action of nature or to the combined efforts of nature and his friends that bumpus owed his recovery we cannot pretend to say but certain it is that on corrie making a severer dab than usual into the pit of the seamans stomach he gave a gasp and a sneeze the latter of which almost overturned poopy who chanced to be gazing wildly into his countenance at the moment  at the same time he involuntarily threw up his right arm and fetched corrie such a tremendous backhander on the chest that our young hero was laid flat on his backhalf stunned by the violence of his fall yet shouting with delight that his rugged friend still lived to strike another blow  having achieved this easy though unintentional victory bumpus sighed again shook his legs in the air and sat up gazing before him with a bewildered air and gasping from time to time in a quiet way  wots to do were the first words with which the restored seaman greeted his friends  hurrah screamed corrie his visage blazing with delight as he danced in front of him  werry good said bumpus whose intellects were not yet thoroughly restored try it again  oh how cold your cheeks are said alice placing her hands on them and chafing them gently then perceiving that she did not communicate much warmth in that way she placed her own fair soft cheek against that of the sailor  suddenly throwing both arms round his neck she hugged him and burst into tears  bumpus was somewhat taken aback by this unexpected explosion but being an affectionate man as well as a rugged one he had no objection whatever to the peculiar treatment  he allowed the child to sob on his neck as long as she chose while corrie stood by with his hands in his pockets sailorfashion and looked on admiringly  as for poopy she sat down on a rock a short way off and began to smile and talk to herself in a manner so utterly idiotical that an ignorant observer would certainly have judged her to be insane  they were thus agreeably employed when an event occurred which changed the current of their thoughts and led to consequences of a somewhat serious nature  this event however was in itself insignificant  it was nothing more than the sudden appearance of a wildpig among the bushes close at hand    chapter sixteen  a wild chasehope disappointment and despairthe sandalwood trader outwits the manofwar  when the wildpig referred to in the last chapter was first observed it was standing on the margin of a thicket from which it had just issued gazing with the profoundly philosophical aspect peculiar to that animal at our four friends and seeming to entertain doubts as to the propriety of beating an immediate retreat  before it had made up its mind on this point corries eye alighted on it  hist exclaimed he with a gesture of caution to his companions look there weve had nothing to eat for an awful time nothing since breakfast on sunday morning  i feel as if my interior had been amputated  oh what a jolly roast that fellow would make if we could only kill him  wots in the pistol inquired bumpus pointing to the weapon which corrie had stuck ostentatiously into his belt  nothin answered the boy  i fired the last charge i had into the face of a savage  fling it at him suggested bumpus getting cautiously up  here hand it to me  ive seed a heavy horsepistol like that do great execution when well aimed by a stout arm  the pig seemed to have an intuitive perception that danger was approaching for it turned abruptly round just as the missile left the seamans hand and received the butt with full force close to the root of its tail  a pigs tendency to shriek on the receipt of the slightest injury is well known  it is therefore not to be wondered at that this pig went off into the bushes under cover of a series of yells so terrific that they might have been heard for miles round  ill after him cried bumpus catching up a large stone and leaping forward a few paces almost as actively as if nothing had happened to him  hurrah shouted corrie ill go too  hold on cried bumpus stopping suddenly  why inquired the boy  cause you must stop an take care of the gals  it wont do to leave em alone again you know corrie  this remark was accompanied with an exceedingly huge wink full of deep meaning which corrie found it convenient not to notice as he observed gravely  ah true  one of us must remain with em poor helpless thingsso so you had better go after the squeaker  all right said bumpus with a broad grinhallo why heres a spear that must ha bin dropt by one o them savages  thats a piece o good luck anyhow as the man said when he fund the fi pun note  now then keep an eye on them gals lad and ill be back as soon as ever i can though i does feel rather stiffish  my old timbers aint used to such deep divin dye see  bumpus entered the thicket as he spoke and corrie returned to console the girls with the feeling and the air of a man whose bosom is filled with a stern resolve to die if need be in the discharge of an important duty  now the yell of this particular pig reached other ears besides those of the party whose doings we have attempted to describe  it rang in those of the pirates who had been sent ashore to hide like the scream of a steamwhistle in consequence of their being close at hand and it sounded like a faint cry in those of henry stuart and the missionary who with their party were a long way off slowly tracing the footsteps of the lost alice to which they had been guided by the keen scent of that animated scrap of doormat toozle  the effect on both parties was powerful but not similar  the pirates supposing that a band of savages were near them lay close and did not venture forth until a prolonged silence and strong curiosity tempted them to creep with slow movements and extreme caution towards the place whence the sounds had proceeded  mr mason and henry on the other hand stopped and listened with intense earnestness expecting yet fearing a recurrence of the cry and then sprang forward with their party under the belief that they had heard the voice of alice calling for help  meanwhile bumpus toiled up the slopes of the mountain keeping the pig well in view for that animal having been somewhat injured by the blow from the pistol could not travel at its ordinary speed  indeed jo would have speedily overtaken it but for the shaky condition of his own body after such a long fast and such a series of violent shocks as well mental as physical  having gained the summit of a hill the pig much exhausted sat down on its hams and gazed pensively at the ground  bumpus took advantage of the fact and also sat down on a stone to rest  wot a brute it is said he to himself ill circumvent it yet though  presently he rose and made as if he had abandoned the chase and were about to return the way he had come but when he had effectually concealed himself from the view of the pig he made a wide detour and coming out suddenly at a spot higher up the mountain charged down upon the unsuspecting animal with a yell that would have done credit to itself  the pig echoed the yell and rushed down the hill towards the cliffs closely followed by the hardy seaman who in the ardour of the chase forgot or ignored his aches and pains and ran like a greyhound his hair streaming in the wind his eyes blazing with excitement and the spear ready poised for a fatal dart  altogether he was so wild and strong in appearance and so furious in his onset that it was impossible to believe he had been half dead little more than an hour before but then as we have before remarked bumpus was hard to kill  for nearly half an hour did the hungry seaman keep up the chaseneither gaining nor losing distance while the affrighted pig having its attention fixed entirely on its pursuer scrambled and plunged forward over every imaginable variety of ground receiving one or two severe falls in consequence  bumpus being warned by its fate escaped them at last the two dashed into a gorge and out at the other end scrambled through a thicket plunged down a hill and doubled a high rock on the other side of which they were met in the teeth by henry stuart at the head of his band  the pig attempted to double  failing to do so it lost its footing and fell flat on its side  jo bumpus threw his spear with violent energy deep into the earth about two feet beyond it tripped on a stump and fell headlong on the top of the pig squeezing the life out of its body with the weight of his ponderous frame and receiving its dying yell into his very bosom  hilloa my stalwart chip of old neptune cried henry laughing youve bagged him this time effectually  hast seen any of the niggers or did you mistake this poor pig for one  ay truly i have seen them and given a few of em marks that will keep em in remembrance of me  as for this pig said jo throwing the carcase over his shoulder i want a bit of summat to eatthats the fact an the poor children will be  children cried mr mason eagerly what do you mean my man have you seen any  in course i has or i wouldnt speak of em returned jo who did not at first recognise the missionary and no wonder for mr masons clothes were torn and soiled and his face was bruised bloodstained and haggard  tell me friend i entreat you said the pastor earnestly laying his hand on jos arm have you seen my child  wot are you the father o the little gal  why ive seed her only half an hour since  but hold on lads come arter me an ill steer you to where she is at this moment  thanks be to god said mr mason with a deep sigh of relief  lead on my man and pray go quickly  bumpus at once led the way to the foot of the cliffs and went over the ground at a pace that satisfied even the impatience of the bereaved father  while this was occurring on the mountain slopes the pirates at the foot of the cliffs had discovered the three children and finding that no one else was near had seized them and carried them off to a cave near to which their boat lay on the rocks  they hoped to have obtained some information from them as to what was going on at the other side of the island but while engaged in a fruitless attempt to screw something out of corrie who was peculiarly refractory they were interrupted first by the yells of bumpus and his pig and afterwards by the sudden appearance of henry and his party on the edge of a cliff a short way above the spot where they were assembled  on seeing these the pirates started to their feet and drew their cutlasses while henry uttered a shout and ran down the rocks like a deer  shall we have a standup fight with em bill said one of the pirates  not if i can help ittheres four to one replied the other  to the boat cried several of the men leading the way and lets take the brats with us  as henrys party came pouring down the hill the more combatively disposed of the pirates saw at a glance that it would be in vain to attempt a stand they therefore discharged a scattering volley from their pistols happily without effect and springing into their boat pushed off from the shore taking the children along with them  mr mason was the first to gain the beach  he had hit upon a shorter path by which to descend and rushing forward plunged into the sea poor little alice who at once recognised her father stretched out her arms towards him and would certainly have leaped into the sea had she not been forcibly detained by one of the pirates whose special duty it was to hold her with one hand while he restrained the violent demonstrations of corrie with the other  the father was too late however  already the boat was several yards from the shore and the frantic efforts he made in the madness of his despair to overtake it only served to exhaust him  when henry stuart reached the beach it was with difficulty he prevented those members of his band who carried muskets from firing on the boat  none of them thought for a moment of course of making the mad attempt to swim towards her  indeed mr mason himself would have hesitated to do so had he been capable of cool thought at the time but the sudden rush of hope when he heard of his child being near combined with the agony of disappointment on seeing her torn as it were out of his very grasp was too much for him  his reasoning powers were completely overturned he continued to buffet the waves with wild energy and to strain every fibre of his being in the effort to propel himself through the water long after the boat was hopelessly beyond reach  henry understood his feelings well and knew that the poor missionary would not cease his efforts until exhaustion should compel him to do so in which case his being drowned would be a certainty for there was neither boat nor canoe at hand in which to push off to his rescue  in these circumstances the youth took the only course that seemed left to him  he threw off his clothes and prepared to swim after his friend in order to render the assistance of his stout arm when it should be needed  here jakolu he cried to one of the natives who stood near him  yes massr answered the sturdy young fellow who has been introduced at an earlier part of this story as being one of the missionarys best behaved and most active church members  i mean to swim after him so i leave the charge of the party to mr bumpus there  you will act under his orders  keep the men together and guard against surprise  we dont know how many more of these blackguards may be lurking among the rocks  to this speech jakolu replied by shaking his head slowly and gravely as if he doubted the propriety of his young commanders intentions  you no can swim queek nuff to save him said he  that remains to be seen retorted henry sharply for the youth was one of the best swimmers on the islandat least the best among the whites and better than many of the natives although some of the latter could beat him  at any rate he continued you would not have me stand idly by while my friend is drowning would you  hims not drownin yet answered the matteroffact native  me vise you to let jakolu go  hims can sweem berer dan you  see here am bit plank toome take dat  ha thats well thought of cried henry who was now ready to plunge fetch it me quickand mind jakolu keep your eye on me when i hold up both hands youll know that im dead beat and that you must come off and help us both  so saying he seized the small piece of driftwood which the native brought to him and plunging into the sea struck out vigorously in the direction in which the pastor was still perseveringly though slowly swimming  while henry was stripping his eye had quickly and intelligently taken in the facts that were presented to him on the bay  he had seen on descending the hill that the manofwar had entered the bay and anchored there a fact which surprised him greatly and that the foam still lay where he had seen her cast anchor on the morning of her arrival  this surprised him even morefor if the latter was really a pirate schooner as had been hinted more than once that day by various members of the settlement why did she remain so fearlessly and peacefully within range of the guns of so dangerous and powerful an enemy  he also observed that one of the large boats of the talisman was in the water alongside and full of armed men as if about to put off on some warlike expedition while his pocket telescope enabled him to perceive that gascoyne who must needs be the pirate captain if the suspicions of his friends were correct was smoking quietly on the quarterdeck apparently holding amicable converse with the british commander  the youth knew not what to think for it was preposterous to suppose that a pirate captain could by any possibility be the intimate friend of his own mother  these and many other conflicting thoughts kept rushing through his mind as he hastened forward but the conclusions to which they led himif indeed they led him to anywere altogether upset by the unaccountable and extremely piratical conduct of the seamen who carried off alice and her companions and whom he knew to be part of the crew of the foam both from their costume and from the direction in which they rowed their little boat  the young mans perplexities were however neutralised for the time by his anxiety for his friend the pastor and by the necessity of instant and vigorous effort for his rescue  he had just time before plunging into the sea to note with satisfaction that the manofwars boat had pushed off and that if alice really was in the hands of pirates there was the certainty of her being speedily rescued  in this latter supposition however henry was mistaken  the events on shore which we have just described had been witnessed of course by the crews of both vessels with as may be easily conjectured very different feelings  in the foam the few men who were lounging about the deck looked uneasily from the war vessel to the countenance of manton in whose hands they felt that their fate now lay  the object of their regard paced the deck slowly with his hands in his pockets and a pipe in his mouth in the most listless manner in order to deceive the numerous eyes which he knew full well scanned his movements with deep curiosity the frowning brow and the tightly compressed lips alone indicated the storm of anger which was in reality raging in the pirates breast at what he deemed the obstinacy of his captain in running into such danger and the folly of his men in having shewn fight on shore when there was no occasion for doing so  but manton was too much alive to his own danger and interests to allow passion at such a critical moment to interfere with his judgment  he paced the deck slowly as we have said undecided as to what course he ought to pursue but ready to act with the utmost energy and promptitude when the time for action should arrive  on board the talisman on the other hand the young commander began to feel certain of his prize and when he witnessed the scuffle on shore the flight of the boats crew with the three young people and the subsequent events he could not conceal a smile of triumph as he turned to gascoyne and said  your men are strangely violent in their proceedings sir for the crew of a peaceable trader  if it were not that they are pulling straight for your schooner where no doubt they will be received with open arms i would have fancied they had been part of the crew of that wonderful pirate who seems to be able to change colour almost as quickly as he changes position  the allusion had no effect whatever on the imperturbable gascoyne on whose countenance good humour seemed to have been immovably enthroned for the worse his case became the more amiable and satisfied was his aspect  surely captain montague does not hold me responsible for the doings of my men in my absence said he calmly  i have already said that they are a wild setnot easily restrained even when i am present and fond of getting into scrapes when they can  you see we have not a choice of men in these outoftheway parts of the world  apparently not returned montague but i hope to have the pleasure of seeing you order your men to be punished for their misdeeds for if not i shall be under the necessity of punishing them for you  is the boat ready mr mulroy  it is sir  then mr gascoyne if you will do me the favour to step into this boat i will have much pleasure in accompanying you on board your schooner  by all means replied gascoyne with a bland smile as he rose and threw away the end of another cigar after having lighted therewith the sixth or seventh in which he had indulged that day  your boat is well manned and your men are well armed captain montague do you go on some cuttingout expedition or are you so much alarmed at the terrible aspect of the broadside of my small craft that  gascoyne here smiled with ineffable urbanity and bowed slightly by way of finishing his sentence  montague was saved the annoyance of having to reply by a sudden exclamation from his lieutenant who was observing the schooners boat though his telescope  there seems to be some one swimming after that boat said he  a manevidently a european for he is lightcoloured  he must have been some time in the water for he is already a long way from shore and seems much exhausted  why the man is drowning i believe cried montague quickly as he looked through the glass  at that moment frederick masons strength had given way he made one or two manful efforts to struggle after the retreating boat and then tossing his arms in the air uttered a loud cry of agony  ho shove off and save him shouted montague the moment he heard it look alive lads give way and when you have picked up the man pull straight for yonder schooner  the oars at once fell into the water with a splash and the boat large and heavy though it was shot from the ships side like an arrow  lower the gig cried the captain  and now mr gascoyne since you seem disposed to go in a lighter boat i will accommodate you  pray follow me  in a few seconds they were seated in the little gig which seemed to fly over the sea under the vigorous strokes of her crew of eight stout men so swift were her motions that she reached the side of the schooner only a few minutes later than the foams boat and a considerable time before his own large boat had picked up mr mason who was found in an almost insensible condition supported by henry stuart  when the gig came within a short distance of the foam gascoyne directed montagues attention to the proceedings of the large boat and at the same instant made a private signal with his right hand to manton who still unmoved and inactive stood at the schooners bow awaiting and evidently expecting it  ha said he aloud i thought as much  now lads shew the redmake ready to slipoff with long toms nightcaplet out the skulkerstake these children down below and a dozen of you stand by to receive the captain and his friends  these somewhat peculiar orders hurriedly given were hastily obeyed and in a few seconds more the gig of the talisman ranged up alongside of the foam    chapter seventeen  the escape  the instant that captain montague stepped over the side of the schooner a handkerchief was pressed tightly over his mouth and nose  at the same time he was seized by four strong men and rendered utterly powerless the thing was done so promptly and silently that the men who remained in the gig heard no unusual sound  im sorry to treat a guest so roughly captain montague said gascoyne in a low tone as the unfortunate officer was carried aft but the safety of my vessel requires it  they will carry you to my stateroom where you will find my steward exceedingly attentive and obliging but let me warn you he is peculiarly ready with the butt end of his pistol at times especially when men are inclined to make unnecessary noise  he turned on his heel as he said this and went forward looking over the side in passing and telling the crew of the gig to remain where they were till their captain should call them  this order the men felt constrained to obey although they were surprised that the captain himself had not given it on quitting the boat their suspicions were farther awakened by the active operations going on upon deck  the sounds apprised them of these for the bulwarks hid everything from view  at length when they heard the cable slipping through the hawsehole they could stand it no longer but sprang up the side in a body  of course they were met by men well prepared  as they were armed only with cutlasses the pirates quickly overcame them and threw them into the sea  all further attempt at concealment was now abandoned  the manofwars boat when it came up was received with a shot from long tom which grazed its side carried away four of the starboard oars and just missed dashing it to pieces by a mere hairsbreadth  at the same time the sails of the schooner were shaken out and filled by the light breeze which for nearly an hour had been blowing off shore  as the coming up of the gig and the large boat had occurred on that side of the schooner that was farthest from the talisman those on board of the latter vessel could not make out clearly what had occurred  that the schooner was a pirate was now clearly evident for the red griffin and stripe were suddenly displayed as well as the bloodred flag but the first lieutenant did not dare to fire on her while the boats were so near  he slipped the cable however and made instant sail on the ship and when he saw the large boat and the gig drop astern of the schooner the former in a disabled conditionhe commenced firing as fast as he could load not doubting that his captain was in his own boat  at such short range the shot flew around the pirate schooner like hail but she appeared to bear a charmed existence for although they whistled between her spars and struck the sea all around her very few indeed did her serious damage  the shots from long tom on the other hand were well aimed and told with terrible effect on the hull and rigging of the frigate  gascoyne himself pointed the gun and his bright eye flashed and a grim smile played on his lips as the shots whistled round his head  the pirate captain seemed to be possessed by a spirit of fierce and reckless jovialty that day  his usual calm selfpossessed demeanour quite forsook him  he issued his orders in a voice of thunder and with an air of what for want of a better expression we may term ferocious heartiness  he generally executed these orders himself hurling the men violently out of his way as if he were indignant at their tardiness although they sprang to obey as actively as usualindeed more so for they were overawed and somewhat alarmed by this unwonted conduct on the part of their captain  the fact was that gascoyne had for a long time past desired to give up his course of life and amend his ways but he discovered as all wicked men discover sooner or later that while it is easy to plunge into evil courses it is by no means easyon the contrary it is extremely difficultto give them up  he had formed his resolution and had laid his plans but all his plans had miscarried  being a man of high temper he had been driven almost to desperation and sought relief to his feelings in physical exertion  of all the men in the avenger however no one was so much alarmed by the captains conduct as the first mate between whom and gascoyne there had been a bitter feeling for some time past and manton knew at least he believed that it would be certain death to him if he should chance to thwart his superior in the mood in which he then was  that was a good shot manton said gascoyne with a wild laugh as the foretopsail yard of the talisman came rattling down on the deck having been cut away by a shot from long tom  it was but that was a better one said manton pointing to the boom of the schooners mainsail which was cut in two by a round shot just as the captain spoke  good very good observed the latter with an approving nod but that alters the game down with the helm steady  get the wreck of that boom cleared away manton we wont want the mainsail long  here comes a squall  look sharp  close reef topsails  the boom was swaying to and fro so violently that three of the men who sprang to obey the order were hurled by it into the lee scuppers gascoyne darted towards the broken spar and held it fast while manton quickly severed the ropes that fastened it to the sail and to the deck then the former hurled it over the side with as much ease as if it had been an oar  let her away now  why that will run us right into the long shoal exclaimed manton anxiously as the squall which had been approaching struck the schooner and laid her almost on her beam ends  i know it replied gascoyne curtly as he thrust aside the man at the wheel and took the spokes in his own hands  its all we can do to find our way through that place in fine weather remonstrated the mate  i know it said gascoyne sternly  scraggs who chanced to be standing by seemed to be immensely delighted with the alarmed expression on mantons face  the worthy second mate hated the first mate so cordially and attached so little value to his own life that he would willingly have run the schooner on the rocks altogether just to have the pleasure of laughing contemptuously at the wreck of mantons hopes  its worth while trying it suggested scraggs with a malicious grin  i mean to try it said gascoyne calmly  but theres not a spot in the shoal except the eels gate that weve a ghost of a chance of getting through cried manton becoming excited as the schooner dashed towards the breakers like a furious charger rushing on destruction  i know it  and theres barely water on that to float us over he added striding forward and laying a hand on the wheel  halfafoot too little said gascoyne with forced calmness  scraggs grinned  you shant run us aground if i can prevent it cried manton fiercely seizing the wheel with both hands and attempting to move it in which attempt he utterly failed and scraggs grinned broader than ever  remove your hands said gascoyne in a low calm voice which surprised the men who were standing near and witnessed these proceedings  i wont  ho lads do you wish to be sent to the bottom by a  the remainder of this speech was cut short by the sudden descent of gascoynes knuckles on the forehead of the mate who dropped on the deck as if he had been felled with a sledge hammer  scraggs laughed outright with satisfaction  remove him said gascoyne  overboard inquired scraggs with a bland smile  below said the captain and scraggs was fain to content himself with carrying the insensible form of his superior officer to his berth taking pains however to bump his head carefully against every spar and corner and otherwise convenient projection on the way down  in a few minutes more the schooner was rushing through the milkwhite foam that covered the dangerous coral reef named the long shoals and the talisman layto not daring to venture into such a place but pouring shot and shell into her bold little adversary with terrible effect as her tattered sails and flying cordage shewed  the fire was steadily replied to by long tom whose heavy shots came crashing repeatedly through the hull of the manofwar  the large boat meanwhile had been picked up by the talisman after having rescued mr mason and henry both of whom were placed in the gig this light boat was now struggling to make the ship but owing to the strength of the squall her diminished crew were unable to effect this they therefore ran ashore to await the issue of the fight and the storm  for some time the avenger stood on her wild course unharmed passing close to huge rocks on either side of her over which the sea burst in clouds of foam  gascoyne still stood at the wheel guiding the vessel with consummate skill and daring while the men looked on in awe and in breathless expectation quite regardless of the shot which flew around them and altogether absorbed by the superior danger by which they were menaced  the surface of the sea was so universally white that there was no line of dark water to guide the pirate captain on his bold and desperate course  he was obliged to trust almost entirely to his intimate knowledge of the coast and to the occasional patches in the surrounding waste where the comparative flatness of the boiling flood indicated less shallow water  as the danger increased the smile left gascoynes lips but the flashing of his bright eyes and his deepened colour shewed that the spirit boiled within almost as wildly as the ocean raged around him  the centre of the shoal was gained and a feeling of hope and exultation began to rise in the breasts of the crew when a terrific shock caused the little schooner to quiver from stem to stern while an involuntary cry burst from the men many of whom were thrown violently on the deck at the same time a shot from the talisman came in through the stern bulwarks struck the wheel and carried it away with part of the tackle attached to the tiller  another leap like that lass and youre over cried gascoyne with a light smile as he sprang to the iron tiller and seizing it with his strong hands steered the schooner as if she had been a boat  get new tackle rove scraggs said he cheerfully ill keep her straight for eels gate with this  that was the first bar of the gatethere are only two altogether and the second wont be so bad  as the captain spoke the schooner seemed to recover from the shock and again rushed forward on her foaming course but before the men had time to breathe she struck againthis time less violently as had been predictedand the next wave lifting her over the shoal launched her into deep water  there that will do said gascoyne resigning the helm to scraggs you can keep her as she goes theres plenty of water now and no fear of that big bully following us  meanwhile i will go below and see to the welfare of our passengers  gascoyne was wrong in supposing that the talisman would not follow she could not indeed follow in the same course but the moment that mulroy observed that the pirate had passed the shoals in safety he stood inshore and without waiting to pick up the gig traversed the channel by which they had entered the bay  then trusting to the lead and to his knowledge of the general appearance of shallows he steered carefully along until he cleared the reefs and finally stood out to sea  in less than halfanhour afterwards the party on shore beheld the two vessels disappear among the black stormclouds that gathered over the distant horizon    chapter eighteen  the goats passan attack a bloodless victory and a sermon  when ole thorwald was landed at the foot of that wild gorge in the cliffs which has been designated the goats pass he felt himself to be an aggrieved man and growled accordingly  its too bad o that fireeating fellow to fix on me for this particular service said he to one of the settlers named hugh barnes a cooper who acted as one of his captains and at night too just as if a man of my years were a cross between a cat which everybody knows can see in the dark and a kangaroo which is said to be a powerful leaper though whether in the dark or the light i dont pretend to knownot being informed on the point  have a care hugh  it seems to me youre going to step into a quarry hole or over a precipice  how my old flesh quakes to be sure  if it was only a fair flat field and open day with any odds you like against me it would be nothing but this abominable goatshah  i knew it  help hold on there murder  oles sudden alarm was caused by his stumbling in the dark over the root of a shrub which grew on the edge of and partly concealed a precipice over which he was precipitated and at the foot of which his mangled and lifeless form would soon have reposed had not his warlike forefathers being impressed with the advantage of wearing strong swordbelts furnished the sword which ole wore with such a belt as was not only on all occasions sufficient to support the sword itself but which on this particular occasion was strong enough to support its owner when he was suspended from and entangled with the shrubs of the cliff  a ray of light chanced to break into the dark chasm at the time and revealed all its dangers to the pendulous thorwald so powerfully that he positively howled with horror  the howl brought hugh and several of his followers to his side and they with much difficulty for he was a heavy man succeeded in dragging him from his dangerous position and placing him on his feet in which position he remained for some time speechless and blowing  now ill tell ye what it is boys said he at length if ever you catch me going on an expedition of this sort again flay me alive thats alldont spare me  pull off the cuticle as if it were a glove and if i roar dont mindthats what i say  having said this the veteran warrior smiled a ghastly smile as if the idea of being so excruciatingly treated were rather pleasant than otherwise  youre not hurt i hope inquired hugh  hurt yes i am hurthurt in my feelingsnot in my body thanks to my good sword and belt but my feelings are injured  that villain that rascal that pirateas i verily believe him to beselected me specially for this service i am persuaded just because he knew me to be unfit for it  bah but ill pay him off for it  come boys forwardperhaps in the circumstances it would be more appropriate to say upward  we must go through with it now for our retreat is cut off lead the way hugh your eyes are younger and sharper than mine and if you chance to fall over a cliff pray give a yell like a good fellow so that i may escape your sad fate  in the course of half an hours rough scramble the party gained the crest of the goats pass and descended in rear of the native village the country over which they had to travel however was so broken and so beset with rugged masses of rock as to retard their progress considerably besides causing them to lose their way more than once  it was thus daybreak before they reached the heights that overlooked the village and the shot from the avenger with the broad side from the frigate was delivered just as they began to descend the hill  ole therefore pushed on with enthusiasm to attack the village in rear but he had not advanced half a mile when the peculiar and to him inexplicable movements of the two vessels which have been already described took place leaving the honest commander of the land forces in a state of great perplexity as to what was meant by his naval allies and in much doubt as to what he ought to do  it seems to me said he to his chiefs in a hastily summoned council of war that we are all at sixes and sevens  i dont understand what manoeuvres these naval men are up to and i doubt if they know themselves  this being the case and the fleet if i may so name it having run away it behoves us my friends to shew these sailors how we soldiers do our duty  i would advise therefore that we should attack at once  but as we are not a strong party and as we know not how strong the savages may be i think it my duty before leading you on to ask your opinions on the point  the officers whose opinions were thus asked were hugh barnes already mentioned terence rigg the blacksmith of the settlement and john thomson the carpenter  these being strong of body powerful of will and intelligent withal had been appointed to the command of companies and when on duty were styled captain by their commanding officer who was when on duty styled general by them  ole thorwald be it remarked in passing was a soldier at heart  having gone through a moderate amount of military education and possessing considerable talent in the matter of drill he took special pride in training the natives and the white men of the settlement to act in concert and according to fixed principles  the consequence was that although his men were poorly armed he had them under perfect command and could cause them to act unitedly at any moment  the captains having been requested to give their opinions captain rigg being senior observed that his vote was for goin at em at wance neck or nothing to which warlike sentiment he gave peculiar emphasis by adding an no mistake in a very decided tone of voice  thats wot i says too general said captain thomson the carpenter  captain barnes being of the same opinion general thorwald said  well then gentlemen we shall attack without delay and proceeded to make the necessary arrangements  when the talisman fired her broadside of blank cartridge at the native village there was not a solitary warrior in itonly aged men women and children  these filled with unutterable consternation on hearing the thunderous discharge sent up one yell of terror and forthwith took to their heels and made for the hills en masse never once looking behind them and therefore remaining in ignorance of the ulterior proceedings of the ships  it was some time before they came in sight of ole thorwald and his men  the moment they did so ole gave the word to charge and whirling his sword round his head set the example  the men followed with a yell the poor savages turned at once and fledsuch of them at least as were not already exhausted by their run up hilland the rest consisting chiefly of old men and children fell on their knees and faces and howled for mercy  as soon as the charging host became aware of the character of the enemy they came came to a sudden halt  sure its owld men and women were about to kill cried captain rigg lowering his formidable forehammer with which in default of a better weapon he had armed himself but hooray  gineral there may be lots o the warrior reptiles in among the huts and them poor craturs have been sent out to decaive us  thats true  forward my lads shouted oleand again the army chargednor did they stop short until they had taken possession of the village when they found that all the fighting men were gone  this being happily accomplished without blood shed ole thorwald like a wise general took the necessary steps to insure and complete his conquest  he seized all the women and children and shut them up in a huge temple built of palmtrees and roofed with broad leaves  this edifice was devoted to the horrible practice of cutting up human bodies that were intended to be eaten  ole had often heard of the cannibalism that is practised by most of the south sea islanders though some tribes are worse than others but he had never before this day come directly in contact with it  here however there could be no doubt whatever of the fact  portions of human bodies were strewn about this hideous templesome parts in a raw and bloody condition as if they had just been cut from a lately slain victim others in a baked state as if ready to form part of some terrible banquet  sick at heart ole thorwald turned from this sight with loathing concluding that the natives who practised such things could not be very much distressed by being shut up for a time in a temple dedicated to the gratification of their own disgusting tastes he barricaded the entrance securely placed a guard over it and hurried away to see that two other buildings in which the remainder of the women and children had been imprisoned were similarly secured and guarded  meanwhile the stalwart knight of the forehammer to whom the duty had been assigned placed sentries at the various entrances to the village and disposed his men in such a way as to prevent the possibility of being taken by surprise  these various arrangements were not made a moment too soon  the savages as we have said in a former chapter rushed towards their village from all quarters on hearing the thunder of the great guns they were now arriving in scores and came rushing over the brow of the neighbouring hill and down the slope that rose immediately in rear of their rude homes  on finding that the place was occupied by their enemies they set up a yell of despair and retired to a neighbouring height where ole could see by their wild gesticulations that they were hotly debating what should be done  it soon became evident that an attack would be made for as their comrades came pouring in the party from the settlement was soon greatly outnumbered  seeing this and knowing that the party under command of henry stuart would naturally hasten to his aid as soon as possible ole sought to cause delay by sending out a flag of truce  the natives had been so long acquainted with the customs of the europeans that they understood the meaning of this and the chief of the tribe at once throwing down his club advanced fearlessly to meet the christian native sent out with the flag  the message was to the effect that if they the enemy should dare to make an attack all the women and children then in the hands of the settlers should have their heads chopped off on the spot  this was a startling announcement and one so directly in opposition to the known principles of the christians that the heathen chief was staggered and turned pale  he returned to his comrades with the horrifying message which seemed to them all utterly unaccountable  it was quite natural for themselves to do such a deed because they held that all sorts of cruelties were just in war  but their constant experience had been that when a native became a follower of the christian missionary from that moment he became merciful especially towards the weak and helpless  counting upon this they were stunned as well as astonished at thorwalds message for they believed implicitly that he meant to do what he threatened  they did not know that ole although a worthy man was not so earnest a believer in all mr masons principles but that he could practise on their credulity in time of need  like the missionary he would rather have died than have sacrificed the life of a woman or child but unlike him he had no objection to deceive in order to gain time  as it turned out his threat was unnecessary for henry and his men were close at hand and before the natives could make up their minds what to do the whole band came pouring over the hill with jo bumpus far ahead of the rest leaping and howling like a maniac with excitement  this decided the natives  they were now outnumbered and surrounded the principal chief therefore advanced towards bumpus with a piece of native cloth tied to the end of his warclub which he brandished furiously by way of making it plain that his object was not war but peace  naturally enough the seaman misinterpreted the signal and there is no doubt that he would have planted his knuckles on the bridge of the nose of that swarthy cannibal had not henry stuart made use of his extraordinary powers of speed  he darted forward overtook jo and grasping him round the neck with both arms shouted  its a flag of truce man  you dont say so well whod ha thought it  it dont look like one so it dont  with this remark jo subsided into a peaceable man  pulling a quid out of his pocket he thrust it into his cheek and crossing his arms on his breast listened patientlythough not profitably seeing that he did not understand a wordto the dialogue that followed  it will be remembered that poor mr mason after being saved by henry was taken into the gig of the talisman and put ashore  after the two vessels had disappeared as has been already described henry at once led his party towards the native village knowing that ole thorwald would require support all the more that the ship had failed to fulfil her part in the combined movement  as the almost heartbroken father had no power to render farther aid to his lost child he suffered himself to be led in a halfbewildered state along with the attacking party under his young friend  he was now brought forward to parley with the native chief  the missionarys manner and aspect at once changed  in the hope of advancing the cause of his master he forgot or at least restrained his own grief for a time  what would the chief say to the christians he began on being confronted with the savage and some of his warriors who crowded round him  that he wishes to have done with war replied the man  that is a good wish but why did the chief begin war  keona began it said the savage angrily  we thought our wars with the christians were going to stop  but keona is bad  he put the war spirit into my people  mr mason knew this to be true  then said he keona deserves punishment  let him die answered the chief and an exclamation of assent broke from the other natives  keona himself happening to be there became pale and looked anxious but remained where he stood nevertheless with his arms crossed on his dark breast  a bandage of native cloth was tied round his wounded arm  without saying a word he undid this tore it off and allowed the blood to ooze from the reopened wound  it was a silent appeal to the feelings and the sense of justice of his comrades and created a visible impression in his favour  that wound was received by one who would have been a murderer said mr mason observing the effect of this action  he struck me cried keona fiercely  he struck you in defending his own home against a cowardly attack answered the missionary  at this point ole thorwald saw fit to interfere  seeing that the natives were beginning to argue the case and knowing that no good could come from such a course he quietly observed  there will be neither wife nor child in this place if i do but hold up my hand  the missionary and his party did not of course understand this allusion but they understood the result for the savages at once dropped their tones and the chief sued earnestly for peace  chiefs and warriors said mr mason raising his hand impressively i am a man of peace and i serve the prince of peace  to stop this war is what i desire most earnestly and i desire above all things that you and i might henceforth live in friendship serving the same god and saviour whose name is jesus christ  but your ways are not like our ways  if i leave you now i fear you will soon find another occasion to renew the war as you have often done before  i have you in my power now  if you were to fight with us we could easily beat you because we are stronger in numbers and well armed  yes i have you in my power and with the blessing of my god i will keep you in my power for ever  there was a visible fall in the countenances of the savages who regarded this strange announcement as their deathwarrant  some of them even grasped their clubs and looked fiercely at their enemies but a glance from ole thorwald quieted these restive spirits  now chiefs and warriors i have two intentions in regard to you continued mr mason  the one is that you shall take your clubs spears and other weapons and lay them in a pile on this mound after which i will make you march unarmed before us half way to our settlement  from that point you shall return to your homes  thus you shall be deprived of the power of treacherously breaking that peace which you know in your hearts you would break if you could  my second intention is that the whole of your tribemen women and childrenshall now assemble at the foot of this mound and hear what i have got to say to you  the first part of this plan i shall carry out by force if need bebut for the second parti must have your own consent  i may not force you to listen if you are not willing to hear  at the mention of the women and children being required to assemble along with them the natives pricked up their ears and as a matter of course they willingly agreed to listen to all that the missionary had to say to them  this being settled and the natives knowing from former experience that the christians never broke faith with them they advanced to the mound pointed out and threw down their arms  a strong guard was placed over these the troops of the settlement were disposed in such a manner as to prevent the possibility of their being recovered and then the women and children were set free  it was a noisy and remarkable meeting that which took place between the men and women of the tribe on this occasion but soon surprise and expectation began to take the place of all other feelings as the strange intentions of the missionary were spoken of and in a very short time mr mason had a large and most attentive congregation  never before had the missionary secured such an opportunity  his eccentric method of obtaining a hearing had succeeded beyond his expectations  with a heart overflowing with gratitude to god he stood up and began to preach the gospel  mr mason was not only eccentric but able and wise  he made the most of his opportunity  he gave them a very long sermon that day but he knew that the savages were not used to sermons and that they would not think it long  his text was a double onethe soul that sinneth it shall die and believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved  he preached that day as a man might who speaks to his hearers for the first and last time and in telling of the goodness the mercy and the love of god the bitter grief of his own heart was sensibly abated  after his discourse was over and prayer had been offered up the savage warriors were silently formed into a band and marched off in front of the christians to the spot where mr mason had promised to set them free  they shewed no disinclination to go  they believed in the good faith of their captors  the missionary had indeed got them into his power that day  some of them he had secured for ever    chapter nineteen  sorrow and sympathythe widow becomes a pleader and her son engages in a single combat  there are times in the life of every one when the heart seems unable to bear the load of sorrow and suffering that is laid upon ittimes when the anguish of the soul is such that the fair world around seems enshrouded with gloom when the bright sun itself appears to shine in mockery and when the smitten heart refuses to be comforted  such a time was it with poor frederick mason when after his return to sandy cove he stood alone amid the blackened ruins of his former home gazing at the spot which he knew from the charred remnants as well as its position was the site of the room which had once been occupied by his lost child  it was night when he stood there  the silence was profound for the people of the settlement sympathised so deeply with their beloved pastors grief that even the ordinary hum of life appeared to be hushed except now and then when a low wail would break out and float away on the night wind  these sounds of woe were full of meaning  they told that there were other mourners there that nightthat the recent battle had not been fought without producing some of the usual bitter fruits of war  beloved but dead and mangled forms lay in more than one hut in sandy cove  motionlesshopelessthe missionary stood amid the charred beams and ashes until the words call upon me in the day of trouble and i will deliver thee and thou shalt glorify me descended on his soul like sunshine upon ice  a suppressed cry burst from his lips and falling on his knees he poured forth his soul in prayer  while he was yet on his knees a cry of anguish arose from one of the huts at the foot of the hill  it died away in a low heartbroken wail mr mason knew its meaning well  that cry had a special significance to him  it spoke reproachfully  it said there is comfort for you for where life is there is hope but here there is death  again the word of god came to his memory weep with them that weep starting up hastily the missionary sprang over the black beams and hurried down the hill entered the village and spent the greater part of the remainder of that night in comforting the bereaved and the wounded  the cause of the pastors grief was not removed thereby but the sorrow itself was lightened by sympathy and when he returned at a late hour to his temporary home hope had begun to arise within his breast  the widows cottage afforded him shelter  when he entered it harry and his mother were seated near a small table on which supper was spread for their expected guest  tom armstrong will recover said the missionary seating himself opposite the widow and speaking in a hurried excited tone  his wound is a bad one given by a warclub but i think it is not dangerous  i wish i could say as much for poor simon  if he had been attended to sooner he might have lived but so much blood has been already lost that there is now no hope  alas for his little boy  he will be an orphan soon  poor harrys wife is distracted with grief  her young husbands body is so disfigured with cuts and bruises that it is dreadful to look upon yet she will not leave the room in which it lies nor cease to embrace and cling to the mangled corpse  poor poor lucy she will have to be comforted  at present she must be left with god  no human sympathy can avail just now but she must be comforted when she will permit any one to speak to her  you will go to her tomorrow mrs stuart wont you  as this was mr masons first meeting with the widow since the sunday morning when the village was attacked his words and manner shewed that he dreaded any allusion to his own loss  the widow saw and understood this but she had consolation for him as well as for others and would not allow him to have his way  but what of alice she said earnestly  you do not mention her henry has told me all  have you nothing to say about yourselfabout alice  oh what can i say cried the pastor clasping his hands while a deep sob almost choked him  can you not say that she is in the hands of godof a loving father said mrs stuart tenderly  yes yes i can say thatihave said that butbut  i know what you would say interrupted the widow you would tell me that she is in the hands of pirates ruthless villains who fear neither god nor man and that unless a miracle is wrought in her behalf nothing can save her  oh spare me mary why do you harrow my broken heart with such a picture cried mr mason rising and pacing the room with quick unsteady steps while with both hands on his head he seemed to attempt to crush down the thoughts that burned up his brain  i speak thus said the widow with an earnestness of tone and manner that almost startled her hearers because i wish to comfort you alice you tell me is on board the foam  on board the pirate schooner cried henry almost fiercely for the youth although as much distressed as mr mason was not so resigned as he and his spirit chafed at the thought of having been deceived so terribly by the pirate  she is on board the foam repeated the widow in a tone so stern that her hearers looked at her in surprise  and is therefore in the hands of gascoyne who will not injure a hair of her head  i tell you mr mason that she is perfectly safe in the hands of gascoyne  of the pirate durward said henry in a deep angry voice  what ground have you for saying so asked the widow quickly  you only know him as gascoyne the sandalwood trader the captain of the foam  he has been suspected it is true but suspicion is not proof his schooner has been fired into by a war vessel he has returned the fireany passionate man might be tempted to do that  his men have carried off some of our dear ones  that was their doingnot his  he knew nothing of it  mother mother cried henry entreatingly dont stand up in that way for a pirate i cant bear to hear it  did he not himself describe the pirate schooners appearance in this room and when he was attacked by the talisman did he not shew out in his true colours thereby proving that he is durward the pirate  the widows face grew pale and her voice trembled as she replied like one who sought to convince herself rather than her hearer that is not positive proof henry  gascoyne may have had some good reason for deceiving you all in this way  his description of the pirate may have been a false one  we cannot tell  you know he was anxious to prevent captain montague from impressing his men  and would proclaiming himself a pirate be a good way of accomplishing that end mother  mary said mr mason solemnly as he seated himself at the table and looked earnestly in the widows face  your knowledge of this man and your manner of speaking about him surprises me  i have long thought that you were not acting wisely in permitting gascoyne to be so intimate for whatever he may in reality be he is a suspicious character to say the best of him and although i know that you think you are right in encouraging his visits other people do not know that they may judge you harshly  i do not wish to pry into secretsbut you have sought to comfort me by bidding me have perfect confidence in this man  i must ask what knowledge you have of him  how far are you aware of his character and employment  how do you know that he is so trustworthy  an expression of deep grief rested on the widows countenance as she replied in a sad voicei know that you may trust gascoyne with your child  he is my oldest friend  i have known him since we were children  he saved my fathers life long long ago and helped to support my mother in her last years  would you have me to forget all this because men say that he is a pirate  why mother cried henry if you know so much about him you must know that whatever he was in time past he is the pirate durward now  i do not know that he is the pirate durward said the widow in a voice and with a look so decided that henry was silenced and sorely perplexedyet much relieved for he knew that his mother would rather die than tell a deliberate falsehood  the missionary was also comforted for although his judgment told him that the grounds of hope thus held out to him were very insufficient he was impressed by the thoroughly confident tone of the widow and felt relieved in spite of himself  soon after this conversation was concluded the household retired to rest  next morning henry was awakened out of a deep sleep by the sound of subdued voices in the room underneath his own  at first he paid no attention to these supposing that as it was broad daylight some of their native servants were moving about  but presently the sound of his mothers voice induced him to listen more attentively  then a voice replied so low that he could with difficulty hear it at all  its strength increased however and at last it broke forth in deep bass tones  henry sprang up and threw on his clothes  as he was thus engaged the front door of the house opened and the speakers went out  a few seconds sufficed for the youth to finish dressing then seizing a pistol he hurried out of the house  looking quickly round he just caught sight of the skirts of a womans dress as they disappeared through the doorway of a hut which had been formerly inhabited by a poor native who had subsisted on the widows bounty until he died  the door was shut immediately after  going swiftly but cautiously round by a back way henry approached the hut  strange and conflicting feelings filled his breast  a blush of deep shame and selfabhorrence mantled on his cheek when it flashed across him that he was about to play the spy on his own mother  but there was no mistaking gascoynes voice  how the supposed pirate had got there and wherefore he was there were matters that he did not think of or care about at that moment  there he was so the young man resolved to secure him and hand him over to justices  henry was too honourable to listen secretly to a conversation whatever it might be that was not intended for his ears  he resolved merely to peep in at one of the many chinks in the log hut for one moment to satisfy himself that gascoyne really was there and to observe his position  but as the latter now thought himself beyond the hearing of any one he spoke in unguarded tones and henry heard a few words in spite of himself  looking through a chink in the wall at the end of the hut he beheld the stalwart form of the sandalwood trader standing on the hearth of the hut which was almost unfurnisheda stool a bench an old chest a table and a chair being all that it contained  his mother was seated at the table with her hands clasped before her looking up at her companion  oh why run so great a risk as this said she earnestly  i was born to run risks i believe replied gascoyne in a sad low voice  it matters not  my being on the island is the result of mantons villainymy being here is for poor henrys sake and your own as well as for the sake of alice the missionarys child  you have been upright mary and kind and true as steel ever since i knew you  but for that i should have been lost long ago  henry heard no more  these words did indeed whet his curiosity to the utmost but the shame of acting the part of an eavesdropper was so great that by a strong effort of will he drew back and pondered for a moment what he ought to do  the unexpected tone and tenor of gascoynes remark had softened him slightly but recalling the undoubted proofs that he had had of his really being a pirate he soon steeled his heart against him  he argued that the mere fact of the man giving his mother credit for a character which everybody knew she possessed was not sufficient to clear him of the suspicions which he had raised against himself  besides it was impertinence in any man to tell his mother his opinion of her to her face  and to call him poor henry forsooth this was not to be endured  having thus wrought himself up to a sufficient degree of indignation the young man went straight to the door making considerable noise in order to prepare those within for his advent  he had expected to find it locked  in this he was mistaken  it yielded to a push  throwing it wide open henry strode into the middle of the apartment and pointing the pistol at gascoynes breast exclaimedpirate durward i arrest you in the kings name  at the first sound of her sons approach mrs stuart bent forward over the table with a groan buried her face in her hands  gascoyne received henrys speech at first with a frown and then with a smile  you have taken a strange time and way to jest henry said he crossing his arms on his broad chest and gazing fixedly in the youths face  you will not throe me off my guard thus said henry sternly  you are my prisoner  i know you to be a pirate  at any rate you will have to prove yourself to be an honest man before you quit this hut a free man  mother leave this place that i may lock the door upon him  the widow did not move but gascoyne made a step towards her son  another step and i will fire  your blood shall be on your own head gascoyne  as gascoyne still advanced henry pointed the pistol straight at his breast and pulled the trigger but no report followedthe priming indeed flashed in the pan but that was all  with a cry of rage and defiance henry leaped upon gascoyne like a young lion  he struck at him with the pistol but the latter caught the weapon in his powerful hand wrenched it from the youths grasp and flung it to the other end of the apartment  you shall not escape me cried henry aiming a tremendous blow with his fist at gascoynes face  it was parried and the next moment the two closed in a deadly struggle  it was a terrible sight for the widow to witness these two herculean men exerting their great strength to the utmost in a handtohand conflict in that small hut like two tigers in a cage  henry although nearly six feet in height and proportionally broad and powerful was much inferior to his gigantic antagonist but to the superior size and physical force of the latter he opposed the lithe activity and the fervid energy of youth so that to an unpractised eye it might have seemed doubtful at first which of the two men had the best chance  straining his powers to the utmost henry attempted to lift his opponent off the ground and throw him  in this he was nearly successful gascoyne staggered but recovered himself instantly  they did not move much from the centre of the room nor was there much noise created during the conflict  it seemed too closetoo full of concentrated energyof heavy prolonged strainingfor much violent motion  the great veins in gascoynes forehead stood out like knotted cords yet there was no scowl or frown on his face  henrys brows on the contrary were gathered into a dark frown  his teeth were set and his countenance flushed to deep red by exertion and passion  strange to say the widow made no effort to separate the combatants neither did she attempt to move from her seat or give any alarm  she sat with her hands on the table clasped tightly together gazing eagerly anxiously like a fascinated creature at the wild struggle that was going on before her  again and again henry attempted with all the fire of youth to throw his adversary by one tremendous effort but failed  then he tried to fling him off so as to have the power of using his fists or making an overwhelming rush  but gascoyne held him in his strong arms like a vice  several times he freed his right arm and attempted to plant a blow but gascoyne caught the blow in his hand or seized the wrist and prevented its being delivered  in short do what he would henry stuart could neither free himself from the embrace of his enemy nor conquer him  still he struggled on for as this fact became more apparent the youths blood became hotter from mingled shame and anger  both men soon began to shew symptoms of fatigue  it was not in the nature of things that two such frames animated by such spirits could prolong so exhausting a struggle  it was not doubtful now which of the two would come off victorious  during the whole course of the fight gascoyne had acted entirely on the defensive  a small knife or stiletto hung at his left side but he never attempted to use it and he never once tried to throw his adversary  in fact it now became evident even to the widows perceptions that the captain was actually playing with her son  all along his countenance though flushed and eager exhibited no sign of passion  he seemed to act like a goodhumoured man who had been foolishly assaulted by a headstrong boy and who meant to keep him in play until he should tire him out  just then the tinkling of a bell and other sounds of the people of the establishment beginning to move about were heard outside  henry noticed this  hah he exclaimed in a gasping voice i can at least hold you until help comes  gascoyne heard the sounds also  he said nothing but he brought the strife to a swift termination  for the first time he bent his back like a man who exerts himself in earnest and lifted henry completely off the ground  throwing him on his back he pressed him down with both arms so as to break from his grasp  no human muscles could resist the force applied  slowly but surely the iron sinews of henrys arms straightened out and the two were soon at arms length  but even gascoynes strength could not unclasp the grip of the youths hands until he placed his knee upon his chest then indeed they were torn away  of course all this was not done without some violence but it was still plain to the widow that gascoyne was careful not to hurt his antagonist more than he could help  now henry my lad said he holding the youth down by the two arms i have given you a good deal of trouble this morning and i mean to give you a little more  it does not just suit me at present to be tried for a pirate so i mean to give you a race  you are reputed one of the best runners in the settlement  well ill give you a chance after me if you overtake me boy ill give myself up to you without a struggle but i suspect youll find me rather hard to catch  as he uttered the last words he permitted henry to rise  ere the youth had quite gained his footing he gave him a violent push and sent him staggering back against the wall  when henry recovered his balance gascoyne was standing in the open doorway  now lad are you ready said he a sort of wild smile lighting up his face  henry was so taken aback by this conduct as well as by the rough handling which he had just received that he could not collect his thoughts for a few seconds but when gascoyne nodded gravely to his mother and walked quietly away saying goodbye mary the exasperated youth darted through the doorway like an arrow  if henry stuarts rush may be compared to the flight of an arrow from a bow not less appropriately may gascoynes bound be likened to the leap of the bolt from a crossbow  the two men sprang over the low fences that surrounded the cottage leapt the rivulet that brawled down its steep course behind it and coursed up the hill like mountain hares  the last that widow stuart saw of them as she gazed eagerly from the doorway of the hut was when gascoynes figure was clearly defined against the sky as he leaped over a great chasm in the lava high up the mountain side  henry followed almost instantly and then both were hidden from view in the chaos of rocks and gorges that rose above the upper line of vegetation  it was a long and a severe chase that henry had undertaken and ably did his fleet foot sustain the credit which he had already gained  but gascoynes foot was fleeter  over every species of ground did the sandalwood trader lead the youth that day  it seemed in fact as if a spirit of mischief had taken possession of gascoyne for his usually grave face was lighted up with a mingled expression of glee and ferocity  it changed too and wore a sad expression at times even when the man seemed to be running for his life  at last after running until he had caused henry to shew symptoms of fatigue gascoyne turned suddenly round and shouting goodbye henry my lad went straight up the mountain and disappeared over the dividing ridge on the summit  henry did not give in  the insult implied in the words renewed his strength  he tightened his belt as he ran and rushed up the mountain almost as fast as gascoyne had done but when he leaped upon the ridge the fugitive had vanished  that he had secreted himself in one of the many gorges or caves with which the place abounded was quite clear but it was equally clear that no one could track him out in such a place unless he were possessed of a dogs nose  the youth did indeed attempt it but being convinced that he was only searching for what could not by any possibility be found he soon gave it up and returned disconsolate and crestfallen to the cottage    chapter twenty  mysterious consultations and plansgascoyne astonishes his friends and makes an unexpected confession  a pretty mornings work i have made of it mother said henry as he flung himself into a chair in the cottage parlour on his return from the weary and fruitless chase which has just been recorded  the widow was pale and haggard but she could not help smiling as she observed the look of extreme disappointment which rested on the countenance of her son  true henry she replied busying herself in preparing breakfast you have not been very successful but you made a noble effort  pshaw a noble effort indeed  why the man has foiled me in the two things in which i prided myself mostwrestling and running  i never saw such a greyhound in my life  he is a giant my boy few men could hope to overcome him  true as regards wrestling mother i am not much ashamed of having been beaten by him at that but runningthats the sore point  such a weight he is and yet he took the north gully like a wild cat and you know mother there are only two of us in sandy cove who can go over that gully  ay and he went a full yard farther than ever i did  i measured the leap as i came down  really it is too bad to have been beaten so completely by a man who must be nearly double my age  but after all the worst of the whole affair is that a pirate has escaped me after i actually had him in my arms the villain  you do not know that he is a villain said the widow in a subdued tone  you are right mother said henry looking up from the plate of bacon to which he had been devoting himself with much assiduity and gazing earnestly into his mothers face you are right and do you know i feel inclined to give the fellow the benefit of the doubt for to tell you the truth i have a sort of liking for him  if it had not been for the way in which he has treated you and the suspicious character that he bears i do believe i should have made a friend of him  a look of evident pleasure crossed the widows face while her son spoke but as that sons eyes were once more riveted on the bacon which his morning exercise rendered peculiarly attractive he did not observe it  just then the door opened and mr mason entered  his face wore a dreadfully anxious expression  ha  im glad to see you henry said he of course you have not caught your man  i have been waiting anxiously for you to consult about our future proceedings  it is quite evident that the pirate schooner cannot be far off  gascoyne must either have swam ashore or been landed in a boat  in either case the schooner must have been within the reef at the time and there has been little wind since the squall blew itself out yesterday  quite enough how ever to blow such a light craft pretty far out to sea in a few hours said henry shaking his head  no matter replied mr mason with a sigh something must be done at any rate i have borrowed the carpenters small cutter which is being now put in order for a voyage  provisions and water for a few days are already on board and i have come to ask you to take command of her as you know something of navigation  i will go of course but will not take any management of the little craft as i know nothing about the working of vessels  and where do you mean to go asked henry  that remains to be seen  i have some ideas running in my head of course but before letting you know them i wish to hear what you would advise  i would advise in the first place that you should provide one or two thorough sailors to manage the craft  by the way that reminds me of bumpus  what of him  where is he  in the midst of all this bustle i have not had time for much thought and it has only just occurred to me that if this schooner is really a pirate and if gascoyne turns out to be durward it follows that bumpus is a pirate too and ought to be dealt with accordingly  i have thought of that said mr mason with a perplexed look and intended to speak to you on the subject but events have crowded so fast upon each other of late that it has been driven out of my mind  no doubt if the foam and the avenger are one and the same vessel as seems too evident to leave much room for doubt then bumpus is a pirate for he does not deny that he was one of the crew  but he acts strangely for a pirate  he seems as much at his ease amongst us as if he were the most innocent of men  moreover his looks seem to stamp him a thoroughly honest fellow  but alas one cannot depend on looks  but where is the man asked henry  he is asleep in the small closet off the kitchen said mrs stuart where he has been lying ever since you returned from the heathen village  poor fellow he sleeps heavily and looks as if he had been hurt during all this fighting  hurt say you exclaimed henry laughing it is a miracle that he is now alive after the flight he took over the north cliff into the sea  flight over the north cliff echoed mrs stuart in surprise  ay and a fearful plunge he had  here henry detailed poor jos misadventure  and now said he when he had finished i must lock his door and keep him in  the settlers have forgotten him in all this turmoil but depend upon it if they see him they will string him up for a pirate to the first handy branch of a tree without giving him the benefit of a trial and that would not be desirable  yet you would have shot gascoyne on mere suspicion without a thought of trial or justice said mrs stuart  true mother but that was when i was seizing him and in hot blood said henry in a subdued voice  i was hasty there no doubt  lucky for us both that the pistol missed fire  the widow looked as if she were about to reply but checked herself  yes said mr mason recurring to the former subject as we shall be away a few days we must lock bumpus up to keep him out of harms way meanwhile  the missionary was interrupted here by the sudden opening of the door an exclamation of surprise burst from the whole party as they sprang up for gascoyne strode into the room locked the door and taking out the key handed it to henry who stood staring at him in speechless amazement  you are surprised to see me appear thus suddenly said he but the fact is that i came here this morning to fulfil a duty and although master henry there has hindered me somewhat in carrying out my good intentions i do not intend to allow him to frustrate me altogether  i do not mean to make a second attempt gascoyne after what has occurred this morning said henry seating himself doggedly on his chair  but it would be as well that you should observe that mr mason is a stout man and as we have seen can act vigorously when occasion offers  remember that we are two to one now  there will be no occasion for vigorous action at least as regards me if you will agree to forget your suspicions for a few minutes and listen to what i have got to say  meanwhile in order to shew you how thoroughly in earnest i am and how regardless of my personal safety i render myself defencelessthus  gascoyne pulled a brace of small pistols from their place of concealment beneath the breast of his shirt and drawing the knife that hung at his girdle hurled them all through the open window into the garden  he then took a chair planted it in the middle of the room and sat down the sadness of his deep voice did not change during the remainder of that interview  the bold look which usually characterised this peculiar man had given place to a grave expression of humility which was occasionally varied by a troubled look  before stating what i have come for said gascoyne i mean to make a confession  you have been right in your suspicionsi am durward the pirate  nay do not shrink from me in that way mary  i have kept this secret from you long because i feared to lose the old friendship that has existed between us since we were children  i have deceived you in this thing only  i have taken advantage of your ignorance to make you suppose that i was merely a smuggler and that in consequence of being an outlaw it was necessary for me to conceal my name and my movements  you have kept my secret mary and have tried to win me back to honest ways but you little knew the strength of the net i had wrapped around me  you did not know that i was a pirate  gascoyne paused and bent his head as if in thought  the widow sat with clasped hands gazing at him with a look of despair on her pale face but she did not move or speak  the three listeners sat in perfect silence until the pirate chose to continue his confession  yes i have been a pirate said he but i have not been the villain that men have painted me  he looked steadily in the widows face as he said these words deliberately  do not try to palliate your conduct gascoyne said mr mason earnestly  the blackness of your sin is too great to be deepened or lightened by what men may have said of you  you are a pirate  every pirate is a murderer  i am not a murderer said gascoyne slowly in reply but still fixing his gaze on the widows face as if he addressed himself solely to her  you may not have committed murder with your own hand said mr mason but the man who leads on others to commit the crime is a murderer in the eye of gods law as well as in that of man  i never led on men to commit murder said gascoyne in the same tone and with the same steadfast gaze  this hand is free from the stain of human blood  do you believe me mary  the widow did not answer  she sat like one bereft of all power of speech or motion  i will explain resumed the pirate captain drawing a long breath and directing his looks to henry now  for reasons which it is not necessary that you should know i resolved some years ago to become a pirate  i had been deceivedshamefully deceived and wrongedby wealthy and powerful men  i had appealed to the law of my country and the law refused to right me  no not the law but those who sat on the judgmentseat to pervert the law  it matters not now i was driven mad at the time for the wrong done was not done so much to me as to those whom i loved  i vowed that i should be avenged  i soon found men as mad as myself who only wanted a leader to guide them in order to run full swing to destruction  i seized the foam of which schooner i was mate called her the avenger and became a pirate  no blood was shed when i seized the schooner  before an opportunity occurred of trying my hand at this new profession my anger had cooled  i repented of what i had done but i was surrounded by men who were more bent on mischief than i was  i could not now draw back but i modified my plan  i determined to become merely a robber and use the proceeds of my trade to indemnify those to whom injustice had been done  i thought at the time that there was some justice in this  i called myself in jest a taxgatherer of the sea  i ordered the men aft one day and explained to them my views  i said that i abhorred the name and the deeds of pirates that i would only consent to command them if they agreed never to shed human blood except in fair and open fight  they liked the idea  there were men among them who had never heartily agreed to the seizing of the schooner and who would have left her if i would have allowed them these were much relieved to hear my proposal it was fixed that we should rob but not murder  miserable fool that i was  i thought it was possible to go just so far and no farther into sin  i did not know at that time the strength of the fearful current into which i had plunged  but we stuck to our principles  we never did commit murder  and as our appearance was always sufficient to cause the colours of any ship we ever came across to be hauled down at once there has been no occasion for shedding blood even in fair and open fight  do you believe me mary said gascoyne pausing at this point  the widow was still silent but a slight inclination of her head satisfied the pirate who was about to resume when mr mason saidgascoyne do you call warfare in the cause of robbery by the name of fair and open fight  no i do not  yet there have been great generals and admirals in this world who have committed wholesale murder in this same cause and whose names stand high in the roll of fame  a look of scorn rested on the pirates face as he said this but it passed away quickly  you tell me that there were some of the men in the schooner whom you kept aboard against their will said mr mason  did it never occur to you gascoyne that you may have been the murderer of the souls of these men  the pirate made no reply for some time and the troubled anxious look that had more than once crossed his face returned  yes said he at length i have thought of that  but it is done now and cannot be undone  i can do no more now than give myself up to justice  you see i have thrown away my arms and stand here defenceless  but i did not come here to plead for mercy  i come to make to you all the reparation i can for the wrong i have done you when that last act is completed you may do with me what you please  i deserve to die and i care not to live  o gascoyne speak not thus exclaimed the widow earnestly  however much and deeply you have sinned against man if you have not taken life you do not deserve to die  besides there is a way of pardon open to the very chief of sinners  i know what you mean mary i know what you mean butwell well this is neither the time nor place to talk of such things  your little girl mr mason is in the hands of the pirates  i know that said the missionary wincing as if he had received a deep wound but she is not in your power now  mores the pity she would have been safer with me than with my first mate who is the greatest villain afloat on the high seas  he does not like our milkandwater style of robbing  he is an outandout pirate in heart and has long desired to cut my throat  i have to thank him for being here tonight  some of the crew who are like himself seized me while i was asleep bound and gagged me put me into a boat and rowed me ashorefor we had easily escaped the talisman in the squall and doubling or our course came back here  the mate was anxious to clear off old scores by cutting my throat at once and pitching me into the sea  luckily some of the men not so bloodthirsty as he objected to this so i was landed and cast loose  but what of alice cried mr mason anxiously  how can we save her  by taking my advice answered gascoyne  you have a small cutter at anchor off the creek at the foot of the hill  put a few trusty men aboard of her and i will guide you to the island where the avenger has been wont to fly when hard pressed  but how do you know that manton will go there inquired henry eagerly  because he is short of powder and all our stores are concealed there besides much of our illgotten wealth  and how can you expect us to put ourselves so completely in your power said mr mason  because you must do so if you would save your child  she is safe now i know and will be until the avenger leaves the island where our stores are concealed  if we do not save her before that happens she is lost to you for ever  that no man can say  she is in the hands of god cried mr mason fervently  true true said gascoyne musing  but god does not work by miracles  we must be up and doing at once  i promise you that i shall be faithful and that after the work is done i will give myself up to justice  may we trust him mother said henry  you may trust him my son replied the widow in a tone of decision that satisfied henry while it called forth a look of gratitude from the pirate  the party now proceeded to arrange the details of their plan for the rescue of alice and her companions  these were speedily settled and henry rose to go and put them in train  he turned the key of the door and was on the point of lifting the latch when this was done for him by some one on the outside  he had just time to step back when the door flew open and he stood face to face with hugh barnes the cooper  have you heard the news henryhallo  this abrupt exclamation was caused by the sight of gascoyne who rose quietly the moment he heard the door open and turning his back towards it walked slowly into a small apartment that opened off the widows parlour and shut the door  i say henry whos that big fellow said the cooper casting a suspicious glance towards the little room into which he had disappeared  he is a friend of mine replied mrs stuart rising hastily and welcoming her visitor  humph its well hes a friend said the man as he took a chair i shouldnt like to have him for an enemy  but what is the news you were so anxious to tell us inquired henry  that gascoyne the pirate captain has been seen on the island by some of the women and theres a regular hunt organising  will you go with us  i have more important work to do hugh replied henry besides i want you to go with me on a hunt which ill tell you about if youll come with me to the creek  by all means come along  henry and the cooper at once left the cottage  the latter was let into the secret and prevailed on to form one of the crew of the wasp as the little cutter was named  in the course of the afternoon everything was in readiness  gascoyne waited till the dusk of the evening and then embarked along with ole thorwald that stout individual having insisted on being one of the party despite the remonstrances of mr mason who did not like to leave the settlement even for a brief period so completely deprived of all its leading men  but ole entertained a suspicion that gascoyne intended to give them the slip and having privately made up his mind to prevent this he was not to be denied  the men who formed the crewtwelve in numberwere selected from among those natives and settlers who were known never to have seen the pirate captain  they were chosen with a view to their fighting qualities for gascoyne and henry were sufficient for the management of the little craft  there were no large guns on board but all the men were well armed with cutlasses muskets and pistols  thus equipped the wasp stood out to sea with a light breeze just as the moon rose on the coral reef and cast a shower of sparkling silver across the bay    chapter twenty one  a terrible doom for an innocent man  so youre to be hanged for a pirate jo bumpus ye arethats pleasant to think of anyhow  such was the remark which our stout seaman addressed to himself when he awoke on the second morning after the departure of the wasp  if the thought was really as pleasant as he asserted it to be his visage must have been a bad index to the state of his mind for at that particular moment jo looked uncommonly miserable  the wonted goodhumoured expression of his countenance had given place to a gaze of stereotyped surprise and solemnity  indeed bumpus seemed to have parted with much of his reason and all of his philosophy for he could say nothing else during at least halfanhour after awaking except the phraseso youre going to be hanged for a pirate  his comments on the phrase were however a little varied though always briefsuch aswot a sell  whod ha thought it  its a dream it is an orrible dream  i dont believe itwho does  wotll your poor mother sayand the like  bumpus had unfortunately good ground for making this statement  after the cutter sailed it was discovered that bumpus was concealed in mrs stuarts cottage  this discovery had been the result of the seamans own recklessness and indiscretion for when he ascertained that he was to be kept a prisoner in the cottage until the return of the wasp he at once made up his mind to submit with a good grace to what could not be avoided  in order to prove that he was by no means cast down as well as to lighten the tedium of his confinement jo entertained himself by singing snatches of sea songssuch as my tight little crafta life on the stormy seaoh for a draught of the howling blast etcetera all of which he delivered in a bass voice so powerful that it caused the rafters of the widows cottage to ring again  these melodious not to say thunderous sounds also caused the ears of a small native youth to tingle with curiosity  this urchin crept on his brown little knees under the window of bumpuss apartment got on his brown and dirty little tiptoes placed his brown little hands on the sill hauled his brown and halfnaked little body up by sheer force of muscle and peeped into the room with his large and staring brown eyes the whites of which were displayed to their full extent  jo was in the middle of an enthusiastic oh when the urchins head appeared  instead of expressing his passionate desire for a draught of the howling blast he prolonged the oh into a hideous yell and thrust his blazing face close to the window so suddenly that the boy let go his hold fell backwards and rolled head over heels into a ditch out of which he scrambled with violent haste and ran with the utmost possible precipitancy to his native home on the seashore  here he related what he had seen to his father  the father went and looked in upon jos solitude  he happened to have seen bumpus during the great fight and knew him to be one of the pirates  the village rose en masse  some of the worst characters in it stirred up the rest went to the widows cottage and demanded that the person of the pirate should be delivered up  the widow objected  the settlers insisted  the widow protested  the settlers threatened force  upon this the widow reasoned with them besought them to remember that the missionary would be back in a day or two and that it would be well to have his advice before they did anything and finally agreed to give up her charge on receiving a promise that he should have a fair trial  bumpus was accordingly bound with ropes led in triumph through the village and placed in a strong wooden building which was used as the jail of the place  the trial that followed was a mere mockery  the leading spirits of it were those who had been styled by mr mason enemies within the camp they elected themselves to the offices of prosecutor and judge as well as taking the trouble to act the part of jurymen and witnesses  poor john bumpuss doom was sealed before the trial began  they had prejudged the case and only went through the form to ease their own consciences and to fulfil their promise to the widow  it was in vain that bumpus asserted with a bold honest countenance that he was not a pirate that he never had been and never would be a pirate that he did not believe the foam was a piratethough he was free to confess its crew wos bad enough for anything amost that he had been hired in south america where he had been shipwrecked by captain gascoyne the sandalwood trader that he had made the voyage straight from that coast to this island without meeting a single sail and that he had never seen a shot fired or a cutlass drawn aboard the schooner  to all this there was but one coarselyexpressed answerit is a lie jo had no proof to give of the truth of what he said so he was condemned to be hanged by the neck till he should be dead and as his judges were afraid that the return of the wasp might interfere with their proceedings it was arranged that he should be executed on the following day at noon  it must not be imagined that in a christian village such as we have described there was no one who felt that this trial was too hastily gone into and too violently conducted  but those who were inclined to take a merciful view of the case and who pled for delay were chiefly natives while the violent party was composed of most of the illdisposed european settlers  the natives had been so much accustomed to put confidence in the wisdom of the white men since their conversion to christianity that they felt unable to cope with them on this occasion so that bumpus after being condemned was led away to his prison and left alone to his own reflections  it chanced that there was one friend left unintentionally in the cell with the condemned man  this was none other than our friend toozle the mass of ragged doormat on which alice doted so fondly  this little dog had during the course of the events which have taken so long to recount done nothing worthy of being recorded  he had indeed been much in every ones way when no one had had time or inclination to take notice of him  he had being an affectionate dog and desirous of much sympathy courted attention frequently and had received many kicks and severe rebuffs for his pains and he had also being a tenderhearted dog howled dreadfully when he lost his young mistress but he had not in any way promoted the interests of humanity or advanced the ends of justice  hence our long silence in regard to him  recollecting that he had witnessed evidences of a friendly relation subsisting between alice and bumpus toozle straightway sought to pour the overflowing love and sorrow of his large little heart into the bosom of that supposed pirate  his advances were well received and from that hour he followed the seaman like his shadow  he shared his prison with him trotted behind him when he walked up and down his room in the widows cottage lay down at his feet when he rested looked up inquiringly in his face when he paused to meditate whined and wagged his stump of a tail when he was taken notice of and lay down to sleep in deep humility when he was neglected  thus it came to pass that toozle attended the trial of bumpus entered his cell along with him slept with him during the night accompanied him to the gallows in the morning and sat under him when they were adjusting the noose looking up with feelings of unutterable dismay as was clearly indicated by the lugubrious and woebegone cast of his ragged countenancebut we are anticipating  it was on the morning of his execution that bumpus sat on the edge of his hard pallet gazed at his manacled wrists and gave vent to the sentiments set down at the beginning of this chapter  toozle sat at his feet looking up in his face sympathetically  no i dont believe its possible said bumpus for at least the hundredth time that morning  its a joke thats wot it is  aint it toozle my boy  toozle whined wagged his tail and said as plainly as if he had spoken yes of course it isan uncommonly bad joke no doubt but a joke undoubtedly so keep up your heart my man  ah youre a funny dog continued bumpus but you dont know wot it is to be hanged my boy  hanged why its agin all laws o justice moral an otherwise it is  but im dreamin yes its dreamin i am but i dont think i ever did dream that i thought i was dreamin an yet wasnt quite sure  really its perplexin to say the least on it aint it toozle  toozle wagged his tail  ah here comes my imaginary jailer to let me out o this here abominably reallookin imaginary lockup  hang jo bumpus why its  before jo could find words sufficiently strong to express his opinion of such a murderous intention the door opened and a surlylooking mana european settlerentered with his breakfast  this meal consisted of a baked breadfruit and a can of water  ha youve come to let me out have you cried jo in a tone of forced pleasantry which was anything but cheerful  have i though said the man setting down the food on a small deal table that stood at the head of the bedstead dont think it my man your times up in another two hourshallo where got ye the dog  it came in with me last nightto keep me company i fancy which is more than the human dogs o this murderin place had the civility to do  if it had knowd you was a murderin pirate retorted the jailer it would ha thought twice before it would ha chose you for a comrade  come now said bumpus in a remonstrative tone you dont really blieve im a pirate do you  in coorse i do  well now thats xtraornary  does everybody else think that too  everybody  an am i really goin to be hanged  till youre dead as mutton  thats entertainin aint it toozle cried poor bumpus with a laugh of desperation for he found it utterly impossible to persuade himself to believe in the reality of his awful position  as he said nothing more the jailer went away and bumpus after heaving two or three very deep sighs attempted to partake of his meagre breakfast  the effort was a vain one  the bite stuck in his throat so he washed it down with a gulp of water and for the first time in his life made up his mind to go without his breakfast  a little before twelve oclock the door again opened and the surly jailer entered bearing a halter and accompanied by six stout men  the irons were now removed from bumpuss wrists and his arms pinioned behind his back  being almost stupified with amazement at his position he submitted without a struggle  i say friends he at last exclaimed would any amount of oaths took before a maginstrate convince ye that im not a pirate but a trueblue seaman  if you were to swear from this time till doomsday it would make no difference  you admit that you were one of the foams crew  we now know that the foam and the avenger are the same schooner  birds of a feather flock together  a pirate would swear anything to save his life  come times up  bumpus bent his head for a minute  the truth forced itself upon him now in all its dread reality  but no unmanly terrors filled his breast at that moment  the fear of man or of violent death was a sensation which the seaman never knew  the feeling of the huge injustice that was about to be done filled him with generous indignation the blood rushed to his temples and with a bound like a tiger he leaped out of the jailers grasp hurling him to the ground in the act  with the strength almost of a samson he wrestled with his cords for a few seconds but they were new and strong  he failed to burst them  in another moment he was overpowered by the six men who guarded him  true to his principles he did his utmost to escape  strong in the faith that while there is life there is hope he did not cease to struggle like a chained giant until he was placed under the limb of the fatal tree which had been selected and round which an immense crowd of natives and white settlers had gathered  during the previous night the widow stuart had striven to save the man whom she knew to be honest for gascoyne had explained to her all about his being engaged in his service  but those to whom she appealed even on her knees were immovable  they considered the proof of the mans guilt quite conclusive and regarded the widows intercession as the mere weakness of a tenderhearted woman  on the following morning and again beside the fatal tree itself the widow pled for the mans life with all her powers of eloquence but in vain  when all hope appeared to have passed away she could not stand to witness so horrible a murder  she fled to her cottage and throwing herself on her bed burst into an agony of tears and prayer  but there were some among the european settlers there who now that things had come to a point felt ill at ease and would fain have washed their hands of the whole affair  others there were who judged the man from his countenance and his acts not from circumstances  these remonstrated even to the last and advised delay  but the half dozen who were set upon the mans deathnot to gratify a thirst for blood but to execute due justice on a pirate whom they abhorredwere influential and violent men  they silenced all opposition at last and john bumpus finally had the noose put round his neck  o susan susan cried the poor man in an agony of intense feeling its little ye thought your jo would come to such an end as this when ye last sot eyes on himan sweet blue eyes they wos too  there was something ludicrous as well as pathetic in this cry  it did more for him than the most eloquent pleading could have done  man in a crowd is an unstable being  at any moment he will veer right round and run in an opposite direction  the idea that the condemned man had a susan who would mourn over his untimely end touched a cord in the hearts of many among the crowd  the reference to her sweet blue eyes at such a moment raised a smile and an extremely dismal but opportune howl from poor toozle raised a laugh  bumpus started and looked sternly on the crowd  you may think me a pirate said he but i know enough of the feelins of honest men to expect no mercy from those wot can laugh at a fellowcreetur in such an hour  you had better get the murder over as soon as ye can  i am readystay one moment more  i had amost forgot it  theres a letter here that i want one o you to take charge of its the last i ever got from my susan an if i had taken her advice to let alone havin to do with all sandalwood traders id never ha bin in such a fix as i am this day  i want it sent back to her with my blessin and a lock o my hair  is there an honest man among ye wholl take in hand to do this for me  as he spoke a young man in a costume somewhat resembling that of a sailor pushed through the crowd leaped upon the deal table on which jo stood and removed the noose from his neck  an exclamation of anger burst from those who surrounded the table but a sound something like applause broke from the crowd and restrained any attempt at violence  the young man at the same time held up his hand and asked leave to address them  ay ay lets hear what he has got to say  thats it speak up dan  the youth whose dark olive complexion proclaimed him to be a halfcaste and whose language shewed that he had received at least the rudiments of education stretched out his hand and said  friends i do not stand here to interfere with justice  those who seek to give a pirate his just reward do well  but there has been doubt in the minds of some that this man may not be a pirate  his own word is of no value but if i can bring forward anything to shew that perhaps his word is true then we have no right to hang him till we have given him a longer trial  hear hear from the white men in the crowd and ho ho from the natives  meanwhile the young man or dan as some one called him turned to bumpus and asked for the letter to which he had referred  being informed that it was in the inside pocket of his jacket the youth put his hand in and drew it forth  may i read it  your life may depend on what i find here  sartinly by all manner of means replied jo not a little surprised at the turn affairs were taking  dan opened and perused the epistle for a few minutes during which intense silence was maintained in the crowd as if they expected to hear the thoughts of the young man as they passed through his brain  ha  i thought so exclaimed dan looking up and again addressing the crowd  at the trial yesterday you heard this man say that he was engaged at san francisco by gascoyne on the 12th of april last and that he believed the schooner to be a sandalwood trader when he shipped  yes yes ho from the crowd  if this statement of his be true then he was not a pirate when he shipped and he has not had much time to become one between that time and this  the letter which i hold in my hand proves the truth of this statement  it is dated san francisco 11th april and is written in a female hand  listen i will read it and you shall judge for yourselves  the young man then read the following letter which being a peculiar as well as an interesting specimen of a loveletter we give verbatim et

indignation that swelled the broad chest of honest john bumpus when he listened to the laughter with which some parts of this letter were received  now said dan could any man want better proof than this that john bumpus is not a pirate  this question was answered by a perfect yell from the crowd  set him free cut his cords cried a voice  stop friends cried a big coarselooking man leaping on the table and jostling dan out of the way  not quite so fast  i dont pretend to be a learned feller and i cant make a speech with a buttery tongue like dan here  but wot ive got to say isjustice for ever  hurrah from some of the wild spirits of the crowd  go on burke from others  yes wot i say isjustice for ever  fair play an no favour thats wot i say  another cheer greeted the bold assertion of these noble sentiments  now here it is continued burke becoming much excited wots to hinder that there letter bein a forgeryay thats the word a forgery  hear hear got up apurpose to bamboozle us chaps that aint lawyers  dye see  burke glanced at dan and smote his thigh triumphantly as he said this  it does not look like a forgery said dan holding up the letter and pointing to the writing  i leave it to yourselves to say if it sounds like a forgery  i dont care a farthin dip for yer looks and sounds cried burke interrupting the other  no man is goin for to tell me that anybody can trust to looks and sounds  why ive knowd the greatest villain that ever chewed the end of a smuggled cigar look as innocent as the babe unborn  an is there a man here wotll tell me he hasnt often an over again mistook the crack of a big gun for a clap o thunder  this was received with much approval by the crowd which had evidently more than halfforgotten the terrible purpose for which it had assembled there and was now much interested in what bid fair to be a keen dispute  when the noise abated dan raised his voice and saidif burke had not interrupted me i was going to have said that another thing which proves the letter to be no forgery is that the postmark of san francisco is on the back of it with the date all right  this statement delighted the crowd immensely and caused burke to look disconcerted for a few seconds he rallied however and returned to the charge  postmarks wot do i care for postmarks  cant a man forge a postmark as easy as any other mark  ah thats true from a voice in the crowd  no not so easily as any other mark retorted dan for its made with a kind of ink thats not sold in shops  everything goes to prove that the letter is no forgery  but mr burke will you answer me thisif it was a forgery got up for the purpose of saving this mans life at what time was it forged for bumpus could not know that he would ever need such a letter until yesterday afternoon and between that time and this there was but little time to forge a letter from san francisco postmark and all and make it soiled and worn at the edges like an old letter  hear and sensation  more than that cried dan waxing eager and earnest if it was a forgery got up for this purpose why was it not produced at the trial  hear hear and cheers  and last of all why if this forgery was so important to him did john bumpus forget all about it until he stood on this table ay until the rope was round his neck  a perfect storm of cheers and applause followed this last sentence in the midst of which there were cries of youre floored burke  hurrah for bumpus  cut the ropes  but although johns life was now safe his indignation at susans letter having been laughed at was not altogether allayed  ill tell ye wot it is said he the instant there was a lull in the uproar of voices  if you think that ill stand here and see my susans letter insulted before my eyes youre very far out o your reckoning just cut them ropes an put any two o yer biggest men black or white before me an if i dont shew them a lot o new stars as hasnt been seed in no sky wotiver since adam was a little boy my names  up to this point jo was heard but the conclusion of his defiance was drowned in roars of laughter  cut the ropes shouted the crowd  dan drew a claspknife from his pocket and with one stroke set bumpus free  shoulder high yelled a voice hurrah  a wild rush was made at the table  jos executioners were overturned and trampled under foot and the table with himself and his young advocate sprawling on it was raised on the shoulders of the crowd and borne off in triumph  halfanhour later bumpus was set down at the widows door  mrs stuart received him with a scream of surprise and joy for she had given him up as a lost man  now then mrs stuart said jo throwing himself on a chair and wiping the perspiration from his forehead dont make such a fuss about me like a good creetur  but do get me a bit o bacon and lets be thankful that im here to eat it  cut it fat mrs stuart cut it fat for its wonderful wot a appetite ive got after such a mornins work as ive gone through  well well after all that yer friends have said of ye jo bumpus i do believe that yer not born to be hanged    chapter twenty two  the rendezvousan episodepeculiar circumstancesand other matters  about five or six days sail from the scene of our tale there lies one of those small rocks or islets with which the breast of the pacific is in many places thickly studded  it is a lonely coral isle far removed from any of its fellows and presenting none of those grand features which characterise the island on which the settlement of sandy cove was situated  in no part does it rise more than thirty feet above the level of the sea in most places it is little more than a few feet above it  the coral reefs around it are numerous and as many of them rise to within a few feet of the surface the navigation in its neighbourhood is dangerous in the extreme  at the time of which we write the vegetation of the isle was not very luxuriant  only a few clusters of cocoanut palms grew here and there over its otherwise barren surface  in this respect it did not resemble most of the other islands of the pacific  owing partly to its being out of the usual course of ships and partly to the dangerous reefs already referred to the spot was never approached by vessels or if a ship happened to be driven towards it she got out of its way as speedily as possible  this was the rendezvous of the pirates and was named by them the isle of palms  here in caverns hollowed out of the coral rock gascoyne had been wont to secrete such goods and stores as were necessary for the maintenance of his piratical course of life and to this lone spot did manton convey his prisoners after getting rid of his former commander  towards this spot also did gascoyne turn the prow of the cutter wasp in pursuit of his mutinous first mate  manton for reasons best known to himself certainly not from goodness of heart was kind to his captives to the extent of simply letting them alone  he declined to hold any intercourse whatever with captain montague and forbade him to speak with the men upon pain of being confined to his berth  the young people were allowed to do as they pleased so long as they kept out of the way  on reaching the isle of palms the pirates at once proceeded to take in those stores of which they stood in need  the harbour into which the schooner ran was a narrow bay on the shores of which the palm trees grew sufficiently high to prevent her masts from being seen from the other side of the island  here the captives were landed but as manton did not wish them to witness his proceedings he sent them across the islet under the escort of a party who conveyed them to the shores of a small bay  on the rocks in this bay lay the wreck of what once had been a noble ship  it was now completely dismantled  her hull was stove in by the rocks  her masts and yards were gone with the exception of their stumps and the lower part of the mainmast to which the mainyard still hung with a ragged portion of the mainsail attached to it  a feeling of depression filled the breast of montague and his companions as they came in sight of this wreck and the former attempted to obtain some information in regard to her from his conductors but they sternly bade him ask no questions  some time afterwards he heard the story of this vessels fate  we shall record it here  not many months prior to the date of our tale the avenger happened to have occasion to run down to the isle of palms  gascoyne was absent at the time  he had been landed at sandy cove and had ordered manton to go to the rendezvous for supplies  on nearing the isle a storm arose the wind was fair however and the schooner ran for her destination under close reefed sails  just before reaching it they fell in with a large fullrigged ship which on sighting the schooner ran up her flag halfmast high as a signal of distress  she had sprung a leak and was sinking  had the weather been calmer the pirates would have at once boarded the vessel and carried her as a prize into the harbour but the sea ran so high that this was impossible  manton therefore ran down as close to the side of the merchantman for such she seemed to be as enabled him to hail her through the speaking trumpet  when sufficiently near he demanded her name and destination  the brilliant from liverpool bound for the sandwich islands  and you  the foamfrom the feejeesfor calcutta  whats wrong with you  sprung a leak is there anchorage in the bay sang out the captain of the merchantman  no its too shoal for a big ship  bear away round to the other side of the island  youll find good holding ground therei will shew you the way  the pirate accordingly conducted the unsuspecting stranger away from the only safe harbour in the island and led him through a complete labyrinth of reefs and rocks to the bay on the other side in which he knew full well there was scarcely enough of water to float his own little schooner  with perfect confidence in his guide the unfortunate captain of the merchantman followed until both vessels were in the comparatively still and sheltered water of the bay  here manton suddenly put down the helm brought his vessel up to the wind and allowed the stranger to pass him  hold on about sixty fathoms farther and then let go your anchor he shouted as the ship went steadily on to her doom  ay ay and thank ee cried the captain who had already taken in nearly all sail and was quite prepared to anchor  but manton knew that before twenty fathoms more should be passed over by the ship she would run straight on a coral reef which rose to within about five feet of the surface of the sea  in an exposed place this reef would have formed a line of breakers but in its sheltered position the water gave no indication of its existence  the gale though not blowing direct into the bay entered it in a sufficiently straight line to carry the ship onward with great speed notwithstanding the reduction made in her canvas  stand by to let go the anchor cried her captain  that was his last order  scarcely had the words passed his lips when the ship struck with a shock that caused her to quiver like a leaf from stem to stern  all the topmasts with their yards and rigging went over the side and in one instant the fine vessel was a total wreck  the rest of the story is soon told  the pirates shewed their true colours ran alongside and took possession without opposition for the crew of the merchantman were so overwhelmed by the suddenness and appalling nature of the calamity that had befallen them that they had no heart to resist  of course it was out of the question that the crew of the brilliant could be allowed to remain on the island  some of the pirates suggested that they should be put on a raft towed to leeward of the island and when out of sight of it be cast adrift to float about until they should be picked up or get blown on one of the numerous islands that lay to the southward of the rendezvous  manton and scraggs advocated this plan but the betterdisposed among the men protested against such needless cruelty and suggested that it would be better to put them into the longboat of the ship bandage their eyes then tow them out of sight of land and cast them loose to steer where they pleased  this plan was adopted and carried into execution  then the pirates returned and at their leisure unloaded and secured the cargo of their prize  it was richer than they had anticipated being a miscellaneous cargo of valuable commodities for the trading stores of some of the south sea merchants and settlers  the joy felt by the pirates on making this discovery was all the benefit that was ever derived from these illgotten gains by any one of those who had a hand in that dastardly deed  long before they had an opportunity of removing the goods thus acquired the career of the avenger had terminated  but we must not anticipate our story  on a green knoll near the margin of this bay and in full view of the wreck a rude tent or hut was constructed by the pirates out of part of an old sail which had been washed ashore from the wreck and some broken spars  a small cask of biscuit and two or three blankets were placed in it and here the captives were left to do as they pleased until such time as manton chose to send for them  the only piece of advice that was given to them by their surly jailer was that they should not on any pretence whatever cross the island to the bay in which the schooner lay at anchor  if ye do said the man who was the last of the party to quit them yell wish ye hadntthats all  take my advice and keep yer kooriosity in yer breeches pockets  with this caution they were left to their own devices and meditations  it was a lovely calm evening at sunset when our four unfortunate friends were thus left alone in these strange circumstances  the effect of their forlorn condition was very different on each  poopy flung herself down on the ground inside the tent and began to sob alice sat down beside her and wept silently whilst montague forgetting his own sorrows in his pity for the poor young creatures who had been thus strangely linked to him in affliction sat down opposite to alice and sought to comfort her  will corrie feeling that he could do nothing to cheer his companions in the circumstances and being unable to sit still rose and going out at the end of the tent both sides of which were open stood leaning on a pole and contemplated the scene before him  in a small creek or indentation of the shore close to the knoll on which the tent stood two of the pirates were working at a boat which lay there  corrie could not at first understand what they were about but he was soon enlightened for after hauling the boat as far out of the water as they could they left her there and followed their comrades to the other side of the island carrying the oars along with them  the spirit that dwelt in corries breast was a very peculiar one  up to this point in his misfortunes the poor boy had been subduedoverwhelmed by the suddenness and the terrible nature of the calamity that had befallen himor rather that had befallen alice for to do him justice he only thought of her  indeed he carried this feeling so far that he had honestly confessed to himself in a mental soliloquy the night on which he had been captured that he did not care one straw for himself or poopy or captain montaguethat his whole and sole distress of mind and body was owing to the grief into which alice had been plunged  he had made an attempt to comfort her one night on the voyage to the isle of palms when she and poopy and he were left alone together but he failed  after one or two efforts he ended by bursting into tears and then choking himself violently with his own hands said that he was ashamed of himself that he wasnt crying for himself but for her alice and that he hoped she wouldnt think the worse of him for being so like a baby  here he turned to poopy and in a most unreasonable manner began to scold her for being at the bottom of the whole mischief in the middle of which he broke off said that he believed himself to be mad and vowed he would blow out his own brains first and those of all the pirates afterwards  whereupon he choked sobbed again and rushed out of the cabin as if he really meant to execute his last awful threat  but poor corrie only rushed away to hide from alice the irrepressible emotions that nearly burst his heart  yes corrie was thoroughly subdued by grief  but the spring was not broken it was only crushed flat by the weight of sorrow that lay like a millstone on his youthful bosom  the first thing that set his active brain agoing once morethereby overturning the weight of sorrow and causing the spring of his peculiar spirit to reboundwas the sight of the two pirates hauling up the boat and carrying off the oars  ha thats your game is it muttered the boy between his teeth and grasping the pole with both hands as if he wished to squeeze his fingers into the wood  you dont want to give us a chance of escaping dont you eh is that it  you think that because were a small party and the half of us females that were cowed and wont think of trying any other way of escaping do you  oh yes thats what you think you know it you do but youre mistaken he became terribly sarcastic and bitter at this point youll find that you have got men to deal with that youve not only caught a tartar but two tartarsone o them being ten times tartarer than the other  oh if  whats all that youre saying corrie said montague stepping out of the tent at that moment  o captain said the boy vehemently i wish i were a giant  why so lad  because then i would wade out to that wreck clap my shoulder to her bow shove her into deep water carry you and alice and poopy aboard haul out the mainmast by the roots make an oar of it and scull out to sea havin previously fired off the biggest gun aboard of her to let the pirates know what i was doing  corries spirit was in a tumultuous and very rebellious state  he was half inclined to indulge in hysterical weeping and more than half disposed to give way to a burst of savage glee  he spoke with the mantling blood blazing in his fat cheeks and his two eyes glittering like those of a basilisk  montague could not repress a smile and a look of admiration as he said to our little hero  why corrie if you were a giant it would be much easier to go to the other side of the island wring off the heads of all the pirates and carrying me on your shoulders and alice and poopy in your coatpockets get safely aboard of the foam and ho for sandy cove  so it would said corrie gravely  i did not think of that and it would be a far pleasanter way than the other  ah  corrie i fear that you are a very bloodthirsty fellow  of course i am when ive pirates to deal with  i would kill them every man without a thought  no you wouldnt my boy  you couldnt do it in cold blood even although they are bad men  i dont know that said corrie dubiously  i would do it without more feeling than i would have in killing a cat  did you ever kill a cat asked montague  never answered corrie  then how can you tell what your feelings would be if you were to attempt to do it  i remember once when i was a boy going out to hunt cats  o captain montague surely you never hunted cats exclaimed alice who came out of the tent with a very pale face and uncommonly red eyes  yes indeed i did oncebut i never did it again  i caught one a kitten and set off with a number of boys to kill it but as we went along it began to play with my necktie and to purr  our hearts were softened so we let it go  ah  corrie my boy never go hunting cats said montague earnestly  did i say i was going to replied corrie indignantly  montague laughed and so did alice at the fierce look the boy put on  corrie said the former im sure that you would not kill a pirate in cold blood any more than you would kill a kittenwould you  im not sure o that said corrie half laughing but still looking fierce  in the first place my blood is never cold when ive to do with pirates and in the second place pirates are not innocent creatures covered with soft hairand they dont purr  this last remark set alice into a fit of laughter and drew a faint hee hee from poopy who had been listening to the conversation behind the canvas of the tent  montague took advantage of this improved state of things  now alice said he cheerfully do you and poopy set about spreading our blankettablecloth and getting supper laid out  it is but a poor one hard biscuit and waterbut there is plenty of it and after all that is the main thing  meanwhile corrie and i will saunter along shore and talk over our plans  cheer up my little girl we will manage to give these pirates the slip somehow or other you may depend upon it  corrie said montague when they were alone  i have spoken cheeringly to alice because she is a little girl and needs comfort but you and i know that our case is a desperate one and it will require all our united wisdom and cleverness to effect our escape from these rascally pirates  the commander of the talisman paused and smiled in spite of himself at the idea of being placed in circumstances that constrained him to hold a consultation in matters that might involve life and death with a mere boy  but there was no help for it besides to say truth the extraordinary energy and courage that had been displayed by the lad combined with a considerable amount of innate sharpness in his character tended to create a feeling that the consultation might not be altogether without advantage  at all events it was better to talk over their desperate position even with a boy than to confine his anxieties to his own breast  but although montague had seen enough of his young companion to convince him that he was an intelligent fellow he was not prepared for the fertility of resource the extremity of daring and the ingenuity of device that were exhibited by him in the course of that consultation  to creep over in the dead of night knife in hand and attack the pirates while asleep was one of the least startling of his daring propositions and to swim out to the wreck set her on fire and get quietly on board the avenger while all the amazed pirates should have rushed over to see what could have caused such a blaze cut the cable and sail away was among the least ingenious of his devices  these two talked long and earnestly while the shades of evening were descending on the isle of palmsand in the earnestness of their talk and the pressing urgency of their case the man almost forgot that his companion was a boy and the boy never for a moment doubted that he himself in everything but years was a man  it was getting dark when they returned to the tent where they found that alice and poopy had arranged their supper with the most scrupulous care and nicety  these too with the happy buoyancy of extreme youth had temporarily forgotten their position and when their male companions entered were deeply engaged in a private game of a tea party in which hard biscuit figured as bun and water was made to do duty for tea  in this latter part of the game by the way the children did but carry out in jest a practice which is not altogether unknown in happier circumstances and in civilised society    chapter twenty three  plans partially carried outthe cutters fateand a serious misfortune  the cutter was a fast sailer and although the pirate schooner had left sandy cove nearly two days before her the wasp having had a fair wind followed close on her heels  the avenger cast anchor in the harbour of the isle of palms on the morning of her fifth day out the wasp sighted the island on the evening of the same day  it was not gascoynes purpose to run down at once and have a hand to hand fight with his own men  he felt that his party was too weak for such an attempt and resolved to accomplish by stratagem what he could not hope to compass by force  he therefore hoveto the instant the tops of the palmtrees appeared on the horizon and waited till night should set in and favour his designs  what do you intend to do inquired henry stuart who stood on the deck watching the sun as it sank into the ocean behind a mass of golden clouds in which however there were some symptoms of stormy weather  i mean to wait till it is dark said gascoyne and then run down and take possession of the schooner  henry looked at the pirate captain in surprise and not without distrust  ole thorwald who was smoking his big german pipe with great energy looked at him with undisguised uneasiness  you speak as if you had no doubt whatever of succeeding in this enterprise mr gascoyne said the latter  i have no doubt replied gascoyne  i do believe youre right returned thorwald smoking furiously as he became more agitated  i make no question but your villains will receive you with open arms  what guarantee have we mister gascoyne or mister durward that we shall not be seized and made to walk the plank or perform some similarly fantastic featin which mayhap our feet will have less to do with the performance than our neckswhen you get into power  you have no guarantee whatever returned gascoyne except the word of a pirate  you say truth cried ole springing up and pacing the deck with unwonted energy while a troubled and somewhat fierce expression settled on his usually goodhumoured countenance  you say truth and i think we have been illadvised when we took this stepfor my part i regard myself as little better than a maniac for putting myself obstinately not to say deliberately into the very jaws of a lion perhaps i should say a tiger  but mark my words gascoyne alias durward here he stopped suddenly before the pirate who was leaning in a careless attitude against the mast and looked him full in the face if you play us false as i have no hesitation in saying i believe that you fully intend to do your life will not be worth a pewter shilling  i am yet in your power mr thorwald said gascoyne if your friends agree to it i cannot prevent your putting about and returning to sandy cove  but in that case the missionarys child will be lost  i do not believe that my childs safety is so entirely dependent on you said mr mason who had listened in silence to the foregoing dialogue she is in the hands of that god on whom you have turned your back and with whom all things are possible  but i feel disposed to trust you gascoyne and i feel thus because of what was said of you by mrs stuart in whose good sense i place implicit confidence  i would advise mr thorwald to wait patiently until he sees more cause than he does at present for distrust  gascoyne had turned round and during the greater part of this speech had gazed intently towards the horizon  we shall have rough weather tonight said he but our work will be done before it comes i hope  up with the helm now henry and slack off the sheets it is dark enough to allow us to creep in without being observed  manton will of course be in the only harbour in the island we must therefore go round to the other side and take the risk of running on the reefs  risk exclaimed henry i thought you knew all the passages about the island  so i do ladall the passages but i dont profess to know every rock and reef in the bottom of the sea  our only chance is to make the island on the south side where there are no passages at all except one that leads into a bay but if we run into that our masts will be seen against the southern sky even from the harbour where the schooner lies if we are seen they will be prepared for us in which case we shall have a desperate fight with little chance of success and the certainty of much bloodshed  we must therefore run straight for another part of the shore not far from the bay i have referred to and take our chance of striking  i think there is enough of water to float this little cutter over the reefs but i am not sure  think sure echoed thorwald in a tone of exasperated surprise and if we do strike mr gascoyne do you mean us to go beg for mercy at the hands of your men or to swim back to sandy cove  if we strike i shall take the boat land with the men and leave the cutter to her fate  the avenger will suffice to take us back to sandy cove  ole was rendered speechless by the coolness of this remark so he relieved himself by tightening his belt and spouting forth volcanoes of smoke  meanwhile the cutter had run to within a short distance of the island the night was rendered doubly dark by the rapid spreading of those heavy clouds which indicated the approach of a squall if not a storm  this is well said gascoyne in a low tone to henry stuart who stood near him the worse the storm is tonight the better for the success of our enterprise  henry lad im sorry you think so badly of me  henry was taken aback by this unexpected remark which was made in a low sad tone  can i think too badly of one who confesses himself to be a pirate said henry  the confession is at least in my favour  i had no occasion to confess nor to give myself up to you  give yourself up  it remains to be seen whether you mean to do that or not  do you not believe me henry  do you not believe the account that i gave of myself to you and your mother  how can i said the young man hesitatingly  your mother believed me  well gascoyne to tell you the plain truth i do feel more than half inclined to believe you and im sorry for youi am from my soul  you might have led a different lifeyou might even do so yet  you forget said gascoyne smiling sadly i have given myself up and you are bound to prevent my escaping  henry was perplexed by this reply  in the enthusiasm of his awakened pity he had for a moment forgotten the pirate in the penitent  before he could reply however the cutter struck violently on a rock and an exclamation of alarm and surprise burst from the crew most of whom were assembled on deck  silence cried gascoyne in a deep sonorous tone that was wonderfully different from that in which he had just been speaking to henry get out the boat  arm yourselves and jump in  there is no time to lose  the cutter is hard and fast said henry if this squall does not come on or if it turns out to be a light one we may get her off  perhaps we may but i have little hope of that returned gascoyne now lads are you all in the boat  come henry get in at once  i will remain here said henry  for what end said gascoyne in surprise  the cutter belongs to a friend i do not chose to forsake her in this offhand manner  but nothing can save her henry  perhaps not  nevertheless i will do what i can  she moves a little if she is lifted over this reef while we are on shore she will be carried out to sea and lost and that must not be allowed  leave me here till you land the men and then send the boat back with two of them  we will put some of the cutters ballast into it and try to tow her off  it wont take halfanhour and that will not interfere with your plans i should think for the whole night lies before us  seeing that he was determined gascoyne agreed and left the cutter promising to send off the boat directly  but it took halfanhour to row from the wasp to the shore and before the half of that time had elapsed the storm which had been impending burst over the island  it was much more violent than had been expected  the cutter was lifted over the reef by the first wave and struck heavily as she slid into deep water  then she rushed out to sea before the gale  henry seized the helm and kept the little vessel right before the wind  he knew nothing of the sea around and the intense darkness of the night prevented his seeing more than a dozen yards beyond the bow  it was perhaps as well that he was kept in ignorance of what awaited him for he was thus spared at least the anticipation of what appeared certain destruction  he fancied that the rock over which he had been carried was the outer reef of the island  in this he was mistaken  the whole sea around and beyond him was beset with reefs which at that moment were covered with foam  had daylight revealed the scene he would have been appalled  as it was he stood stoutly and hopefully to the helm while the cutter rushed wildly on her doom  suddenly she struck with terrific violence and henry was hurled to the deck  leaping up he sprang again to the helm and attempted to put about but the shock had been so great that the whole framework of the little craft was dislocated  the fastenings of the rudder had been torn out and she was unmanageable  the next wave lifted her over the reef and the gale swept her away  even then the hopes of the young man did not quite fail him  he believed that the last reef had now been passed and that he would be driven out to the open sea clear at least of immediate danger  it was a vain hope  in another moment the vessel struck for the third time and the mast went over the side  again and again she rose and fell with all her weight on the rocks  the last blow burst out her sides and she fell to pieces a total wreck leaving henry struggling with the waves  he seized the first piece of wood that came in his way and clung to it for many hours he was driven about and tossed by the winds and waves until he began to feel utterly exhausted but he clung to the spar with the tenacity of a drowning man  in those seas the water is not so cold as in our northern climes so that men can remain in it for a great length of time without much injury  there are many instances of the south sea islanders having been wrecked in their canoes and having spent not only hours but days in the water clinging to broken pieces of wood and swimming for many miles pushing these before them  when therefore the morning broke and the bright sun shone out and the gale had subsided henry found himself still clinging to the spar and although much weakened still able to make some exertion to save himself  on looking round he found that numerous pieces of the wreck floated near him and that the portion to which he clung was the broken lowermast a large mass of the deck with part of the gunwale attached to it lay close beside him held to the mast by one of the shrouds  he at once swam to this and found it sufficiently large to sustain his weight though not large enough to enable him to get quite out of the water while here halfin and halfout of the water his first act was to fall on his knees and thank god for sparing his life and to pray for help in that hour of need  feeling that it would be impossible to exist much longer unless he could get quite out of the water so as to allow the sun to warm his chilled frame he used what strength remained in him to drag towards him several spars that lay within his reach  these he found to be some of the rough timbers that had lain on the deck of the cutter to serve as spare masts and yards  they were therefore destitute of cordage so that it was not possible to form a secure raft  nevertheless by piling them together on the top of the broken portion of the deck he succeeded in constructing a platform which raised him completely out of the water  the heat of the sun speedily dried his garments and as the day wore on the sea went down sufficiently to render the keeping of his raft together a matter of less difficulty than it was at first  in trying to make some better arrangement of the spars on which he rested he discovered the corner of a sail sticking between two of them  this he hauled out of the water and found it to be a portion of the gaff  it was a fortunate discovery because in the event of long exposure it would prove to be a most useful covering  wringing it out he spread it over the logs to dry  the doing of all this occupied the shipwrecked youth so long that it was nearly midday before he could sit down on his raft and think calmly over his position  hunger now began to remind him that he was destitute of food but henry had been accustomed while roaming among the mountains of his island home to go fasting for long periods of time the want of breakfast therefore did not inconvenience him much but before he had remained inactive more than ten minutes the want of sleep began to tell upon him  gradually he felt completely overpowered by it he laid his head on one of the spars at last and resigned himself to an influence he could no longer resist  it was evening before he awoke from that slumber  the sun had just disappeared below the horizon and the red clouds that remained behind were beginning to deepen as night prepared to throw her dark mantle over the sea  a gull wheeled over the youths head and uttered a wild cry as he awoke causing him to start up with a feeling of bewildered uncertainty as to where he was  the true nature of his position was quickly forced upon him  a dead calm now prevailed  henry gazed eagerly wistfully round the horizon it was an unbroken line not a speck that resembled a sail was to be seen  remembering for the first time that his low raft would be quite invisible at a very short distance he set about erecting a flag  this was easily done  part of his red shirt was torn off and fastened to a light spar the end of which he stuck between the logs  having set up his signal of distress he sat down beside it and drawing part of the sail over his shoulders leaned on the broken part of the bulwark and pondered his forlorn condition  it was a long sad reverie into which poor henry stuart fell that evening  hope did not indeed forsake his breastfor hope is strong in youth but he was too well acquainted with the details of a sailors life and risks to be able to shut his eyes to the real dangers of his position  he knew full well that if he should be cast on any of the inhabited islands of the south seas unless it might be one of the very few that had at that time accepted the gospel he would certainly be killed by the savages whose practice it is to slay and eat all unfortunates who chance to be wrecked and cast upon their shores  but no islands were in sight and it was possible that he might be left to float on the boundless ocean until the slow and terrible process of starvation did its work and wore away the life which he felt to be so fresh and strong within him  when he thought of this he shuddered and reverted almost with a feeling of pleasure to the idea that another storm might spring up ere long and by dashing his frail raft to pieces bring his life to a speedy termination  his hopes were not very clear even to his own mind he did indeed hope because he could not help it but what it was that he hoped for would have puzzled him to state  a passing ship finding him in a part of the pacific where ships were not wont to pass was perhaps among the least animating of all his hopes  but the thoughts that coursed through the youths brain that night were not centred alone upon the means or the prospects of deliverance  he thought of his motherher gentleness her goodness her unaccountable partiality for gascoyne but more than all he thought of her love for himself  he thought too of his former lifehis joys his sorrows and his sins  as he remembered these last his soul was startled and he thought of his god and his saviour as he had never thought before despite his efforts to restrain them tears but not unmanly tears would flow down his cheeks as he sat that evening on his raft meditated on the past the present and the future and realised the terrible solemnity of his positionwithout water or foodalmost without hopealone on the deep  see frontispiece    chapter twenty four  an unexpected meetingdoings on the isle of palmsgascoynes despair  it was not without some difficulty that the boat reached the shore after the squall burst upon them  on landing the party observed dark though it was that their leaders countenance wore an expression of the deepest anxiety yet there were lines upon it that indicated the raging of conflicting passions which he found it difficult to restrain  i fear me said ole thorwald in a troubled voice that our young friend henry stuart is in danger  lost said gascoyne in a voice so low and grating that it startled his hearers  say not so said mr mason earnestly  he is a brave and a clever youth and knows how to manage the cutter until we can row back and fetch him ashore  row back exclaimed gascoyne almost fiercely  think you that i would stand here idle if our boat could live in such a sea as now rolls on the rocks  the wasp must have been washed over the reef by this time  she may pass the next without being dashed to pieces but she is too rickety to stand the third  no there is no hope  while he spoke the missionarys eyes were closed and his lips moved as if in silent prayer  seizing gascoyne nervously by the arm he saidyou cannot tell that there is no hope  that is known only to one who has encouraged us to hope against hope  henry is a stout youth and a good swimmer  he may succeed in clinging to some portion of the wreck  true true cried gascoyne eagerly grasping at this hope slight though it was  come we waste time  there is but one chance  the schooner must be secured without delay  lads you will follow mr thorwald  do whatever he bids you  and now he added leading the merchant aside the time for action has come  i will conduct you to a certain point on the island where you will remain concealed among the bushes until i return to you  and suppose you never return to us mister gascoyne said ole who regarded every act of the pirate captain with suspicion  then you will remain there till you are tired answered gascoyne with some asperity and after that do what you please  well well i am in your power retorted the obdurate norseman make what arrangements you please i will carry them out until  here ole thought fit to break off and gascoyne without taking notice of the remark went on in a few hurried sentences to explain as much of his plan as he thought necessary for the guidance of his suspicious ally  this done he led the whole party to the highest part of the island and made them lie in ambush there while he went forward alone to reconnoitre  the night was admirably suited to their purpose  it was so dark that it was extremely difficult to perceive objects more than a few yards off and the wind howled so furiously among the palms that there was no danger of being overheard in the event of their speaking too loud or stumbling over fallen trees  gascoyne who knew every rock and tree on the isle of palms went rapidly down the gentle slope that intervened between him and the harbour in which the foam lay at anchor  dark though it was he could see the taper masts and yards of his vessel traced dimly against the sky  the pirates movements now became more cautious  he stepped slowly and paused frequently to listen  at last he went down on his hands and knees and crept forward for a considerable distance in that position until he reached a ledge of rocks that overhung the shore of the bay here he observed an object like a round lump of rock lying a few yards before him on a spot where he was well aware no such rock had previously existed  it moved after a moment or two  gascoyne knew that there were no wild animals of any kind on the island and therefore at once jumped to the conclusion that this must needs be a human being of some sort  drawing his knife he put it between his teeth and creeping noiselessly towards the object in question laid his strong hand on the neck of the horrified will corrie  that adventurous and desperate little hero having lain sleepless and miserable at the feet of alice until the squall blew the tent over their heads got up and assisted montague to erect it anew in a more sheltered position after which saying that he meant to take a midnight ramble on the shore to cool his fevered brow he made straight for the sea stepped kneedeep into the raging surf and bared his breast to the furious blast  this cooled him so effectually that he took to running along shore in order to warm himself  then it occurred to him that the night was particularly favourable for a sly peep at the pirates  without a moments hesitation he walked and stumbled towards the high part of the island at which he arrived just halfanhour before gascoyne reached it  he had seen nothing however and was on the point of advancing still further in his explorations when he was discovered as we have seen  gascoyne instantly turned the boy over on his back and nipped a tremendous yell in the bud by grasping his windpipe  why corrie exclaimed gascoyne in surprise at the same time loosening his grip though still holding the boy down  ah you villain you rascally pirate  i know you i  the pipe was gently squeezed at this point and the sentence abruptly cut short  come boy you must not speak so loud  enemies are near  if you dont behave ill have to throttle you  i have come from sandy cove with a party to save you and your friends  corrie did not believe a word of this  he knew or at least he supposed that gascoyne had left the schooner not having seen him since they sailed from sandy cove but he knew nothing of the manner in which he had been put ashore  it wont do gascoyne gasped poor corrie on being permitted again to use his windpipe  you may kill me but youll never cow me  i dont believe you you cowardly monster  ill have to convince you then said gascoyne suddenly catching the boy in his arms and bearing him swiftly away from the spot  corrie struggled like a hero as he was  he tried to shout but gascoynes right hand again squeezed the windpipe he attempted to bite but the same hand easily kept the refractory head in order he endeavoured to kick and hit but gascoynes left hand encircled him in such a comprehensive embrace and pressed him so powerfully to his piratical bosom that he could only wriggle  this he did without ceasing until gascoyne suddenly planted him on his feet panting and dishevelled before the astonished faces of frederick mason and ole thorwald  it is not necessary to describe in detail the surprise of all then and there assembled the hurried conversation and the cry of joy with which the missionary received the information that alice was safe and within five minutes walk of the spot on which he stood  suffice it to say that corrie was now convinced of the good faith of gascoyne whom he at once led along with mr mason to the tent where alice and her friends sleptleaving thorwald and his men where they were to await further orders  the cry of wild delight with which alice sprang into her fathers arms might have been destructive of all gascoynes plans had not the wind carried it away from the side of the island where the pirate schooner lay  there was now no time to be lost  after the first embrace and a few hurried words of blessing and thanksgiving the missionary was summoned to a consultation  i will join you in this enterprise mr gascoyne said montague  i believe what you say to be true besides the urgency of our present danger leaves me no room for choice  i am in your power  i believe that in your present penitent condition you are willing to enable us to escape from your former associates but i tell you frankly that if ever i have an opportunity to do so i will consider it my duty to deliver you over to justice  time is too precious to trifle thus said gascoyne hurriedly  i have already said that i will deliver myself upnot however to you but to mr masonafter i have rescued the party so that i am not likely to claim any consideration from you on account of the obligation which you seem to think my present act will lay you under  but you must not accompany me just now  why not  because your presence may be required here  you and mr mason will remain where you are to guard the girls until i return  all that i have to ask is that you be in readiness to follow me at a moments notice when the time comes  of course what you arrange must be agreed to said montague  come corrie i will require your assistance  follow me said the pirate captain as he turned and strode rapidly away  corrie was now thoroughly convinced of the good intentions of gascoyne so he followed him without hesitation  indeed now that he had an opportunity of seeing a little more of his gigantic companion he began to feel a strange kind of pity and liking for him but he shuddered and felt repelled when he thought of the human blood in which his hands must have been imbrued for as yet he had not heard of the defence of himself which gascoyne had made in the widows cottage  but he had not much time to think for in a few minutes they came upon ole thorwald and his party  follow me quietly said gascoyne  keep in single file and close together for if we are separated here we shall not easily get together again  leading them over the same ground that he had formerly traversed gascoyne conducted his party to the shores of the bay where the foam lay at anchor  here he made them keep close in the bushes with directions to be ready to act the instant he should call on them to do so  but it would comfort me mightily mister gascoyne said thorwald in a somewhat troubled voice if you would give me some instructions or advice as to what i am to do in the event of your plans miscarrying  i care nought for a fair fight in open field but i do confess to a dislike of being brought to the condition of not knowing what to do  it wont matter much what you do mr thorwald said gascoyne gravely  if my plans miscarry you will be killed every soul of you youll not have the ghost of a chance of escaping  ole opened his eyes uncommonly wide at this  well said he at length with a sigh of resignation its some comfort to know that one can only be killed once  gascoyne now proceeded leisurely to strip off his shirt thereby displaying a chest back and arms in which the muscles were developed to an extent that might have made hercules himself envious  kicking off his boots he reduced his clothing to a pair of loose kneebreeches  tis a strange time to indulge in a cold bath murmured thorwald whose state of surprise was beginning to render him desperately ironical  gascoyne took no notice of this remark but calling corrie to his side said  can you swim boy  yes like a duck  can you distinguish the stern of the schooner  i can  listen then  when you see a white sheet waved over the taffrail throw off your jacket and shirt and swim out to the schooner  dye understand  perfectly replied the boy whose decision of manner and action grew with the occasion  and now mr thorwald said gascoyne i shall swim off to the schooner  if as i expect the men are on shore in a place that i wot of and with which you have nothing to do well and good i will send a boat for you with muffled oarsbut mark you let there be no noise in embarking or in getting aboard the schooner  if on the other hand the men are aboard i will bring a boat to you myself in which case silence will not be so necessary and your fighting powers shall be put to the proof  without waiting for a reply the pirate captain walked down the sloping beach and waded slowly into the dark sea  his motions were so noiseless and stealthy that those who watched him with eager eyes could only discern a figure moving gradually away from them and melting into the thick gloom  fierce though the storm was outside the sheltered waters of the bay were almost calm so that gascoyne had no difficulty in swimming off to the foam without making any noise  as he drew near a footstep on the deck apprised him that there was at least a watch left  a few seconds later a man leaned over the low bulwarks of the vessel on the side on which the swimmer approached  hist what sort o brutes that he exclaimed seizing a handspike that chanced to be near him and hurling it at the head of the brute  the handspike fell within a yard of gascoyne who keeping up his supposed character made a wild splash with his arms and dived like a genuine monster of the deep  swimming under water as vigorously as he could he endeavoured to gain the other side of the vessel before he came up but finding that this was impossible he turned on his back and allowed himself to rise gently until nothing but his face appeared above the surface  by this means he was enabled to draw a full breath and then causing himself to sink he swam under water to the other side of the schooner and rose under her quarter  here he paused a minute to breathe then glided with noiseless strokes to the main chains which he seized hold of and under their shelter listened intently for at least five minutes  not a sound was to be heard on board save the footstep of the solitary watchman who slowly paced the deck and now and then beguiled the tedium of his vigil by humming a snatch of a sea song  gascoyne now felt assured that the crew were ashore enjoying themselves as they were wont to do in one of the artificial caverns where their goods were concealed  he knew from his own former experience that they felt quite secure when once at anchor in the harbour of the isle of palms it was therefore probable that all of them had gone ashore except this man who had been left to take care of the vessel  gascoyne now drew himself slowly up into the chains and remained there for a few seconds in a stooping position keeping his head below the level of the bulwarks while he squeezed the water out of his lower garments  this done he waited until the man on deck came close to where he stood when he sprang on him with the agility of a tiger threw him down and placed his hand on his mouth  it will be your wisest course to be still my man said gascoyne sternly  you know who i am and you know what i can do when occasion requires  if you shout when i remove my hand from your mouth you die  the man seemed to be quite aware of the hopelessness of his case for he quietly submitted to have his mouth bound with a handkerchief and his hands and feet tied with cords  a few seconds sufficed to accomplish this after which gascoyne took him up in his arms as if he had been a child carried him below and laid him on one of the cabin lockers then dragging a sheet off one of the beds he sprang up on deck and waved it over the stern  thats the signal for me said corrie who had watched for it eagerlynow uncle ole mind you obey ordersyoure rather inclined to be mutinous and that wont pay tonight  if you dont look out gascoyne will pitch into you old boy  master corrie indulged in these impertinent remarks while he was stripping off his jacket and shirt  the exasperated thorwald attempted to seize him by the neck and shake him but corrie flung his jacket in his face and sprang down the beach like a squirrel  he had wisdom enough however to say and do all this in the quietest possible manner and when he entered the sea he did so with as much caution as gascoyne himself had done insomuch that he seemed to melt away like a mischievous sprite  in a few minutes he was alongside of the foam caught a rope that was thrown to him and quickly stood on the deck  well done corrie  clamber over the stern and slide down by that rope into the little boat that floats there  take one of the oars which you will find muffled and scull to the shore and bring off thorwald and his men  and hark ee boy bring off my shirt and boots  now look alive your friend henry stuarts life may depend on it  henrys life exclaimed corrie in amazement  come no questions  his life may depend on your promptitude  corrie wanted no stronger motive for speed  in a state of surprise mingled with anxious forebodings he leaped over the stern and was gone in a moment  the distance between the shore and the schooner being very short the boat was quickly alongside and the party under stout ole thorwald took possession of their prize  meanwhile gascoyne had set the jib and foretopsail which latter had been left hanging loose from the yard so that by hauling out the sheets slowly and with great care the thing was done without noise  the cable was then cut the boat manned and the foam glided out of the bay like a phantom ship  the moment she got beyond the shelter of the palms her sails filled and in a few minutes she was rushing through the water at the rate of ten or eleven knots an hour  gascoyne stood at the helm and guided her through the intricacies of the dangerous coast with consummate skill until he reached the bay where the wrecked ship lay  here he lay to and sent the boat ashore for the party that had been left at the tent  they were waiting anxiously for his return great therefore was their astonishment when he sent a message inviting them to go on board the foam  the instant they embarked gascoyne put about and ordering the mainsail to be hoisted and one of the reefs to be shaken out of the topsail ran round to windward of the island with the foam flying in great masses on either side of the schooner which lay over so much before the gale that it was scarcely possible to stand on the deck  the manner in which the pirate captain now acted was calculated to fill the hearts of those whose lives seemed to hang in his hands with alarm if not dismay  his spirit seemed to be stirred within him  there was indeed no anger either in his looks or tones but there was a stern fixedness of purpose in his manner and aspect which aroused yet repelled the curiosity of those around him  even ole thorwald and montague agreed that it was best to let him alone for although they might overcome his great physical force by the united strength of numbers the result would certainly be disastrous as he was the only one who knew the locality  on reaching the windward side of the island he threw the schooner up into the wind and ordered the large boat to be hoisted out and put in the water gascoyne issued his commands in a quick loud voice and ole shook his head as if he felt that this overbearing manner proved what he had expected namely that when the pirate got aboard his own vessel he would come out in his true colours  whatever men felt or thought there was no hesitation in rendering prompt obedience to that voice  the large boat was hoisted off the brass pivot gun amidships and lowered into the water  then gascoyne gave the helm to one of the men with directions to hold it exactly as it then lay and hurrying down below speedily returned to the astonishment of every one with a man in his arms  now connway said gascoyne as he cut the cords that bound the man and removed the handkerchief from his mouth im a man of few words and tonight have less time than usual to speak  i set you free  get into that boatone oar will suffice to guide itthe wind will drive it to the island  i send it as a parting gift to manton and my former associates  it is large enough to hold them all  tell them that i repent of my sins and the sooner they do the same the better  i cannot now undo the evil i have done them  i can only furnish the means of escape so that they may have time and opportunity to mend their ways and hark ee the sooner they leave this plane the better  it will no longer be a safe retreat  farewell  while he was speaking he led the man by the arm to the side of the schooner and constrained him to get into the boat  as he uttered the last word he cut the rope that held it and let it drop astern  gascoyne immediately resumed his place at the helm and once more the schooner was running through the water almost gunwale under towards the place where the wasp had been wrecked  without uttering a word of explanation and apparently forgetful of every one near him the pirate continued during the remainder of that night to steer the foam out and in among the roaring breakers as if he were trying how near he could venture to the jaws of destruction without actually plunging into them  as the night wore on the sky cleared up and the scene of foaming desolation that was presented by the breakers in the midst of which they flew was almost enough to appal the stoutest heart  the crew looked on in moody silence  they knew that their lives were imperilled but they felt that they had no resource  no one dared to address the silent stern man who stood like an iron statue at the helm the whole of that night  towards morning he steered out from among the dangerous coral reefs and ran south straight before the wind  then corrie summoned up courage and going aft to gascoyne looked up in his face and said  youre searching for henry i think  yes boy  i am answered the pirate and a gleam of kindliness crossed his face for a moment but it was quickly chased away by a look of deep anxiety and corrie retired  now that the danger of the night was over all the people on board became anxious to save henry or ascertain his fate but although they searched the ocean far and wide they saw not a vestige of him or of the wasp  during this period gascoyne acted like a bewildered man  he never quitted the helm night nor day  he only ate a biscuit now and then when it was brought to him and he did not answer when he was spoken to  every one felt sympathy with the man who seemed to mourn so deeply for the lost youth  at last montague went up to him and said in a gentle voice  i fear that henry is gone  gascoyne started as if a sword had pierced him  for one moment he looked fiercely in the young captains face then an expression of the deepest sadness overspread his countenance as he said  do you think there is no hope  none said montague  i grieve to give pain to one who seems to have been an intimate friend of the lad  he was the son of my oldest and best friend  what would you advise mr montague  i thinkthat is to say dont you thinkthat it would be as well to put about now  gascoynes head dropped on his chest and for some moments he stood speechless while his strong hands played nervously with the tiller that they had held so long and so firmly  at last he looked up and said in a low voicei resign the schooner into your hands mr montague  then he went slowly below and shut himself up in his cabin  montague at once put down the helm and pointing the schooners prow northward steered for the harbour of sandy cove    chapter twenty five  surly dickthe rescue  we must turn aside here for a short time to follow the fortunes of the talisman  when that vessel went in chase of the foam after her daring passage across the reefs she managed to keep her in view until the island was out of sight astern  then the increasing darkness caused by the squall hid the two vessels from each other and before the storm passed away the superior sailing qualities of the foam carried her far beyond the reach of the cruiser  but mr mulroy was not a man to be easily baffled  he resolved to continue the chase and supposing that his commander must have got safely to the shore he made up his mind to proceed southward for a short time thinking it probable that the pirate would run for the shelter of those remote islands which he knew were seldom visited by merchant ships  the importance of keeping the chase in view as long as possible and following it up without delay he felt it would be accepted as a sufficient excuse by montague for not putting back to take him on board  the squalls which happened to prevail at that time drove the talisman farther south than her first lieutenant had intended to go and she failed to fall in with the pirate schooner  mulroy cruised far and wide for fully a week then he gave up the chase as hopeless  two days after the breaking of the storm that wrecked the wasp the talismans prow was turned northward towards sandy cove  it was the close of a calm beautiful evening when this was done  a gentle breeze fanned the topsails although it failed to ruffle the sea  i dont like to be baffled in this way said mulroy to the second lieutenant as they paced the quarterdeck together  it is very unfortunate returned the other  would it not be as well to examine the man called surly dick before leaving these waters  you know he let out that there is some island hereabouts at which the pirates are wont to rendezvous  perhaps by threats if not by persuasion he may be induced to tell us where it lies  true  i had forgotten that fellow altogether  let him be sent for  in a few minutes surly dick stepped on the quarterdeck and touched his cap  he did not appear to have grown less surly since his introduction on board the frigate  discipline had evidently a souring effect on his temper  your late comrades have escaped me said the first lieutenant but you may depend upon it i will catch the villains in the long run  itll be a pretty long run before you do remarked the man sulkily  mulroy looked sternly at him  you forget said he that you are a prisoner  let me advise you to be at least civil in your manner and tone  whether the run shall be a long or a short one remains to be seen  one thing is pretty certain namely that your own run of life will be a very short one  you know the usual doom of a pirate when he is caught  surly dick moved uneasily  i was made a pirate against my will said he in a still more sulky tone and disrespectful manner  you will find it difficult to prove that returned mulroy  meanwhile i shall put you in irons and treat you as you deserve until i can place you in the hands of the civil authorities  surly dick stood first on one leg and then on the other moved his fingers about nervously and glanced in the lieutenants face furtively it was evident that he was ill at ease  i never committed murder sir said he in an improved tone  it wasnt allowed on board of the avenger sir  its a hard case that a fellow should be made a pirate by force and then be scragged for it though hes done none o the bloody work  this may be true rejoined the lieutenant but as i have said you will find it difficult to convince your judges of it  but you will receive a fair trial  there is one thing however that will stand in your favour and that is a full and free confession  if you make this and give me all the information you can in order to bring your late comrades to justice your judges will perhaps be disposed to view your case leniently  wot more can i confess sir said dick beginning to look a little more interested  ive already confessed that i wos made a pirate against my will and that ive never done no murderthough i have plundered a little just like the rest  as for helpin to bring my comrades to justice i only wish as i knowd how and id do it right off i would  surly dicks expression of countenance when he said this was a sufficient guarantee that he was in earnest  there is an island somewhere hereabouts said the lieutenant where the pirates are in the habit of hiding sometimes is there not  surly dick looked at his questioner slyly as he repliedthere is sir  do you not think it very likely that they may have run there nowthat they may be there at this moment  its oncommom likely replied dick with a grin  can you direct me how to steer in order to reach that island  surly dicks aspect changed  he became morose again and looked silently at his feet for a few moments as if he were debating something in his own mind  he was in truth perplexed for while he was extremely anxious to bring his hated comrades to justice he was by no means so anxious to let the lieutenant into the secret of the treasures contained in the caverns of the isle of palms all of which he knew would be at once swept hopelessly beyond his grasp if they should be discovered  he also reflected that if he could only manage to get his late companions comfortably hanged and himself set free for having turned kings evidence against them he could return to the island and abstract the wealth it contained by degrees  the brilliant prospect thus opened up to him was somewhat marred however by the consideration that some of the pirates might make a confession and let this secret be known in which case his golden dreams would vanish  the difficulty of making up his mind was so great that he continued for some time to twist his fingers and move his feet uneasily in silence  mulroy observed the pirates indecision and although he knew not its cause to the full extent he was sufficiently acquainted with human nature to know that now was the moment to overcome the man if he was to be overcome at all  well well he said carelessly im sorry to see you throw away your only chance  as for the information you refuse to give i can do without it  perhaps i may find some of your late comrades when we make the island who will stand witness against you  that will do my man you may go  mr geoffrey turning to a midshipman will you accompany that pirate forward and see that he is put in irons  but you dont know where the island is said surly dick anxiously as the lieutenant was turning away  mulroy turned backno said he but you ought to know that when a seaman is aware of the existence of an island and knows that he is near it a short time will suffice to enable him to find it  again he was about to turn away when dick cried outstay sir will you stand by me if i shew you the way  i will not deceive you said mulroy bluntly  if you shew me how to steer for this island and assist me in every way that you can to catch these villains i will report what you have done and the judges at your trial will give what weight they please to the facts but if you suppose that i will plead for such a rascal as you are you very much mistake me  a look of deep hatred settled on the pirates countenance as he said brieflywell ill shew you how to steer  accordingly surly dick after being shewn a chart and being made aware of the exact position of the ship ordered the course to be altered to northhalfeast  as this was almost dead in the eye of the light breeze that was blowing the talisman had to proceed on her course by the slow process of tacking  while she was in the act of putting about on one of these tacks the lookout reported a boat on the lee bow  boat on the lee bow was passed from mouth to mouth and the order was immediately given to let the frigate fall off  in another minute instead of ploughing her way slowly and doggedly to windward the talisman ran swiftly before the breeze towards a dark object which at a distance resembled a boat with a mast and a small flag flying from it  it is a raft i think observed the second lieutenant as he adjusted the telescope more perfectly  you are right and i think there is someone on it said mulroy  i see something like a man lying on it but whether he is dead or alive i cannot say  there is a flag undoubtedlybut no one waves a handkerchief or a rag of any kind  surely if a living being occupied the raft he would have seen the ship by this time  stay he moves  no it must have been imagination  i fear that he is dead poor fellow stand by to lower a boat  the lieutenant spoke in a sad voice for he felt convinced that he had come too late to the aid of some unfortunate who had died in perhaps the most miserable manner in which man can perish  henry stuart did indeed lie on the raft a dead man to all appearance towards the evening of his third day he had suffered very severely from the pangs of hunger  long and earnestly had he gazed round the horizon but no sail appeared  he felt that his end was approaching and in a fit of despair and increasing weakness he fell on his face in a state of half consciousness  then he began to pray and gradually he fell into a troubled slumber  it was while he was in this condition that the talisman hove in sight  henry had frequently fallen into this species of sleep during the last few hours but he never continued in it long for the pains of thirst as well as hunger now racked his frame  nevertheless he was not much reduced in strength or vigour  a long slow process of dying would have still lain before the poor youth had it been his lot to perish on that raft  a delightful dream came over him as he lay  a rich banquet was spread before him  with wolfish desire he grasped the food and ate as he never ate before  oh it was a rare feast that  each morsel was delicious each draught was nectar  but he could not devour enough there was a strange feeling in him that he could by no means eat to satisfaction  while he was thus feasting in dreams the talisman drew near  her bulwarks were crowded with faces gazing earnestly at the bit of red rag that fluttered in the breeze and the pile of loose spars on the mans form lay extended and motionless  suddenly henry awoke with a start to find that his rich banquet was a terrible delusion that he was starving to deathand that a large ship was hoveto within a few yards of him  starting up on his knees he uttered a wild shriek  then as the truth entered his soul he raised his hand and gave a faint cheer  the revulsion of feeling in the crew of the talisman was overpoweringa long loud tremendous cheer burst from every heart  lower away was shouted to the men who stood at the falltackles of the boat  as the familiar sounds broke on henrys ear he leaped to his feet and waving his hand above his head again attempted to cheer but his voice failed him  staggering backwards he fell fainting into the sea  almost at the same instant a man leaped from the bulwark of the frigate and swam vigorously towards the raft  it was richard price the boatswain of the frigate  he reached henry before the boat did and grasping his inanimate form supported him until it came up and rescued them both  a few minutes later henry stuart was restored to consciousness and the surgeon of the frigate was ministering to him such restoratives as his condition seemed to require    chapter twenty six  the capture and the fire  eight days after the rescue of henry stuart from a horrible death as related in the last chapter the talisman found herself late in the afternoon within about forty hours sail of sandy cove  mulroy had visited the isle of palms and found that the pirates had flown  the mate of the avenger and his companions had taken advantage of the opportunity of escape afforded them by gascoyne and had hastily quitted their rendezvous with as much of the most valuable portion of their booty as the boat could carry  as this is their last appearance in these pages it may be as well to say that they were never again heard of  whether they perished in a storm or gained some distant land and followed their former leaders adviceto repent of their sinsor again took to piracy and continued the practice of their terrible trade under a more bloody minded captain we cannot tell  they disappeared as many a band of wicked men has disappeared before and never turned up again  with these remarks we dismiss them from our tale  surly dick now began to entertain sanguine hopes that he would be pardoned and that he would yet live to enjoy the undivided booty which he alone knew lay concealed in the isle of palmsfor now that he had heard henrys account of the landing of gascoyne on the island he never doubted that the pirates would fly in haste from a spot that was no longer unknown to others and that they would be too much afraid of being captured to venture to return to it  it was then with a feeling of no small concern that the pirate heard the lookout shout on the afternoon referred to sail ho  where away  on the lee beam  the course of the frigate was at once changed and she ran down towards the strange sail  a schooner sir observed the second lieutenant to mr mulroy  it looks marvellously like the foam alias the avenger observed the latter  beat to quarters  if this rascally pirate has indeed been thrown in our way again we will give him a warm reception  why the villain has actually altered his course and is standing towards us  dont you think it is just possible suggested henry stuart that gascoyne may have captured the vessel from his mate and now comes to meet us as a friend  i dont know that said mulroy in an excited tone for he could not easily forget the rough usage his vessel had received at the hands of the bold pirate  i dont know that  no doubt gascoynes mate was against him but the greater part of the crew were evidently in his favour else why the secret manner in which he was deprived of his command  no no  depend upon it the villain has got hold of his schooner and will keep it  by a fortunate chance we have again met i will see to it that we do not part without a close acquaintance  yet why he should throw himself into my very arms in this way puzzles me ha  i see his big gun amidships  it is uncovered  no doubt he counts on his superior sailing powers and means to give us a shot and shew us his heels  well we shall see  there goes his flag observed the second lieutenant  what eh  its the union jack exclaimed mulroy  i doubt not that your own captain commands the schooner said henry who had of course long before this time made the first lieutenant of the talisman acquainted with montagues capture by the pirate along with alice and her companions  you naturally mistrust gascoyne but i have reason to believe that on this occasion at least he is a true man  mulroy returned no answer for the two vessels were now almost near enough to enable those on board to distinguish faces with the telescope a very few minutes sufficed to remove all doubts and a quarter of an hour later montague stood on his own quarterdeck receiving the congratulations of his officers while henry stuart was seized upon and surrounded by his friends corrie alice poopy the missionary and ole thorwald  in the midst of a volley of excited conversation henry suddenly exclaimed but what of gascoyne  where is the pirate captain  why weve forgotten him exclaimed thorwald whose pipe was doing duty like a factory chimney  i shouldnt wonder if he took advantage of us just now to give us the slip  no fear of that said mr mason  poor fellow he has felt your loss terribly henry for we all believed that you were lost but i am bound to confess that none of us have shewn a depth of sorrow equal to that of gascoyne  it seems unaccountable to me  he has not shewn his face on deck since the day he gave up all hope of rescuing you and has eaten nothing but a biscuit now and then which he would suffer no one but corrie to take to him  poor gascoyne i will go and relieve his mind said henry turning to quit the quarterdeck  now the noise created by the meeting of the two vessels had aroused gascoyne from the lethargic state of mind and body to which he had given way  coming on deck he was amazed to find himself close to the talisman  a boat lay alongside the foam into which he jumped and sculling towards the frigate he stepped over the bulwarks just as henry turned to go in search of him  the pirate captains face wore a haggard careworn humbled look that was very different from its usual bold lionlike expression  no one can tell what a storm had passed through the strong mans breast while he lay alone on the floor of his cabin  the deep deep sorrowthe remorse for sinthe bitterness of soul when he reflected that his present misery was chargeable only to himself  a few nights had given him the aspect of a much older man  for a few seconds he stood glancing round the quarterdeck of the talisman with a look of mingled curiosity and sadness  but when his eye fell on the form of henry he turned deadly pale and trembled like an aspen leaf  well gascoyne mymyfriend said the youth with some hesitation as he advanced  the shout that gascoyne uttered on hearing the young mans voice was almost superhuman  it was something like a mingled cheer and cry of agony  in another moment he sprang forward and seizing henry in his arms pressed him to his breast with a grasp that rendered the youth utterly powerless  almost instantly he released him from his embrace and seizing his hand said in a wild gay almost fierce manner  come henry lad i have somewhat to say to you  come with me  he forced rather than led the amazed youth into the boat sculled to the schooner hurried him into the cabin and shut and locked the door  we need scarcely say that all this was a matter of the deepest curiosity and interest to those who witnessed it but they were destined to remain with their curiosity unsatisfied for some time after that  when henry stuart issued from the cabin of the avenger after that mysterious interview his countenance wore a surprised and troubled expression  gascoynes on the contrary was grave and calm yet cheerful  he was more like his former self  the young man was of course eagerly questioned as to what had been said to him and why the pirate had shewn such fondness for him but the only reply that could be got from him was i must not tell  it is a private matter  you shall know time enough  with this answer they were fain to be contenteven corrie failed to extract anything more definite from his friend  a prize crew was put on board the foam and the two vessels proceeded towards the harbour of sandy cove in company  henry and his friends went in the foam but gascoyne was detained a prisoner on board the talisman  montague felt that it was his duty to put him in irons but he could not prevail on himself to heap unnecessary indignity on the head of one who had rendered him such good service so he left him at large intending to put him in irons only when duty compelled him to do so  during the night a stiff breeze amounting almost to a gale of fair wind sprang up and the two vessels flew towards their destination but the foam left her bulky companion far behind  that night a dark and savage mind was engaged on board the talisman in working out a black and desperate plot  surly dick saw in the capture of gascoyne and the foam the end of all his cherished hopes and in a fit of despair and rage he resolved to be avenged  this man when he first came on board the frigate had not been known as a pirate and afterwards as we have seen he had been treated with leniency on account of his offer to turn informant against his former associates  in the stirring events that followed he had been overlooked and on the night of which we are writing he found himself free to retire to his hammock with the rest of the watch  in the night when the wind was howling mournfully through the rigging and the greater part of the crew were buried in repose this man rose stealthily from his hammock and with noiseless tread found his way to a dark corner of the ship where the eyes of the sentries were not likely to observe him  here he had made preparations for his diabolical purpose  drawing a flint and steel from his pocket he proceeded to strike a light  this was procured in a few seconds and as the match flared up in his face it revealed the workings of a countenance in which all the strongest and worst passions of human nature had stamped deep and terrible lines  the pirate had taken the utmost care by arranging an old sail over the spot to prevent the reflection of the light being seen  it revealed a large mass of oakum and tar  into the heart of this he thrust the match and instantly glided away as he had come stealthily and without noise  for a few seconds the fire smouldered for the sail that covered it kept it down as well as hid it from view  but such combustible material could not be smothered long  the smell of burning soon reached one of the marines stationed on the lowerdeck who instantly gave the alarm but almost before the words had passed his lips the flames burst forth  fire fire fire  what a scene ensued  there was confusion at first for no sound at sea rings so terribly in the ear as the shout of fire  but speedily the stern discipline on board a manofwar prevailed  men were stationed in rows the usual appliances for the extinction of fire were brought into play buckets of water were passed down below as fast as they could be drawn  no miscellaneous shouting took place but the orders that were necessary and the noise of action together with the excitement and the dense smoke that rolled up the hatchway produced a scene of the wildest and most stirring description  in the midst of this the pirate captain as might have been expected performed a prominent part  his great physical strength enabled him to act with a degree of vigour that rendered his aid most valuable  he wrought with the energy of a huge mechanical power and with a quick promptitude of perception and a ready change of action which is denied to mere mechanism  he tore down the bulkheads that rendered it difficult to get at the place where the fire was he hurled bucket after bucket of water on the glowing mass and rushed amid clouds of hot steam and suffocating smoke with piles of wet blankets to smother it out  montague and he wrought together  the young captain issued his orders as calmly as if there were no danger yet with a promptitude and vigour that inspired his men with confidence  gascoynes voice was never heard  he obeyed orders and acted as circumstances required but he did not presume as men are too apt to do on such occasions to give orders and advice when there was a legitimate commander  only once or twice were the deep tones of his bass voice heard when he called for more water or warned the more daring among the men when danger from falling timber threatened them  but all this availed not to check the flames  the men were quickly driven upon deck and it soon became evident that the vessel must perish  the fire burst through the hatchways and in a short time began to leap up the rigging  it now became necessary to make arrangements for the saving of the crew  nothing more can be done mr mulroy said montague in a calm voice that accorded ill with the state of his mind  get the boats ready and order the men to assemble on the quarterdeck  if we were only nearer the island said gascoyne in a low tone as if he were talking to himself we might run her on the reef and the breakers would soon put out the fire  that would be little consolation to me said montague with a bitter smile  lower the boats mr mulroy  the foam has observed our condition i see let them row to it  i will go in the gig  the first lieutenant hastened to obey the order and the men embarked in the boats lighted by the flames which were now roaring high up the masts  meanwhile the man who had been the cause of all this was rushing about the deck a furious maniac  he had wrought at the fire almost as fiercely as gascoyne himself and now that all hope was past he continued despite the orders of montague to the contrary to draw water and rush with bucket after bucket into the midst of the roaring flames at last he disappeared no one knew where and no one cared for in such a scene he was soon forgotten  the last man left the ship when the heat on the poop became so great that it was scarcely possible to stand there  still montague and gascoyne stood side by side near the taffrail and the gig with her crew floated just below them  the last boatful of men pulled away from the burning vessel and then montague turned with a deep sigh and said  now mr gascoyne get into the boat  i must be the last man to quit the ship  without a word gascoyne swung himself over the stern and sliding down by a rope dropped into the boat  montague followed and they rowed away  just at that moment surly dick sprang on the bulwarks and holding on by the mizzenshrouds took off his hat and cheered  ha ha he shrieked with a fiendish laugh ive escaped you have i escaped youhurrah and with another wild shriek he leaped on the hot deck and seizing a bucket resumed his selfimposed duty of deluging the fire with water  pull pull lads we cant leave the miserable man to perish cried montague starting up while the men rowed after the frigate with their utmost might  but in vain  already she was far from them and ever increased the distance as she ran before the gale  as long as the ship lasted the poor maniac was seen diligently pursuing his workstopping now and then to spring on the bulwarks and give another cheer  at last the blazing vessel left boats and schooner far behind and the flames rose in great flakes and tongues above her topmasts while the smoke rolled in dense black volumes away to leeward  while the awestricken crew watched her there came a sudden flash of bright white flame as if a volcano had leaped out of the ocean  the powdermagazine had caught  it was followed by a roaring crash that seemed to rend the very heavens  a thick darkness settled over the sceneand the vessel that a few hours before had been a noble frigate was scattered on the ocean a mass of blackened ruins    chapter twenty seven  the pacific is not always calm but neither is it always stormy  we think it necessary to make this latter observation because the succession of shortlived gales and squalls which have been prominently and unavoidably brought forward in our tale might lead the reader to deem the name of this ocean inappropriate  although the sea was not quite so still now owing to the swell caused by the recent gale it was quite as glassy as it was then  the sun too was as hot and the sky as brilliant but the aspect of the foam was much changed  the deep quiet was gone  crowded on every part of the deck and even down in her hold were the crew of the manofwar lolling about listlessly and sadly or conversing with grave looks about the catastrophe which had deprived them so suddenly of their floating home  gascoyne and henry leaned over the stern in order to avoid being overheard by those around them and conversed in low tones  but why not attempt to escape said the latter in reply to some observation made by his companion  because i am pledged to give myself up to justice  no not to justice replied the youth quickly  you said you would give yourself up to me and mr mason  i for one wont act the part of aa  thiefcatcher suggested gascoyne  well put it so if you will and i am certain that the missionary will not have anything to do with your capture  he will say that the officers of justice are bound to attend to such matters  it would be perfectly right in you to try to escape  ah  henry your feelings have warped your judgment said gascoyne shaking his head  it is strange how men will prevaricate and deceive themselves when they want to reason themselves into a wrong course or out of a right one  but what you or mr mason think or will do has nothing to do with my course of action  but the law holds if i mistake not that a man is not bound to criminate himself said henry  i know not and care not what the law of man holds replied the other sadly  i have forfeited my life to my country and i am willing to lay it down  nay not your life said henry you have done no murder  well then at least my liberty is forfeited  i shall leave it to those who judge me whether my life shall be taken or no  i sometimes wish that i could get away to some distant part of the world and there by living the life of an honest man try to undo if possible a little of what i have done  but woes me wishes and regrets come too late no i must be content to reap what i have sown  they will be certain to hang you said the youth bitterly  i think it likely they will replied his companion  and would you call that justice asked henry sharply  whatever punishment you may deserve you do not deserve to die  you know well enough that your own word will go for nothing and no one else can bear witness in your favour  you will be regarded simply as a notorious pirate  even if some of the people whose lives you have spared while taking their goods should turn up their testimony could not prove that you had not murdered others so your fate is certain if you go to trial have you any right then to compass your own death by thus giving yourself up  ah boy your logic is not sound  but answer my question said the youth testily henry plead with me no longer said gascoyne in a deep stern tone  my mind is made up i have spent many years in dishonesty and selfdeception  it is perhaps possible that by a life devoted to doing good i might in the long run benefit men more than i have damaged them  this is just possible i say though i doubt it but i have promised to give myself up whenever this cruise is at an end and i wont break the last promise i am likely to give in this world so do not attempt to turn me boy  henry made no reply but his knitted brows and compressed lips shewed that a struggle was going on within him  suddenly he stood erect and said firmly  be it so gascoyne  i will hold you to your promise  you shall not escape me  with this somewhat singular reply henry left his surprised companion and mingled with the crowd of men who stood on the quarterdeck  a light breeze had now sprung up and the foam was gliding rapidly towards the island  gascoynes deep voice was still heard at intervals issuing a word of command for as he knew the reefs better than any one else on board montague had intrusted him with the pilotage of the vessel into harbour  when they had passed the barrierreef and were sailing over the calm waters of the enclosed lagoon in the direction of sandy cove the young officer went up to the pirate captain with a perplexed air and a degree of hesitation that was very foreign to his character  gascoyne flushed deeply when he observed him  i know what you would say to me he said quickly  you have a duty to perform  i am ready  gascoyne said montague with deep earnestness of tone and manner i would willingly spare you this but as you say i have a duty to perform  i would with all my heart that it had fallen to other hands believe me i appreciate what you have done within the last few days and i believe what you have said in regard to yourself and your career all this you may depend upon it will operate powerfully with your judges  but you know i cannot permit you to quit this vessel a free man  i know it said gascoyne calmly  andand here montague stammered and came to an abrupt pause  say on captain montague  i appreciate your generosity in feeling for me thus but i am prepared to meet whatever awaits me  it is necessary resumed montague that you should be manacled before i take you on shore  gascoyne started  he had not thought of this  he had not fully realised the fact that he was to be deprived of his liberty so soon  in the merited indignity which was now to be put upon him he recognised the opening act of the tragedy which was to terminate with his life  be it so he said lowering his head and sitting down on a carronade in order to avoid the gaze of those who surrounded him  while this was being done the youthful corrie was in the forepart of the schooner whispering eagerly to alice and poopy  o alice ive seen him exclaimed the lad  seen who inquired alice raising her pretty little eyebrows just the smallest morsel  why the boatswain of the talisman dick price you know who jumped overboard to save henry when he fell off the raft  come ill point him out  so saying corrie edged his way through the crowd until he could see the windlass  here seated on a mass of chain cable sat a remarkably rugged specimen of the british boatswain  he was extremely short excessively broad uncommonly jovial and remarkably hairy  he wore his round hat so far on the back of his head that it was a marvel how it managed to hang there and smoked a pipe so black that the most powerful imagination could hardly conceive of its ever having been white and so short that it seemed all head and no stem  thats him said corrie eagerly  oh is it replied alice with much interest  hee hee observed poopy  stand by to let go the anchor shouted montague  instantly bustle and noise prevailed everywhere  the crew of the lost frigate had started up on hearing the order but having no stations to run to they expended the energy that had been awakened in shuffling about and opening an animated conversation in under tones  soon the schooner swept round the point that had hitherto shut out the view of sandy cove and a few minutes later the rattling of the chain announced that the voyage of the foam had terminated  immediately after a boat was lowered and gascoyne was conveyed by a party of marines to the shore and lodged in the prison which had been but recently occupied by our friend john bumpus  mrs stuart had purposely kept out of the way when she heard of the arrival of the foam  she knew gascoyne so well that she felt sure he would succeed in recapturing his schooner  but she also knew that in doing this he would necessarily release montague from his captivity in which case it was certain that the pirate captain having promised to give himself up would be led on shore a prisoner  she could not bear to witness this but no sooner did she hear of his being lodged in jail than she prepared to visit him  as she was about to issue from her cottage henry met her and clasped her in his arms  the meeting would have doubtless been a warmer one had the mother known what a narrow escape her son had so recently had  but mrs stuart was accustomed to part from henry for weeks at a time and regarded this return in much the same light as former homecomings except in so far as he had news of their lost friends to give her  she welcomed him therefore with a kiss and a glad smile and then hurried him into the house to inquire about the result of the voyage  i have already heard of your success in finding alice and our friends come tell me more  have you heard how nearly i was lost mother  lost exclaimed the widow in surprise no i have heard nothing of that  henry rapidly narrated his escape from the wreck of the wasp and then looking earnestly in his mothers anxious face he said slowly  but you do not ask for gascoyne mother  do you know that he is now in the jail  the widow looked perplexed  i know it said she  i was just going to see him when you came in  ah mother said henry reproachfully why did you not tell me sooner about gascoyne  i  he was interrupted here by corrie and alice rushing into the room the latter of whom threw herself into the widows arms and burst into tears while master corrie indulged in some eccentric bounds and cheers by way of relieving his feelings  for some time henry allowed them to talk eagerly to each other then he told corrie and alice that he had something of importance to say to his mother and led her into an adjoining room  corrie had overheard the words spoken by henry just as he entered and great was his curiosity to know what was the mystery connected with the pirate captain  this curiosity was intensified when he heard a halfsuppressed shriek in the room where mother and son were closeted for one moment he was tempted to place his ear to the keyhole  but a blush covered his fat cheeks at the very thought of acting such a disgraceful part  like a wise fellow he did not give the tempter a second opportunity but seizing the hand of his companion said  come along alice well go seek for bumpus  halfanhour afterwards the widow stood at the jail door  the jailer was an intimate friend and considerately retired during the interview  o gascoyne has it come to this  she sat down beside the pirate and grasped one of his manacled hands in both of hers  even so mary my hour has come  i do not complain of my doom  i have brought it on myself  but why not try to escape said mrs stuart earnestly  there are some here who could aid you  here the widow attempted to reason with gascoyne as her son had done before but with similar want of success  gascoyne remained immovable he did indeed betray deep emotion while the woman reasoned with him in tones of intense earnestness but he would not change his mind  he said that if montague as the representative of the law would set him free in consideration of what he had recently done he would accept of liberty but nothing would induce him to attempt to escape  leaving him in this mood mrs stuart hurried to the cottage where montague had taken up his abode  the young captain received her kindly  having learned from corrie all about the friendship that existed between the widow and gascoyne he listened with the utmost consideration to her  it is impossible said he shaking his head i cannot set him free  do his late services weigh nothing with you pleaded the widow  my dear madam replied montague sorrowfully you forget that i am not his judge  i have no right to weigh the circumstances of his case he is a convicted and selfacknowledged pirate  my only duty is to convey him to england and hand him over to the officers of justice  i sympathise with you indeed i do for you seem to take his case to heart very much but i cannot help you  i must do my duty  the foam will be ready for sea in a few days in it i shall convey gascoyne to england  o mr montague i do take his case to heart as you say and no one on this earth has more cause to do so  will it interest you more in gascoyne and induce you to use your influence in his favour if i tell you thatthathe is my husband  your husband cried montague springing up and pacing the apartment with rapid strides  ay said mrs stuart mournfully covering her face with her hands i had hoped that this secret would die with me and him but in the hope that it may help ever so little to save his life i have revealed it to you  believe me the secret shall be safe in my keeping said montague tenderly as he sat down again and drew his chair near to that of mrs stuart  but alas  i do not see how it is possible for me to help your husband  i will use my utmost influence to mitigate his sentence but i cannot i dare not set him free  the poor woman sat pale and motionless while the captain said this  she began to perceive that all hope was gone and felt despair settling down on her heart  what will be his doom said she in a husky voice if his life is spared  i do not know  at least i am not certain  my knowledge of criminal law is very slight but i should suppose it would be transportation for  montague hesitated and could not find it in his heart to add the word life  without uttering a word mrs stuart rose and staggering from the room hastened with a quick unsteady step towards her own cottage    chapter twenty eight  a peculiar confidantmore difficulties and various plans to overcome them  when alice mason was a little child there was a certain tree near her fathers house to which in her hours of sorrow she was wont to run and tell it all the grief of her overflowing heart  she firmly believed that this tree heard and understood and sympathised with all that she said  there was a hole in the stem into which she was wont to pour her complaints and when she had thus unburthened her heart to her silent confidant she felt comforted as one feels when a human friend has shared ones sorrows  when the child became older and her sorrows were heavier and perhaps more real her wellnurtured mind began to rise to a higher source for comfort  habit and inclination led her indeed to the same tree but when she kneeled upon its roots and leaned against its stem she poured out her heart into the bosom of him who is ever present and who can be touched with a feeling of our infirmities  almost immediately after landing on the island alice sought the umbrageous shelter of her old friend and favourite and on her knees thanked god for restoring her to her father and her home  to the same place the missionary directed his steps for he knew it well and doubtless expected to find his daughter there  alice dear i have good news to tell you said the missionary sitting down beside her  i know what it is cried alice eagerly  what do you think it is my pet  gascoyne is to be forgiven am i right  mr mason shook his head sadlyno that is not what i have to tell you  poor fellow i would that i had some good news to give you about him but i fear there is no hope for himi mean as regards his being pardoned by man  alice sighed and her face expressed the deepest tenderness and sympathy  why do you take so great an interest in this man dear said her father  because mary stuart loves him and i love mary stuart  and corrie seemed to like him too since he has come to know him better  besides has he not saved my life and captain montagues and corries  corrie tells me that he is very sorry for the wicked things he has done and he thinks that if his life is spared he will become a good man  has he been very wicked papa  yes very wicked  he has robbed many people of their goods and has burnt and sunk their vessels  alice looked horrified  but continued her father i am convinced of the truth of his statementthat he has never shed human blood  nevertheless he has been very wicked and the fact that he has such a powerful will such commanding and agreeable manners only makes his guilt the greater for there is less excuse for his having devoted such powers and qualities to the service of satan  i fear that his judges will not take into account his recent good deeds and his penitence  they will not pardon him  father said alice earnestly god pardons the chief of sinnerswhy will not man do so  the missionary was somewhat perplexed as to how he should reply to such a difficult question  my child said he the law of god and the law of man must be obeyed or the punishment must be inflicted on the disobedientboth laws are alike in this respect  in the case of gods law jesus christ our lord obeyed it bore the punishment for us and set our souls free  but in the case of mans law who is to bear gascoynes punishment and set him free  as poor alice could not answer this she cast down her tearful eyes sighed again and looked more miserable than ever  but come my pet resumed mr mason you must guess again  it is really good newstry  i cant said alice looking up in her fathers face with animation and shaking her head i never could guess anything rightly  what would you think the best thing that could happen said her father  the child looked intently at the ground for a few seconds and pursed her rosy little mouth while the smallest possible frownthe result of intellectual exertionknitted her fair brow  the best thing that could happen said she slowly would be that all the whole world should become good  well done alice exclaimed her father laughing you have certainly taken the widest possible view of the subject  but you have soared a little too high yet you have not altogether missed the mark  what would you say if the chiefs of the heathen village were to cast their idols into the fire and ask me to come over and teach them how to become christians  oh have they really done this cried alice in eager surprise  indeed they have  i have just seen and had a talk with some of their chief men and have promised to go over to their village tomorrow  i came up here just to tell you this and to say that your friend the widow will take care of you while i am away  and shall we have no more warsno more of these terrible deeds of blood inquired the child while a shudder passed through her frame at the recollection of what she had heard and seen during her short life on that island  i trust not my lamb  i believe that god has heard our prayers and that the prince of peace will henceforth rule in this place  but i must go and prepare for this work  come will you go with me  leave me here for a little papa i wish to think it over all alone  kissing her forehead the missionary left her  when he was out of sight the little girl sat down and nestling between two great roots of her favourite tree laid her head against the stem and shut her eyes  but poor alice was not left long to her solitary meditations  there was a peculiarly attractive power about her which drew other creatures around her wherever she might chance to be  the first individual who broke in upon her was that animated piece of ragged doormat toozle  this imbecile little dog was not possessed of much delicacy of feeling having been absent on a private excursion of his own into the mountain when the schooner arrived he only became aware of the return of his lost loved and deeplyregretted mistress when he came back from his trip  the first thing that told him of her presence was his own nose the black point of which protruded with difficulty a quarter of an inch beyond the mass of matting which totally extinguished his eyes and indeed every other portion of his head  coming down the hill immediately behind sandy cove at a breakneck scramble toozle happened to cross the path by which his mistress had ascended to her tree  the instant he did so he came to a halt so sudden that one might have fancied he had been shot  in another moment he was rushing up the hill in wild excitement giving an occasional yelp of mingled surprise and joy as he went along  the footsteps led him a little beyond the tree and then turned down towards it so that he had the benefit of the descent in making the final onset  the moment he came in sight of alice he began to bark and yelp in such an eager way that the sounds produced might be described as an intermittent scream  he charged at once with characteristic want of consideration and plunging headlong into alices bosom sought to cover her face with kissesie with licks that being the wellknown canine method of doing the thing  o toozle how glad glad glad i am to see you my own darling toozle cried alice actually shedding tears  toozle screamed with delight  it was almost too much for him  again and again he attempted to lick her face a familiarity which alice gently declined to permit so he was obliged to content himself with her hand  it has often struck us as surprising that little dogsusually so intelligent and apt to learn in other mattersshould be so dull of apprehension in this  toozle had the experience of a lifetime to convince him that alice objected to have her face licked and would on no account permit it although she was extremely liberal in regard to her hands but toozle ignored the authority of experience  he was at this time a dog of mature years but his determination to kiss alice was as strong as it had been when in the tender years of infancy he had entertained the mistaken belief that she was his own mother  he watched every unguarded moment to thrust forward his black not to say impertinent little snout and although often reproved he still remained unconvinced resolutely returned to the charge and was not a bit ashamed of himself  on the present occasion toozle behaved like a canine lunatic and alice was beginning to think of exercising a little tender violence in order to restrain his superabundant glee when another individual appeared on the scene and for a time at least relieved her  the second comer was our dark friend kekupoopi  she by some mischance had got separated from her young mistress and immediately went in search of her  she found her at once of course for as water finds its level so love finds its object without much loss of time  o toozle hee hee am dat you exclaimed poopy who was as much delighted in her way to see the dog as alice had been  toozle was in his way as much delighted to see poopy as he had been to see aliceno we are wrong not quite so much as that but still extremely glad to see her and evinced his joy by extravagant sounds and actions  he also evinced his scorn for the opinion that some foolish persons hold namely that black people are not as good as white by rushing into poopys arms and attempting to lick her black face as he had tried to do to alice  as the darkskinned girl had no objection for tastes differ you see and received the caresses with a quiet hee hee  toozle was extremely gratified  now it happened that jo bumpus oppressed with a feeling of concern for his former captain and with a feeling of doubt as to the stirring events in which he was an actor being waking realities had wandered up the mountainside in order to indulge in profound philosophical reflections  happening to hear the noise caused by the joyful meeting which we have just described he turned aside to see what all the row could be about and thus came unexpectedly on alice and her friends  about the same time it chanced for things sometimes do happen by chance in a very remarkable way it chanced that will corrie being also much depressed about gascoyne resolved to take into his confidence dick price the boatswain with whom during their short voyage together he had become intimate  he found that worthy seated on a cask at the end of the rude pile of coral rocks that formed the quay of sandy cove surrounded by some of his shipmates all of whom as well as himself were smoking their pipes and discussing things in general  corrie went forward and pulled dick by the sleeve  hallo boy what dye want with me said the boatswain  i want to speak to you  well lad fire away  yes but i want you to come with me said the boy with an anxious and rather mysterious look  very goodheave ahead said the boatswain getting up and following corrie with a peculiarly nautical roll  after he had been led through the settlement and a considerable way up the mountain in silence the boatswain suddenly stopped and saidhallo hold on my timbers wont stand much more o this sort o thing  i was built for navigatin the seasi was not for cruisin on the land  were far enough out of earshot i spose in this here bit of a plantation  come what have ye got to say to me  you aint agoin to tell me the freemasons word are ye  for if so dont trouble yourself i wouldnt listen to it on no account watever  its too mysterious that is for me  dick price said corrie looking up in the face of the seaman with a serious expression that was not often seen on his round countenance youre a man  the boatswain looked down at the youthful visage in some surprise  well i spose i am said he stroking his beard complacently  and you know what it is to be misunderstood misjudged dont you  well now i come to think on it i believe i have had that misfortunespecially wen ive ordered the powdermonkies to make less noise for them younkers never do seem to understand me  as for misjudgin ive often an over again heard em say i was the crossest feller they ever did meet with but they never was more out in their reckoning  corrie did not smile he did not betray the smallest symptom of power either to appreciate or to indulge in jocularity at that moment  but feeling that it was useless to appeal to the former experience of the boatswain he changed his plan of attack  dick price said he its a hard case for an innocent man to be hanged  so it is boyoncommon hard  i once knowd a poor feller as was hanged for murderin his old grandmother  it was afterwards found out that hed never done the deed but he was the most incorrigible thief and poacher in the whole place so it warnt such a mistake after all  dick price said corrie gravely at the same time laying his hand impressively on his companions arm im a tremendous jokerawful fond o fun and skylarkin  pon my word lad if you hadnt said so yourself id scarce have believed it  you dont look like it just now by no manner o means  but i am though continued corrie and i tell you that in order to shew you that i am very very much in earnest at this moment and that you must give your mind to what ive got to say  the boatswain was impressed by the fervour of the boy  he looked at him in surprise for a few seconds then nodded his head and said fire away  you know that gascoyne is in prison said corrie  in course i does  thats one rascally pirate less on the seas anyhow  hes not so bad as you think dick  whew whistled the boatswain  youre a friend of his are ye  no not a friend but neither am i an enemy  you know he saved my life and the lives of two of my friends and of your own captain too  well theres no denying that but he must have been the means of takin away more lives than what he has saved  no he hasnt cried corrie eagerly  thats it thats just the point he has saved more than he ever took away and hes sorry for what he has done yet theyre going to hang him  now i say thats sinful its not just  it shant be done if i can prevent it and you must help me to get him out of this scrapeyou must indeed dick price  the boatswain was quite taken aback  he opened his eyes wide with surprise and putting his head to one side gazed earnestly and long at the boy as if he had been a rare old painting  before he could reply the furious barking of a dog attracted corries attention  he knew it to be the voice of toozle  being well acquainted with the locality of alices tree he at once concluded that she was there and knowing that she would certainly side with him and that the side she took must necessarily be the winning side he resolved to bring dick price within the fascination of her influence  come follow me said he well talk it over with a friend of mine  the seaman followed the boy obediently and in a few minutes stood beside alice  corrie had expected to find her there but he had not counted on meeting with poopy and jo bumpus  hallo  grampus is that you  wot  corrie my boy is it yourself  give us your flipper small though it be  i didnt think id niver see ye agin lad  no more did i grampus it was very nearly all up with us  ah my boy said bumpus becoming suddenly very grave youve no notion how near it was all up with me  why you wont believe iti was all but scragged  dear me what is scragged inquired alice  you dont mean for to say you dont know exclaimed bumpus  no indeed i dont  why it means bein hanged  i was so near hanged just a day or two back that ive had an orrible pain in my neck ever since at the bare thought of it  but whos your friend said bumpus turning to the boatswain  oh  i forgot himhes the boatswain of the talisman  dick price this is my friend john bumpus  glad to know you dick price  same to you and luck john bumpus  the two seadogs joined their enormous palms and shook hands cordially  after these two had indulged in a little desultory conversation will corrie who meanwhile consulted with alice in an undertone brought them back to the point that was uppermost in his mind  now said he it comes to thiswe must not let gascoyne be hanged  why corrie cried bumpus in surprise thats the very thing i was athinkin of wen i comed up here and found miss alice under the tree  i am glad to hear that jo its what has been on my own mind all the morning  but dick price here is not convinced that he deserves to escape  now you tell him all you know about gascoyne and ill tell him all i know and if he dont believe us alice and poopy will tell him all they know and if that wont do you and i will take him up by the legs and pitch him into the sea  that bein how the case standsfire away said dick price with a grin sitting down on the grass and busily filling his pipe  dick was not so hard to be convinced as corrie had feared  the glowing eulogiums of bumpus and the earnest pleadings of alice won him over very soon  he finally agreed to become one of the conspirators  but how is the thing to be done asked corrie in some perplexity  ah thats the pint observed dick looking profoundly wise  nothin easier said bumpus whose pipe was by this time keeping pace with that of his new friend  the case is as clear as mud  heres how it is  gascoyne is in limbo well we are out of limbo  good  then all weve got for to do is to break into limbo and shove gascoyne out of limbo and help him to escape  its all square you see lads  not so square as you seem to think said henry stuart who at that moment stepped from behind the stem of the tree which had prevented the party from observing his approach  why not said bumpus making room for the young man to sit beside alice on the grass  because said henry gascoyne wont agree to escape  not agree for to escape  no  if the prison door were opened at this moment he would not walk out  bumpus became very grave and shook his head  are ye sartin sure o this said he  quite sure replied henry who now detailed part of his recent conversation with the pirate captain  then its all up with him said bumpus and the pirate will meet his doom as i once heard a feller say in a playthough i little thought to see it acted in reality  so he will added dick price  corries countenance fell and alice grew pale  even poopy and toozle looked a little depressed  no it is not all up with him cried henry stuart energetically i have a plan in my head which i think will succeed but i must have assistance  it wont do however to discuss this before our young friends  i must beg of alice and poopy to leave us  i do not mean to say i could not trust you alice but the plan must be made known only to those who have to act in this matter  rest assured dear child that i shall do my best to make it successful  alice sprang up at once  my father told me to follow him some time ago said she  i have been too long of doing so already  i do hope that you will succeed  so saying and with a cheerful goodbye the little girl ran down the mountainside closely followed by toozle and poopy  as soon as she was gone henry turned to his companions and unfolded to them his planthe details and carrying out of which however we must reserve for another chapter    chapter twenty nine  bumpus is perplexedmysterious communings and a curious leavetaking  its a puzzler said jo bumpus to himselffor jo was much in the habit of conversing with himself and a very good habit it is one that is often attended with much profit to the individual when the conversation is held upon right topics and in a proper spiritits a puzzler it is thats a fact  having relieved his mind of this observation the seaman proceeded to cut down some tobacco and looked remarkably grave and solemn as if it were not only a puzzler but an alarmingly serious puzzler  yes its the biggest puzzler as ever i comed across said he filling his pipefor john when not roused got on both mentally and physically by slow stages  niver knowd its equal he continued beginning to smoke which operation as the pipe did not draw well at first prevented him from saying anything more  it was early morning when bumpus said all this and the mariner was enjoying his morning pipe in a reclining attitude on the grass beneath alice masons favourite tree from which commanding position he gazed approvingly on the magnificent prospect of land and sea which lay before him bathed in the light of the rising sun  it is wery koorious continued john taking his pipe out of his mouth and addressing himself to it with much gravitywery koorious  things always seems wot they isnt and turns out to be wot they didnt appear as if they wasnt werry odd indeed it is  only to think that this here sandalwood trader should turn out for to be henrys father and the widows motherno i mean the widows husband an a pirate an a deliverer o little boys and gals out o pirates handshis own hands so to speaknot to mention captings in the royal navy an not sich a bad feller after all as wont have his liberty on no account wotiver even if it was gived to him for nothin and yet wot cant git it if he wanted it iver so much and to think that jo bumpus should come for to lend hisself tohallo  jo back yer topsls didnt henry tell ye that ye wasnt to convarse upon that there last matter even with yerself for fear o bein overheard and spilin the whole affair  come ill refresh myself  the refreshment in which jo proposed to indulge was of a peculiar kind which never failed himit was the perusal of susans loveletter  he now sat up drew forth the precious and much soiled epistle unfolded and spread it out carefully on his knees placed his pipe very much on one side of his mouth in order that the smoke might not interfere with his vision and began to read  peelers farm ah  susan darlin its jo bumpus as would give all he has in the world includin his sunday close to be anchored alongside o ye at that same farm  sanfransko  i misdoubt the spellin o that word susan dear it seems to me raither short as if yed docked off its tail  howsomeverfor john bumpusso susan susan if yed only remember the big b and there aint two esses  im sure its not for want o tellin ye but ye was never great in the way ov memry or spellin  praps its as well  yed ha bin too perfect an thats not desirable by no meansmy darlin joay thems the words  its that as sets my art a bilinover like  here jo raised his eyes from the letter and revelled silently in the thought for at least two minutes during which his pipe did double duty in half its usual time  then he recurred to his theme but some parts he read in silence and without audible comment  ay said he sandlewood skooners the haf ov thems piritsso they is susan  its yer powers o prophecy as amazes mean the other hafs no betera deal wus susan if ye only knowd it  ah my sweet gal if ye knew wot a grief that word beter wos to me before i diskivered wot it wos yed try to improve yer hand o write an make fewer blots  at this point jo was arrested by the sound of footsteps behind him  he folded up his letter precipitately thrust it into his left breastpocket and jumped up with a guilty air about him  why bumpus we have startled you out of a morning nap i fear said henry stuart who accompanied by his mother came up at that moment we are on our way to say goodbye to mr mason  as we passed this knoll i caught sight of you and came up to ask about the boat  its all right said bumpus who quickly recovered his composure indeed he had never lost much of it  ive bin down to saunders store and got the ropes for your  hush man there is no need of telling me what they are for said henry with a mysterious look at his mother  why not tell me all henry said mrs stuart surely you can trust me  trust you mother replied the youth with a smile i should think so but there are reasons for my not telling you everything just now surely you can trust me  i have told you as much as i think advisable in the meantime  ere long i will tell you all  the widow sighed and was fain to rest content  she sat down beside the tree while her companions talked together apart in low tones  now jo my man continued henry one of our friends must be got out of the way  wery good im the man asll do it  of course i dont mean that hes to be killed  in coorse not  who is he  ole thorwald  wot the descendant o the sea kings as he calls himself  the same said henry laughing at the look of surprise with which bumpus received this information  what has he bin an done  he has done nothing as yet said henry but he will certainly thwart our schemes if he hears of them  he has an inveterate illwill to my poor father henry lowered his voice as he proceeded and i know has suspicions that we are concocting some plan to enable him to escape and watches us accordingly  i find him constantly hanging about the jail alas if he knew how thoroughly determined gascoyne is to refuse deliverance unless it comes from the proper source he would keep his mind more at ease  dont you think if you wos to tell him that gascoyne is yer father he would side with us suggested bumpus  perhaps he would  i think he would but i dare not risk it  the easier method will be to outwit him  not an easy thing for to do im afraid for hes a cute old feller hows it to be done asked bumpus  by telling him the truth said henry and you must tell it to him  well that is a koorious way said bumpus with a broad grin  but not the whole truth continued henry  you must just tell him as much as it is good for him to know and nothing more and as the thing must be done at once ill tell you what you have got to say  here the young man explained to the attentive bumpus the course that he was to follow and having got him thoroughly to understand his part he sent him away to execute it  meanwhile he and his mother went in search of mr mason who at the time was holding a consultation with the chiefs of the native village near the site of his burnt cottage  the consultation had just been concluded when they reached the spot and the missionary was conversing with the native carpenter who superintended the erection of his new home  after the morning greeting and a few words of general conversation mrs stuart said  we have come to have a talk with you in private will you walk to alices tree with us  certainly my friend i hope no new evils are about to befall us said the missionary who was startled by the serious countenances of the mother and son for he was ignorant of the close relation in which they stood to gascoyne as indeed was every one else in the settlement excepting montague and his boatswain and corrie all of whom were enjoined to maintain the strictest secrecy on the point  no i thank god all is well replied mrs stuart but we have come to say that we are going away  going away echoed the missionary in surprise  whenwhere to why  you amaze me mary  henry will explain  the fact is mr mason said henry circumstances require my absence from sandy cove on a longer trip than usual and i mean to take my mother with me  indeed to be plain with you i do not think it likely that we shall return for a long timeperhaps not at all and it is absolutely necessary that we should go secretly  but we could not go without saying goodbye to you  we owe much to you dear mr mason cried the widow grasping the missionarys hand and kissing it  we can never never forget you and will always pray for gods best blessings to descend on you and yours  this is overwhelming news exclaimed mr mason who had stood hitherto gazing from the one to the other in mute astonishment  but tell me mary here he spoke in earnest tones is not gascoyne at the bottom of this  mr mason said henry we never did and never will deceive you there is a good reason for neither asking nor answering questions on this subject just now  i am sure you know us too well to believe that we think of doing what is wrong and you can trust usat least my motherthat we will not do what is foolish  i have perfect confidence in your hearts my dear friends replied mr mason but you will forgive me if i express some doubt as to your ability to judge between right and wrong when your feelings are deeply moved as they evidently are from some cause or other just now  can you not put confidence in me  i can keep a secret and may perhaps give good counsel  no no said henry emphatically it will not do to involve you in our affairs  it would not be right in us just now to confide even in you  i cannot explain whyyou must accept the simple assurance in the meantime  wherever we go we can communicate by letter and i promise ere long to reveal all  well i will not press you farther but i will commend you in prayer to god  i do not like to part thus hurriedly however  can we not meet again before you go  we shall be in the cottage at four this afternoon and will be very glad if you will come to us for a short time said the widow  that is settled then i will go and explain to the natives that i cannot accompany them to the village till tomorrow  when do you leave  tonight  so soon  surely it is not  but i forbear to say more on a subject which is forbidden  god bless you my friends we shall meet at four goodbye  the missionary turned from them with a sad countenance and went in search of the native chiefs while henry and his mother separated from each other the former taking the path that led to the little quay of sandy cove the latter that which conducted to her own cottage    chapter thirty  more leavetakingdeep designsbumpus in a new capacity  on the particular day of which we are writing alice mason felt an unusual depression of spirits  she had been told by her father of the intended departure of the widow and her son and had been warned not to mention it to any one  in consequence of this the poor child was debarred her usual consolation of pouring her grief into the black bosom of poopy  it naturally followed therefore that she sought her next favouritethe tree  here to her surprise and comfort she found corrie seated on one of its roots with his head resting on the stem and his hands clasped before him  his general appearance was that of a human being in the depths of woe  on observing alice he started up and assuming a cheerful look ran to meet her  oh  im so glad to find you here corrie cried alice hastening forward im in such distress  do you know thatohi forgot papa said i was to tell nobody about it  dont let that trouble you alice said corrie as they sat down together under the tree  i know what you were about to sayhenry and his mother are going away  how do you know that  i thought it was a great secret  so it is a tremendous secret rejoined corrie with a look that was intended to be very mysterious and i know it because ive been let into the secret for reasons which i cannot tell even to you  but there is another secret which you dont know yet and which will surprise you perhaps  i am going away too  you exclaimed the little girl her eyes dilating to their full size  ay me  youre jesting corrie  am i  i wish i was but its a fact  but where are you going to said alice her eyes filling with tears  i dont know  corrie  i tell you i dont know and if i did know i couldnt tell  listen alice i will tell you as much as i am permitted to let out  the boy became extremely solemn at this point took the little girls hand and gazed into her face as he spoke  you must know he began that henry and his mother and i go away tonight  tonight cried alice quickly  tonight repeated the boy  bumpus and jakolu go with us  i have said that i dont know where we are going to but i am pretty safe in assuring you that we are going somewhere  why we are going i am forbidden to telldivulge i think henry called it but what that means i dont know  i can only guess its another word for tell and yet it cant be that either for you can speak of telling lies but you cant speak of divulging them  however that dont matter  but im not forbidden to tell you why i am going away  in the first place then im going to seek my fortune  where im to find it remains to be seen the only thing i know is that i mean to find it somewhere or other and then here corrie became very impressive come back and live beside you and your father not to speak of poopy and toozle  alice smiled sadly at this  corrie looked graver than ever and went on  meanwhile during my absence i will write letters to you and youll write ditto to me  i am going away because i ought to go and be doing something for myself  you know quite well that i would rather stop beside you than go anywhere in this wide world alice but that would be stupid  im getting to be a man now and mustnt go on shewin the weaknesses of a boy  in the second or third placei forget which but no matteri am going with henry because i could not go with a better man and in the fourthif its not the fifthplace im going because uncle ole thorwald has long wished me to go to sea and to tell you the truth i would have gone long ago had it not been for you alice  theres only one thing that bothers me  here corrie looked at his fair companion with a perplexed air  what is that asked alice sympathetically  it is that i must go without saying goodbye to uncle ole  im very sorry about it  it will look so ungrateful to him but it cant be helped  why not inquired alice  if he has often said he wished you to go to sea would he not be delighted to hear that you are going  yes but he must not know that i am going tonight and with henry stuart  why not  ah thats the point  mystery  alicemystery  what a world of mystery this is observed the precocious corrie shaking his head with profound solemnity  ive been involved i think thats the word rolled up drowned and buried in mystery for more than three weeks and im beginning to fear that ill never again git into the unmysteriously happy state in which i lived before this abominable manofwar came to the island  no alice i dare not say anything more on that point even to you just now  but wont i give it you all in my first letter and wont you open your eyes just until they look like two blue saucers  further conversation between the friends was interrupted at this point by the inrushing of toozle followed up by poopy and a short time after by mr mason who took alice away with him and left poor corrie disconsolate  while this was going on john bumpus was fulfilling his mission to ole thorwald  he found that obstinate individual in his own parlour deep in the investigation of the state of his books of business which had been allowed to fall into arrear during his absence  come in bumpus  so i hear you were halfhanged when we were away  ole wheeled round on his stool and hooked his thumbs into the armholes of his vest as he said this leaned his back against his desk and regarded the seaman with a facetious look  halfhanged indeed said bumpus indignantly  i was more than halfthreequarters at least  why the worst of its over wen the ropes round your neck  that is a matter which you cant speak to john bumpus seeing that youve never gone beyond the putting of the rope round your neck  well im content with wot i does happen to know about it remarked jo making a wry face an i hope that ill never git the chance of knowin more  but i comed here on business mr thorwald here john became mysterious and put his finger to his lips ive comed here mr thorwald tosplit  as ole did not quite understand the meaning of this word and did not believe that the seaman actually meant to rend himself from head to foot he saidwhy bumpus what dye mean  i mean as how that ive comed to split on my comradeswich means im goin to tell upon em  oh exclaimed ole eyeing the man with a look of distrust  yes pursued bumpus im willin to tell ye all about it and prevent his escape if youll only promise on yer word as a ginlmun that ye wont tell nobody else but six niggers who are more than enough to sarve your turn  prevent whose escape said thorwald with an excited look  gascoynes  ole jumped off his stool and hit his left palm a sounding blow with his right fist  i knew it he exclaimed staring into the face of the seaman  i was sure of it  i said it  but how dye know my man  ah  ill not say another word if ye dont promise to let me go free and only take six niggers with ye  well bumpus i do promise on the word of a true norseman which is much better than that of a gentleman that no harm shall come to you if you tell me all you know of this matter  but i will promise nothing more because if you wont tell me you have told me enough to enable me to take such measures as will prevent gascoyne from escaping  no ye cant prevent it said bumpus with an air of indifference if ye dont choose to come to my way o thinkin ye can take yer own coorse  but let me tell you theres more people on the island that will take gascoynes part than ye think of  theres the whole crew of the talisman whose capn he saved and a lot besides an if ye do come to a fight about it yell have a pretty tough scrimmage  therll be blood spilt mr thorwald an it was partly to prevent that as i comed here for  but you know best  you better take yer own way an ill take mine  the cool impudence of manner with which john bumpus said this had its effect on ole who although fond enough of fighting against enemies had no sort of desire to fight against friends especially for the sake of a pirate  come bumpus said he you and i understand each other  let us talk the thing over calmly  ive quite as much objection to see unnecessary bloodshed as you have  we have had enough of that lately  tell me what you know and i promise to do what you recommend as far as i can in reason  do you promise to let no one else know wot i tell ye  i do  an dye promise to take no more than six niggers to prewent this escape  will six be enough  plenty but if that bothers ye say twelve im not particlarsay twelve  thats more than enough for theyll only have four to fight with  well i promise that too  good  now ill tell ye all about it said bumpus  you see although im splittin i dont want to get my friends into trouble and so i got you to promise an i trust to yer word mr thorwaldyou bein a genlmun  this is how it is  young henry stuart thinks that although gascoyne is a pirate or rather was a pirate he dont deserve to be hanged  cause why  firstly he never committed no murder secondly he saved the lives o some of your peoplealice mason among the rest and thirdly hes an old friend o the family as has done em good sarvice long ago  so henrys made up his mind that as gascoynes sure to be hanged if hes tried its his duty to prewent that there from happenin of  now ye see gascoyne is quite willin to escape  hah the villain exclaimed ole i was sure of that  i knew well enough that all his smoothtongued humility was hypocrisy  im sorry for henry and dont wish to thwart him but its clearly my duty to prevent this escape if i can  so i think sir said bumpus so i think  thats just wat i said to myself wen i made up my mind for to split  gascoyne bein willin then henry has bribed the jailer and he intends to open the jail door for him at twelve oclock this night and hell know wat to do with his legs wen hes got em free  but how am i to prevent his escape if i do not set a strong guard over the prison exclaimed ole in an excited manner  if he once gets into the mountains i might as well try to catch a hare  all fair and softly mr thorwald  dont take on so  it aint two oclock yet weve lots o time  henry has arranged to get a boat ready for him  at twelve oclock tonight the doors will be opened and hell start for the boat  it will lie concealed among the rocks off the long point  theres no mistakin the spot just west of the village an if you place your niggers there youll have as good a chance as need be to nab em  indeed theres two boats to be in waitin for the pirate captain and his friendsset em up  and where is the second boat to be hidden asked ole  im not sure of the exact spot but it cant be very far off from the tother cernly not a hundred miles said bumpus with a grin  now wot i want is that if ye get hold of the pirate yell be content an not go an peach on henry an his comrades  theyll be so ashamed o themselves at bein nabbed in the wery act that theyll give it up as a bad job  besides ye can then go an give him in charge of capting montague  but if ye try to prewent the escape bein attempted henry will take the bloody way of itfor i tell you his birse is up an no mistake  how many men are to be with gascoyne asked thorwald who had he not been naturally a stupid man must have easily seen through this clumsy attempt to blind him  just four answered bumpus an im to be one of em  well bumpus ill take your advice  i shall be at the long point before twelve with a dozen niggers and ill count on you lending us a hand  no ye mustnt count on that mr thorwald  surely its enough if i run away and leave the others to fight  very well do as you please said thorwald with a look of contempt  good day mr thorwald  youll be sure to be there  trust me  an youll not say a word about it to nobody  not a syllable  thats all square  youll see the boat wen ye git there and as long as ye see that boat yer all right  good day sir  john bumpus left thorwalds house chuckling and wended his way to the widows cottage whistling the groves of blarney    chapter thirty one  the ambushthe escaperetributive justiceand conclusion  an hour before the appointed time ole thorwald under cover of a dark night stole out of his own dwelling with slow and wary step and crossed the little plot of ground that lay in front of it with the sly and mysterious air of a burglar rather than that of an honest man  outside his gate he was met in the same cautious manner by a darkskinned human being the character of whose garments was something between those of a sailor and a west india planter  this was sambo thorwalds majordomo clerk overseer and righthand man  sambo was not his proper name but his master regarding him as being the embodiment of all the excellent qualities that could by any possibility exist in the person of a south sea islander had bestowed upon him the generic name of the dark race in addition to that wherewith mr mason had gifted him on the day of his baptism  sambo and his master exchanged a few words in low whispers and then gliding down the path that led from the stout merchants house to the south side of the village they entered the woods that lined the shore like two men bent on a purpose which might or might not be of the blackest possible kind  i dont half like this sort of work sambo observed thorwald speaking and treading with less caution as they left the settlement behind them  ambushments and surprises and night forages especially when they include goats passes dont suit me at all  i have a strong antipathy to everything in the way of warfare save a fair field and no favour under the satisfactory light of the sun  ho said sambo quietly as much as to sayi hear and appreciate but having no observation to make in reply i wait for more from your honoured lips  now you see pursued thorwald if i were to follow my own tastes which it seems to me i am destined not to be allowed to do any more in the affairs of this world if i may judge by the events of the past monthif i were to follow my own tastes i say i would go boldly to the prison where this pestiferous pirate captain lies put double irons on him and place a strong guard round the building  in this case i would be ready to defend it against any odds and would have the satisfaction of standing up for the rights of the settlement like a man and of hurling defiance at the entire british navy at least such portion of it as happens to be on the island at this time if they were to attempt a rescueas this bumpus hints they are likely to do  yet it seems to me strange and unaccountable that they should thus interest themselves in a vile pirate  i verily believe that i have been deceived but it is too late now to alter my plans or to hesitate  truly it seemeth to me that i might style myself an ass without impropriety  ho remarked sambo and the grin with which the remark was accompanied seemed to imply that he not only appreciated his masters sentiment but agreed with it entirely  youve got eleven men i trust sambo  yes massr  all good and true i hope men who can be trusted both in regard to their fighting qualities and their ability to hold their tongues  dumb as owls ebery von returned sambo  good  you see my man i must not permit that fellow to escape at the same time i do not wish to blazon abroad that it is my friend henry stuart who is helping him  neither do i wish to run the risk of killing my friends in a scrimmage if they are so foolish as to resist me therefore i am particular about the men you have told off for this duty where did you say they are to meet us  close by de point massr  a few minutes walk brought them to the point where the men were awaiting them  as far as ole could judge by the dim light of a few stars that struggled through the cloudy sky they were eleven as stout fellows as any warrior could desire to have at his back in a hand to hand conflict  they were all natives clothed much in the same manner as sambo and armed with heavy clubs for as we have seen thorwald was resolved that this should be a bloodless victory  whereabout is the boat whispered ole to his henchman as he groped his way down the rocky slopes towards the shore  bout two hondrd yards more farder in front said sambo  then ill place the men here said ole turning to the natives who were following close at his heels  now boys remain under cover of this rock till i lead you on to the attack and mind what i say to youno killing  some of party are my friends dye understand  i dont want to do them a damage but i do want to prevent their letting off as great a villain i believe as ever sailed the ocean under a black flagonly his was a red one because of his extreme bloodymindedness no doubt which led him to adopt the colour of blood  we will attack them in the rear which means of course by surprise though i must confess that style of warfare goes much against the grain with me  there are just four men i am told besides the pirate  our first onset will secure the fall of at least two of the party by my own cudgeland mark me lads i dont say this in the spirit of boasting  he would indeed be but a poor warrior who could not fell two men when he took them unawares and in the dark  no i feel half ashamed o the work but i suppose it is my duty  so you see there will be just two men and the pirate left for us to deal with  four of you ought to be able to overcome the two men without drawing blood except it may be a little surfacefluid  the remaining nine of us will fall on the pirate captain in a body  you will easily know him by his great size and i have no manner of doubt but that he will make himself further known by the weight of his blows  if i happen to fall dont look after me till you have overcome and bound the pirate  the ropes are all ready and my man sambo will carry them  having delivered this address to his followers who by their hos and grins indicated their perfect readiness to do as they were bid ole thorwald left them in ambush and groped his way down to the beach accompanied by sambo  did you bring the chain and padlock sambo  yis massr  but you no tink it am berer to take boat awaypull him out ob sight  no sambo i have thought on that subject already and have come to the conclusion that it is better to let the boat remain  you see they have placed it in such a way that as long as daylight lasted it could be seen from the settlement and even now it is visible at some distance as you see  if we were to remove it they would at once observe that it was gone and thus be put on their guard  no no sambo  i may not be fond of ambushments but i flatter myself that i have some talent for such matters  the master and servant had reached the beach by this time where they found the boat in the exact position that had been indicated by john bumpus  it lay behind a low piece of coral rock fastened to an iron ring by means of a rope while the oars lay in readiness on the thwarts  sambo now produced a heavy iron chain with which the boat was speedily fastened to the ring  it was secured with a large padlock the key of which ole placed in his pocket  this being satisfactorily accomplished they returned to the place of ambush  now mister gascoyne observed thorwald with a grim smile as he sat down beside his men and pulled out his watch i will await your pleasure  it is just halfpast eleven if you are a punctual man as jo bumpus led me to believe i will try your metal in halfanhour and have you back in your cage before one oclock  what say you to that sambo  the faithful native opened his huge mouth wide and shut his eyes thereby indicating that he laughed but he said nothing bad good or indifferent to his masters facetious observation  the other natives also grinned in a quiet but particularly knowing manner after which the whole party relapsed into profound silence and kept their midnight watch with exemplary patience and eager expectation  at this same hour the pirate captain was seated in his cell on the edge of the low bedstead with his elbows resting on his knees and his face buried in his hands  the cell was profoundly darkso dark that the figure of the prisoner could scarcely be distinguished  gascoyne did not move for many minutes but once or twice a deep sigh escaped him shewing that although his body was at rest his thoughts were busy  at last he moved and clasped his hands together violently as if under a strong impulse  in doing so the clank of his chains echoed harshly through the cell  this seemed to change the current of his thoughts for he again covered his face with both hands and began to mutter to himself  ay said he it has come at last  how often i have dreamed of this when i was free and roaming over the wide ocean  i would say that i have been a fool did i not feel that i have more cause to bow my head and confess that i am a sinner  ah what a thing pride is  how little do men know what it has cost me to humble myself before them as i have done yet i feel no shame in confessing it here when i am all alone alone am i alone  for a long time gascoyne sat in deep silence as if he were following out the train of thought which had been suggested by the last words presently his ideas again found vent in muttered speech  in my pride i have said that there is no god  i dont think i ever believed that but i tried to believe it for i knew that my deeds were evil  surely my own words will condemn me for i have said that i think myself a fool and does not the bible say that the fool hath said in his heart there is no god  ay i remember it well  the words were printed in my brain when i learnt the psalms of david at my mothers knee long long ago  my mother what bitter years have passed since that day  how little did ye dream mother that your child would come to this  god help me  the pirate relapsed into silence and a low groan escaped him  but his thoughts seemed too powerful to be restrained within his breast for they soon broke forth again in words  your two texts have come true pastor mason  you did not mean them for me but they were sent to me  there is no rest saith my god to the wicked  no rest  i have not known rest since i was a boy  be sure your sin shall find you out  i laughed at these words once they laugh at me now  i have found them out to be trueand found it out too late  too late  is it too late  if these words be true are not all the words of god equally true  the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin  that was what you said pastor mason on that sunday morning when the savages were stealing down on us  it gave me comfort then but ah me it seems to give me no comfort now  oh that i had resisted the tempter when he first came to me  strange  i often heard this said long long ago but i laughed at itnot in scorn no it was in easy indifference  i did not believe it had anything to do with me  and now i suppose if i were to stand in the public streets and cry that i had been mistaken with all the fervour of a bursting heart men would laugh at me in an easy wayas i did then  i dont fear death  i have often faced it and i dont remember ever feeling afraid of death  yet i shrink from death now  why is this what a mystery my thoughts and feelings are to me  i know not what to think  but it will soon be over for i feel certain that i shall be doomed to die  god help me  gascoyne again became silent  when he had remained thus a few minutes his attention was roused by the sound of footsteps and of whispering voices close under his window  presently the key was put in the lock the heavy bolt shot back and the door creaked on its hinges as it opened slowly  gascoyne knew by the sound that several men entered the cell but as they carried no light he could not tell how many there were  he was of course surprised at a visit at such an unusual hour as well as at the stealthy manner in which his visitors entered but having made up his mind to submit quietly to whatever was in store for him and knowing that he could not hope for much tenderness at the hands of the inhabitants of sandy cove he was not greatly disturbed  still he would not have been human had not his pulse quickened under the influence of a strong desire to spring up and defend himself  the door of the cell was shut and locked as quietly as it had been opened then followed the sound of footsteps crossing the floor  is that you jailer demanded gascoyne  yell know that time enough answered a gruff voice that was not unfamiliar to the prisoners ear  the others who had entered along with this man did not move from the doorat least if they did so there was no sound of footsteps  the man who had spoken went to the window and spread a thick cloth over it gascoyne could see this because there was sufficient light outside to make the arms of the man dimly visible as he raised them up to accomplish his object  the cell was thus rendered if possible more impenetrably dark than before  now pirate said the man turning round and suddenly flashing a dark lantern full on the stern face of the prisoner you and i will have a little convarse togetherby yer leave or without yer leave  in case there might be pryin eyes about ive closed the porthole dye see  gascoyne listened to this familiar style of address in surprise but did not suffer his features to betray any emotion whatever  the lantern which the seaman for such he evidently was carried in his hand threw a strong light wherever its front was turned but left every other part of the cell in partial darkness  the reflected light was however quite sufficient to enable the prisoner to see that his visitor was a short thickset man of great physical strength and that three men of unusual size and strength stood against the wall in the deep shadow of a recess with their straw hats pulled very much over their eyes  now mister gascoyne began the seaman sitting down on the edge of the small table beside the low pallet and raising the lantern a little while he gazed earnestly into the prisoners face ive reason to believe  ha you are the boatswain of the talisman exclaimed gascoyne as the light reflected from his own countenance irradiated that of dick price whom of course he had seen frequently while they were on board the frigate together  no mister pirate said dick i am not the bosn of the talisman else i shouldnt be here this night  i wos the bosn of that unfortunate frigate but i is so no longer  dick said this in a melancholy tone and thereafter meditated for a few moments in silence  no he resumed with a heavy sigh the talismans blowd up an her bosns out on the spreeso to speakthough it aint a cheerful spree by no means  but to come back to the pint wich wos wot the clergyman said wen hed got so far away from the pint that he never did get back to it as i wos sayin or was agoin to say wen you prewented me ive reason to blieve youre agoin to try for to make yer escape  you are mistaken my man said gascoyne with a sad smile nothing is farther from my thoughts  i dont know how far its from yer thoughts said dick sternly but its pretty close to your intentions so im told  indeed you are mistaken replied gascoyne  if captain montague has sent you here to mount guard he has only deprived you of a nights rest needlessly  if i had intended to make my escape i would not have given myself up  i dont know thatim not so sure o that rejoined the boatswain stoutly  youre said to be a obstinate feller and theres no sayin what a obstinate feller wont do or will do  but i didnt come here for to argify the question with you mister gascoyne  wot i comd here for wos to do my duty so now im agoing to do it  gascoyne who was amused in spite of himself by the manner of the man merely smiled and awaited in silence the pleasure of his eccentric visitor  dick now set down the lantern went to the door and returned with a coil of stout rope  you see observed the boatswain as he busied himself in uncoiling and making a running noose on the rope im ordered to prewent you from carryin out your intentionswotiver these may beby puttin a coil or two o this here rope round you  now wot ive got to ask of you is will ye submit peaceable like to have it done  surely this is heaping unnecessary indignity upon me exclaimed gascoyne flushing crimson with anger  it may be unnecessary but its got to be done returned dick with cool decision as he placed the end of a knot between his powerful teeth and drew it tight  besides mister gascoyne a pirate must expect indignities to be heaped upon him  however ill heap as few as possible on ye in the discharge of my duty  gascoyne had started to his feet but he sat down abashed on being thus reminded of his deserts  true said he true  i will submit  he added in his mind i deserve this but nothing more escaped his lips while he stood up and permitted the boatswain to pass the cord round his arms and lash them firmly to his sides  having bound him in a peculiarly tight and nautical manner dick once more went to his accomplices at the door and returned with a hammer and chisel and a large stone  the latter he placed on the table and directing gascoyne to raise his armswhich were not secured below the elbowsand place his manacles on the stone he cut them asunder with a few powerful blows and removed them  the darbies aint o no use you see as we ye got you all safe with the ropes  now mister gascoyne im agoin to heap one more indignity on ye  im sorry to do it dye see but im bound for to obey orders youll be so good as to sit down on the bed for i aint quite so long as youthough i wont say that im not about as broadand let me tie this napkin over yer mouth  why exclaimed gascoyne again starting and looking fiercely at the boatswain this at least must be unnecessary  i have said that i am willing to submit quietly to whatever the law condemns me  you dont take me for a woman or a child that will be apt to cry out when hurt  certainly not but as im goin to take ye away out o this here limbo it is needful that i should prewent you from lettin people know that yer goin on your travels for ive heerd say theres some o yer friends as is plottin to help you to escape  have i not said already that i do not wish to escape and therefore will not take advantage of any opportunity afforded me by my friends friends  i have no friends  even those whom i thought were my friends have not been near my prison all this day  gascoyne said this bitterly and in great anger  hush exclaimed dick not quite so loud mister pirate  you see there is some reason in my puttin this on your mouth  itll be as well to let me do it quietly else ill have to get a little help  he pointed to the three stout men who stood motionless and silent in the dark recess  oh it was cowardly of you to bind my arms before you told me this said gascoyne with flashing eyes  if my hands were free now  he checked himself by a powerful effort and crushed back the boastful defiance which rose to his lips  now ill tell ye wot it is mister gascoyne said dick price i do believe yer not such a bad feller as they say ye are an im disposed to be marciful to ye  if yell give me your word of honour that youll not holler out and that youll go with us peaceably and do wot yer bid ill not trouble you with the napkin nor bind ye up more than ive done already  but here dick spoke in tones that could not be misunderstood if ye wont give me that promise ill gag ye and bind ye neck and heels and well carry ye out o this shoulder high  now wot say ye to that  gascoyne had calmed his feelings while the boatswain was speaking  he even smiled when he repliedhow can you ask me to give my word of honour  what honour has a pirate to boast of think you  not much praps said dick howsomdever ill be content with wots left of it and if there aint none why then give us yer word  itll do as well  after all it matters little what is done with me said gascoyne in a resigned voice  i am a fool to resist thus  you need not fear that i will offer any further resistance my man  do your duty whitever that may be  that wont do said dick stoutly ye must promise not to holler out  i promise said gascoyne sternly  pray cease this trifling and if it is not inconsistent with your duty let me know where i am to be taken to  thats just wot im not allowed for to tell  but youll find it out in the coorse of time  now all that youve got to do is to walk by my side and do wot i tell ye  the prisoner made no answer  he was evidently weary of the conversation and his thoughts were already wandering on other subjects  the door was now unlocked by one of the three men who stood near it  as its hinges creaked dick shut the lantern and threw the cell at once into total darkness  taking hold of gascoynes wrist gently as if to guide not to force him away he conducted him along the short passage that led to the outer door of the prison  this was opened and the whole party stood in the open air  gascoyne looked with feelings of curiosity at the men who surrounded him but the night was so intensely dark that their features were invisible  he could just discern the outlines of their figures which were enveloped in large cloaks  he was on the point of speaking to them when he remembered his promise to make no noise so he restrained himself and followed his guard in silence  dick and another man walked at his sidethe rest followed in rear leading him round the outskirts of the village towards its northern extremity gascoynes conductors soon brought him to the beach at a retired spot where was a small bay  here they were met by one whose stature proved him to be a boy  he glided up to dick who said in a low whisper  is all ready  all right replied the boy  the ooman aboard  ay  now mr gascoyne said dick pointing to a large boat floating beside the rocks on which they stood youll be so good as to step into that ere boat and sit down beside the individual you see asittin there in the sternsheets  have you authority for what you do asked gascoyne hesitating  i have power to enforce wot i command said dick quietly  remember yer promise mister pirate else  dick finished his sentence by pointing to the three men who stood near still maintaining a silence worthy of eastern mutes and gascoyne feeling that he was completely in their power stepped quickly into the boat and sat down beside the individual referred to by dick who was so completely enveloped in the folds of a large cloak as to defy recognition  but the pirate captain was too much occupied with his own conflicting thoughts and feelings to bestow more than a passing glance on the person who sat at his side  indeed it was not surprising that gascoyne was greatly perplexed by all that was going on at that time for he could not satisfactorily account to himself for the mystery and secrecy which his guards chose to maintain  if they were legitimate agents of the law why these muffled oars with which they swept the boat across the lagoon through the gap in the coral reef and out to sea and if they were not agents of the law who were they and where were they conveying him  the boat was a large one halfdecked and fitted to stand a heavy sea and rough weather  it would have moved sluggishly through the water had not the four men who pulled the oars been possessed of more than average strength  as soon as they passed the barrier reef the sails were hoisted and dick took the helm  the breeze was blowing fresh off the land and the water rushed past the boat as she cut swiftly out to sea leaving a track of white foam behind her  for a few minutes the mass of the island was dimly seen rising like a huge shade on the dark sky but soon it melted away and nothing remained for the straining eyes to rest upon save the boat with its silent crew and the curling foam on the black sea  weve got him safe now lads said dick price speaking for the first time that night in unguarded tones youd better do the deed  the sooner its done the better  while he was speaking one of the three men opened a large clasp knife and advanced towards gascoyne  father said henry cutting the rope that bound him you are free at last  gascoyne started but before he had time to utter the exclamation of surprise that sprang to his lips his hand was seized by the muffled figure that sat at his side  oh  gascoyne forgive usforgive me said mary stuart in a trembling voice  i did indeed know something of what they meant to do but i knew nothing of the cruel violence that these bonds  violence cried dick price i put it to yourself mister gascoyne if i didnt treat ye as if ye wos a lamb  wot a blissin it is for a man to git his mouth open agin and let his breath go free cried jo bumpus with a deep sigh  come corrie give us a cheerhip hip hip  the cheer that followed was stirring and wonderfully harmonious for it was given in a deep bass and a shrill treble with an intermediate baritone ho from jakolu  i know it mary i know it said gascoyne and there was a slight tremor in his deep voice as he drew his wife towards him and laid her head upon his breast  you have never done me an evil turnyou have done me nothing but goodsince you were a little child  heaven bless you mary  now father said henry i suppose you have no objection to make your escape  no need to raise that question lad said gascoyne with a perplexed smile  i am not quite clear as to what my duty is now that i am free to go back and again give myself up  go backfree exclaimed john bumpus in a tone of withering sarcasm so mister gascoyne yeve got sich an oncommon cargo o conceit in ye yet that you actually think ye could go back without so much as by your leave  while jo was speaking he bared to the shoulder an arm that was the reverse of infantine and holding it up said slowly  ive often had a sort o desire dye see to try whether this bit of a limb or the one thats round mrs stuarts waist is the strongest  now if you have any desire to settle this question just try to shove this boats head up into the windthats all  this was said so emphatically by the pugnacious bumpus that his companions laughed and corrie cheered in admiration  you see observed henry you need not give yourself any concern as to this point you have no option in the matter  no not a bit o poption in it wotiverthough wot that means i aint rightly sure said dick price  perhaps i ought to exercise my parental authority over you henry said gascoyne and command you to steer back to sandy cove  but we wouldnt let him mister pirate said dick price who now that his difficult duties were over was preparing to solace himself with a pipe an example that was immediately followed by bumpus who backed his friend by adding  no more we would  nay then if henry joins me said gascoyne i think that we two will not have a bad chance against you three  come thats good so i count for nothing exclaimed corrie  ha stick up lad observed bumpus  the niggers wot you pitched into at the mouth o yon cave didnt think thateh didnt they not  well well if corrie sides with you i feel that my wisest course is to submit  and now henry said gascoyne resuming his wonted gravity of tone and demeanour sit down here and let me know where we are going to and what you mean to do  it is natural that i should feel curious on these points even although i have perfect confidence in you all  henry obeyed and their voices sank into low tones as they mingled in earnest converse about their future plans  thus did gascoyne with his family and friends leave sandy cove in the dead of that dark night and sail away over the wide waste of the great pacific ocean    reader our tale is nearly told  like a picture it contains but a small portion of the career of those who have so long engaged your attention and i would fain hope your sympathy  the life of man may be comprehensively epitomised almost to a point or expanded out ad infinitum  he was born he died is its lowest term  its highest is not definable  innumerable tomes of encyclopaedic dimensions could not contain much less exhaust an account of all that was said and done and all that might be said about what was said and done by our cidevant sandalwood trader and his friends  yet there are main points amid the little details of their career which it would be unpardonable to pass over in silence  to these we shall briefly refer before letting the curtain fall  there is a distant isle of the sea a beautiful spot an oceanic gem which has been reclaimed by the word of god from those regions that have been justly styled the dark places of the earth  we will not mention its name we will not even indicate its whereabout lest we should furnish a clue to the unromantic myrmidons of the law whose inflexible justice is only equalled by their pertinacity in tracking the criminalto his lair  on this beautiful isle at the time of our tale the churches and houses of christian men had begun to rise  the natives had begun to cultivate the arts of civilisation and to appreciate in some degree the inestimable blessings of christianity  the plough had torn up the virgin soil and the anchors of merchantships had begun to kiss the strand  the crimes peculiar to civilised men had not yet been developed  the place had all the romance and freshness of a flourishing infant colony  early one fine morning a halfdecked boat rowed into the harbour of this isle and ran alongside the little quay where the few natives who chanced to be lounging there were filled with admiration at the sight of five stalwart men who leaped upon the rocks an active lad who held the boat steady and a handsome middleaged woman who was assisted to land with much care by the tallest of her five companions  there were a few small bales of merchandise in the boat  these being quickly tossed ashore one of the natives was asked to shew the way to the nearest store where they might be placed in safe keeping  this done the largest man of the party who was clad in the rough garments of a merchant captain offered his arm to the female who was evidently his wife and went off in search of the chief magistrate of the settlement leaving his companions to look after the boat and smoke their pipes  the handsome stranger introduced himself to the magistrate as mr stuart stated that he intended to settle on the island as a general merchant having brought a few bales of merchandise with him that he had been bred an engineer and a shipwright and meant also to work at his old trade and concluded by asking for advice and general information in regard to the state of trade on the island  after having obtained all the information on these subjects that the magistrate could give insomuch that that functionary deemed him a perfect marvel of catechetical wisdom and agreeable addressthe stalwart stranger proceeded to inquire minutely into the state of religion and education among the natives and settlers and finally left the charmed magistrate rejoicing in the belief that he was a most intelligent philanthropist and would be an inestimable acquisition to the settlement  a small trading store was soon built  the stranger was not a rich man he began in a humble way and sought to eke out his subsistence by doing the ordinary work of a wright  in this latter occupation he was ably assisted by his stout son henry for the duties of the store were attended to chiefly by the lad corrie superintended by mr stuart  the mysterious strangers were a source of much gossip and great speculation of course to the good people of green isle as we shall style this gem of the pacific in order to thwart the myrmidons of the law  they found them so reserved and uncommunicative however on the subject of their personal affairs that the most curious gossip in the settlement at last gave up speculating in despair  in other respects the new family were noted for kindliness and urbanity  mrs stuart especially became an intimate friend of the missionary who dwelt there and one of his hardestworking parishioners mr stuart also became his friend but the stern gravity of countenance and reserved though perfectly wellbred and even kindly manner of the stranger forbade close intimacy  he was a most regular attender at church not only on sundays but at the weekly prayermeetings and occasional festivals and the missionary noticed that his bible looked as if it were a wellthumbed one  at first the two seamen whom people soon found out were named respectively jo and dick wrought in the wrights workshop and at all kinds of miscellaneous jobs besides making frequent and sometimes long voyages in their boat to the neighbouring islands  as time flew by things seemed to prosper with the merchant  the keel of a little schooner was laid  father and son and seamen as well as the native servant who was called jako toiled at this vessel incessantly until she was finishedthen henry was placed in command of her jo and dick were appointed first and second mates two or three natives completed the crew and she went to sea under the somewhat peculiar name of the avenger  this seemed to be the first decided advance in the fortunes of the new family  business increased in a wonderful way  the avenger returned again and again to the green isle laden with rich and varied commodities for the successful merchant  in course of time the old store was taken down and a new one built the avenger was sold and a large brig purchased the rather pretty name of whichevening starwas erased and the mysterious word avenger put in its place  everything in short betokened that mr stuart was on the high road to fortune  but there were some mysteries connected with the merchant which sorely puzzled the wisest heads in the place and which would have puzzled still wiser heads had they been there  although it soon became quite evident to the meanest capacity that mr stuart was the richest man on the island yet he and his family continued to occupy the poor shabby little illfurnished cottage which they had erected with their own hands when they first landed and although they sold the finest silks and brocades to the wives and daughters of the other wealthy settlers they themselves wore only the plainest and most sombre fabrics that consisted with respectability  people would have called them a family of misers but for their goodness of character in other respects and for the undeniable fact that they were by far the most liberal contributors to the church and to the poornot only in their own island but in all the other islands around them  another thing that puzzled the mercantile men of the place extremely was the manner in which mr stuart kept his books of business  they soon began to take note that he kept two ledgers and two distinct sets of booksthe one set small the other set very bulky  some of the more audacious among his customers ventured to peep over his shoulder and discovered that the small set contained nothing but entries of boats made and repairs to shipping executed and work connected exclusively with the shipwright department of his businesswhile the large books contained entries of those silks and sugars and teas and spices etcetera which turned so much gold into his coffers  it thus became evident to these men of business that the merchant kept the two departments quite separate in order to ascertain the distinct profits on each  they were the more amazed at this when they considered that the shipwright work must necessarily be a mere driblet altogether unworthy the attention of one so wealthy  but that which amazed them most of all was that such a man in such circumstances could waste his time in doing with his own hands the work of an ordinary mechanicthus as they concluded entailing on himself the necessity of devoting much of the night to his more lucrative concern  these longheaded men of business little knew the man  they did not know that he was great in the highest sense of the term and that among other elements of his greatness he possessed the power of seizing the little thingsthe little opportunitiesof life and turning them to the best account that he not only knew what should be done and how to do it but was gifted with that inflexible determination of purpose to carry out a design without which knowledge and talent can never accomplish great things  the merchant did not as they supposed work late at night  he measured his time and measured his work  in this he was like many other men in this struggling world but he stuck to his time and to his work in which respect he resembled the great few whose names stand prominent on the page of history  in consequence of this mr stuart wrought with success at both departments of his business and while in the one he coined thousands in the other he earned more than the average wages of a working man  the avenger was erratic and uncertain in her voyages  she evidently sailed to the principal islands of the south seas and did business with them all  from one of these voyages henry her captain returned with a wifea darkhaired darkeyed ladylike girlfor whom he built a small cottage beside his fathers and left her there while he was away at sea  it was observed by the clerks in mr stuarts countingroom that their chief accountant mr corrie was a great letter writerthat when one letter was finished he invariably began another and kept it by him adding sheet after sheet to it until the avenger returned and carried it off  once mr corrie was called hurriedly away while in the act of addressing one of these epistles  he left it lying on his desk and a small contemptible little apprentice allowed his curiosity so far to get the better of him that he looked at the address and informed his companions that mr corries correspondent was a certain miss alice mason  of course mr corrie received voluminous replies from this mysterious alice and if one might judge from his expression on reading these epistles as that contemptible little apprentice did judge the course of his love ran smoother than usual thus by its exceptionality proving the truth of the rule  years passed away  the merchants head became grey but his gigantic frame was as straight and his step as firm as ever  his wife strange to say looked younger as she grew older  it seemed as if she were recovering from some terrible illness that had made her prematurely old and were now renewing her youth  the business prospered to such an extent that by becoming altogether too wonderful it ceased to be a matter of wonder altogether to the merchants of the green isle  they regarded it as semimiraculousthe most unprecedented case of luck that had ever been heard of in the annals of mercantile history  but the rich merchant still dwelt in the humble almost mean cottage and still wrought as an engineer and shipwright with his own hands  in the little cottage beside his own there were soon seen and heard three stout children two boys and a girl the former being named respectively gascoyne and henry the latter mary  it is needless to say that these were immense favourites with the eccentric merchant  during all this time there was a firm in liverpool which received periodical remittances of money from an unknown source  the cashier of that firm a fat little man with a face like a dumpling and a nose like a cherry lived as it were in a state of perpetual amazement in regard to these remittances  they came regularly from apparently nowhere were acknowledged to nobody and amounted in the course of time to many thousands  this firm had some years previously lost a fine vessel  she was named the brilliant had sailed for the south sea islands with a rich cargo and was never more heard of  the fat cashier knew the loss sustained by this vessel to a penny  he had prepared and calculated all the papers and sent duplicates on board and as he had a stake in the venture he never forgot the amount of the loss sustained  one day the firm received a remittance from the unknown with a note to the following effect at the foot of itthis is the last remittance on account of the brilliant  the value of the cargo including compound interest and the estimated value of the vessel have now been repaid to the owners  the fat cashier was thunderstruck  he rushed to his ledger examined the account calculated the interest summed up the whole and found it correct  he went home to bed and fell sound asleep in amazement awoke in amazement went back to the office in amazement worked on day after day in amazement lived and eventually died in a state of unrelieved amazement in regard to this incomprehensible transaction  about the same time that this occurred mr stuart entered his poor cottage and finding his wife there said  mary i have sent off the last remittance today  i have made amends for that evil deed  it has cost me a long and hard struggle to realise the thousands of pounds that were requisite for some of the goods had got damaged by damp in the cavern of the isle of palms but the profits of my engineering and shipwright business have increased of late and i have managed to square it all off with interest  and now mary i can do no more  if i knew of any others who have suffered at my hands i would restore what i took tenfoldbut i know of none  it therefore remains that i should work this business for the good of mankind  of all the thousands that have passed through my hands i have not used one penny  you know that i have always kept the business that has grown out of the labour of my own hands distinct from that which has been reared on the stolen goods  i have lived and supported you by it and now through gods blessing it has increased to such an extent that i think we may afford to build a somewhat more commodious house and furnish it a little better  as for the mercantile businessit must go on  it has prospered and still prospers  many mouths are dependent on it for daily bread  i will continue to manage it but every penny of profit shall go in charity as long as i live  after that henry may do with it as he pleases  he has contributed largely to make it what it is and deserves to reap where he has sown so diligently  do you think i am right in all this mary  we need scarcely remark that mary did think it all right for she and gascoyne had no differences of opinion now  soon after this corrie went off on a long voyage in the avenger  the vessel touched at san francisco and while there some remarkable scenes took place between jo bumpus and a goodlooking woman whom he called susan  this female ultimately went on board the avenger and sailed in her for green isle  on the way thither they touched at one of the first of the south sea islands that they came in sight of where scenes of the most unprecedented description took place between corrie and a bluff old gentleman named ole thorwald and a sweet blueeyed fairhaired maiden named alice mason  strange to say this fair girl agreed to become a passenger in the avenger and still more strange to say her father and ole thorwald agreed to accompany her also an ancient piece of animated doormatting called toozle and a black woman named poopy whose single observation in regard to every event in sublunary history was hee hee  on reaching green isle corrie and alice were married and on the same day bumpus and susan were also united  there was great rejoicing on the occasion ole thorwald and dick price distinguished themselves by dancing an impromptu and maniacal pas de deux at the double wedding  of captain montagues future career we know nothing  he may have been killed in the wars of his country or he may have become an admiral in the british navy for all we know to the contrary  one thing only we are certain of and that is that he sailed for england in the pirate schooner and seemed by no means to regret the escape of the pirate captain  years rolled away  the head of gascoyne became silvery white but time seemed impotent to subdue the vigour of his stalwart frame or destroy the music of his deep bass voice  he was the idol of numerous grandchildren as well as of a large circle of juveniles who without regard to whether they had or had not a right to do so styled him grandfather  little did these youngsters think as they clambered over his huge frame and listened with breathless attention to his wild stories of the sea that grandfather had once been the celebrated and muchdreaded durward the pirate  nothing would induce gascoyne to take a prominent part in the public affairs of his chosen home but he did attempt to teach a class of the very smallest boys and girls in the missionarys sunday school and he came in time to take special delight in this work  he was never so happy as when telling to these little ones the story of redeeming love  in the choice of subjects for his class he was somewhat peculiar as well as in his manner of treating them  he was particularly emphatic and earnest used to fill his little hearers with awe when he spoke of the danger of sin and the importance of resisting its beginnings  but his two favourite themes of alland those which dwelt most frequently on his lipswere god is love and love is the fulfilling of the law  the end
