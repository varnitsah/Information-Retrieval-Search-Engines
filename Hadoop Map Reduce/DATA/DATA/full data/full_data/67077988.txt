67077988	a human braincontrolled spacecraft would mean mechanical     perfection this was accomplished and something unforeseen a     strange entity called     mr spaceship   by   philip k dick   illustration  kramer leaned back you can see the situation how can we deal with a factor like this the perfect variable  perfect prediction should still be possible a living thing still acts from necessity the same as inanimate material but the causeeffect chain is more subtle there are more factors to be considered the difference is quantitative i think the reaction of the living organism parallels natural causation but with greater complexity  gross and kramer looked up at the board plates suspended on the wall still dripping the images hardening into place kramer traced a line with his pencil  see that its a pseudopodium theyre alive and so far a weapon we cant beat no mechanical system can compete with that simple or intricate well have to scrap the johnson control and find something else  meanwhile the war continues as it is stalemate checkmate they cant get to us and we cant get through their living minefield  kramer nodded its a perfect defense for them but there still might be one answer  whats that  wait a minute kramer turned to his rocket expert sitting with the charts and files the heavy cruiser that returned this week it didnt actually touch did it it came close but there was no contact  correct the expert nodded the mine was twenty miles off the cruiser was in spacedrive moving directly toward proxima linestraight using the johnson control of course it had deflected a quarter of an hour earlier for reasons unknown later it resumed its course that was when they got it  it shifted kramer said but not enough the mine was coming along after it trailing it its the same old story but i wonder about the contact  heres our theory the expert said we keep looking for contact a trigger in the pseudopodium but more likely were witnessing a psychological phenomena a decision without any physical correlative were watching for something that isnt there the mine decides to blow up it sees our ship approaches and then decides  thanks kramer turned to gross well that confirms what im saying how can a ship guided by automatic relays escape a mine that decides to explode the whole theory of mine penetration is that you must avoid tripping the trigger but here the trigger is a state of mind in a complicated developed lifeform  the belt is fifty thousand miles deep gross added it solves another problem for them repair and maintenance the damn things reproduce fill up the spaces by spawning into them i wonder what they feed on  probably the remains of our firstline the big cruisers must be a delicacy its a game of wits between a living creature and a ship piloted by automatic relays the ship always loses kramer opened a folder ill tell you what i suggest  go on gross said ive already heard ten solutions today whats yours  mine is very simple these creatures are superior to any mechanical system but only because theyre alive almost any other lifeform could compete with them any higher lifeform if the yuks can put out living mines to protect their planets we ought to be able to harness some of our own lifeforms in a similar way lets make use of the same weapon ourselves  which lifeform do you propose to use  i think the human brain is the most agile of known living forms do you know of any better  but no human being can withstand outspace travel a human pilot would be dead of heart failure long before the ship got anywhere near proxima  but we dont need the whole body kramer said we need only the brain  what  the problem is to find a person of high intelligence who would contribute in the same manner that eyes and arms are volunteered  but a brain  technically it could be done brains have been transferred several times when body destruction made it necessary of course to a spaceship to a heavy outspace cruiser instead of an artificial body thats new  the room was silent  its quite an idea gross said slowly his heavy square face twisted but even supposing it might work the big question is whose brain                                       it was all very confusing the reasons for the war the nature of the enemy the yucconae had been contacted on one of the outlying planets of proxima centauri at the approach of the terran ship a host of dark slim pencils had lifted abruptly and shot off into the distance the first real encounter came between three of the yuk pencils and a single exploration ship from terra no terrans survived after that it was all out war with no holds barred  both sides feverishly constructed defense rings around their systems of the two the yucconae belt was the better the ring around proxima was a living ring superior to anything terra could throw against it the standard equipment by which terran ships were guided in outspace the johnson control was not adequate something more was needed automatic relays were not good enough  not good at all kramer thought to himself as he stood looking down the hillside at the work going on below him a warm wind blew along the hill rustling the weeds and grass at the bottom in the valley the mechanics had almost finished the last elements of the reflex system had been removed from the ship and crated up  all that was needed now was the new core the new central key that would take the place of the mechanical system a human brain the brain of an intelligent wary human being but would the human being part with it that was the problem  kramer turned two people were approaching him along the road a man and a woman the man was gross expressionless heavyset walking with dignity the woman washe stared in surprise and growing annoyance it was dolores his wife since theyd separated he had seen little of her  kramer gross said look who i ran into come back down with us were going into town  hello phil dolores said well arent you glad to see me  he nodded how have you been youre looking fine she was still pretty and slender in her uniform the bluegrey of internal security gross organization  thanks she smiled you seem to be doing all right too commander gross tells me that youre responsible for this project operation head as they call it whose head have you decided on  thats the problem kramer lit a cigarette this ship is to be equipped with a human brain instead of the johnson system weve constructed special draining baths for the brain electronic relays to catch the impulses and magnify them a continual feeding duct that supplies the living cells with everything they need but  but we still havent got the brain itself gross finished they began to walk back toward the car if we can get that well be ready for the tests  will the brain remain alive dolores asked is it actually going to live as part of the ship  it will be alive but not conscious very little life is actually conscious animals trees insects are quick in their responses but they arent conscious in this process of ours the individual personality the ego will cease we only need the response ability nothing more  dolores shuddered how terrible  in time of war everything must be tried kramer said absently if one life sacrificed will end the war its worth it this ship might get through a couple more like it and there wouldnt be any more war                                       they got into the car as they drove down the road gross said have you thought of anyone yet  kramer shook his head thats out of my line  what do you mean  im an engineer its not in my department  but all this was your idea  my work ends there  gross was staring at him oddly kramer shifted uneasily  then who is supposed to do it gross said i can have my organization prepare examinations of various kinds to determine fitness that kind of thing  listen phil dolores said suddenly  what  she turned toward him i have an idea do you remember that professor we had in college michael thomas  kramer nodded  i wonder if hes still alive dolores frowned if he is he must be awfully old  why dolores gross asked  perhaps an old person who didnt have much time left but whose mind was still clear and sharp  professor thomas kramer rubbed his jaw he certainly was a wise old duck but could he still be alive he must have been seventy then  we could find that out gross said i could make a routine check  what do you think dolores said if any human mind could outwit those creatures  i dont like the idea kramer said in his mind an image had appeared the image of an old man sitting behind a desk his bright gentle eyes moving about the classroom the old man leaning forward a thin hand raised  keep him out of this kramer said  whats wrong gross looked at him curiously  its because i suggested it dolores said  no kramer shook his head its not that i didnt expect anything like this somebody i knew a man i studied under i remember him very clearly he was a very distinct personality  good gross said he sounds fine  we cant do it were asking his death  this is war gross said and war doesnt wait on the needs of the individual you said that yourself surely hell volunteer we can keep it on that basis  he may already be dead dolores murmured  well find that out gross said speeding up the car they drove the rest of the way in silence                                       for a long time the two of them stood studying the small wood house overgrown with ivy set back on the lot behind an enormous oak the little town was silent and sleepy once in awhile a car moved slowly along the distant highway but that was all  this is the place gross said to kramer he folded his arms quite a quaint little house  kramer said nothing the two security agents behind them were expressionless  gross started toward the gate lets go according to the check hes still alive but very sick his mind is agile however that seems to be certain its said he doesnt leave the house a woman takes care of his needs hes very frail  they went down the stone walk and up onto the porch gross rang the bell they waited after a time they heard slow footsteps the door opened an elderly woman in a shapeless wrapper studied them impassively  security gross said showing his card we wish to see professor thomas  why  government business he glanced at kramer  kramer stepped forward i was a pupil of the professors he said im sure he wont mind seeing us  the woman hesitated uncertainly gross stepped into the doorway all right mother this is war time we cant stand out here  the two security agents followed him and kramer came reluctantly behind closing the door gross stalked down the hall until he came to an open door he stopped looking in kramer could see the white corner of a bed a wooden post and the edge of a dresser  he joined gross  in the dark room a withered old man lay propped up on endless pillows at first it seemed as if he were asleep there was no motion or sign of life but after a time kramer saw with a faint shock that the old man was watching them intently his eyes fixed on them unmoving unwinking  professor thomas gross said im commander gross of security this man with me is perhaps known to you  the faded eyes fixed on kramer  i know him philip kramer youve grown heavier boy the voice was feeble the rustle of dry ashes is it true youre married now  yes i married dolores french you remember her kramer came toward the bed but were separated it didnt work out very well our careers  what we came here about professor gross began but kramer cut him off with an impatient wave  let me talk cant you and your men get out of here long enough to let me talk to him  gross swallowed all right kramer he nodded to the two men the three of them left the room going out into the hall and closing the door after them  the old man in the bed watched kramer silently i dont think much of him he said at last ive seen his type before whats he want  nothing he just came along can i sit down kramer found a stiff upright chair beside the bed if im bothering you  no im glad to see you again philip after so long im sorry your marriage didnt work out  how have you been  ive been very ill im afraid that my moment on the worlds stage has almost ended the ancient eyes studied the younger man reflectively you look as if you have been doing well like everyone else i thought highly of youve gone to the top in this society  kramer smiled then he became serious professor theres a project were working on that i want to talk to you about its the first ray of hope weve had in this whole war if it works we may be able to crack the yuk defenses get some ships into their system if we can do that the war might be brought to an end  go on tell me about it if you wish  its a long shot this project it may not work at all but we have to give it a try  its obvious that you came here because of it professor thomas murmured im becoming curious go on                                       after kramer finished the old man lay back in the bed without speaking at last he sighed  i understand a human mind taken out of a human body he sat up a little looking at kramer i suppose youre thinking of me  kramer said nothing  before i make my decision i want to see the papers on this the theory and outline of construction im not sure i like itfor reasons of my own i mean but i want to look at the material if youll do that  certainly kramer stood up and went to the door gross and the two security agents were standing outside waiting tensely gross come inside  they filed into the room  give the professor the papers kramer said he wants to study them before deciding  gross brought the file out of his coat pocket a manila envelope he handed it to the old man on the bed here it is professor youre welcome to examine it will you give us your answer as soon as possible were very anxious to begin of course  ill give you my answer when ive decided he took the envelope with a thin trembling hand my decision depends on what i find out from these papers if i dont like what i find then i will not become involved with this work in any shape or form he opened the envelope with shaking hands im looking for one thing  what is it gross said  thats my affair leave me a number by which i can reach you when ive decided  silently gross put his card down on the dresser as they went out professor thomas was already reading the first of the papers the outline of the theory                                       kramer sat across from dale winter his second in line what then winter said  hes going to contact us kramer scratched with a drawing pen on some paper i dont know what to think  what do you mean winters goodnatured face was puzzled  look kramer stood up pacing back and forth his hands in his uniform pockets he was my teacher in college i respected him as a man as well as a teacher he was more than a voice a talking book he was a person a calm kindly person i could look up to i always wanted to be like him someday now look at me  so  look at what im asking im asking for his life as if he were some kind of laboratory animal kept around in a cage not a man a teacher at all  do you think hell do it  i dont know kramer went to the window he stood looking out in a way i hope not  but if he doesnt  then well have to find somebody else i know there would be somebody else why did dolores have to  the vidphone rang kramer pressed the button  this is gross the heavy features formed the old man called me professor thomas  what did he say he knew he could tell already by the sound of gross voice  he said hed do it i was a little surprised myself but apparently he means it weve already made arrangements for his admission to the hospital his lawyer is drawing up the statement of liability  kramer only half heard he nodded wearily all right im glad i suppose we can go ahead then  you dont sound very glad  i wonder why he decided to go ahead with it  he was very certain about it gross sounded pleased he called me quite early i was still in bed you know this calls for a celebration  sure kramer said it sure does                                       toward the middle of august the project neared completion they stood outside in the hot autumn heat looking up at the sleek metal sides of the ship  gross thumped the metal with his hand well it wont be long we can begin the test any time  tell us more about this an officer in gold braid said its such an unusual concept  is there really a human brain inside the ship a dignitary asked a small man in a rumpled suit and the brain is actually alive  gentlemen this ship is guided by a living brain instead of the usual johnson relaycontrol system but the brain is not conscious it will function by reflex only the practical difference between it and the johnson system is this a human brain is far more intricate than any manmade structure and its ability to adapt itself to a situation to respond to danger is far beyond anything that could be artificially built  gross paused cocking his ear the turbines of the ship were beginning to rumble shaking the ground under them with a deep vibration kramer was standing a short distance away from the others his arms folded watching silently at the sound of the turbines he walked quickly around the ship to the other side a few workmen were clearing away the last of the waste the scraps of wiring and scaffolding they glanced up at him and went on hurriedly with their work kramer mounted the ramp and entered the control cabin of the ship winter was sitting at the controls with a pilot from spacetransport  hows it look kramer asked  all right winter got up he tells me that it would be best to take off manually the robot controls winter hesitated i mean the builtin controls can take over later on in space  thats right the pilot said its customary with the johnson system and so in this case we should  can you tell anything yet kramer asked  no the pilot said slowly i dont think so ive been going over everything it seems to be in good order theres only one thing i wanted to ask you about he put his hand on the control board there are some changes here i dont understand  changes  alterations from the original design i wonder what the purpose is  kramer took a set of the plans from his coat let me look he turned the pages over the pilot watched carefully over his shoulder  the changes arent indicated on your copy the pilot said i wonder he stopped commander gross had entered the control cabin  gross who authorized alterations kramer said some of the wiring has been changed  why your old friend gross signaled to the field tower through the window  my old friend  the professor he took quite an active interest gross turned to the pilot lets get going we have to take this out past gravity for the test they tell me well perhaps its for the best are you ready  sure the pilot sat down and moved some of the controls around anytime  go ahead then gross said  the professor kramer began but at that moment there was a tremendous roar and the ship leaped under him he grasped one of the wall holds and hung on as best he could the cabin was filling with a steady throbbing the raging of the jet turbines underneath them  the ship leaped kramer closed his eyes and held his breath they were moving out into space gaining speed each moment                                       well what do you think winter said nervously is it time yet  a little longer kramer said he was sitting on the floor of the cabin down by the control wiring he had removed the metal coveringplate exposing the complicated maze of relay wiring he was studying it comparing it to the wiring diagrams  whats the matter gross said  these changes i cant figure out what theyre for the only pattern i can make out is that for some reason  let me look the pilot said he squatted down beside kramer you were saying  see this lead here originally it was switch controlled it closed and opened automatically according to temperature change now its wired so that the central control system operates it the same with the others a lot of this was still mechanical worked by pressure temperature stress now its under the central master  the brain gross said you mean its been altered so that the brain manipulates it  kramer nodded maybe professor thomas felt that no mechanical relays could be trusted maybe he thought that things would be happening too fast but some of these could close in a split second the brake rockets could go on as quickly as  hey winter said from the control seat were getting near the moon stations whatll i do  they looked out the port the corroded surface of the moon gleamed up at them a corrupt and sickening sight they were moving swiftly toward it  ill take it the pilot said he eased winter out of the way and strapped himself in place the ship began to move away from the moon as he manipulated the controls down below them they could see the observation stations dotting the surface and the tiny squares that were the openings of the underground factories and hangars a red blinker winked up at them and the pilots fingers moved on the board in answer  were past the moon the pilot said after a time the moon had fallen behind them the ship was heading into outer space well we can go ahead with it  kramer did not answer  mr kramer we can go ahead any time  kramer started sorry i was thinking all right thanks he frowned deep in thought  what is it gross asked  the wiring changes did you understand the reason for them when you gave the okay to the workmen  gross flushed you know i know nothing about technical material im in security  then you should have consulted me  what does it matter gross grinned wryly were going to have to start putting our faith in the old man sooner or later  the pilot stepped back from the board his face was pale and set well its done he said thats it  whats done kramer said  were on automatic the brain i turned the board over to itto him i mean the old man the pilot lit a cigarette and puffed nervously lets keep our fingers crossed                                       the ship was coasting evenly in the hands of its invisible pilot far down inside the ship carefully armoured and protected a soft human brain lay in a tank of liquid a thousand minute electric charges playing over its surface as the charges rose they were picked up and amplified fed into relay systems advanced carried on through the entire ship  gross wiped his forehead nervously so he is running it now i hope he knows what hes doing  kramer nodded enigmatically i think he does  what do you mean  nothing kramer walked to the port i see were still moving in a straight line he picked up the microphone we can instruct the brain orally through this he blew against the microphone experimentally  go on winter said  bring the ship around halfright kramer said decrease speed  they waited time passed gross looked at kramer no change nothing  wait  slowly the ship was beginning to turn the turbines missed reducing their steady beat the ship was taking up its new course adjusting itself nearby some space debris rushed past incinerating in the blasts of the turbine jets  so far so good gross said  they began to breathe more easily the invisible pilot had taken control smoothly calmly the ship was in good hands kramer spoke a few more words into the microphone and they swung again now they were moving back the way they had come toward the moon  lets see what he does when we enter the moons pull kramer said he was a good mathematician the old man he could handle any kind of problem  the ship veered turning away from the moon the great eatenaway globe fell behind them  gross breathed a sigh of relief thats that  one more thing kramer picked up the microphone return to the moon and land the ship at the first space field he said into it  good lord winter murmured why are you  be quiet kramer stood listening the turbines gasped and roared as the ship swung full around gaining speed they were moving back back toward the moon again the ship dipped down heading toward the great globe below  were going a little fast the pilot said i dont see how he can put down at this velocity                                       the port filled up as the globe swelled rapidly the pilot hurried toward the board reaching for the controls all at once the ship jerked the nose lifted and the ship shot out into space away from the moon turning at an oblique angle the men were thrown to the floor by the sudden change in course they got to their feet again speechless staring at each other  the pilot gazed down at the board it wasnt me i didnt touch a thing i didnt even get to it  the ship was gaining speed each moment kramer hesitated maybe you better switch it back to manual  the pilot closed the switch he took hold of the steering controls and moved them experimentally nothing he turned around nothing it doesnt respond  no one spoke  you can see what has happened kramer said calmly the old man wont let go of it now that he has it i was afraid of this when i saw the wiring changes everything in this ship is centrally controlled even the cooling system the hatches the garbage release were helpless  nonsense gross strode to the board he took hold of the wheel and turned it the ship continued on its course moving away from the moon leaving it behind  release kramer said into the microphone let go of the controls well take it back release  no good the pilot said nothing he spun the useless wheel its dead completely dead  and were still heading out winter said grinning foolishly well be going through the firstline defense belt in a few minutes if they dont shoot us down  we better radio back the pilot clicked the radio to send ill contact the main bases one of the observation stations  better get the defense belt at the speed were going well be into it in a minute  and after that kramer said well be in outer space hes moving us toward outspace velocity is this ship equipped with baths  baths gross said  the sleep tanks for spacedrive we may need them if we go much faster  but good god where are we going gross said wherewheres he taking us                                       the pilot obtained contact this is dwight on ship he said were entering the defense zone at high velocity dont fire on us  turn back the impersonal voice came through the speaker youre not allowed in the defense zone  we cant weve lost control  lost control  this is an experimental ship  gross took the radio this is commander gross security were being carried into outer space theres nothing we can do is there any way that we can be removed from this ship  a hesitation we have some fast pursuit ships that could pick you up if you wanted to jump the chances are good theyd find you do you have space flares  we do the pilot said lets try it  abandon ship kramer said if we leave now well never see it again  what else can we do were gaining speed all the time do you propose that we stay here  no kramer shook his head damn it there ought to be a better solution  could you contact him winter asked the old man try to reason with him  its worth a chance gross said try it  all right kramer took the microphone he paused a moment listen can you hear me this is phil kramer can you hear me professor can you hear me i want you to release the controls  there was silence  this is kramer professor can you hear me do you remember who i am do you understand who this is  above the control panel the wall speaker made a sound a sputtering static they looked up  can you hear me professor this is philip kramer i want you to give the ship back to us if you can hear me release the controls let go professor let go  static a rushing sound like the wind they gazed at each other there was silence for a moment  its a waste of time gross said  nolisten  the sputter came again then mixed with the sputter almost lost in it a voice came toneless without inflection a mechanical lifeless voice from the metal speaker in the wall above their heads   is it you philip i cant make you out darkness whos there with you  its me kramer his fingers tightened against the microphone handle you must release the controls professor we have to get back to terra you must  silence then the faint faltering voice came again a little stronger than before kramer everything so strange i was right though consciousness result of thinking necessary result cognito ergo sum retain conceptual ability can you hear me  yes professor  i altered the wiring control i was fairly certain i wonder if i can do it try  suddenly the airconditioning snapped into operation it snapped abruptly off again down the corridor a door slammed something thudded the men stood listening sounds came from all sides of them switches shutting opening the lights blinked off they were in darkness the lights came back on and at the same time the heating coils dimmed and faded  good god winter said  water poured down on them the emergency firefighting system there was a screaming rush of air one of the escape hatches had slid back and the air was roaring frantically out into space  the hatch banged closed the ship subsided into silence the heating coils glowed into life as suddenly as it had begun the weird exhibition ceased  i can doeverything the dry toneless voice came from the wall speaker it is all controlled kramer i wish to talk to you ive beenbeen thinking i havent seen you in many years a lot to discuss youve changed boy we have much to discuss your wife  the pilot grabbed kramers arm theres a ship standing off our bow look                                       they ran to the port a slender pale craft was moving along with them keeping pace with them it was signalblinking  a terran pursuit ship the pilot said lets jump theyll pick us up suits  he ran to a supply cupboard and turned the handle the door opened and he pulled the suits out onto the floor  hurry gross said a panic seized them they dressed frantically pulling the heavy garments over them winter staggered to the escape hatch and stood by it waiting for the others they joined him one by one  lets go gross said open the hatch  winter tugged at the hatch help me  they grabbed hold tugging together nothing happened the hatch refused to budge  get a crowbar the pilot said  hasnt anyone got a blaster gross looked frantically around damn it blast it open  pull kramer grated pull together  are you at the hatch the toneless voice came drifting and eddying through the corridors of the ship they looked up staring around them i sense something nearby outside a ship you are leaving all of you kramer you are leaving too very unfortunate i had hoped we could talk perhaps at some other time you might be induced to remain  open the hatch kramer said staring up at the impersonal walls of the ship for gods sake open it  there was silence an endless pause then very slowly the hatch slid back the air screamed out rushing past them into space  one by one they leaped one after the other propelled away by the repulsive material of the suits a few minutes later they were being hauled aboard the pursuit ship as the last one of them was lifted through the port their own ship pointed itself suddenly upward and shot off at tremendous speed it disappeared  kramer removed his helmet gasping two sailors held onto him and began to wrap him in blankets gross sipped a mug of coffee shivering  its gone kramer murmured  ill have an alarm sent out gross said  whats happened to your ship a sailor asked curiously it sure took off in a hurry whos on it  well have to have it destroyed gross went on his face grim its got to be destroyed theres no telling what itwhat he has in mind gross sat down weakly on a metal bench what a close call for us we were so damn trusting  what could he be planning kramer said half to himself it doesnt make sense i dont get it                                       as the ship sped back toward the moon base they sat around the table in the dining room sipping hot coffee and thinking not saying very much  look here gross said at last what kind of man was professor thomas what do you remember about him  kramer put his coffee mug down it was ten years ago i dont remember much its vague  he let his mind run back over the years he and dolores had been at hunt college together in physics and the life sciences the college was small and set back away from the momentum of modern life he had gone there because it was his home town and his father had gone there before him  professor thomas had been at the college a long time as long as anyone could remember he was a strange old man keeping to himself most of the time there were many things that he disapproved of but he seldom said what they were  do you recall anything that might help us gross asked anything that would give us a clue as to what he might have in mind  kramer nodded slowly i remember one thing  one day he and the professor had been sitting together in the school chapel talking leisurely  well youll be out of school soon the professor had said what are you going to do  do work at one of the government research projects i suppose  and eventually whats your ultimate goal  kramer had smiled the question is unscientific it presupposes such things as ultimate ends  suppose instead along these lines then what if there were no war and no government research projects what would you do then  i dont know but how can i imagine a hypothetical situation like that theres been war as long as i can remember were geared for war i dont know what id do i suppose id adjust get used to it  the professor had stared at him oh you do think youd get accustomed to it eh well im glad of that and you think you could find something to do  gross listened intently what do you infer from this kramer  not much except that he was against war  were all against war gross pointed out  true but he was withdrawn set apart he lived very simply cooking his own meals his wife died many years ago he was born in europe in italy he changed his name when he came to the united states he used to read dante and milton he even had a bible  very anachronistic dont you think  yes he lived quite a lot in the past he found an old phonograph and records and he listened to the old music you saw his house how oldfashioned it was  did he have a file winter asked gross  with security no none at all as far as we could tell he never engaged in political work never joined anything or even seemed to have strong political convictions  no kramer agreed about all he ever did was walk through the hills he liked nature  nature can be of great use to a scientist gross said there wouldnt be any science without it  kramer what do you think his plan is taking control of the ship and disappearing winter said  maybe the transfer made him insane the pilot said maybe theres no plan nothing rational at all  but he had the ship rewired and he had made sure that he would retain consciousness and memory before he even agreed to the operation he must have had something planned from the start but what  perhaps he just wanted to stay alive longer kramer said he was old and about to die or  or what  nothing kramer stood up i think as soon as we get to the moon base ill make a vidcall to earth i want to talk to somebody about this  whos that gross asked  dolores maybe she remembers something  thats a good idea gross said                                       where are you calling from dolores asked when he succeeded in reaching her  from the moon base  all kinds of rumors are running around why didnt the ship come back what happened  im afraid he ran off with it  he  the old man professor thomas kramer explained what had happened  dolores listened intently how strange and you think he planned it all in advance from the start  im certain he asked for the plans of construction and the theoretical diagrams at once  but why what for  i dont know look dolores what do you remember about him is there anything that might give a clue to all this  like what  i dont know thats the trouble  on the vidscreen dolores knitted her brow i remember he raised chickens in his back yard and once he had a goat she smiled do you remember the day the goat got loose and wandered down the main street of town nobody could figure out where it came from  anything else  no he watched her struggling trying to remember he wanted to have a farm sometime i know  all right thanks kramer touched the switch when i get back to terra maybe ill stop and see you  let me know how it works out  he cut the line and the picture dimmed and faded he walked slowly back to where gross and some officers of the military were sitting at a chart table talking  any luck gross said looking up  no all she remembers is that he kept a goat  come over and look at this detail chart gross motioned him around to his side watch  kramer saw the record tabs moving furiously the little white dots racing back and forth  whats happening he asked  a squadron outside the defense zone has finally managed to contact the ship theyre maneuvering now for position watch  the white counters were forming a barrel formation around a black dot that was moving steadily across the board away from the central position as they watched the white dots constricted around it  theyre ready to open fire a technician at the board said commander what shall we tell them to do  gross hesitated i hate to be the one who makes the decision when it comes right down to it  its not just a ship kramer said its a man a living person a human being is up there moving through space i wish we knew what  but the order has to be given we cant take any chances suppose he went over to them to the yuks  kramers jaw dropped my god he wouldnt do that  are you sure do you know what hell do  he wouldnt do that  gross turned to the technician tell them to go ahead  im sorry sir but now the ship has gotten away look down at the board                                       gross stared down kramer over his shoulder the black dot had slipped through the white dots and had moved off at an abrupt angle the white dots were broken up dispersing in confusion  hes an unusual strategist one of the officers said he traced the line its an ancient maneuver an old prussian device but it worked  the white dots were turning back too many yuk ships out that far gross said well thats what you get when you dont act quickly he looked up coldly at kramer we should have done it when we had him look at him go he jabbed a finger at the rapidly moving black dot the dot came to the edge of the board and stopped it had reached the limit of the chartered area see  now what kramer thought watching so the old man had escaped the cruisers and gotten away he was alert all right there was nothing wrong with his mind or with his ability to control his new body  bodythe ship was a new body for him he had traded in the old dying body withered and frail for this hulking frame of metal and plastic turbines and rocket jets he was strong now strong and big the new body was more powerful than a thousand human bodies but how long would it last him the average life of a cruiser was only ten years with careful handling he might get twenty out of it before some essential part failed and there was no way to replace it  and then what then what would he do when something failed and there was no one to fix it for him that would be the end someplace far out in the cold darkness of space the ship would slow down silent and lifeless to exhaust its last heat into the eternal timelessness of outer space or perhaps it would crash on some barren asteroid burst into a million fragments  it was only a question of time  your wife didnt remember anything gross said  i told you only that he kept a goat once  a hell of a lot of help that is  kramer shrugged its not my fault  i wonder if well ever see him again gross stared down at the indicator dot still hanging at the edge of the board i wonder if hell ever move back this way  i wonder too kramer said                                       that night kramer lay in bed tossing from side to side unable to sleep the moon gravity even artificially increased was unfamiliar to him and it made him uncomfortable a thousand thoughts wandered loose in his head as he lay fully awake  what did it all mean what was the professors plan maybe they would never know maybe the ship was gone for good the old man had left forever shooting into outer space they might never find out why he had done it what purposeif anyhad been in his mind  kramer sat up in bed he turned on the light and lit a cigarette his quarters were small a metallined bunk room part of the moon station base  the old man had wanted to talk to him he had wanted to discuss things hold a conversation but in the hysteria and confusion all they had been able to think of was getting away the ship was rushing off with them carrying them into outer space kramer set his jaw could they be blamed for jumping they had no idea where they were being taken or why they were helpless caught in their own ship and the pursuit ship standing by waiting to pick them up was their only chance another half hour and it would have been too late  but what had the old man wanted to say what had he intended to tell him in those first confusing moments when the ship around them had come alive each metal strut and wire suddenly animate the body of a living creature a vast metal organism  it was weird unnerving he could not forget it even now he looked around the small room uneasily what did it signify the coming to life of metal and plastic all at once they had found themselves inside a living creature in its stomach like jonah inside the whale  it had been alive and it had talked to them talked calmly and rationally as it rushed them off faster and faster into outer space the wall speaker and circuit had become the vocal cords and mouth the wiring the spinal cord and nerves the hatches and relays and circuit breakers the muscles  they had been helpless completely helpless the ship had in a brief second stolen their power away from them and left them defenseless practically at its mercy it was not right it made him uneasy all his life he had controlled machines bent nature and the forces of nature to man and mans needs the human race had slowly evolved until it was in a position to operate things run them as it saw fit now all at once it had been plunged back down the ladder again prostrate before a power against which they were children  kramer got out of bed he put on his bathrobe and began to search for a cigarette while he was searching the vidphone rang  he snapped the vidphone on  yes  the face of the immediate monitor appeared a call from terra mr kramer an emergency call  emergency call for me put it through kramer came awake brushing his hair back out of his eyes alarm plucked at him  from the speaker a strange voice came philip kramer is this kramer  yes go on  this is general hospital new york city terra mr kramer your wife is here she has been critically injured in an accident your name was given to us to call is it possible for you to  how badly kramer gripped the vidphone stand is it serious  yes its serious mr kramer are you able to come here the quicker you can come the better  yes kramer nodded ill come thanks                                       the screen died as the connection was broken kramer waited a moment then he tapped the button the screen relit again yes sir the monitor said  can i get a ship to terra at once its an emergency my wife  theres no ship leaving the moon for eight hours youll have to wait until the next period  isnt there anything i can do  we can broadcast a general request to all ships passing through this area sometimes cruisers pass by here returning to terra for repairs  will you broadcast that for me ill come down to the field  yes sir but there may be no ship in the area for awhile its a gamble the screen died  kramer dressed quickly he put on his coat and hurried to the lift a moment later he was running across the general receiving lobby past the rows of vacant desks and conference tables at the door the sentries stepped aside and he went outside onto the great concrete steps  the face of the moon was in shadow below him the field stretched out in total darkness a black void endless without form he made his way carefully down the steps and along the ramp along the side of the field to the control tower a faint row of red lights showed him the way  two soldiers challenged him at the foot of the tower standing in the shadows their guns ready  kramer  yes a light was flashed in his face  your call has been sent out already  any luck kramer asked  theres a cruiser nearby that has made contact with us it has an injured jet and is moving slowly back toward terra away from the line  good kramer nodded a flood of relief rushing through him he lit a cigarette and gave one to each of the soldiers the soldiers lit up  sir one of them asked is it true about the experimental ship  what do you mean  it came to life and ran off  no not exactly kramer said it had a new type of control system instead of the johnson units it wasnt properly tested  but sir one of the cruisers that was there got up close to it and a buddy of mine says this ship acted funny he never saw anything like it it was like when he was fishing once on terra in washington state fishing for bass the fish were smart going this way and that  heres your cruiser the other soldier said look  an enormous vague shape was setting slowly down onto the field they could make nothing out but its row of tiny green blinkers kramer stared at the shape  better hurry sir the soldiers said they dont stick around here very long  thanks kramer loped across the field toward the black shape that rose up above him extended across the width of the field the ramp was down from the side of the cruiser and he caught hold of it the ramp rose and a moment later kramer was inside the hold of the ship the hatch slid shut behind him  as he made his way up the stairs to the main deck the turbines roared up from the moon out into space  kramer opened the door to the main deck he stopped suddenly staring around him in surprise there was nobody in sight the ship was deserted  good god he said realization swept over him numbing him he sat down on a bench his head swimming good god  the ship roared out into space leaving the moon and terra farther behind each moment  and there was nothing he could do                                       so it was you who put the call through he said at last it was you who called me on the vidphone not any hospital on terra it was all part of the plan he looked up and around him and dolores is really  your wife is fine the wall speaker above him said tonelessly it was a fraud i am sorry to trick you that way philip but it was all i could think of another day and you would have been back on terra i dont want to remain in this area any longer than necessary they have been so certain of finding me out in deep space that i have been able to stay here without too much danger but even the purloined letter was found eventually  kramer smoked his cigarette nervously what are you going to do where are we going  first i want to talk to you i have many things to discuss i was very disappointed when you left me along with the others i had hoped that you would remain the dry voice chuckled remember how we used to talk in the old days you and i that was a long time ago  the ship was gaining speed it plunged through space at tremendous speed rushing through the last of the defense zone and out beyond a rush of nausea made kramer bend over for a moment  when he straightened up the voice from the wall went on im sorry to step it up so quickly but we are still in danger another few moments and well be free  how about yuk ships arent they out here  ive already slipped away from several of them theyre quite curious about me  curious  they sense that im different more like their own organic mines they dont like it i believe they will begin to withdraw from this area soon apparently they dont want to get involved with me theyre an odd race philip i would have liked to study them closely try to learn something about them im of the opinion that they use no inert material all their equipment and instruments are alive in some form or other they dont construct or build at all the idea of making is foreign to them they utilize existing forms even their ships  where are we going kramer said i want to know where you are taking me  frankly im not certain  youre not certain  i havent worked some details out there are a few vague spots in my program still but i think that in a short while ill have them ironed out  what is your program kramer said  its really very simple but dont you want to come into the control room and sit the seats are much more comfortable than that metal bench  kramer went into the control room and sat down at the control board looking at the useless apparatus made him feel strange  whats the matter the speaker above the board rasped                                       kramer gestured helplessly impowerless i cant do anything and i dont like it do you blame me  no no i dont blame you but youll get your control back soon dont worry this is only a temporary expedient taking you off this way it was something i didnt contemplate i forgot that orders would be given out to shoot me on sight  it was gross idea  i dont doubt that my conception my plan came to me as soon as you began to describe your project that day at my house i saw at once that you were wrong you people have no understanding of the mind at all i realized that the transfer of a human brain from an organic body to a complex artificial space ship would not involve the loss of the intellectualization faculty of the mind when a man thinks he is  when i realized that i saw the possibility of an ageold dream becoming real i was quite elderly when i first met you philip even then my lifespan had come pretty much to its end i could look ahead to nothing but death and with it the extinction of all my ideas i had made no mark on the world none at all my students one by one passed from me into the world to take up jobs in the great research project the search for better and bigger weapons of war  the world has been fighting for a long time first with itself then with the martians then with these beings from proxima centauri whom we know nothing about the human society has evolved war as a cultural institution like the science of astronomy or mathematics war is a part of our lives a career a respected vocation bright alert young men and women move into it putting their shoulders to the wheel as they did in the time of nebuchadnezzar it has always been so  but is it innate in mankind i dont think so no social custom is innate there were many human groups that did not go to war the eskimos never grasped the idea at all and the american indians never took to it well  but these dissenters were wiped out and a cultural pattern was established that became the standard for the whole planet now it has become ingrained in us  but if someplace along the line some other way of settling problems had arisen and taken hold something different than the massing of men and material to  whats your plan kramer said i know the theory it was part of one of your lectures  yes buried in a lecture on plant selection as i recall when you came to me with this proposition i realized that perhaps my conception could be brought to life after all if my theory were right that war is only a habit not an instinct a society built up apart from terra with a minimum of cultural roots might develop differently if it failed to absorb our outlook if it could start out on another foot it might not arrive at the same point to which we have come a dead end with nothing but greater and greater wars in sight until nothing is left but ruin and destruction everywhere  of course there would have to be a watcher to guide the experiment at first a crisis would undoubtedly come very quickly probably in the second generation cain would arise almost at once  you see kramer i estimate that if i remain at rest most of the time on some small planet or moon i may be able to keep functioning for almost a hundred years that would be time enough sufficient to see the direction of the new colony after thatwell after that it would be up to the colony itself  which is just as well of course man must take control eventually on his own one hundred years and after that they will have control of their own destiny perhaps i am wrong perhaps war is more than a habit perhaps it is a law of the universe that things can only survive as groups by group violence  but im going ahead and taking the chance that it is only a habit that im right that war is something were so accustomed to that we dont realize it is a very unnatural thing now as to the place im still a little vague about that we must find the place still  thats what were doing now you and i are going to inspect a few systems off the beaten path planets where the trading prospects are low enough to keep terran ships away i know of one planet that might be a good place it was reported by the fairchild expedition in their original manual we may look into that for a start  the ship was silent                                       kramer sat for a time staring down at the metal floor under him the floor throbbed dully with the motion of the turbines at last he looked up  you might be right maybe our outlook is only a habit kramer got to his feet but i wonder if something has occurred to you  what is that  if its such a deeply ingrained habit going back thousands of years how are you going to get your colonists to make the break leave terra and terran customs how about this generation the first ones the people who found the colony i think youre right that the next generation would be free of all this if there were an he grinned an old man above to teach them something else instead  kramer looked up at the wall speaker how are you going to get the people to leave terra and come with you if by your own theory this generation cant be saved it all has to start with the next  the wall speaker was silent then it made a sound the faint dry chuckle  im surprised at you philip settlers can be found we wont need many just a few the speaker chuckled again ill acquaint you with my solution  at the far end of the corridor a door slid open there was sound a hesitant sound kramer turned  dolores  dolores kramer stood uncertainly looking into the control room she blinked in amazement phil what are you doing here whats going on  they stared at each other  whats happening dolores said i received a vidcall that you had been hurt in a lunar explosion  the wall speaker rasped into life you see philip that problem is already solved we dont really need so many people even a single couple might do  kramer nodded slowly i see he murmured thickly just one couple one man and woman  they might make it all right if there were someone to watch and see that things went as they should there will be quite a few things i can help you with philip quite a few well get along very well i think  kramer grinned wryly you could even help us name the animals he said i understand thats the first step  ill be glad to the toneless impersonal voice said as i recall my part will be to bring them to you one by one then you can do the actual naming  i dont understand dolores faltered what does he mean phil naming animals what kind of animals where are we going  kramer walked slowly over to the port and stood staring silently out his arms folded beyond the ship a myriad fragments of light gleamed countless coals glowing in the dark void stars suns systems endless without number a universe of worlds an infinity of planets waiting for them gleaming and winking from the darkness  he turned back away from the port where are we going he smiled at his wife standing nervous and frightened her large eyes full of alarm i dont know where we are going he said but somehow that doesnt seem too important right now im beginning to see the professors point its the result that counts  and for the first time in many months he put his arm around dolores at first she stiffened the fright and nervousness still in her eyes but then suddenly she relaxed against him and there were tears wetting her cheeks  phil  do you really think we can start over againyou and i  he kissed her tenderly then passionately  and the spaceship shot swiftly through the endless trackless eternity of the void
