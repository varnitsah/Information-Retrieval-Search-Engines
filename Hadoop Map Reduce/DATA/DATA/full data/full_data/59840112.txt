59840112	the movements and habits of climbing plants     preface    this essay first appeared in the ninth volume of the journal of the linnean society published in 1865  it is here reproduced in a corrected and i hope clearer form with some additional facts  the illustrations were drawn by my son george darwin  fritz muller after the publication of my paper sent to the linnean society journal vol ix p 344 some interesting observations on the climbing plants of south brazil to which i shall frequently refer recently two important memoirs chiefly on the difference in growth between the upper and lower sides of tendrils and on the mechanism of the movements of twiningplants by dr hugo de vries have appeared in the arbeiten des botanischen instituts in wurzburg heft iii 1873  these memoirs ought to be carefully studied by every one interested in the subject as i can here give only references to the more important points  this excellent observer as well as professor sachs 1 attributes all the movements of tendrils to rapid growth along one side but from reasons assigned towards the close of my fourth chapter i cannot persuade myself that this holds good with respect to those due to a touch  in order that the reader may know what points have interested me most i may call his attention to certain tendrilbearing plants for instance bignonia capreolata cobaea echinocystis and hanburya which display as beautiful adaptations as can be found in any part of the kingdom of nature  it is also an interesting fact that intermediate states between organs fitted for widely different functions may be observed on the same individual plant of corydalis claviculata and the common vine and these cases illustrate in a striking manner the principle of the gradual evolution of species    appendix to preface 1882    since the publication of this edition two papers by eminent botanists have appeared schwendener das winden der pflanzen monatsberichte der berliner akademie dec 1881 and j sachs notiz uber schlingpflanzen arbeiten des botanischen instituts in wurzburg bd ii p 719 1882  the view that the capacity of revolving on which most climbers depend is inherent though undeveloped in almost every plant in the vegetable kingdom climbing plants p 205 has been confirmed by the observations on circumnutation since given in the power of movement in plants    errata    on pp 28 32 40 53 statements are made with reference to the supposed acceleration of the revolving movement towards the light it appears from the observations given in the power of movement in plants p 451 that these conclusions were drawn from insufficient observations and are erroneous     the movements and habits of climbing plants     chapter itwining plants    introductory remarksdescription of the twining of the hoptorsion of the stemsnature of the revolving movement and manner of ascent stems not irritablerate of revolution in various plantsthickness of the support round which plants can twinespecies which revolve in an anomalous manner  i was led to this subject by an interesting but short paper by professor asa gray on the movements of the tendrils of some cucurbitaceous plants 2  my observations were more than half completed before i learnt that the surprising phenomenon of the spontaneous revolutions of the stems and tendrils of climbing plants had been long ago observed by palm and by hugo von mohl 3 and had subsequently been the subject of two memoirs by dutrochet 4 nevertheless i believe that my observations founded on the examination of above a hundred widely distinct living species contain sufficient novelty to justify me in publishing them  climbing plants may be divided into four classes  first those which twine spirally round a support and are not aided by any other movement  secondly those endowed with irritable organs which when they touch any object clasp it such organs consisting of modified leaves branches or flowerpeduncles  but these two classes sometimes graduate to a certain extent into one another  plants of the third class ascend merely by the aid of hooks and those of the fourth by rootlets but as in neither class do the plants exhibit any special movements they present little interest and generally when i speak of climbing plants i refer to the two first great classes   twining plants   this is the largest subdivision and is apparently the primordial and simplest condition of the class  my observations will be best given by taking a few special cases  when the shoot of a hop humulus lupulus rises from the ground the two or three firstformed joints or internodes are straight and remain stationary but the next formed whilst very young may be seen to bend to one side and to travel slowly round towards all points of the compass moving like the hands of a watch with the sun  the movement very soon acquires its full ordinary velocity  from seven observations made during august on shoots proceeding from a plant which had been cut down and on another plant during april the average rate during hot weather and during the day is 2 hrs 8 m for each revolution and none of the revolutions varied much from this rate  the revolving movement continues as long as the plant continues to grow but each separate internode as it becomes old ceases to move  to ascertain more precisely what amount of movement each internode underwent i kept a potted plant during the night and day in a wellwarmed room to which i was confined by illness  a long shoot projected beyond the upper end of the supporting stick and was steadily revolving  i then took a longer stick and tied up the shoot so that only a very young internode 175 of an inch in length was left free  this was so nearly upright that its revolution could not be easily observed but it certainly moved and the side of the internode which was at one time convex became concave which as we shall hereafter see is a sure sign of the revolving movement  i will assume that it made at least one revolution during the first twentyfour hours  early the next morning its position was marked and it made a second revolution in 9 hrs during the latter part of this revolution it moved much quicker and the third circle was performed in the evening in a little over 3 hrs  as on the succeeding morning i found that the shoot revolved in 2 hrs 45 m it must have made during the night four revolutions each at the average rate of a little over 3 hrs  i should add that the temperature of the room varied only a little the shoot had now grown 35 inches in length and carried at its extremity a young internode 1 inch in length which showed slight changes in its curvature  the next or ninth revolution was effected in 2 hrs 30 m  from this time forward the revolutions were easily observed  the thirtysixth revolution was performed at the usual rate so was the last or thirtyseventh but it was not completed for the internode suddenly became upright and after moving to the centre remained motionless  i tied a weight to its upper end so as to bow it slightly and thus detect any movement but there was none some time before the last revolution was half performed the lower part of the internode ceased to move  a few more remarks will complete all that need be said about this internode  it moved during five days but the more rapid movements after the performance of the third revolution lasted during three days and twenty hours  the regular revolutions from the ninth to thirtysixth inclusive were effected at the average rate of 2 hrs 31 m but the weather was cold and this affected the temperature of the room especially during the night and consequently retarded the rate of movement a little  there was only one irregular movement which consisted in the stem rapidly making after an unusually slow revolution only the segment of a circle  after the seventeenth revolution the internode had grown from 175 to 6 inches in length and carried an internode 1875 inch long which was just perceptibly moving and this carried a very minute ultimate internode  after the twentyfirst revolution the penultimate internode was 25 inches long and probably revolved in a period of about three hours  at the twentyseventh revolution the lower and still moving internode was 8375 the penultimate 35 and the ultimate 25 inches in length and the inclination of the whole shoot was such that a circle 19 inches in diameter was swept by it  when the movement ceased the lower internode was 9 inches and the penultimate 6 inches in length so that from the twentyseventh to thirtyseventh revolutions inclusive three internodes were at the same time revolving  the lower internode when it ceased revolving became upright and rigid but as the whole shoot was left to grow unsupported it became after a time bent into a nearly horizontal position the uppermost and growing internodes still revolving at the extremity but of course no longer round the old central point of the supporting stick from the changed position of the centre of gravity of the extremity as it revolved a slight and slow swaying movement was given to the long horizontally projecting shoot and this movement i at first thought was a spontaneous one  as the shoot grew it hung down more and more whilst the growing and revolving extremity turned itself up more and more  with the hop we have seen that three internodes were at the same time revolving and this was the case with most of the plants observed by me  with all if in full health two internodes revolved so that by the time the lower one ceased to revolve the one above was in full action with a terminal internode just commencing to move  with hoya carnosa on the other hand a depending shoot without any developed leaves 32 inches in length and consisting of seven internodes a minute terminal one an inch in length being counted continually but slowly swayed from side to side in a semicircular course with the extreme internodes making complete revolutions  this swaying movement was certainly due to the movement of the lower internodes which however had not force sufficient to swing the whole shoot round the central supporting stick  the case of another asclepiadaceous plant viz ceropegia gardnerii is worth briefly giving  i allowed the top to grow out almost horizontally to the length of 31 inches this now consisted of three long internodes terminated by two short ones  the whole revolved in a course opposed to the sun the reverse of that of the hop at rates between 5 hrs 15 m and 6 hrs 45 m for each revolution  the extreme tip thus made a circle of above 5 feet or 62 inches in diameter and 16 feet in circumference travelling at the rate of 32 or 33 inches per hour the weather being hot the plant was allowed to stand on my study table and it was an interesting spectacle to watch the long shoot sweeping this grand circle night and day in search of some object round which to twine  if we take hold of a growing sapling we can of course bend it to all sides in succession so as to make the tip describe a circle like that performed by the summit of a spontaneously revolving plant  by this movement the sapling is not in the least twisted round its own axis  i mention this because if a black point be painted on the bark on the side which is uppermost when the sapling is bent towards the holders body as the circle is described the black point gradually turns round and sinks to the lower side and comes up again when the circle is completed and this gives the false appearance of twisting which in the case of spontaneously revolving plants deceived me for a time  the appearance is the more deceitful because the axes of nearly all twiningplants are really twisted and they are twisted in the same direction with the spontaneous revolving movement  to give an instance the internode of the hop of which the history has been recorded was at first as could be seen by the ridges on its surface not in the least twisted but when after the 37th revolution it had grown 9 inches long and its revolving movement had ceased it had become twisted three times round its own axis in the line of the course of the sun on the other hand the common convolvulus which revolves in an opposite course to the hop becomes twisted in an opposite direction  hence it is not surprising that hugo von mohl p 105 108 c thought that the twisting of the axis caused the revolving movement but it is not possible that the twisting of the axis of the hop three times should have caused thirtyseven revolutions  moreover the revolving movement commenced in the young internode before any twisting of its axis could be detected  the internodes of a young siphomeris and lecontea revolved during several days but became twisted only once round their own axes  the best evidence however that the twisting does not cause the revolving movement is afforded by many leafclimbing and tendrilbearing plants as pisum sativum echinocystis lobata bignonia capreolata eccremocarpus scaber and with the leafclimbers solanum jasminoides and various species of clematis of which the internodes are not twisted but which as we shall hereafter see regularly perform revolving movements like those of true twiningplants  moreover according to palm pp 30 95 and mohl p 149 and leon 5 internodes may occasionally and even not very rarely be found which are twisted in an opposite direction to the other internodes on the same plant and to the course of their revolutions and this according to leon p 356 is the case with all the internodes of a certain variety of phaseolus multiflorus internodes which have become twisted round their own axes if they have not ceased to revolve are still capable of twining round a support as i have several times observed  mohl has remarked p 111 that when a stem twines round a smooth cylindrical stick it does not become twisted 6  accordingly i allowed kidneybeans to run up stretched string and up smooth rods of iron and glass onethird of an inch in diameter and they became twisted only in that degree which follows as a mechanical necessity from the spiral winding  the stems on the other hand which had ascended ordinary rough sticks were all more or less and generally much twisted  the influence of the roughness of the support in causing axial twisting was well seen in the stems which had twined up the glass rods for these rods were fixed into split sticks below and were secured above to cross sticks and the stems in passing these places became much twisted  as soon as the stems which had ascended the iron rods reached the summit and became free they also became twisted and this apparently occurred more quickly during windy than during calm weather  several other facts could be given showing that the axial twisting stands in some relation to inequalities in the support and likewise to the shoot revolving freely without any support  many plants which are not twiners become in some degree twisted round their own axes 7 but this occurs so much more generally and strongly with twiningplants than with other plants that there must be some connexion between the capacity for twining and axial twisting  the stem probably gains rigidity by being twisted on the same principle that a much twisted rope is stiffer than a slackly twisted one and is thus indirectly benefited so as to be enabled to pass over inequalities in its spiral ascent and to carry its own weight when allowed to revolve freely 8  i have alluded to the twisting which necessarily follows on mechanical principles from the spiral ascent of a stem namely one twist for each spire completed  this was well shown by painting straight lines on living stems and then allowing them to twine but as i shall have to recur to this subject under tendrils it may be here passed over  the revolving movement of a twining plant has been compared with that of the tip of a sapling moved round and round by the hand held some way down the stem but there is one important difference  the upper part of the sapling when thus moved remains straight but with twining plants every part of the revolving shoot has its own separate and independent movement  this is easily proved for when the lower half or twothirds of a long revolving shoot is tied to a stick the upper free part continues steadily revolving  even if the whole shoot except an inch or two of the extremity be tied up this part as i have seen in the case of the hop ceropegia convolvulus c goes on revolving but much more slowly for the internodes until they have grown to some little length always move slowly  if we look to the one two or several internodes of a revolving shoot they will be all seen to be more or less bowed either during the whole or during a large part of each revolution  now if a coloured streak be painted this was done with a large number of twining plants along we will say the convex surface the streak will after a time depending on the rate of revolution be found to be running laterally along one side of the bow then along the concave side then laterally on the opposite side and lastly again on the originally convex surface  this clearly proves that during the revolving movement the internodes become bowed in every direction the movement is in fact a continuous selfbowing of the whole shoot successively directed to all points of the compass and has been well designated by sachs as a revolving nutation  as this movement is rather difficult to understand it will be well to give an illustration  take a sapling and bend it to the south and paint a black line on the convex surface let the sapling spring up and bend it to the east and the black line will be seen to run along the lateral face fronting the north bend it to the north the black line will be on the concave surface bend it to the west the line will again be on the lateral face and when again bent to the south the line will be on the original convex surface  now instead of bending the sapling let us suppose that the cells along its northern surface from the base to the tip were to grow much more rapidly than on the three other sides the whole shoot would then necessarily be bowed to the south and let the longitudinal growing surface creep round the shoot deserting by slow degrees the northern side and encroaching on the western side and so round by the south by the east again to the north  in this case the shoot would remain always bowed with the painted line appearing on the several above specified surfaces and with the point of the shoot successively directed to each point of the compass  in fact we should have the exact kind of movement performed by the revolving shoots of twining plants 9  it must not be supposed that the revolving movement is as regular as that given in the above illustration in very many cases the tip describes an ellipse even a very narrow ellipse  to recur once again to our illustration if we suppose only the northern and southern surfaces of the sapling alternately to grow rapidly the summit would describe a simple arc if the growth first travelled a very little to the western face and during the return a very little to the eastern face a narrow ellipse would be described and the sapling would be straight as it passed to and fro through the intermediate space and a complete straightening of the shoot may often be observed in revolving plants  the movement is frequently such that three of the sides of the shoot seem to be growing in due order more rapidly than the remaining side so that a semicircle instead of a circle is described the shoot becoming straight and upright during half of its course  when a revolving shoot consists of several internodes the lower ones bend together at the same rate but one or two of the terminal ones bend at a slower rate hence though at times all the internodes are in the same direction at other times the shoot is rendered slightly serpentine  the rate of revolution of the whole shoot if judged by the movement of the extreme tip is thus at times accelerated or retarded  one other point must be noticed  authors have observed that the end of the shoot in many twining plants is completely hooked this is very general for instance with the asclepiadaceae the hooked tip in all the cases observed by me viz in ceropegia sphaerostemma clerodendron wistaria stephania akebia and siphomeris has exactly the same kind of movement as the other internodes for a line painted on the convex surface first becomes lateral and then concave but owing to the youth of these terminal internodes the reversal of the hook is a slower process than that of the revolving movement 10  this strongly marked tendency in the young terminal and flexible internodes to bend in a greater degree or more abruptly than the other internodes is of service to the plant for not only does the hook thus formed sometimes serve to catch a support but and this seems to be much more important it causes the extremity of the shoot to embrace the support much more closely than it could otherwise have done and thus aids in preventing the stem from being blown away during windy weather as i have many times observed  in lonicera brachypoda the hook only straightens itself periodically and never becomes reversed  i will not assert that the tips of all twining plants when hooked either reverse themselves or become periodically straight in the manner just described for the hooked form may in some cases be permanent and be due to the manner of growth of the species as with the tips of the shoots of the common vine and more plainly with those of cissus discolorplants which are not spiral twiners  the first purpose of the spontaneous revolving movement or more strictly speaking of the continuous bowing movement directed successively to all points of the compass is as mohl has remarked to favour the shoot finding a support  this is admirably effected by the revolutions carried on night and day a wider and wider circle being swept as the shoot increases in length  this movement likewise explains how the plants twine for when a revolving shoot meets with a support its motion is necessarily arrested at the point of contact but the free projecting part goes on revolving  as this continues higher and higher points are brought into contact with the support and are arrested and so onwards to the extremity and thus the shoot winds round its support  when the shoot follows the sun in its revolving course it winds round the support from right to left the support being supposed to stand in front of the beholder when the shoot revolves in an opposite direction the line of winding is reversed  as each internode loses from age its power of revolving it likewise loses its power of spirally twining  if a man swings a rope round his head and the end hits a stick it will coil round the stick according to the direction of the swinging movement so it is with a twining plant a line of growth travelling round the free part of the shoot causing it to bend towards the opposite side and this replaces the momentum of the free end of the rope  all the authors except palm and mohl who have discussed the spiral twining of plants maintain that such plants have a natural tendency to grow spirally  mohl believes p 112 that twining stems have a dull kind of irritability so that they bend towards any object which they touch but this is denied by palm  even before reading mohls interesting treatise this view seemed to me so probable that i tested it in every way that i could but always with a negative result  i rubbed many shoots much harder than is necessary to excite movement in any tendril or in the footstalk of any leaf climber but without any effect  i then tied a light forked twig to a shoot of a hop a ceropegia sphaerostemma and adhatoda so that the fork pressed on one side alone of the shoot and revolved with it i purposely selected some very slow revolvers as it seemed most likely that these would profit most from possessing irritability but in no case was any effect produced 11  moreover when a shoot winds round a support the winding movement is always slower as we shall immediately see than whilst it revolves freely and touches nothing hence i conclude that twining stems are not irritable and indeed it is not probable that they should be so as nature always economizes her means and irritability would have been superfluous nevertheless i do not wish to assert that they are never irritable for the growing axis of the leafclimbing but not spirally twining lophospermum scandens is certainly irritable but this case gives me confidence that ordinary twiners do not possess any such quality for directly after putting a stick to the lophopermum i saw that it behaved differently from a true twiner or any other leafclimber 12  the belief that twiners have a natural tendency to grow spirally probably arose from their assuming a spiral form when wound round a support and from the extremity even whilst remaining free sometimes assuming this form  the free internodes of vigorously growing plants when they cease to revolve become straight and show no tendency to be spiral but when a shoot has nearly ceased to grow or when the plant is unhealthy the extremity does occasionally become spiral  i have seen this in a remarkable manner with the ends of the shoots of the stauntonia and of the allied akebia which became wound up into a close spire just like a tendril and this was apt to occur after some small illformed leaves had perished  the explanation i believe is that in such cases the lower parts of the terminal internodes very gradually and successively lose their power of movement whilst the portions just above move onwards and in their turn become motionless and this ends in forming an irregular spire  when a revolving shoot strikes a stick it winds round it rather more slowly than it revolves  for instance a shoot of the ceropegia revolved in 6 hrs but took 9 hrs 30 m to make one complete spire round a stick aristolochia gigas revolved in about 5 hrs but took 9 hrs 15 m to complete its spire  this i presume is due to the continued disturbance of the impelling force by the arrestment of the movement at successive points and we shall hereafter see that even shaking a plant retards the revolving movement  the terminal internodes of a long muchinclined revolving shoot of the ceropegia after they had wound round a stick always slipped up it so as to render the spire more open than it was at first and this was probably in part due to the force which caused the revolutions being now almost freed from the constraint of gravity and allowed to act freely  with the wistaria on the other hand a long horizontal shoot wound itself at first into a very close spire which remained unchanged but subsequently as the shoot twined spirally up its support it made a much more open spire  with all the many plants which were allowed freely to ascend a support the terminal internodes made at first a close spire and this during windy weather served to keep the shoots in close contact with their support but as the penultimate internodes grew in length they pushed themselves up for a considerable space ascertained by coloured marks on the shoot and on the support round the stick and the spire became more open 13  it follows from this latter fact that the position occupied by each leaf with respect to the support depends on the growth of the internodes after they have become spirally wound round it  i mention this on account of an observation by palm p 34 who states that the opposite leaves of the hop always stand in a row exactly over one another on the same side of the supporting stick whatever its thickness may be  my sons visited a hopfield for me and reported that though they generally found the points of insertion of the leaves standing over each other for a space of two or three feet in height yet this never occurred up the whole length of the pole the points of insertion forming as might have been expected an irregular spire  any irregularity in the pole entirely destroyed the regularity of position of the leaves  from casual inspection it appeared to me that the opposite leaves of thunbergia alata were arranged in lines up the sticks round which they had twined accordingly i raised a dozen plants and gave them sticks of various thicknesses as well as string to twine round and in this case one alone out of the dozen had its leaves arranged in a perpendicular line  i conclude therefore palms statement is not quite accurate  the leaves of different twiningplants are arranged on the stem before it has twined alternately or oppositely or in a spire  in the latter case the line of insertion of the leaves and the course of the revolutions coincide  this fact has been well shown by dutrochet 14 who found different individuals of solanum dulcamara twining in opposite directions and these had their leaves in each case spirally arranged in the same direction  a dense whorl of many leaves would apparently be incommodious for a twining plant and some authors assert that none have their leaves thus arranged but a twining siphomeris has whorls of three leaves  if a stick which has arrested a revolving shoot but has not as yet been encircled be suddenly taken away the shoot generally springs forward showing that it was pressing with some force against the stick  after a shoot has wound round a stick if this be withdrawn it retains for a time its spiral form it then straightens itself and again commences to revolve  the long muchinclined shoot of the ceropegia previously alluded to offered some curious peculiarities the lower and older internodes which continued to revolve were incapable on repeated trials of twining round a thin stick showing that although the power of movement was retained this was not sufficient to enable the plant to twine  i then moved the stick to a greater distance so that it was struck by a point 25 inches from the extremity of the penultimate internode and it was then neatly encircled by this part of the penultimate and by the ultimate internode  after leaving the spirally wound shoot for eleven hours i quietly withdrew the stick and in the course of the day the curled portion straightened itself and recommenced revolving but the lower and not curled portion of the penultimate internode did not move a sort of hinge separating the moving and the motionless part of the same internode  after a few days however i found that this lower part had likewise recovered its revolving power  these several facts show that the power of movement is not immediately lost in the arrested portion of a revolving shoot and that after being temporarily lost it can be recovered  when a shoot has remained for a considerable time round a support it permanently retains its spiral form even when the support is removed  when a tall stick was placed so as to arrest the lower and rigid internodes of the ceropegia at the distance at first of 15 and then of 21 inches from the centre of revolution the straight shoot slowly and gradually slid up the stick so as to become more and more highly inclined but did not pass over the summit  then after an interval sufficient to have allowed of a semirevolution the shoot suddenly bounded from the stick and fell over to the opposite side or point of the compass and reassumed its previous slight inclination  it now recommenced revolving in its usual course so that after a semi revolution it again came into contact with the stick again slid up it and again bounded from it and fell over to the opposite side this movement of the shoot had a very odd appearance as if it were disgusted with its failure but was resolved to try again  we shall i think understand this movement by considering the former illustration of the sapling in which the growing surface was supposed to creep round from the northern by the western to the southern face and thence back again by the eastern to the northern face successively bowing the sapling in all directions  now with the ceropegia the stick being placed to the south of the shoot and in contact with it as soon as the circulatory growth reached the western surface no effect would be produced except that the shoot would be pressed firmly against the stick  but as soon as growth on the southern surface began the shoot would be slowly dragged with a sliding movement up the stick and then as soon as the eastern growth commenced the shoot would be drawn from the stick and its weight coinciding with the effects of the changed surface of growth would cause it suddenly to fall to the opposite side reassuming its previous slight inclination and the ordinary revolving movement would then go on as before  i have described this curious case with some care because it first led me to understand the order in which as i then thought the surfaces contracted but in which as we now know from sachs and ii de vries they grow for a time rapidly thus causing the shoot to bow towards the opposite side  the view just given further explains as i believe a fact observed by mohl p 135 namely that a revolving shoot though it will twine round an object as thin as a thread cannot do so round a thick support  i placed some long revolving shoots of a wistaria close to a post between 5 and 6 inches in diameter but though aided by me in many ways they could not wind round it  this apparently was due to the flexure of the shoot whilst winding round an object so gently curved as this post not being sufficient to hold the shoot to its place when the growing surface crept round to the opposite surface of the shoot so that it was withdrawn at each revolution from its support  when a free shoot has grown far beyond its support it sinks downwards from its weight as already explained in the case of the hop with the revolving extremity turned upwards  if the support be not lofty the shoot falls to the ground and resting there the extremity rises up  sometimes several shoots when flexible twine together into a cable and thus support one another  single thin depending shoots such as those of the sollya drummondii will turn abruptly backwards and wind up on themselves  the greater number of the depending shoots however of one twining plant the hibbertia dentata showed but little tendency to turn upwards  in other cases as with the cryptostegia grandiflora several internodes which were at first flexible and revolved if they did not succeed in twining round a support become quite rigid and supporting themselves upright carried on their summits the younger revolving internodes  here will be a convenient place to give a table showing the direction and rate of movement of several twining plants with a few appended remarks  these plants are arranged according to lindleys vegetable kingdom of 1853 and they have been selected from all parts of the series so as to show that all kinds behave in a nearly uniform manner 15   the rate of revolution of various twining plants  acotyledons  lygodium scandens

we see that the rate at which growth travels or circulates round the axis on which the revolving movement depends differs much  as long as a plant remains under the same conditions the rate is often remarkably uniform as with the hop mikania phaseolus c  the scyphanthus made one revolution in 1 hr 17 m and this is the quickest rate observed by me but we shall hereafter see a tendrilbearing passiflora revolving more rapidly  a shoot of the akebia quinata made a revolution in 1 hr 30 m and three revolutions at the average rate of 1 hr 38 m a convolvulus made two revolutions at the average of 1 hr 42 m and phaseolus vulgaris three at the average of 1 hr 57 m  on the other hand some plants take 24 hrs for a single revolution and the adhadota sometimes required 48 hrs yet this latter plant is an efficient twiner  species of the same genus move at different rates  the rate does not seem governed by the thickness of the shoots  those of the sollya are as thin and flexible as string but move more slowly than the thick and fleshy shoots of the ruscus which seem little fitted for movement of any kind  the shoots of the wistaria which become woody move faster than those of the herbaceous ipomoea or thunbergia  we know that the internodes whilst still very young do not acquire their proper rate of movement hence the several shoots on the same plant may sometimes be seen revolving at different rates  the two or three or even more internodes which are first formed above the cotyledons or above the rootstock of a perennial plant do not move they can support themselves and nothing superfluous is granted  a greater number of twiners revolve in a course opposed to that of the sun or to the hands of a watch than in the reversed course and consequently the majority as is well known ascend their supports from left to right  occasionally though rarely plants of the same order twine in opposite directions of which mohl p 125 gives a case in the leguminosae and we have in the table another in the acanthaceae  i have seen no instance of two species of the same genus twining in opposite directions and such cases must be rare but fritz muller 16 states that although mikania scandens twines as i have described from left to right another species in south brazil twines in an opposite direction  it would have been an anomalous circumstance if no such cases had occurred for different individuals of the same species namely of solanum dulcamara dutrochet tom xix p 299 revolve and twine in two directions this plant however is a most feeble twiner  loasa aurantiaca leon p 351 offers a much more curious case  i raised seventeen plants  of these eight revolved in opposition to the sun and ascended from left to right five followed the sun and ascended from right to left and four revolved and twined first in one direction and then reversed their course 17 the petioles of the opposite leaves affording a point dappui for the reversal of the spire  one of these four plants made seven spiral turns from right to left and five turns from left to right  another plant in the same family the scyphanthus elegans habitually twines in this same manner  i raised many plants of it and the stems of all took one turn or occasionally two or even three turns in one direction and then ascending for a short space straight reversed their course and took one or two turns in an opposite direction  the reversal of the curvature occurred at any point in the stem even in the middle of an internode  had i not seen this case i should have thought its occurrence most improbable  it would be hardly possible with any plant which ascended above a few feet in height or which lived in an exposed situation for the stem could be pulled away easily from its support with but little unwinding nor could it have adhered at all had not the internodes soon become moderately rigid  with leaf climbers as we shall soon see analogous cases frequently occur but these present no difficulty as the stem is secured by the clasping petioles  in the many other revolving and twining plants observed by me i never but twice saw the movement reversed once and only for a short space in ipomoea jucunda but frequently with hibbertia dentata this plant at first perplexed me much for i continually observed its long and flexible shoots evidently well fitted for twining make a whole or half or quarter circle in one direction and then in an opposite direction consequently when i placed the shoots near thin or thick sticks or perpendicularly stretched string they seemed as if constantly trying to ascend but always failed  i then surrounded the plant with a mass of branched twigs the shoots ascended and passed through them but several came out laterally and their depending extremities seldom turned upwards as is usual with twining plants  finally i surrounded a second plant with many thin upright sticks and placed it near the first one with twigs and now both had got what they liked for they twined up the parallel sticks sometimes winding round one and sometimes round several and the shoots travelled laterally from one to the other pot but as the plants grew older some of the shoots twined regularly up thin upright sticks  though the revolving movement was sometimes in one direction and sometimes in the other the twining was invariably from left to right 18 so that the more potent or persistent movement of revolution must have been in opposition to the course of the sun  it would appear that this hibbertia is adapted both to ascend by twining and to ramble laterally through the thick australian scrub  i have described the above case in some detail because as far as i have seen it is rare to find any special adaptations with twining plants in which respect they differ much from the more highly organized tendrilbearers  the solanum dulcamara as we shall presently see can twine only round stems which are both thin and flexible  most twining plants are adapted to ascend supports of moderate though of different thicknesses  our english twiners as far as i have seen never twine round trees excepting the honeysuckle lonicera periclymenum which i have observed twining up a young beechtree nearly 45 inches in diameter  mohl p 134 found that the phaseolus multiflorus and ipomoea purpurea could not when placed in a room with the light entering on one side twine round sticks between 3 and 4 inches in diameter for this interfered in a manner presently to be explained with the revolving movement in the open air however the phaseolus twined round a support of the above thickness but failed in twining round one 9 inches in diameter  nevertheless some twiners of the warmer temperate regions can manage this latter degree of thickness for i hear from dr hooker that at kew the ruscus androgynus has ascended a column 9 inches in diameter and although a wistaria grown by me in a small pot tried in vain for weeks to get round a post between 5 and 6 inches in thickness yet at kew a plant ascended a trunk above 6 inches in diameter  the tropical twiners on the other hand can ascend thicker trees i hear from drs thomson and hooker that this is the case with the butea parviflora one of the menispermaceae and with some dalbergias and other leguminosae 19  this power would be necessary for any species which had to ascend by twining the large trees of a tropical forest otherwise they would hardly ever be able to reach the light  in our temperate countries it would be injurious to the twining plants which die down every year if they were enabled to twine round trunks of trees for they could not grow tall enough in a single season to reach the summit and gain the light  by what means certain twining plants are adapted to ascend only thin stems whilst others can twine round thicker ones i do not know  it appeared to me probable that twining plants with very long revolving shoots would be able to ascend thick supports accordingly i placed ceropegia gardnerii near a post 6 inches in diameter but the shoots entirely failed to wind round it their great length and power of movement merely aid them in finding a distant stem round which to twine  the sphaerostemma marmoratum is a vigorous tropical twiner and as it is a very slow revolver i thought that this latter circumstance might help it in ascending a thick support but though it was able to wind round a 6inch post it could do this only on the same level or plane and did not form a spire and thus ascend  as ferns differ so much in structure from phanerogamic plants it may be worth while here to show that twining ferns do not differ in their habits from other twining plants  in lygodium articulatum the two internodes of the stem properly the rachis which are first formed above the rootstock do not move the third from the ground revolves but at first very slowly  this species is a slow revolver  but l scandens made five revolutions each at the average rate of 5 hrs 45 m and this represents fairly well the usual rate taking quick and slow movers amongst phanerogamic plants  the rate was accelerated by increased temperature  at each stage of growth only the two upper internodes revolved  a line painted along the convex surface of a revolving internode becomes first lateral then concave then lateral and ultimately again convex  neither the internodes nor the petioles are irritable when rubbed  the movement is in the usual direction namely in opposition to the course of the sun and when the stem twines round a thin stick it becomes twisted on its own axis in the same direction  after the young internodes have twined round a stick their continued growth causes them to slip a little upwards if the stick be soon removed they straighten themselves and recommence revolving  the extremities of the depending shoots turn upwards and twine on themselves  in all these respects we have complete identity with twining phanerogamic plants and the above enumeration may serve as a summary of the leading characteristics of all twining plants  the power of revolving depends on the general health and vigour of the plant as has been laboriously shown by palm  but the movement of each separate internode is so independent of the others that cutting off an upper one does not affect the revolutions of a lower one  when however dutrochet cut off two whole shoots of the hop and placed them in water the movement was greatly retarded for one revolved in 20 hrs and the other in 23 hrs whereas they ought to have revolved in between 2 hrs and 2 hrs 30 m  shoots of the kidneybean cut off and placed in water were similarly retarded but in a less degree  i have repeatedly observed that carrying a plant from the greenhouse to my room or from one part to another of the greenhouse always stopped the movement for a time hence i conclude that plants in a state of nature and growing in exposed situations would not make their revolutions during very stormy weather  a decrease in temperature always caused a considerable retardation in the rate of revolution but dutrochet tom xvii pp 994 996 has given such precise observations on this head with respect to the common pea that i need say nothing more  when twining plants are placed near a window in a room the light in some cases has a remarkable power as was likewise observed by dutrochet p 998 with the pea on the revolving movement but this differs in degree with different plants thus ipomoea jucunda made a complete circle in 5 hrs 30 m the semicircle from the light taking 4 hrs 80 m and that towards the light only 1 hr  lonicera brachypoda revolved in a reversed direction to the ipomoea in 8 hrs the semicircle from the light taking 5 hrs 23 m and that to the light only 2 hrs 37 m  from the rate of revolution in all the plants observed by me being nearly the same during the night and the day i infer that the action of the light is confined to retarding one semicircle and accelerating the other so as not to modify greatly the rate of the whole revolution  this action of the light is remarkable when we reflect how little the leaves are developed on the young and thin revolving internodes  it is all the more remarkable as botanists believe mohl p 119 that twining plants are but little sensitive to the action of light  i will conclude my account of twining plants by giving a few miscellaneous and curious cases  with most twining plants all the branches however many there may be go on revolving together but according to mohl p 4 only the lateral branches of tamus elephantipes twine and not the main stem  on the other hand with a climbing species of asparagus the leading shoot alone and not the branches revolved and twined but it should be stated that the plant was not growing vigorously  my plants of combretum argenteum and c purpureum made numerous short healthy shoots but they showed no signs of revolving and i could not conceive how these plants could be climbers but at last c argenteum put forth from the lower part of one of its main branches a thin shoot 5 or 6 feet in length differing greatly in appearance from the previous shoots owing to its leaves being little developed and this shoot revolved vigorously and twined  so that this plant produces shoots of two kinds  with periploca graeca palm p 43 the uppermost shoots alone twine polygonum convolvulus twines only during the middle of the summer palm p 43 94 and plants growing vigorously in the autumn show no inclination to climb  the majority of asclepiadaceae are twiners but asclepias nigra only in fertiliori solo incipit scandere subvolubili caule willdenow quoted and confirmed by palm p 41 asclepias vincetoxicum does not regularly twine but occasionally does so palm p 42 mohl p 112 when growing under certain conditions  so it is with two species of ceropegia as i hear from prof  harvey for these plants in their native dry south african home generally grow erect from 6 inches to 2 feet in heighta very few taller specimens showing some inclination to curve but when cultivated near dublin they regularly twined up sticks 5 or 6 feet in height  most convolvulaceae are excellent twiners but in south africa ipomoea argyraeoides almost always grows erect and compact from about 12 to 18 inches in height one specimen alone in prof harveys collection showing an evident disposition to twine  on the other hand seedlings raised near dublin twined up sticks above 8 feet in height  these facts are remarkable for there can hardly be a doubt that in the dryer provinces of south africa these plants have propagated themselves for thousands of generations in an erect condition and yet they have retained during this whole period the innate power of spontaneously revolving and twining whenever their shoots become elongated under proper conditions of life  most of the species of phaseolus are twiners but certain varieties of the p multiflorus produce leon p 681 two kinds of shoots some upright and thick and others thin and twining  i have seen striking instances of this curious case of variability in fulmers dwarf forcingbean which occasionally produced a single long twining shoot  solanum dulcamara is one of the feeblest and poorest of twiners  it may often be seen growing as an upright bush and when growing in the midst of a thicket merely scrambles up between the branches without twining but when according to dutrochet tom xix p 299 it grows near a thin and flexible support such as the stem of a nettle it twines round it  i placed sticks round several plants and vertically stretched strings close to others and the strings alone were ascended by twining  the stem twines indifferently to the right or left  some others species of solanum and of another genus viz habrothamnus belonging to the same family are described in horticultural works as twining plants but they seem to possess this faculty in a very feeble degree  we may suspect that the species of these two genera have as yet only partially acquired the habit of twining  on the other hand with tecoma radicans a member of a family abounding with twiners and tendrilbearers but which climbs like the ivy by the aid of rootlets we may suspect that a former habit of twining has been lost for the stem exhibited slight irregular movements which could hardly be accounted for by changes in the action of the light  there is no difficulty in understanding how a spirally twining plant could graduate into a simple rootclimber for the young internodes of bignonia tweedyana and of hoya carnosa revolve and twine but likewise emit rootlets which adhere to any fitting surface so that the loss of twining would be no great disadvantage and in some respects an advantage to these species as they would then ascend their supports in a more direct line 20    chapter iileafclimbers    plants which climb by the aid of spontaneously revolving and

petiolesfumariaadlumiaplants which climb by the aid of their produced midribsgloriosaflagellarianepenthessummary on leafclimbers  we now come to our second class of climbing plants namely those which ascend by the aid of irritable or sensitive organs  for convenience sake the plants in this class have been grouped under two subdivisions namely leafclimbers or those which retain their leaves in a functional condition and tendrilbearers  but these subdivisions graduate into each other as we shall see under corydalis and the gloriosa lily  it has long been observed that several plants climb by the aid of their leaves either by their petioles footstalks or by their produced midribs but beyond this simple fact they have not been described  palm and mohl class these plants with those which bear tendrils but as a leaf is generally a defined object the present classification though artificial has at least some advantages leafclimbers are moreover intermediate in many respects between twiners and tendrilbearers  eight species of clematis and seven of tropaeolum were observed in order to see what amount of difference in the manner of climbing existed within the same genus and the differences are considerable  clematisc glandulosathe thin upper internodes revolve moving against the course of the sun precisely like those of a true twiner at an average rate judging from three revolutions of 3 hrs 48 m the leading shoot immediately twined round a stick placed near it but after making an open spire of only one turn and a half it ascended for a short space straight and then reversed its course and wound two turns in an opposite direction  this was rendered possible by the straight piece between the opposed spires having become rigid the simple broad ovate leaves of this tropical species with their short thick petioles seem but illfitted for any movement and whilst twining up a vertical stick no use is made of them nevertheless if the footstalk of a young leaf be rubbed with a thin twig a few times on any side it will in the course of a few hours bend to that side afterwards becoming straight again  the under side seemed to be the most sensitive but the sensitiveness or irritability is slight compared to that which we shall meet with in some of the following species thus a loop of string weighing 164 grain 1062 mg and hanging for some days on a young footstalk produced a scarcely perceptible effect  a sketch is here given of two young leaves which had naturally caught hold of two thin branches  a forked twig placed so as to press lightly on the under side of a young footstalk caused it in 12 hrs to bend greatly and ultimately to such an extent that the leaf passed to the opposite side of the stem the forked stick having been removed the leaf slowly recovered its former position  the young leaves spontaneously and gradually change their position when first developed the petioles are upturned and parallel to the stem they then slowly bend downwards remaining for a short time at right angles to the stem and then become so much arched downwards that the blade of the leaf points to the ground with its tip curled inwards so that the whole petiole and leaf together form a hook they are thus enabled to catch hold of any twig with which they may be brought into contact by the revolving movement of the internodes if this does not happen they retain their hooked shape for a considerable time and then bending upwards reassume their original upturned position which is preserved ever afterwards  the petioles which have clasped any object soon become much thickened and strengthened as may be seen in the drawing  clematis montanathe long thin petioles of the leaves whilst young are sensitive and when lightly rubbed bend to the rubbed side subsequently becoming straight  they are far more sensitive than the petioles of c glandulosa for a loop of thread weighing a quarter of a grain 162 mg caused them to bend a loop weighing only oneeighth of a grain 81 mg sometimes acted and sometimes did not act  the sensitiveness extends from the blade of the leaf to the stem  i may here state that i ascertained in all cases the weights of the string and thread used by carefully weighing 50 inches in a chemical balance and then cutting off measured lengths  the main petiole carries three leaflets but their short subpetioles are not sensitive  a young inclined shoot the plant being in the greenhouse made a large circle opposed to the course of the sun in 4 hrs 20 m but the next day being very cold the time was 5 hrs 10 m  a stick placed near a revolving stem was soon struck by the petioles which stand out at right angles and the revolving movement was thus arrested  the petioles then began being excited by the contact to slowly wind round the stick  when the stick was thin a petiole sometimes wound twice round it  the opposite leaf was in no way affected  the attitude assumed by the stem after the petiole had clasped the stick was that of a man standing by a column who throws his arm horizontally round it  with respect to the stems power of twining some remarks will be made under c calycina  clematis sieboldia shoot made three revolutions against the sun at an average rate of 3 hrs 11 m  the power of twining is like that of the last species  its leaves are nearly similar in structure and in function excepting that the subpetioles of the lateral and terminal leaflets are sensitive  a loop of thread weighing oneeighth of a grain acted on the main petiole but not until two or three days had elapsed  the leaves have the remarkable habit of spontaneously revolving generally in vertical ellipses in the same manner but in a less degree as will be described under c microphylla  clematis calycinathe young shoots are thin and flexible  one revolved describing a broad oval in 5 hrs 30 m and another in 6 hrs 12 m  they followed the course of the sun but the course if observed long enough would probably be found to vary in this species as well as in all the others of the genus  it is a rather better twiner than the two last species  the stem sometimes made two spiral turns round a thin stick if free from twigs it then ran straight up for a space and reversing its course took one or two turns in an opposite direction  this reversal of the spire occurred in all the foregoing species  the leaves are so small compared with those of most of the other species that the petioles at first seem illadapted for clasping  nevertheless the main service of the revolving movement is to bring them into contact with surrounding objects which are slowly but securely seized  the young petioles which alone are sensitive have their ends bowed a little downwards so as to be in a slight degree hooked ultimately the whole leaf if it catches nothing becomes level  i gently rubbed with a thin twig the lower surfaces of two young petioles and in 2 hrs 30 m they were slightly curved downwards in 5 hrs after being rubbed the end of one was bent completely back parallel to the basal portion in 4 hrs subsequently it became nearly straight again  to show how sensitive the young petioles are i may mention that i just touched the under sides of two with a little watercolour which when dry formed an excessively thin and minute crust but this sufficed in 24 hrs to cause both to bend downwards  whilst the plant is young each leaf consists of three divided leaflets which barely have distinct petioles and these are not sensitive but when the plant is well grown the petioles of the two lateral and terminal leaflets are of considerable length and become sensitive so as to be capable of clasping an object in any direction  when a petiole has clasped a twig it undergoes some remarkable changes which may be observed with the other species but in a less strongly marked manner and will here be described once for all  the clasped petiole in the course of two or three days swells greatly and ultimately becomes nearly twice as thick as the opposite one which has clasped nothing  when thin transverse slices of the two are placed under the microscope their difference is conspicuous  the side of the petiole which has been in contact with the support is formed of a layer of colourless cells with their longer axes directed from the centre and these are very much larger than the corresponding cells in the opposite or unchanged petiole the central cells also are in some degree enlarged and the whole is much indurated  the exterior surface generally becomes bright red  but a far greater change takes place in the nature of the tissues than that which is visible  the petiole of the unclasped leaf is flexible and can be snapped easily whereas the clasped one acquires an extraordinary degree of toughness and rigidity so that considerable force is required to pull it into pieces  with this change great durability is probably acquired at least this is the case with the clasped petioles of clematis vitalba  the meaning of these changes is obvious namely that the petioles may firmly and durably support the stem  clematis microphylla var leptophyllathe long and thin internodes of this australian species revolve sometimes in one direction and sometimes in an opposite one describing long narrow irregular ellipses or large circles  four revolutions were completed within five minutes of the same average rate of 1 hr 51 m so that this species moves more quickly than the others of the genus  the shoots when placed near a vertical stick either twine round it or clasp it with the basal portions of their petioles  the leaves whilst young are nearly of the same shape as those of c viticella and act in the same manner like a hook as will be described under that species but the leaflets are more divided and each segment whilst young terminates in a hardish point which is much curved downwards and inwards so that the whole leaf readily catches hold of any neighbouring object  the petioles of the young terminal leaflets are acted on by loops of thread weighing 0125th and even 00625th of a grain  the basal portion of the main petiole is much less sensitive but will clasp a stick against which it presses  the leaves whilst young are continually and spontaneously moving slowly  a bellglass was placed over a shoot secured to a stick and the movements of the leaves were traced on it during several days  a very irregular line was generally formed but one day in the course of eight hours and three quarters the figure clearly represented three and a half irregular ellipses the most perfect one of which was completed in 2 hrs 35 m  the two opposite leaves moved independently of each other  this movement of the leaves would aid that of the internodes in bringing the petioles into contact with surrounding objects  i discovered this movement too late to be enabled to observe it in the other species but from analogy i can hardly doubt that the leaves of at least c viticella c flammula and c vitalba move spontaneously and judging from c sieboldi this probably is the case with c montana and c calycina  i ascertained that the simple leaves of c glandulosa exhibited no spontaneous revolving movement  clematis viticella var venosain this and the two following species the power of spirally twining is completely lost and this seems due to the lessened flexibility of the internodes and to the interference caused by the large size of the leaves  but the revolving movement though restricted is not lost  in our present species a young internode placed in front of a window made three narrow ellipses transversely to the direction of the light at an average rate of 2 hrs 40 m  when placed so that the movements were to and from the light the rate was greatly accelerated in one half of the course and retarded in the other as with twining plants the ellipses were small the longer diameter described by the apex of a shoot bearing a pair of not expanded leaves was only 4625 inches and that by the apex of the penultimate internode only 1125 inch  at the most favourable period of growth each leaf would hardly be carried to and fro by the movement of the internodes more than two or three inches but as above stated it is probable that the leaves themselves move spontaneously  the movement of the whole shoot by the wind and by its rapid growth would probably be almost equally efficient as these spontaneous movements in bringing the petioles into contact with surrounding objects  the leaves are of large size  each bears three pairs of lateral leaflets and a terminal one all supported on rather long sub petioles  the main petiole bends a little angularly downwards at each point where a pair of leaflets arises see fig 2 and the petiole of the terminal leaflet is bent downwards at right angles hence the whole petiole with its rectangularly bent extremity acts as a hook  this hook the lateral petioles being directed a little upwards forms an excellent grappling apparatus by which the leaves readily become entangled with surrounding objects  if they catch nothing the whole petiole ultimately grows straight  the main petiole the subpetioles and the three branches into which each basilateral subpetiole is generally subdivided are all sensitive the basal portion of the main petiole between the stem and the first pair of leaflets is less sensitive than the remainder it will however clasp a stick with which it is left in contact  the inferior surface of the rectangularly bent terminal portion carrying the terminal leaflet which forms the inner side of the end of the hook is the most sensitive part and this portion is manifestly best adapted to catch a distant support  to show the difference in sensibility i gently placed loops of string of the same weight in one instance weighing only 082 of a grain or 5314 mg on the several lateral subpetioles and on the terminal one in a few hours the latter was bent but after 24 hrs no effect was produced on the other subpetioles  again a terminal subpetiole placed in contact with a thin stick became sensibly curved in 45 m and in 1 hr 10m moved through ninety degrees whilst a lateral subpetiole did not become sensibly curved until 3 hrs 30 m had elapsed  in all cases if the sticks are taken away the petioles continue to move during many hours afterwards so they do after a slight rubbing but they become straight again after about a days interval that is if the flexure has not been very great or long continued  the graduated difference in the extension of the sensitiveness in the petioles of the abovedescribed species deserves notice  in c montana it is confined to the main petiole and has not spread to the subpetioles of the three leaflets so it is with young plants of c calycina but in older plants it spreads to the three subpetioles in c viticella the sensitiveness has spread to the petioles of the seven leaflets and to the subdivisions of the basilateral sub petioles  but in this latter species it has diminished in the basal part of the main petiole in which alone it resided in c montana whilst it has increased in the abruptly bent terminal portion  clematis flammulathe rather thick straight and stiff shoots whilst growing vigorously in the spring make small oval revolutions following the sun in their course  four were made at an average rate of 3 hrs 45 m  the longer axis of the oval described by the extreme tip was directed at right angles to the line joining the opposite leaves its length was in one case only 1375 and in another case 175 inch so that the young leaves were moved a very short distance  the shoots of the same plant observed in midsummer when growing not so quickly did not revolve at all  i cut down another plant in the early summer so that by august 1st it had formed new and moderately vigorous shoots these when observed under a bellglass were on some days quite stationary and on other days moved to and fro only about the eighth of an inch  consequently the revolving power is much enfeebled in this species and under unfavourable circumstances is completely lost  the shoot must depend for coming into contact with surrounding objects on the probable though not ascertained spontaneous movement of the leaves on rapid growth and on movement from the wind  hence perhaps it is that the petioles have acquired a high degree of sensitiveness as a compensation for the little power of movement in the shoots  the petioles are bowed downwards and have the same general hooklike form as in c viticella  the medial petiole and the lateral sub petioles are sensitive especially the much bent terminal portion as the sensitiveness is here greater than in any other species of the genus observed by me and is in itself remarkable i will give fuller details  the petioles when so young that they have not separated from one another are not sensitive when the lamina of a leaflet has grown to a quarter of an inch in length that is about onesixth of its full size the sensitiveness is highest but at this period the petioles are relatively much more fully developed than are the blades of the leaves  fullgrown petioles are not in the least sensitive a thin stick placed so as to press lightly against a petiole having a leaflet a quarter of an inch in length caused the petiole to bend in 3 hrs 15 m  in another case a petiole curled completely round a stick in 12 hrs these petioles were left curled for 24 hrs and the sticks were then removed but they never straightened themselves  i took a twig thinner than the petiole itself and with it lightly rubbed several petioles four times up and down these in 1 hr 45 m became slightly curled the curvature increased during some hours and then began to decrease but after 25 hrs from the time of rubbing a vestige of the curvature remained  some other petioles similarly rubbed twice that is once up and once down became perceptibly curved in about 2 hrs 30 m the terminal subpetiole moving more than the lateral subpetioles they all became straight again in between 12 hrs and 14 hrs  lastly a length of about oneeighth of an inch of a subpetiole was lightly rubbed with the same twig only once it became slightly curved in 3 hrs remaining so during 11 hrs but by the next morning was quite straight  the following observations are more precise  after trying heavier pieces of string and thread i placed a loop of fine string weighing 104 gr 674 mg on a terminal subpetiole  in 6 hrs 40 m a curvature could be seen in 24 hrs the petiole formed an open ring round the string in 48 hrs the ring had almost closed on the string and in 72 hrs seized it so firmly that some force was necessary for its withdrawal  a loop weighing 052 of a grain 337 mg caused in 14 hrs a lateral subpetiole just perceptibly to curve and in 24 hrs it moved through ninety degrees  these observations were made during the summer  the following were made in the spring when the petioles apparently are more sensitive a loop of thread weighing oneeighth of a grain 81 mg produced no effect on the lateral subpetioles but placed on a terminal one caused it after 24 hrs to curve moderately the curvature though the loop remained suspended was after 48 hrs diminished but never disappeared showing that the petiole had become partially accustomed to the insufficient stimulus  this experiment was twice repeated with nearly the same result  lastly a loop of thread weighing only onesixteenth of a grain 405 mg was twice gently placed by a forceps on a terminal subpetiole the plant being of course in a still and closed room and this weight certainly caused a flexure which very slowly increased until the petiole moved through nearly ninety degrees  beyond this it did not move nor did the petiole the loop remaining suspended ever become perfectly straight again  when we consider on the one hand the thickness and stiffness of the petioles and on the other hand the thinness and softness of fine cotton thread and what an extremely small weight onesixteenth of a grain 405 mg is these facts are remarkable  but i have reason to believe that even a less weight excites curvature when pressing over a broader surface than that acted on by a thread  having noticed that the end of a suspended string which accidentally touched a petiole caused it to bend i took two pieces of thin twine 10 inches in length weighing 164 gr and tying them to a stick let them hang as nearly perpendicularly downwards as their thinness and flexuous form after being stretched would permit i then quietly placed their ends so as just to rest on two petioles and these certainly became curved in 36 hrs one of the ends touched the angle between a terminal and lateral subpetiole and it was in 48 hours caught between them as by a forceps  in these cases the pressure though spread over a wider surface than that touched by the cotton thread must have been excessively slight  clematis vitalbathe plants were in pots and not healthy so that i dare not trust my observations which indicate much similarity in habits with c flammula  i mention this species only because i have seen many proofs that the petioles in a state of nature are excited to movement by very slight pressure  for instance i have found them embracing thin withered blades of grass the soft young leaves of a maple and the flowerpeduncles of the quakinggrass or briza  the latter are about as thick as the hair of a mans beard but they were completely surrounded and clasped  the petioles of a leaf so young that none of the leaflets were expanded had partially seized a twig those of almost all the old leaves even when unattached to any object are much convoluted but this is owing to their having come whilst young into contact during several hours with some object subsequently removed  with none of the abovedescribed species cultivated in pots and carefully observed was there any permanent bending of the petioles without the stimulus of contact  in winter the blades of the leaves of c vitalba drop off but the petioles as was observed by mohl remain attached to the branches sometimes during two seasons and being convoluted they curiously resemble true tendrils such as those possessed by the allied genus naravelia the petioles which have clasped some object become much more stiff hard and polished than those which have failed in this their proper function  tropaeolumi observed t tricolorum t azureum t pentaphyllum t peregrinum t elegans t tuberosum and a dwarf variety of as i believe t minus  tropaeolum tricolorum var grandiflorumthe flexible shoots which first rise from the tubers are as thin as fine twine  one such shoot revolved in a course opposed to the sun at an average rate judging from three revolutions of 1 hr 23 m but no doubt the direction of the revolving movement is variable  when the plants have grown tall and are branched all the many lateral shoots revolve  the stem whilst young twines regularly round a thin vertical stick and in one case i counted eight spiral turns in the same direction but when grown older the stem often runs straight up for a space and being arrested by the clasping petioles makes one or two spires in a reversed direction  until the plant grows to a height of two or three feet requiring about a month from the time when the first shoot appears above ground no true leaves are produced but in their place filaments coloured like the stem  the extremities of these filaments are pointed a little flattened and furrowed on the upper surface  they never become developed into leaves  as the plant grows in height new filaments are produced with slightly enlarged tips then others bearing on each side of the enlarged medial tip a rudimentary segment of a leaf soon other segments appear and at last a perfect leaf is formed with seven deep segments  so that on the same plant we may see every step from tendrillike clasping filaments to perfect leaves with clasping petioles  after the plant has grown to a considerable height and is secured to its support by the petioles of the true leaves the clasping filaments on the lower part of the stem wither and drop off so that they perform only a temporary service  these filaments or rudimentary leaves as well as the petioles of the perfect leaves whilst young are highly sensitive on all sides to a touch  the slightest rub caused them to curve towards the rubbed side in about three minutes and one bent itself into a ring in six minutes they subsequently became straight  when however they have once completely clasped a stick if this is removed they do not straighten themselves  the most remarkable fact and one which i have observed in no other species of the genus is that the filaments and the petioles of the young leaves if they catch no object after standing for some days in their original position spontaneously and slowly oscillate a little from side to side and then move towards the stem and clasp it  they likewise often become after a time in some degree spirally contracted  they therefore fully deserve to be called tendrils as they are used for climbing are sensitive to a touch move spontaneously and ultimately contract into a spire though an imperfect one  the present species would have been classed amongst the tendrilbearers had not these characters been confined to early youth  during maturity it is a true leafclimber  tropaeolum azureuman upper internode made four revolutions following the sun at an average rate of 1 hr 47 m  the stem twined spirally round a support in the same irregular manner as that of the last species  rudimentary leaves or filaments do not exist  the petioles of the young leaves are very sensitive  a single light rub with a twig caused one to move perceptibly in 5 m and another in 6 m  the former became bent at right angles in 15 min and became straight again in between 5 hrs and 6 hrs  a loop of thread weighing 0125th of a grain caused another petiole to curve  tropaeolum pentaphyllumthis species has not the power of spirally twining which seems due not so much to a want of flexibility in the stem as to continual interference from the clasping petioles  an upper internode made three revolutions following the sun at an average rate of 1 hr 46 m  the main purpose of the revolving movement in all the species of tropaeolum manifestly is to bring the petioles into contact with some supporting object  the petiole of a young leaf after a slight rub became curved in 6 m another on a cold day in 20 m and others in from 8 m to 10 m  their curvature usually increased greatly in from 15 m to 20 m and they became straight again in between 5 hrs and 6 hrs but on one occasion in 3 hrs  when a petiole has fairly clasped a stick it is not able on the removal of the stick to straighten itself  the free upper part of one the base of which had already clasped a stick still retained the power of movement  a loop of thread weighing 0125th of a grain caused a petiole to curve but the stimulus was not sufficient the loop remaining suspended to cause a permanent flexure  if a much heavier loop be placed in the angle between the petiole and the stem it produces no effect whereas we have seen with clematis montana that the angle between the stem and petiole is sensitive  tropaeolum peregrinumthe firstformed internodes of a young plant did not revolve resembling in this respect those of a twining plant in an older plant the four upper internodes made three irregular revolutions in a course opposed to the sun at an average rate of 1 hr 48 min  it is remarkable that the average rate of revolution taken however but from few observations is very nearly the same in this and the two last species namely 1 hr 47 m 1 hr 46 m and 1 hr 48 m  the present species cannot twine spirally which seems mainly due to the rigidity of the stem  in a very young plant which did not revolve the petioles were not sensitive  in older plants the petioles of quite young leaves and of leaves as much as an inch and a quarter in diameter are sensitive  a moderate rub caused one to curve in 10 m and others in 20 m  they became straight again in between 5 hrs 45m and 8 hrs  petioles which have naturally come into contact with a stick sometimes take two turns round it  after they have clasped a support they become rigid and hard  they are less sensitive to a weight than in the previous species for loops of string weighing 082 of a grain 5314 mg did not cause any curvature but a loop of double this weight 164 gr acted  tropaeolum elegansi did not make many observations on this species  the short and stiff internodes revolve irregularly describing small oval figures  one oval was completed in 3 hrs a young petiole when rubbed became slightly curved in 17 m and afterwards much more so  it was nearly straight again in 8 hrs  tropaeolum tuberosumon a plant nine inches in height the internodes did not move at all but on an older plant they moved irregularly and made small imperfect ovals  these movements could be detected only by being traced on a bellglass placed over the plant sometimes the shoots stood still for hours during some days they moved only in one direction in a crooked line on other days they made small irregular spires or circles one being completed in about 4 hrs  the extreme points reached by the apex of the shoot were only about one or one and a half inches asunder yet this slight movement brought the petioles into contact with some closely surrounding twigs which were then clasped  with the lessened power of spontaneously revolving compared with that of the previous species the sensitiveness of the petioles is also diminished  these when rubbed a few times did not become curved until half an hour had elapsed the curvature increased during the next two hours and then very slowly decreased so that they sometimes required 24 hrs to become straight again  extremely young leaves have active petioles one with the lamina only 015 of an inch in diameter that is about a twentieth of the full size firmly clasped a thin twig  but leaves grown to a quarter of their full size can likewise act  tropaeolum minus the internodes of a variety named dwarf crimson nasturtium did not revolve but moved in a rather irregular course during the day to the light and from the light at night  the petioles when well rubbed showed no power of curving nor could i see that they ever clasped any neighbouring object  we have seen in this genus a gradation from species such as t tricolorum which have extremely sensitive petioles and internodes which rapidly revolve and spirally twine up a support to other species such as t elegans and t tuberosum the petioles of which are much less sensitive and the internodes of which have very feeble revolving powers and cannot spirally twine round a support to this last species which has entirely lost or never acquired these faculties  from the general character of the genus the loss of power seems the more probable alternative  in the present species in t elegans and probably in others the flowerpeduncle as soon as the seedcapsule begins to swell spontaneously bends abruptly downwards and becomes somewhat convoluted  if a stick stands in the way it is to a certain extent clasped but as far as i have been able to observe this clasping movement is independent of the stimulus from contact  antirrhineaein this tribe lindley of the scrophulariaceae at least four of the seven included genera have leafclimbing species  maurandia barclayanaa thin slightly bowed shoot made two revolutions following the sun each in 3 hrs 17 min on the previous day this same shoot revolved in an opposite direction  the shoots do not twine spirally but climb excellently by the aid of their young and sensitive petioles  these petioles when lightly rubbed move after a considerable interval of time and subsequently become straight again  a loop of thread weighing 0125th of a grain caused them to bend  maurandia semperflorensthis freely growing species climbs exactly like the last by the aid of its sensitive petioles  a young internode made two circles each in 1 hr 46 mm so that it moved almost twice as rapidly as the last species  the internodes are not in the least sensitive to a touch or pressure  i mention this because they are sensitive in a closely allied genus namely lophospermum  the present species is unique in one respect  mohl asserts p 45 that the flowerpeduncles as well as the petioles wind like tendrils but he classes as tendrils such objects as the spiral flowerstalks of the vallisneria  this remark and the fact of the flowerpeduncles being decidedly flexuous led me carefully to examine them  they never act as true tendrils i repeatedly placed thin sticks in contact with young and old peduncles and i allowed nine vigorous plants to grow through an entangled mass of branches but in no one instance did they bend round any object  it is indeed in the highest degree improbable that this should occur for they are generally developed on branches which have already securely clasped a support by the petioles of their leaves and when borne on a free depending branch they are not produced by the terminal portion of the internode which alone has the power of revolving so that they could be brought only by accident into contact with any neighbouring object  nevertheless and this is the remarkable fact the flower peduncles whilst young exhibit feeble revolving powers and are slightly sensitive to a touch  having selected some stems which had firmly clasped a stick by their petioles and having placed a bell glass over them i traced the movements of the young flower peduncles  the tracing generally formed a short and extremely irregular line with little loops in its course  a young peduncle 15 inch in length was carefully observed during a whole day and it made four and a half narrow vertical irregular and short ellipses each at an average rate of about 2 hrs 25 m  an adjoining peduncle described during the same time similar though fewer ellipses  as the plant had occupied for some time exactly the same position these movements could not be attributed to any change in the action of the light  peduncles old enough for the coloured petals to be just visible do not move  with respect to irritability 21 i rubbed two young peduncles 15 inch in length a few times very lightly with a thin twig one was rubbed on the upper and the other on the lower side and they became in between 4 hrs and 5 hrs distinctly bowed towards these sides in 24 hrs subsequently they straightened themselves  next day they were rubbed on the opposite sides and they became perceptibly curved towards these sides  two other and younger peduncles threefourths of an inch in length were lightly rubbed on their adjoining sides and they became so much curved towards one another that the arcs of the bows stood at nearly right angles to their previous direction and this was the greatest movement seen by me  subsequently they straightened themselves other peduncles so young as to be only threetenths of an inch in length became curved when rubbed  on the other hand peduncles above 15 inch in length required to be rubbed two or three times and then became only just perceptibly bowed  loops of thread suspended on the peduncles produced no effect loops of string however weighing 082 and 164 of a grain sometimes caused a slight curvature but they were never closely clasped as were the far lighter loops of thread by the petioles  in the nine vigorous plants observed by me it is certain that neither the slight spontaneous movements nor the slight sensitiveness of the flowerpeduncles aided the plants in climbing  if any member of the scrophulariaceae had possessed tendrils produced by the modification of flowerpeduncles i should have thought that this species of maurandia had perhaps retained a useless or rudimentary vestige of a former habit but this view cannot be maintained  we may suspect that owing to the principle of correlation the power of movement has been transferred to the flowerpeduncles from the young internodes and sensitiveness from the young petioles  but to whatever cause these capacities are due the case is interesting for by a little increase in power through natural selection they might easily have been rendered as useful to the plant in climbing as are the flowerpeduncles hereafter to be described of vitis or cardiospermum  rhodochiton volubilea long flexible shoot swept a large circle following the sun in 5 hrs 30 m and as the day became warmer a second circle was completed in 4 hrs 10 m  the shoots sometimes make a whole or a half spire round a vertical stick they then run straight up for a space and afterwards turn spirally in an opposite direction  the petioles of very young leaves about onetenth of their full size are highly sensitive and bend towards the side which is touched but they do not move quickly  one was perceptibly curved in 1 hr 10 m after being lightly rubbed and became considerably curved in 5 hrs 40 m some others were scarcely curved in 5 hrs 30 m but distinctly so in 6 hrs 30 m  a curvature was perceptible in one petiole in between 4 hrs 30 m and 5 hrs after the suspension of a little loop of string  a loop of fine cotton thread weighing one sixteenth of a grain 405 mg not only caused a petiole slowly to bend but was ultimately so firmly clasped that it could be withdrawn only by some little force  the petioles when coming into contact with a stick take either a complete or half a turn round it and ultimately increase much in thickness  they do not possess the power of spontaneously revolving  lophospermum scandens var purpureumsome long moderately thin internodes made four revolutions at an average rate of 3 hrs 15 m the course pursued was very irregular namely an extremely narrow ellipse a large circle an irregular spire or a zigzag line and sometimes the apex stood still  the young petioles when brought by the revolving movement into contact with sticks clasped them and soon increased considerably in thickness  but they are not quite so sensitive to a weight as those of the rhodochiton for loops of thread weighing oneeighth of a grain did not always cause them to bend  this plant presents a case not observed by me in any other leaf climber or twiner 22 namely that the young internodes of the stem are sensitive to a touch  when a petiole of this species clasps a stick it draws the base of the internode against it and then the internode itself bends towards the stick which is caught between the stem and the petiole as by a pair of pincers  the internode afterwards straightens itself excepting the part in actual contact with the stick  young internodes alone are sensitive and these are sensitive on all sides along their whole length  i made fifteen trials by twice or thrice lightly rubbing with a thin twig several internodes and in about 2 hrs but in one case in 3 hrs all were bent  they became straight again in about 4 hrs afterwards  an internode which was rubbed as often as six or seven times became just perceptibly curved in 1 hr 15 m and in 3 hrs the curvature increased much it became straight again in the course of the succeeding night  i rubbed some internodes one day on one side and the next day either on the opposite side or at right angles to the first side and the curvature was always towards the rubbed side  according to palm p 63 the petioles of linaria cirrhosa and to a limited degree those of l elatine have the power of clasping a support  solanaceaesolanum jasminoidessome of the species in this large genus are twiners but the present species is a true leafclimber  a long nearly upright shoot made four revolutions moving against the sun very regularly at an average rate of 3 hrs 26 m  the shoots however sometimes stood still  it is considered a greenhouse plant but when kept there the petioles took several days to clasp a stick in the hothouse a stick was clasped in 7 hrs  in the greenhouse a petiole was not affected by a loop of string suspended during several days and weighing 25 grains 163 mg but in the hothouse one was made to curve by a loop weighing 164 gr 10627 mg and on the removal of the string it became straight again  another petiole was not at all acted on by a loop weighing only 082 of a grain 5314 mg we have seen that the petioles of some other leaf climbing plants are affected by onethirteenth of this latter weight in this species and in no other leafclimber seen by me a full grown leaf is capable of clasping a stick but in the greenhouse the movement was so extraordinarily slow that the act required several weeks on each succeeding week it was clear that the petiole had become more and more curved until at last it firmly clasped the stick  the flexible petiole of a half or a quarter grown leaf which has clasped an object for three or four days increases much in thickness and after several weeks becomes so wonderfully hard and rigid that it can hardly be removed from its support  on comparing a thin transverse slice of such a petiole with one from an older leaf growing close beneath which had not clasped anything its diameter was found to be fully doubled and its structure greatly changed  in two other petioles similarly compared and here represented the increase in diameter was not quite so great  in the section of the petiole in its ordinary state a we see a semilunar band of cellular tissue not well shown in the woodcut differing slightly in appearance from that outside it and including three closely approximate groups of dark vessels  near the upper surface of the petiole beneath two exterior ridges there are two other small circular groups of vessels  in the section of the petiole b which had clasped during several weeks a stick the two exterior ridges have become much less prominent and the two groups of woody vessels beneath them much increased in diameter  the semilunar band has been converted into a complete ring of very hard white woody tissue with lines radiating from the centre  the three groups of vessels which though near together were before distinct are now completely blended  the upper part of this ring of woody vessels formed by the prolongation of the horns of the original semilunar band is narrower than the lower part and slightly less compact  this petiole after clasping the stick had actually become thicker than the stem from which it arose and this was chiefly due to the increased thickness of the ring of wood  this ring presented both in a transverse and longitudinal section a closely similar structure to that of the stem  it is a singular morphological fact that the petiole should thus acquire a structure almost identically the same with that of the axis and it is a still more singular physiological fact that so great a change should have been induced by the mere act of clasping a support 23  fumariaceaefumaria officinalisit could not have been anticipated that so lowly a plant as this fumaria should have been a climber  it climbs by the aid of the main and lateral petioles of its compound leaves and even the muchflattened terminal portion of the petiole can seize a support  i have seen a substance as soft as a withered blade of grass caught  petioles which have clasped any object ultimately become rather thicker and more cylindrical  on lightly rubbing several petioles with a twig they became perceptibly curved in 1 hr 15 m and subsequently straightened themselves  a stick gently placed in the angle between two subpetioles excited them to move and was almost clasped in 9 hrs  a loop of thread weighing oneeighth of a grain caused after 12 hrs and before 20 hrs had elapsed a considerable curvature but it was never fairly clasped by the petiole  the young internodes are in continual movement which is considerable in extent but very irregular a zigzag line or a spire crossing itself or a figure of 8 being formed  the course during 12 hrs when traced on a bellglass apparently represented about four ellipses  the leaves themselves likewise move spontaneously the main petioles curving themselves in accordance with the movements of the internodes so that when the latter moved to one side the petioles moved to the same side then becoming straight reversed their curvature  the petioles however do not move over a wide space as could be seen when a shoot was securely tied to a stick  the leaf in this case followed an irregular course like that made by the internodes  adlumia cirrhosai raised some plants late in the summer they formed very fine leaves but threw up no central stem  the first formed leaves were not sensitive some of the later ones were so but only towards their extremities which were thus enabled to clasp sticks  this could be of no service to the plant as these leaves rose from the ground but it showed what the future character of the plant would have been had it grown tall enough to climb  the tip of one of these basal leaves whilst young described in 1 hr 36 m a narrow ellipse open at one end and exactly three inches in length a second ellipse was broader more irregular and shorter viz only 25 inches in length and was completed in 2 hrs 2 m  from the analogy of fumaria and corydalis i have no doubt that the internodes of adlumia have the power of revolving  corydalis claviculatathis plant is interesting from being in a condition so exactly intermediate between a leafclimber and a tendrilbearer that it might have been described under either head but for reasons hereafter assigned it has been classed amongst tendrilbearers  besides the plants already described bignonia unguis and its close allies though aided by tendrils have clasping petioles  according to mohl p 40 cocculus japonicus one of the menispermaceae and a fern the ophioglossum japonicum p 39 climb by their leafstalks   we now come to a small section of plants which climb by means of the produced midribs or tips of their leaves  liliaceaegloriosa plantiithe stem of a halfgrown plant continually moved generally describing an irregular spire but sometimes oval figures with the longer axes directed in different lines  it either followed the sun or moved in an opposite course and sometimes stood still before reversing its direction  one oval was completed in 3 hrs 40 m of two horseshoeshaped figures one was completed in 4 hrs 35 m and the other in 3 hrs  the shoots in their movements reached points between four and five inches asunder the young leaves when first developed stand up nearly vertically but by the growth of the axis and by the spontaneous bending down of the terminal half of the leaf they soon become much inclined and ultimately horizontal  the end of the leaf forms a narrow ribbon like thickened projection which at first is nearly straight but by the time the leaf gets into an inclined position the end bends downwards into a wellformed hook  this hook is now strong and rigid enough to catch any object and when caught to anchor the plant and stop the revolving movement  its inner surface is sensitive but not in nearly so high a degree as that of the many beforedescribed petioles for a loop of string weighing 164 grain produced no effect  when the hook has caught a thin twig or even a rigid fibre the point may be perceived in from 1 hr to 3 hrs to have curled a little inwards and under favourable circumstances it curls round and permanently seizes an object in from 8 hrs to 10 hrs  the hook when first formed before the leaf has bent downwards is but little sensitive  if it catches hold of nothing it remains open and sensitive for a long time ultimately the extremity spontaneously and slowly curls inwards and makes a buttonlike flat spiral coil at the end of the leaf  one leaf was watched and the hook remained open for thirtythree days but during the last week the tip had curled so much inwards that only a very thin twig could have been inserted within it  as soon as the tip has curled so much inwards that the hook is converted into a ring its sensibility is lost but as long as it remains open some sensibility is retained  whilst the plant was only about six inches in height the leaves four or five in number were broader than those subsequently produced their soft and but littleattenuated tips were not sensitive and did not form hooks nor did the stem then revolve  at this early period of growth the plant can support itself its climbing powers are not required and consequently are not developed so again the leaves on the summit of a fullgrown flowering plant which would not require to climb any higher were not sensitive and could not clasp a stick  we thus see how perfect is the economy of nature  commelynaceaeflagellaria indicafrom dried specimens it is manifest that this plant climbs exactly like the gloriosa  a young plant 12 inches in height and bearing fifteen leaves had not a single leaf as yet produced into a hook or tendrillike filament nor did the stem revolve  hence this plant acquires its climbing powers later in life than does the gloriosa lily  according to mohl p 41 uvularia melanthaceae also climbs like gloriosa  these three lastnamed genera are monocotyledons but there is one dicotyledon namely nepenthes which is ranked by mohl p 41 amongst tendrilbearers and i hear from dr hooker that most of the species climb well at kew  this is effected by the stalk or midrib between the leaf and the pitcher coiling round any support  the twisted part becomes thicker but i observed in mr veitchs hothouse that the stalk often takes a turn when not in contact with any object and that this twisted part is likewise thickened  two vigorous young plants of n laevis and n distillatoria in my hothouse whilst less than a foot in height showed no sensitiveness in their leaves and had no power of climbing  but when n laevis had grown to a height of 16 inches there were signs of these powers the young leaves when first formed stand upright but soon become inclined at this period they terminate in a stalk or filament with the pitcher at the extremity hardly at all developed  the leaves now exhibited slight spontaneous movements and when the terminal filaments came into contact with a stick they slowly bent round and firmly seized it  but owing to the subsequent growth of the leaf this filament became after a time quite slack though still remaining firmly coiled round the stick  hence it would appear that the chief use of the coiling at least whilst the plant is young is to support the pitcher with its load of secreted fluid   summary on leafclimbersplants belonging to eight families are known to have clasping petioles and plants belonging to four families climb by the tips of their leaves  in all the species observed by me with one exception the young internodes revolve more or less regularly in some cases as regularly as those of a twining plant  they revolve at various rates in most cases rather rapidly some few can ascend by spirally twining round a support  differently from most twiners there is a strong tendency in the same shoot to revolve first in one and then in an opposite direction  the object gained by the revolving movement is to bring the petioles or the tips of the leaves into contact with surrounding objects and without this aid the plant would be much less successful in climbing  with rare exceptions the petioles are sensitive only whilst young  they are sensitive on all sides but in different degrees in different plants and in some species of clematis the several parts of the same petiole differ much in sensitiveness  the hooked tips of the leaves of the gloriosa are sensitive only on their inner or inferior surfaces  the petioles are sensitive to a touch and to excessively slight continued pressure even from a loop of soft thread weighing only the one sixteenth of a grain 405 mg and there is reason to believe that the rather thick and stiff petioles of clematis flammula are sensitive to even much less weight if spread over a wide surface the petioles always bend towards the side which is pressed or touched at different rates in different species sometimes within a few minutes but generally after a much longer period  after temporary contact with any object the petiole continues to bend for a considerable time afterwards it slowly becomes straight again and can then react  a petiole excited by an extremely slight weight sometimes bends a little and then becomes accustomed to the stimulus and either bends no more or becomes straight again the weight still remaining suspended  petioles which have clasped an object for some little time cannot recover their original position after remaining clasped for two or three days they generally increase much in thickness either throughout their whole diameter or on one side alone they subsequently become stronger and more woody sometimes to a wonderful degree and in some cases they acquire an internal structure like that of the stem or axis  the young internodes of the lophospermum as well as the petioles are sensitive to a touch and by their combined movement seize an object the flowerpeduncles of the maurandia semperflorens revolve spontaneously and are sensitive to a touch yet are not used for climbing  the leaves of at least two and probably of most of the species of clematis of fumaria and adlumia spontaneously curve from side to side like the internodes and are thus better adapted to seize distant objects  the petioles of the perfect leaves of tropaeolum tricolorum as well as the tendrillike filaments of the plants whilst young ultimately move towards the stem or the supporting stick which they then clasp  these petioles and filaments also show some tendency to contract spirally  the tips of the uncaught leaves of the gloriosa as they grow old contract into a flat spire or helix  these several facts are interesting in relation to true tendrils  with leaf climbers as with twining plants the first internodes which rise from the ground do not at least in the cases observed by me spontaneously revolve nor are the petioles or tips of the first formed leaves sensitive  in certain species of clematis the large size of the leaves together with their habit of revolving and the extreme sensitiveness of their petioles appear to render the revolving movement of the internodes superfluous and this latter power has consequently become much enfeebled  in certain species of tropaeolum both the spontaneous movements of the internodes and the sensitiveness of the petioles have become much enfeebled and in one species have been completely

as being modified leaves flowerpeduncles c this would be an excellent scheme but i observe that botanists are by no means unanimous on the homological nature of certain tendrils consequently i will describe tendrilbearing plants by natural families following lindleys classification and this will in most cases keep those of the same nature together  the species to be described belong to ten families and will be given in the following order bignoniaceae polemoniaceae leguminosae compositae smilaceae fumariaceae cucurbitaceae vitaceae sapindaceae passifloraceae 25  bignoniaceaethis family contains many tendrilbearers some twiners and some rootclimbers  the tendrils always consist of modified leaves  nine species of bignonia selected by hazard are here described in order to show what diversity of structure and action there may be within the same genus and to show what remarkable powers some tendrils possess  the species taken together afford connecting links between twiners leafclimbers tendrilbearers and rootclimbers  bignonia an unnamed species from kew closely allied to b unguis but with smaller and rather broader leavesa young shoot from a cutdown plant made three revolutions against the sun at an average rate of 2 hrs 6m  the stem is thin and flexible it twined round a slender vertical stick ascending from left to right as perfectly and as regularly as any true twiningplant  when thus ascending it makes no use of its tendrils or petioles but when it twined round a rather thick stick and its petioles were brought into contact with it these curved round the stick showing that they have some degree of irritability  the petioles also exhibit a slight degree of spontaneous movement for in one case they certainly described minute irregular vertical ellipses  the tendrils apparently curve themselves spontaneously to the same side with the petioles but from various causes it was difficult to observe the movement of either the tendrils or petioles in this and the two following species  the tendrils are so closely similar in all respects to those of b unguis that one description will suffice  bignonia unguisthe young shoots revolve but less regularly and less quickly than those of the last species  the stem twines imperfectly round a vertical stick sometimes reversing its direction in the same manner as described in so many leafclimbers and this plant though possessing tendrils climbs to a certain extent like a leafclimber  each leaf consists of a petiole bearing a pair of leaflets and terminates in a tendril which is formed by the modification of three leaflets and closely resembles that above figured fig 5  but it is a little larger and in a young plant was about half an inch in length  it is curiously like the leg and foot of a small bird with the hind toe cut off  the straight leg or tarsus is longer than the three toes which are of equal length and diverging lie in the same plane  the toes terminate in sharp hard claws much curved downwards like those on a birds foot  the petiole of the leaf is sensitive to contact even a small loop of thread suspended for two days caused it to bend upwards but the sub petioles of the two lateral leaflets are not sensitive  the whole tendril namely the tarsus and the three toes are likewise sensitive to contact especially on their under surfaces  when a shoot grows in the midst of thin branches the tendrils are soon brought by the revolving movement of the internodes into contact with them and then one toe of the tendril or more commonly all three bend and after several hours seize fast hold of the twigs like a bird when perched  if the tarsus of the tendril comes into contact with a twig it goes on slowly bending until the whole foot is carried quite round and the toes pass on each side of the tarsus and seize it  in like manner if the petiole comes into contact with a twig it bends round carrying the tendril which then seizes its own petiole or that of the opposite leaf  the petioles move spontaneously and thus when a shoot attempts to twine round an upright stick those on both sides after a time come into contact with it and are excited to bend  ultimately the two petioles clasp the stick in opposite directions and the footlike tendrils seizing on each other or on their own petioles fasten the stem to the support with surprising security  the tendrils are thus brought into action if the stem twines round a thin vertical stick and in this respect the present species differs from the last  both species use their tendrils in the same manner when passing through a thicket this plant is one of the most efficient climbers which i have observed and it probably could ascend a polished stem incessantly tossed by heavy storms  to show how important vigorous health is for the action of all the parts i may mention that when i first examined a plant which was growing moderately well though not vigorously i concluded that the tendrils acted only like the hooks on a bramble and that it was the most feeble and inefficient of all climbers  bignonia tweedyanathis species is closely allied to the last and behaves in the same manner but perhaps twines rather better round a vertical stick  on the same plant one branch twined in one direction and another in an opposite direction  the internodes in one case made two circles each in 2 hrs 33 m  i was enabled to observe the spontaneous movements of the petioles better in this than in the two preceding species  one petiole described three small vertical ellipses in the course of 11 hrs whilst another moved in an irregular spire  some little time after a stem has twined round an upright stick and is securely fastened to it by the clasping petioles and tendrils it emits aerial roots from the bases of its leaves and these roots curve partly round and adhere to the stick this species of bignonia therefore combines four different methods of climbing generally characteristic of distinct plants namely twining leafclimbing tendrilclimbing and rootclimbing  in the three foregoing species when the footlike tendril has caught an object it continues to grow and thicken and ultimately becomes wonderfully strong in the same manner as the petioles of leaf climbers  if the tendril catches nothing it first slowly bends downwards and then its power of clasping is lost  very soon afterwards it disarticulates itself from the petiole and drops off like a leaf in autumn  i have seen this process of disarticulation in no other tendrils for these when they fail to catch an object merely wither away  bignonia venustathe tendrils differ considerably from those of the previous species  the lower part or tarsus is four times as long as the three toes these are of equal length and diverge equally but do not lie in the same plane their tips are bluntly hooked and the whole tendril makes an excellent grapnel  the tarsus is sensitive on all sides but the three toes are sensitive only on their outer surfaces  the sensitiveness is not much developed for a slight rubbing with a twig did not cause the tarsus or the toes to become curved until an hour had elapsed and then only in a slight degree subsequently they straightened themselves  both the tarsus and toes can seize well hold of sticks  if the stem is secured the tendrils are seen spontaneously to sweep large ellipses the two opposite tendrils moving independently of one another  i have no doubt from the analogy of the two following allied species that the petioles also move spontaneously but they are not irritable like those of b unguis and b tweedyana  the young internodes sweep large circles one being completed in 2 hrs 15 m and a second in 2 hrs 55 m  by these combined movements of the internodes petioles and grapnel like tendrils the latter are soon brought into contact with surrounding objects  when a shoot stands near an upright stick it twines regularly and spirally round it  as it ascends it seizes the stick with one of its tendrils and if the stick be thin the right and lefthand tendrils are alternately used  this alternation follows from the stem necessarily taking one twist round its own axis for each completed circle  the tendrils contract spirally a short time after catching any object those which catch nothing merely bend slowly downwards  but the whole subject of the spiral contraction of tendrils will be discussed after all the tendrilbearing species have been described  bignonia littoralisthe young internodes revolve in large ellipses an internode bearing immature tendrils made two revolutions each in 3 hrs 50 m but when grown older with the tendrils mature it made two ellipses each at the rate of 2 hrs 44 m  this species unlike the preceding is incapable of twining round a stick  this does not appear to be due to any want of flexibility in the internodes or to the action of the tendrils and certainly not to any want of the revolving power nor can i account for the fact  nevertheless the plant readily ascends a thin upright stick by seizing a point above with its two opposite tendrils which then contract spirally  if the tendrils seize nothing they do not become spiral  the species last described ascended a vertical stick by twining spirally and by seizing it alternately with its opposite tendrils like a sailor pulling himself up a rope hand over hand the present species pulls itself up like a sailor seizing with both hands together a rope above his head  the tendrils are similar in structure to those of the last species they continue growing for some time even after they have clasped an object  when fully grown though borne by a young plant they are 9 inches in length  the three divergent toes are shorter relatively to the tarsus than in the former species they are blunt at their tips and but slightly hooked they are not quite equal in length the middle one being rather longer than the others  their outer surfaces are highly sensitive for when lightly rubbed with a twig they became perceptibly curved in 4 m and greatly curved in 7 m  in 7 hrs they became straight again and were ready to react  the tarsus for the space of one inch close to the toes is sensitive but in a rather less degree than the toes for the latter after a slight rubbing became curved in about half the time  even the middle part of the tarsus is sensitive to prolonged contact as soon as the tendril has arrived at maturity  after it has grown old the sensitiveness is confined to the toes and these are only able to curl very slowly round a stick  a tendril is perfectly ready to act as soon as the three toes have diverged and at this period their outer surfaces first become irritable  the irritability spreads but little from one part when excited to another  thus when a stick was caught by the part immediately beneath the three toes these seldom clasped it but remained sticking straight out  the tendrils revolve spontaneously  the movement begins before the tendril is converted into a threepronged grapnel by the divergence of the toes and before any part has become sensitive so that the revolving movement is useless at this early period  the movement is also now slow two ellipses being completed conjointly in 24 hrs 18 m  a mature tendril made an ellipse in 6 hrs so that it moved much more slowly than the internodes  the ellipses which were swept both in a vertical and horizontal plane were of large size  the petioles are not in the least sensitive but revolve like the tendrils  we thus see that the young internodes the petioles and the tendrils all continue revolving together but at different rates  the movements of the tendrils which rise opposite one another are quite independent  hence when the whole shoot is allowed freely to revolve nothing can be more intricate than the course followed by the extremity of each tendril  a wide space is thus irregularly searched for some object to be grasped  one other curious point remains to be mentioned  in the course of a few days after the toes have closely clasped a stick their blunt extremities become developed though not invariably into irregular disclike balls which have the power of adhering firmly to the wood as similar cellular outgrowths will be fully described under b capreolata i will here say nothing more about them  bignonia aequinoctialis var chamberlayniithe internodes the elongated nonsensitive petioles and the tendrils all revolve  the stem does not twine but ascends a vertical stick in the same manner as the last species  the tendrils also resemble those of the last species but are shorter the three toes are more unequal in length the two outer ones being about onethird shorter and rather thinner than the middle toe but they vary in this respect  they terminate in small hard points and what is important cellular adhesive discs are not developed  the reduced size of two of the toes as well as their lessened sensitiveness seem to indicate a tendency to abortion and on one of my plants the firstformed tendrils were sometimes simple that is were not divided into three toes  we are thus naturally led to the three following species with undivided tendrils  bignonia speciosathe young shoots revolve irregularly making narrow ellipses spires or circles at rates varying from 3 hrs 30 m to 4 hrs 40 m but they show no tendency to twine  whilst the plant is young and does not require a support tendrils are not developed  those borne by a moderately young plant were five inches in length  they revolve spontaneously as do the short and non sensitive petioles  when rubbed they slowly bend to the rubbed side and subsequently straighten themselves but they are not highly sensitive  there is something strange in their behaviour  i repeatedly placed close to them thick and thin rough and smooth sticks and posts as well as string suspended vertically but none of these objects were well seized  after clasping an upright stick they repeatedly loosed it again and often would not seize it at all or their extremities did not coil closely round  i have observed hundreds of tendrils belonging to various cucurbitaceous passifloraceous and leguminous plants and never saw one behave in this manner  when however my plant had grown to a height of eight or nine feet the tendrils acted much better  they now seized a thin upright stick horizontally that is at a point on their own level and not some way up the stick as in the case of all the previous species  nevertheless the nontwining stem was enabled by this means to ascend the stick  the extremity of the tendril is almost straight and sharp  the whole terminal portion exhibits a singular habit which in an animal would be called an instinct for it continually searches for any little crevice or hole into which to insert itself  i had two young plants and after having observed this habit i placed near them posts which had been bored by beetles or had become fissured by drying the tendrils by their own movement and by that of the internodes slowly travelled over the surface of the wood and when the apex came to a hole or fissure it inserted itself in order to effect this the extremity for a length of half or quarter of an inch would often bend itself at right angles to the basal part  i have watched this process between twenty and thirty times  the same tendril would frequently withdraw from one hole and insert its point into a second hole  i have also seen a tendril keep its point in one case for 20 hrs and in another for 36 hrs in a minute hole and then withdraw it  whilst the point is thus temporarily inserted the opposite tendril goes on revolving  the whole length of a tendril often fits itself closely to any surface of wood with which it has come into contact and i have observed one bent at right angles from having entered a wide and deep fissure with its apex abruptly rebent and inserted into a minute lateral hole  after a tendril has clasped a stick it contracts spirally if it remains unattached it hangs straight downwards  if it has merely adapted itself to the inequalities of a thick post though it has clasped nothing or if it has inserted its apex into some little fissure this stimulus suffices to induce spiral contraction but the contraction always draws the tendril away from the post  so that in every case these movements which seem so nicely adapted for some purpose were useless  on one occasion however the tip became permanently jammed into a narrow fissure  i fully expected from the analogy of b capreolata and b littoralis that the tips would have been developed into adhesive discs but i could never detect even a trace of this process  there is therefore at present something unintelligible about the habits of this plant  bignonia pictathis species closely resembles the last in the structure and movements of its tendrils  i also casually examined a fine growing plant of the allied b lindleyi and this apparently behaved in all respects in the same manner  bignonia capreolatawe now come to a species having tendrils of a different type but first for the internodes  a young shoot made three large revolutions following the sun at an average rate of 2 hrs 23 m  the stem is thin and flexible and i have seen one make four regular spiral turns round a thin upright stick ascending of course from right to left and therefore in a reversed direction compared with the before described species  afterwards from the interference of the tendrils it ascended either straight up the stick or in an irregular spire  the tendrils are in some respects highly remarkable  in a young plant they were about 25 inches in length and much branched the five chief branches apparently representing two pairs of leaflets and a terminal one  each branch is however bifid or more commonly trifid towards the extremity with the points blunt yet distinctly hooked  a tendril bends to any side which is lightly rubbed and subsequently becomes straight again but a loop of thread weighing 025th of a grain produced no effect  on two occasions the terminal branches became slightly curved in 10 m after they had touched a stick and in 30 m the tips were curled quite round it  the basal part is less sensitive  the tendrils revolved in an apparently capricious manner sometimes very slightly or not at all at other times they described large regular ellipses  i could detect no spontaneous movement in the petioles of the leaves  whilst the tendrils are revolving more or less regularly another remarkable movement takes place namely a slow inclination from the light towards the darkest side of the house  i repeatedly changed the position of my plants and some little time after the revolving movement had ceased the successively formed tendrils always ended by pointing to the darkest side  when i placed a thick post near a tendril between it and the light the tendril pointed in that direction  in two instances a pair of leaves stood so that one of the two tendrils was directed towards the light and the other to the darkest side of the house the latter did not move but the opposite one bent itself first upwards and then right over its fellow so that the two became parallel one above the other both pointing to the dark  i then turned the plant half round and the tendril which had turned over recovered its original position and the opposite one which had not before moved now turned over to the dark side lastly on another plant three pairs of tendrils were produced at the same time by three shoots and all happened to be differently directed  i placed the pot in a box open only on one side and obliquely facing the light in two days all six tendrils pointed with unerring truth to the darkest corner of the box though to do this each had to bend in a different manner  six windvanes could not have more truly shown the direction of the wind than did these branched tendrils the course of the stream of light which entered the box  i left these tendrils undisturbed for above 24 hrs and then turned the pot half round but they had now lost their power of movement and could not any longer avoid the light  when a tendril has not succeeded in clasping a support either through its own revolving movement or that of the shoot or by turning towards any object which intercepts the light it bends vertically downwards and then towards its own stem which it seizes together with the supporting stick if there be one  a little aid is thus given in keeping the stem secure  if the tendril seizes nothing it does not contract spirally but soon withers away and drops off  if it seizes an object all the branches contract spirally  i have stated that after a tendril has come into contact with a stick it bends round it in about half an hour but i repeatedly observed as in the case of b speciosa and its allies that it often again loosed the stick sometimes seizing and loosing the same stick three or four times  knowing that the tendrils avoided the light i gave them a glass tube blackened within and a wellblackened zinc plate  the branches curled round the tube and abruptly bent themselves round the edges of the zinc plate but they soon recoiled from these objects with what i can only call disgust and straightened themselves  i then placed a post with extremely rugged bark close to a pair of tendrils twice they touched it for an hour or two and twice they withdrew at last one of the hooked extremities curled round and firmly seized an excessively minute projecting point of bark and then the other branches spread themselves out following with accuracy every inequality of the surface  i afterwards placed near the plant a post without bark but much fissured and the points of the tendrils crawled into all the crevices in a beautiful manner  to my surprise i observed that the tips of the immature tendrils with the branches not yet fully separated likewise crawled just like roots into the minutest crevices  in two or three days after the tips had thus crawled into the crevices or after their hooked ends had seized minute points the final process now to be described commenced  this process i discovered by having accidentally left a piece of wool near a tendril and this led me to bind a quantity of flax moss and wool loosely round sticks and to place them near tendrils  the wool must not be dyed for these tendrils are excessively sensitive to some poisons  the hooked points soon caught hold of the fibres even loosely floating fibres and now there was no recoiling on the contrary the excitement caused the hooks to penetrate the fibrous mass and to curl inwards so that each hook caught firmly one or two fibres or a small bundle of them  the tips and the inner surfaces of the hooks now began to swell and in two or three days were visibly enlarged  after a few more days the hooks were converted into whitish irregular balls rather above the 005th of an inch 127 mm in diameter formed of coarse cellular tissue which sometimes wholly enveloped and concealed the hooks themselves  the surfaces of these balls secrete some viscid resinous matter to which the fibres of the flax c adhere  when a fibre has become fastened to the surface the cellular tissue does not grow directly beneath it but continues to grow closely on each side so that when several adjoining fibres though excessively thin were caught so many crests of cellular matter each not as thick as a human hair grew up between them and these arching over on both sides adhered firmly together  as the whole surface of the ball continues to grow fresh fibres adhere and are afterwards enveloped so that i have seen a little ball with between fifty and sixty fibres of flax crossing it at various angles and all embedded more or less deeply  every gradation in the process could be followedsome fibres merely sticking to the surface others lying in more or less deep furrows or deeply embedded or passing through the very centre of the cellular ball  the embedded fibres are so closely clasped that they cannot be withdrawn  the outgrowing tissue has so strong a tendency to unite that two balls produced by distinct tendrils sometimes unite and grow into a single one  on one occasion when a tendril had curled round a stick half an inch in diameter an adhesive disc was formed but this does not generally occur in the case of smooth sticks or posts  if however the tip catches a minute projecting point the other branches form discs especially if they find crevices to crawl into  the tendrils failed to attach themselves to a brick wall  i infer from the adherence of the fibres to the discs or balls that these secrete some resinous adhesive matter and more especially from such fibres becoming loose if immersed in sulphuric ether  this fluid likewise removes small brown glistening points which can generally be seen on the surfaces of the older discs  if the hooked extremities of the tendrils do not touch anything discs as far as i have seen are never formed 26 but temporary contact during a moderate time suffices to cause their development  i have seen eight discs formed on the same tendril  after their development the tendrils contract spirally and become woody and very strong  a tendril in this state supported nearly seven ounces and would apparently have supported a considerably greater weight had not the fibres of flax to which the discs were attached yielded  from the facts now given we may infer that though the tendrils of this bignonia can occasionally adhere to smooth cylindrical sticks and often to rugged bark yet that they are specially adapted to climb trees clothed with lichens mosses or other such productions and i hear from professor asa gray that the polypodium incanum abounds on the foresttrees in the districts of north america where this species of bignonia grows  finally i may remark how singular a fact it is that a leaf should be metamorphosed into a branched organ which turns from the light and which can by its extremities either crawl like roots into crevices or seize hold of minute projecting points these extremities afterwards forming cellular outgrowths which secrete an adhesive cement and then envelop by their continued growth the finest fibres  eccremocarpus scaber bignoniaceaeplants though growing pretty well in my greenhouse showed no spontaneous movements in their shoots or tendrils but when removed to the hothouse the young internodes revolved at rates varying from 3 hrs 15 m to 1 hr 13 m one large circle was swept at this latter unusually quick rate but generally the circles or ellipses were small and sometimes the course pursued was quite irregular  an internode after making several revolutions sometimes stood still for 12 hrs or 18 hrs and then recommenced revolving  such strongly marked interruptions in the movements of the internodes i have observed in hardly any other plant  the leaves bear four leaflets themselves subdivided and terminate in muchbranched tendrils  the main petiole of the leaf whilst young moves spontaneously and follows nearly the same irregular course and at about the same rate as the internodes  the movement to and from the stem is the most conspicuous and i have seen the chord of a curved petiole which formed an angle of 59 degrees with the stem in an hour afterwards making an angle of 106 degrees  the two opposite petioles do not move together and one is sometimes so much raised as to stand close to the stem whilst the other is not far from horizontal  the basal part of the petiole moves less than the distal part  the tendrils besides being carried by the moving petioles and internodes themselves move spontaneously and the opposite tendrils occasionally move in opposite directions  by these combined movements of the young internodes petioles and tendrils a considerable space is swept in search of a support  in young plants the tendrils are about three inches in length  they bear two lateral and two terminal branches and each branch bifurcates twice with the tips terminating in blunt double hooks having both points directed to the same side  all the branches are sensitive on all sides and after being lightly rubbed or after coming into contact with a stick bend in about 10 m  one which had become curved in 10 m after a light rub continued bending for between 3 hrs and 4 hrs and became straight again in 8 hrs or 9 hrs  tendrils which have caught nothing ultimately contract into an irregular spire as they likewise do only much more quickly after clasping a support  in both cases the main petiole bearing the leaflets which is at first straight and inclined a little upwards moves downwards with the middle part bent abruptly into a right angle but this is seen in e miniatus more plainly than in e scaber  the tendrils in this genus act in some respects like those of bignonia capreolata but the whole does not move from the light nor do the hooked tips become enlarged into cellular discs  after the tendrils have come into contact with a moderately thick cylindrical stick or with rugged bark the several branches may be seen slowly to lift themselves up change their positions and again come into contact with the supporting surface  the object of these movements is to bring the doublehooks at the extremities of the branches which naturally face in all directions into contact with the wood  i have watched a tendril half of which had bent itself at right angles round the sharp corner of a square post neatly bring every single hook into contact with both rectangular surfaces  the appearance suggested the belief that though the whole tendril is not sensitive to light yet that the tips are so and that they turn and twist themselves towards any dark surface  ultimately the branches arrange themselves very neatly to all the irregularities of the most rugged bark so that they resemble in their irregular course a river with its branches as engraved on a map  but when a tendril has wound round a rather thick stick the subsequent spiral contraction generally draws it away and spoils the neat arrangement  so it is but not in quite so marked a manner when a tendril has spread itself over a large nearly flat surface of rugged bark  we may therefore conclude that these tendrils are not perfectly adapted to seize moderately thick sticks or rugged bark  if a thin stick or twig is placed near a tendril the terminal branches wind quite round it and then seize their own lower branches or the main stem  the stick is thus firmly but not neatly grasped  what the tendrils are really adapted for appears to be such objects as the thin culms of certain grasses or the long flexible bristles of a brush or thin rigid leaves such as those of the asparagus all of which they seize in an admirable manner  this is due to the extremities of the branches close to the little hooks being extremely sensitive to a touch from the thinnest object which they consequently curl round and clasp when a small brush for instance was placed near a tendril the tips of each subbranch seized one two or three of the bristles and then the spiral contraction of the several branches brought all these little parcels close together so that thirty or forty bristles were drawn into a single bundle which afforded an excellent support  polemoniaceaecobaea scandensthis is an excellently constructed climber  the tendrils on a fine plant were eleven inches long with the petiole bearing two pairs of leaflets only two and a half inches in length  they revolve more rapidly and vigorously than those of any other tendrilbearer observed by me with the exception of one kind of passiflora  three large nearly circular sweeps directed against the sun were completed each in 1 hr 15 m and two other circles in 1 hr 20 m and 1 hr 23 m  sometimes a tendril travels in a much inclined position and sometimes nearly upright  the lower part moves but little and the petiole not at all nor do the internodes revolve so that here we have the tendril alone moving on the other hand with most of the species of bignonia and the eccremocarpus the internodes tendrils and petioles all revolved the long straight tapering main stem of the tendril of the cobaea bears alternate branches and each branch is several times divided with the finer branches as thin as very thin bristles and extremely flexible so that they are blown about by a breath of air yet they are strong and highly elastic  the extremity of each branch is a little flattened and terminates in a minute double though sometimes single hook formed of a hard translucent woody substance and as sharp as the finest needle  on a tendril which was eleven inches long i counted ninetyfour of these beautifully constructed little hooks  they readily catch soft wood or gloves or the skin of the naked hand  with the exception of these hardened hooks and of the basal part of the central stem every part of every branchlet is highly sensitive on all sides to a slight touch and bends in a few minutes towards the touched side  by lightly rubbing several sub branches on opposite sides the whole tendril rapidly assumed an extraordinarily crooked shape  these movements from contact do not interfere with the ordinary revolving movement  the branches after becoming greatly curved from being touched straighten themselves at a quicker rate than in almost any other tendril seen by me namely in between half an hour and an hour  after the tendril has caught any object spiral contraction likewise begins after an unusually short interval of time namely in about twelve hours  before the tendril is mature the terminal branchlets cohere and the hooks are curled closely inwards  at this period no part is sensitive to a touch but as soon as the branches diverge and the hooks stand out full sensitiveness is acquired  it is a singular circumstance that immature tendrils revolve at their full velocity before they become sensitive but in a useless manner as in this state they can catch nothing  this want of perfect coadaptation though only for a short time between the structure and the functions of a climbingplant is a rare event  a tendril as soon as it is ready to act stands together with the supporting petiole vertically upwards  the leaflets borne by the petiole are at this time quite small and the extremity of the growing stem is bent to one side so as to be out of the way of the revolving tendril which sweeps large circles directly over head  the tendrils thus revolve in a position well adapted for catching objects standing above and by this means the ascent of the plant is favoured  if no object is caught the leaf with its tendril bends downwards and ultimately assumes a horizontal position  an open space is thus left for the next succeeding and younger tendril to stand vertically upwards and to revolve freely  as soon as an old tendril bends downwards it loses all power of movement and contracts spirally into an entangled mass  although the tendrils revolve with unusual rapidity the movement lasts for only a short time  in a plant placed in the hot house and growing vigorously a tendril revolved for not longer than 36 hours counting from the period when it first became sensitive but during this period it probably made at least 27 revolutions  when a revolving tendril strikes against a stick the branches quickly bend round and clasp it  the little hooks here play an important part as they prevent the branches from being dragged away by the rapid revolving movement before they have had time to clasp the stick securely  this is especially the case when only the extremity of a branch has caught hold of a support  as soon as a tendril has bent a smooth stick or a thick rugged post or has come into contact with planed wood for it can adhere temporarily even to so smooth a surface as this the same peculiar movements may be observed as those described under bignonia capreolata and eccremocarpus  the branches repeatedly lift themselves up and down those which have their hooks already directed downwards remaining in this position and securing the tendril whilst the others twist about until they succeed in arranging themselves in conformity with every irregularity of the surface and in bringing their hooks into contact with the wood  the use of the hooks was well shown by giving the tendrils tubes and slips of glass to catch for these though temporarily seized were invariably lost either during the re arrangement of the branches or ultimately when spiral contraction ensued  the perfect manner in which the branches arranged themselves creeping like rootlets over every inequality of the surface and into any deep crevice is a pretty sight for it is perhaps more effectually performed by this than by any other species  the action is certainly more conspicuous as the upper surfaces of the main stem as well as of every branch to the extreme hooks are angular and green whilst the lower surfaces are rounded and purple  i was led to infer as in former cases that a less amount of light guided these movements of the branches of the tendrils  i made many trials with black and white cards and glass tubes to prove it but failed from various causes yet these trials countenanced the belief  as a tendril consists of a leaf split into numerous segments there is nothing surprising in all the segments turning their upper surfaces towards the light as soon as the tendril is caught and the revolving movement is arrested  but this will not account for the whole movement for the segments actually bend or curve to the dark side besides turning round on their axes so that their upper surfaces may face the light  when the cobaea grows in the open air the wind must aid the extremely flexible tendrils in seizing a support for i found that a mere breath sufficed to cause the extreme branches to catch hold by their hooks of twigs which they could not have reached by the revolving movement  it might have been thought that a tendril thus hooked by the extremity of a single branch could not have fairly grasped its support  but several times i watched cases like the following  tendril caught a thin stick by the hooks of one of its two extreme branches though thus held by the tip it still tried to revolve bowing itself to all sides and by this movement the other extreme branch soon caught the stick  the first branch then loosed itself and arranging its hooks again caught hold  after a time from the continued movement of the tendril the hooks of a third branch caught hold  no other branches as the tendril then stood could possibly have touched the stick  but before long the upper part of the main stem began to contract into an open spire  it thus dragged the shoot which bore the tendril towards the stick and as the tendril continually tried to revolve a fourth branch was brought into contact  and lastly from the spiral contraction travelling down both the main stem and the branches all of them one after another were ultimately brought into contact with the stick  they then wound themselves round it and round one another until the whole tendril was tied together in an inextricable knot  the tendrils though at first quite flexible after having clasped a support for a time become more rigid and stronger than they were at first  thus the plant is secured to its support in a perfect manner  leguminosaepisum sativumthe common pea was the subject of a valuable memoir by dutrochet 27 who discovered that the internodes and tendrils revolve in ellipses  the ellipses are generally very narrow but sometimes approach to circles  i several times observed that the longer axis slowly changed its direction which is of importance as the tendril thus sweeps a wider space  owing to this change of direction and likewise to the movement of the stem towards the light the successive irregular ellipses generally form an irregular spire  i have thought it worth while to annex a tracing of the course pursued by the upper internode the movement of the tendril being neglected of a young plant from 840 am to 915 pm the course was traced on a hemispherical glass placed over the plant and the dots with figures give the hours of observation each dot being joined by a straight line  no doubt all the lines would have been curvilinear if the course had been observed at much shorter intervals  the extremity of the petiole from which the young tendril arose was two inches from the glass so that if a pencil two inches in length could have been affixed to the petiole it would have traced the annexed figure on the under side of the glass but it must be remembered that the figure is reduced by onehalf neglecting the first great sweep towards the light from the figure 1 to 2 the end of the petiole swept a space 4 inches across in one direction and 3 inches in another  as a fullgrown tendril is considerably above two inches in length and as the tendril itself bends and revolves in harmony with the internode a considerably wider space is swept than is here represented on a reduced scale dutrochet observed the completion of an ellipse in 1 hr 20 m and i saw one completed in 1 hr 30 m  the direction followed is variable either with or against the sun  dutrochet asserts that the petioles of the leaves spontaneously revolve as well as the young internodes and tendrils but he does not say that he secured the internodes when this was done i could never detect any movement in the petiole except to and from the light  the tendrils on the other hand when the internodes and petioles are secured describe irregular spires or regular ellipses exactly like those made by the internodes  a young tendril only 1125 of an inch in length revolved  dutrochet has shown that when a plant is placed in a room so that the light enters laterally the internodes travel much quicker to the light than from it  on the other hand he asserts that the tendril itself moves from the light towards the dark side of the room  with due deference to this great observer i think he was mistaken owing to his not having secured the internodes  i took a young plant with highly sensitive tendrils and tied the petiole so that the tendril alone could move it completed a perfect ellipse in 1 hr 30 m i then turned the plant partly round but this made no change in the direction of the succeeding ellipse  the next day i watched a plant similarly secured until the tendril which was highly sensitive made an ellipse in a line exactly to and from the light the movement was so great that the tendril at the two ends of its elliptical course bent itself a little beneath the horizon thus travelling more than 180 degrees but the curvature was fully as great towards the light as towards the dark side of the room  i believe dutrochet was misled by not having secured the internodes and by having observed a plant of which the internodes and tendrils no longer curved in harmony together owing to inequality of age  dutrochet made no observations on the sensitiveness of the tendrils these whilst young and about an inch in length with the leaflets on the petiole only partially expanded are highly sensitive a single light touch with a twig on the inferior or concave surface near the tip caused them to bend quickly as did occasionally a loop of thread weighing oneseventh of a grain 925 mg  the upper or convex surface is barely or not at all sensitive  tendrils after bending from a touch straighten themselves in about two hours and are then ready to act again  as soon as they begin to grow old the extremities of their two or three pairs of branches become hooked and they then appear to form an excellent grappling instrument but this is not the case  for at this period they have generally quite lost their sensitiveness and when hooked on to twigs some were not at all affected and others required from 18 hrs to 24 hrs before clasping such twigs nevertheless they were able to utilise the last vestige of irritability owing to their extremities being hooked ultimately the lateral branches contract spirally but not the middle or main stem  lathyrus aphacathis plant is destitute of leaves except during a very early age these being replaced by tendrils and the leaves themselves by large stipules  it might therefore have been expected that the tendrils would have been highly organized but this is not so  they are moderately long thin and unbranched with their tips slightly curved  whilst young they are sensitive on all sides but chiefly on the concave side of the extremity  they have no spontaneous revolving power but are at first inclined upwards at an angle of about 45 degrees then move into a horizontal position and ultimately bend downwards  the young internodes on the other hand revolve in ellipses and carry with them the tendrils  two ellipses were completed each in nearly 5 hrs their longer axes were directed at about an angle of 45 degrees to the axis of the previously made ellipse  lathyrus grandiflorusthe plants observed were young and not growing vigorously yet sufficiently so i think for my observations to be trusted  if so we have the rare case of neither internodes nor tendrils revolving  the tendrils of vigorous plants are above 4 inches in length and are often twice divided into three branches the tips are curved and are sensitive on their concave sides the lower part of the central stem is hardly at all sensitive  hence this plant appears to climb simply by its tendrils being brought through the growth of the stem or more efficiently by the wind into contact with surrounding objects which they then clasp  i may add that the tendrils or the internodes or both of vicia sativa revolve  compositaemutisia clematisthe immense family of the compositae is well known to include very few climbing plants  we have seen in the table in the first chapter that mikania scandens is a regular twiner and f muller informs me that in s brazil there is another species which is a leafclimber  mutisia is the only genus in the family as far as i can learn which bears tendrils  it is therefore interesting to find that these though rather less metamorphosed from their primordial foliar condition than are most other tendrils yet display all the ordinary characteristic movements both those that are spontaneous and those which are excited by contact  the long leaf bears seven or eight alternate leaflets and terminates in a tendril which in a plant of considerable size was 5 inches in length  it consists generally of three branches and these although much elongated evidently represent the petioles and midribs of three leaflets for they closely resemble the same parts in an ordinary leaf in being rectangular on the upper surface furrowed and edged with green  moreover the green edging of the tendrils of young plants sometimes expands into a narrow lamina or blade  each branch is curved a little downwards and is slightly hooked at the extremity  a young upper internode revolved judging from three revolutions at an average rate of 1 hr 38 m it swept ellipses with the longer axes directed at right angles to one another but the plant apparently cannot twine  the petioles and the tendrils are both in constant movement  but their movement is slower and much less regularly elliptical than that of the internodes  they appear to be much affected by the light for the whole leaf usually sinks down during the night and rises during the day moving also during the day in a crooked course to the west  the tip of the tendril is highly sensitive on the lower surface and one which was just touched with a twig became perceptibly curved in 3 m and another in 5 m the upper surface is not at all sensitive the sides are moderately sensitive so that two branches which were rubbed on their inner sides converged and crossed each other  the petiole of the leaf and the lower parts of the tendril halfway between the upper leaflet and the lowest branch are not sensitive  a tendril after curling from a touch became straight again in about 6 hrs and was ready to react but one that had been so roughly rubbed as to have coiled into a helix did not become perfectly straight until after 13 hrs  the tendrils retain their sensibility to an unusually late age for one borne by a leaf with five or six fully developed leaves above was still active  if a tendril catches nothing after a considerable interval of time the tips of the branches curl a little inwards but if it clasps some object the whole contracts spirally  smilaceaesmilax aspera var maculataaug sthilaire 28 considers that the tendrils which rise in pairs from the petiole are modified lateral leaflets but mohl p 41 ranks them as modified stipules  these tendrils are from 15 to 175 inches in length are thin and have slightly curved pointed extremities they diverge a little from each other and stand at first nearly upright  when lightly rubbed on either side they slowly bend to that side and subsequently become straight again  the back or convex side when placed in contact with a stick became just perceptibly curved in 1 hr 20 m but did not completely surround it until 48 hrs had elapsed the concave side of another became considerably curved in 2 hrs and clasped a stick in 5 hrs  as the pairs of tendrils grow old one tendril diverges more and more from the other and both slowly bend backwards and downwards so that after a time they project on the opposite side of the stem to that from which they arise  they then still retain their sensitiveness and can clasp a support placed behind the stem  owing to this power the plant is able to ascend a thin upright stick  ultimately the two tendrils belonging to the same petiole if they do not come into contact with any object loosely cross each other behind the stem as at b in fig 7  this movement of the tendrils towards and round the stem is to a certain extent guided by their avoidance of the light for when a plant stood so that one of the two tendrils was compelled in thus slowly moving to travel towards the light and the other from the light the latter always moved as i repeatedly observed more quickly than its fellow  the tendrils do not contract spirally in any case  their chance of finding a support depends on the growth of the plant on the wind and on their own slow backward and downward movement which as we have just seen is guided to a certain extent by the avoidance of the light for neither the internodes nor the tendrils have any proper revolving movement  from this latter circumstance from the slow movements of the tendrils after contact though their sensitiveness is retained for an unusual length of time from their simple structure and shortness this plant is a less perfect climber than any other tendrilbearing species observed by me  the plant whilst young and only a few inches in height does not produce any tendrils and considering that it grows to only about 8 feet in height that the stem is zigzag and is furnished as well as the petioles with spines it is surprising that it should be provided with tendrils comparatively inefficient though these are the plant might have been left one would have thought to climb by the aid of its spines alone like our brambles  as however it belongs to a genus some of the species of which are furnished with much longer tendrils we may suspect that it possesses these organs solely from being descended from progenitors more highly organized in this respect  fumariaceaecorydalis claviculataaccording to mohl p 43 the extremities of the branched stem as well as the leaves are converted into tendrils  in the specimens examined by me all the tendrils were certainly foliar and it is hardly credible that the same plant should produce tendrils of a widely different homological nature  nevertheless from this statement by mohl i have ranked this species amongst the tendrilbearers if classed exclusively by its foliar tendrils it would be doubtful whether it ought not to have been placed amongst the leafclimbers with its allies fumaria and adlumia  a large majority of its socalled tendrils still bear leaflets though excessively reduced in size but some few of them may properly be designated as tendrils for they are completely destitute of laminae or blades  consequently we here behold a plant in an actual state of transition from a leafclimber to a tendril bearer  whilst the plant is rather young only the outer leaves but when fullgrown all the leaves have their extremities converted into more or less perfect tendrils  i have examined specimens from one locality alone viz hampshire and it is not improbable that plants growing under different conditions might have their leaves a little more or less changed into true tendrils  whilst the plant is quite young the firstformed leaves are not modified in any way but those next formed have their terminal leaflets reduced in size and soon all the leaves assume the structure represented in the following drawing  this leaf bore nine leaflets the lower ones being much subdivided  the terminal portion of the petiole about 15 inch in length above the leaflet f is thinner and more elongated than the lower part and may be considered as the tendril  the leaflets borne by this part are greatly reduced in size being on an average about the tenth of an inch in length and very narrow one small leaflet measured onetwelfth of an inch in length and oneseventyfifth in breadth 2116 mm and 0339 mm so that it was almost microscopically minute  all the reduced leaflets have branching nerves and terminate in little spines like those of the fully developed leaflets  every gradation could be traced until we come to branchlets as a and d in the figure which show no vestige of a lamina or blade  occasionally all the terminal branchlets of the petiole are in this condition and we then have a true tendril  the several terminal branches of the petiole bearing the much reduced leaflets a b c d are highly sensitive for a loop of thread weighing only the onesixteenth of a grain 405 mg caused them to become greatly curved in under 4 hrs  when the loop was removed the petioles straightened themselves in about the same time  the petiole e was rather less sensitive and in another specimen in which the corresponding petiole bore rather larger leaflets a loop of thread weighing oneeighth of a grain did not cause curvature until 18 hrs had elapsed  loops of thread weighing onefourth of a grain left suspended on the lower petioles f to l during several days produced no effect  yet the three petioles f g and h were not quite insensible for when left in contact with a stick for a day or two they slowly curled round it  thus the sensibility of the petiole gradually diminishes from the tendrillike extremity to the base the internodes of the stem are not at all sensitive which makes mohls statement that they are sometimes converted into tendrils the more surprising not to say improbable  the whole leaf whilst young and sensitive stands almost vertically upwards as we have seen to be the case with many tendrils  it is in continual movement and one that i observed swept at an average rate of about 2 hrs for each revolution large though irregular ellipses which were sometimes narrow sometimes broad with their longer axes directed to different points of the compass  the young internodes likewise revolved irregularly in ellipses or spires so that by these combined movements a considerable space was swept for a support  if the terminal and attenuated portion of a petiole fails to seize any object it ultimately bends downwards and inwards and soon loses all irritability and power of movement  this bending down differs much in nature from that which occurs with the extremities of the young leaves in many species of clematis for these when thus bent downwards or hooked first acquire their full degree of sensitiveness  dicentra thalictrifoliain this allied plant the metamorphosis of the terminal leaflets is complete and they are converted into perfect tendrils  whilst the plant is young the tendrils appear like modified branches and a distinguished botanist thought that they were of this nature but in a fullgrown plant there can be no doubt as i am assured by dr hooker that they are modified leaves when of full size they are above 5 inches in length they bifurcate twice thrice or even four times their extremities are hooked and blunt  all the branches of the tendrils are sensitive on all sides but the basal portion of the main stem is only slightly so  the terminal branches when lightly rubbed with a twig became curved in the course of from 30 m to 42 m and straightened themselves in between 10 hrs and 20 hrs  a loop of thread weighing oneeighth of a grain plainly caused the thinner branches to bend as did occasionally a loop weighing onesixteenth of a grain but this latter weight though left suspended was not sufficient to cause a permanent flexure  the whole leaf with its tendril as well as the young upper internodes revolves vigorously and quickly though irregularly and thus sweeps a wide space  the figure traced on a bellglass was either an irregular spire or a zigzag line  the nearest approach to an ellipse was an elongated figure of 8 with one end a little open and this was completed in 1 hr 53 m  during a period of 6 hrs 17 m another shoot made a complex figure apparently representing three and a half ellipses  when the lower part of the petiole bearing the leaflets was securely fastened the tendril itself described similar but much smaller figures  this species climbs well  the tendrils after clasping a stick become thicker and more rigid but the blunt hooks do not turn and adapt themselves to the supporting surface as is done in so perfect a manner by some bignoniaceae and cobaea  the tendrils of young plants two or three feet in height are only half the length of those borne by the same plant when grown taller and they do not contract spirally after clasping a support but only become slightly flexuous  fullsized tendrils on the other hand contract spirally with the exception of the thick basal portion  tendrils which have caught nothing simply bend downwards and inwards like the extremities of the leaves of the corydalis claviculata  but in all cases the petiole after a time is angularly and abruptly bent downwards like that of eccremocarpus    chapter

as modified leaves stipules or branches or as partly a leaf and partly a branch  de candolle believes that the tendrils differ in their homological nature in two of the tribes 29  from facts recently adduced mr berkeley thinks that payers view is the most probable namely that the tendril is a separate portion of the leaf itself but much may be said in favour of the belief that it is a modified flowerpeduncle 30  echinocystis lobatanumerous observations were made on this plant raised from seed sent me by prof asa gray for the spontaneous revolving movements of the internodes and tendrils were first observed by me in this case and greatly perplexed me  my observations may now be much condensed  i observed thirtyfive revolutions of the internodes and tendrils the slowest rate was 2 hrs and the average rate with no great fluctuations 1 hr 40 m sometimes i tied the internodes so that the tendrils alone moved at other times i cut off the tendrils whilst very young so that the internodes revolved by themselves but the rate was not thus affected  the course generally pursued was with the sun but often in an opposite direction  sometimes the movement during a short time would either stop or be reversed and this apparently was due to interference from the light as for instance when i placed a plant close to a window  in one instance an old tendril which had nearly ceased revolving moved in one direction whilst a young tendril above moved in an opposite course  the two uppermost internodes alone revolve and as soon as the lower one grows old only its upper part continues to move  the ellipses or circles swept by the summits of the internodes are about three inches in diameter whilst those swept by the tips of the tendrils are from 15 to 16 inches in diameter  during the revolving movement the internodes become successively curved to all points of the compass in one part of their course they are often inclined together with the tendrils at about 45 degrees to the horizon and in another part stand vertically up  there was something in the appearance of the revolving internodes which continually gave the false impression that their movement was due to the weight of the long and spontaneously revolving tendril but on cutting off the latter with sharp scissors the top of the shoot rose only a little and went on revolving  this false appearance is apparently due to the internodes and tendrils all curving and moving harmoniously together  a revolving tendril though inclined during the greater part of its course at an angle of about 45 degrees in one case of only 37 degrees above the horizon stiffened and straightened itself from tip to base in a certain part of its course thus becoming nearly or quite vertical  i witnessed this repeatedly and it occurred both when the supporting internodes were free and when they were tied up but was perhaps most conspicuous in the latter case or when the whole shoot happened to be much inclined  the tendril forms a very acute angle with the projecting extremity of the stem or shoot and the stiffening always occurred as the tendril approached and had to pass over the shoot in its circular course  if it had not possessed and exercised this curious power it would infallibly have struck against the extremity of the shoot and been arrested  as soon as the tendril with its three branches begins to stiffen itself in this manner and to rise from an inclined into a vertical position the revolving motion becomes more rapid and as soon as the tendril has succeeded in passing over the extremity of the shoot or point of difficulty its motion coinciding with that from its weight often causes it to fall into its previously inclined position so quickly that the apex could be seen travelling like the minute hand of a gigantic clock  the tendrils are thin from 7 to 9 inches in length with a pair of short lateral branches rising not far from the base  the tip is slightly and permanently curved so as to act to a limited extent as a hook  the concave side of the tip is highly sensitive to a touch but not so the convex side as was likewise observed to be the case with other species of the family by mohl p 65  i repeatedly proved this difference by lightly rubbing four or five times the convex side of one tendril and only once or twice the concave side of another tendril and the latter alone curled inwards  in a few hours afterwards when the tendrils which had been rubbed on the concave side had straightened themselves i reversed the process of rubbing and always with the same result  after touching the concave side the tip becomes sensibly curved in one or two minutes and subsequently if the touch has been at all rough it coils itself into a helix  but the helix will after a time straighten itself and be again ready to act  a loop of thin thread only onesixteenth of a grain in weight caused a temporary flexure  the lower part was repeatedly rubbed rather roughly but no curvature ensued yet this part is sensitive to prolonged pressure for when it came into contact with a stick it would slowly wind round it  one of my plants bore two shoots near together and the tendrils were repeatedly drawn across one another but it is a singular fact that they did not once catch each other  it would appear as if they had become habituated to contact of this kind for the pressure thus caused must have been much greater than that caused by a loop of soft thread weighing only the onesixteenth of a grain  i have however seen several tendrils of bryonia dioica interlocked but they subsequently released one another  the tendrils of the echinocystis are also habituated to drops of water or to rain for artificial rain made by violently flirting a wet brush over them produced not the least effect  the revolving movement of a tendril is not stopped by the curving of its extremity after it has been touched  when one of the lateral branches has firmly clasped an object the middle branch continues to revolve  when a stem is bent down and secured so that the tendril depends but is left free to move its previous revolving movement is nearly or quite stopped but it soon begins to bend upwards and as soon as it has become horizontal the revolving movement recommences i tried this four times the tendril generally rose to a horizontal position in an hour or an hour and a half but in one case in which a tendril depended at an angle of 45 degrees beneath the horizon the uprising took two hours in half an hour afterwards it rose to 23 degrees above the horizon and then recommenced revolving  this upward movement is independent of the action of light for it occurred twice in the dark and on another occasion the light came in on one side alone  the movement no doubt is guided by opposition to the force of gravity as in the case of the ascent of the plumules of germinating seeds  a tendril does not long retain its revolving power and as soon as this is lost it bends downwards and contracts spirally  after the revolving movement has ceased the tip still retains for a short time its sensitiveness to contact but this can be of little or no use to the plant  though the tendril is highly flexible and though the extremity travels under favourable circumstances at about the rate of an inch in two minutes and a quarter yet its sensitiveness to contact is so great that it hardly ever fails to seize a thin stick placed in its path  the following case surprised me much  i placed a thin smooth cylindrical stick and i repeated the experiment seven times so far from a tendril that its extremity could only curl half or threequarters round the stick but i always found that the tip managed in the course of a few hours to curl twice or even thrice round the stick  i at first thought that this was due to rapid growth on the outside but by coloured points and measurements i proved that there had been no sensible increase of length within the time  when a stick flat on one side was similarly placed the tip of the tendril could not curl beyond the flat surface but coiled itself into a helix which turning to one side lay flat on the little flat surface of wood  in one instance a portion of tendril threequarters of an inch in length was thus dragged on to the flat surface by the coiling in of the helix  but the tendril thus acquires a very insecure hold and generally after a time slips off in one case alone the helix subsequently uncoiled itself and the tip then passed round and clasped the stick  the formation of the helix on the flat side of the stick apparently shows us that the continued striving of the tip to curl itself closely inwards gives the force which drags the tendril round a smooth cylindrical stick  in this latter case whilst the tendril was slowly and quite insensibly crawling onwards i observed several times through a lens that the whole surface was not in close contact with the stick and i can understand the onward progress only by supposing that the movement is slightly undulatory or vermicular and that the tip alternately straightens itself a little and then again curls inwards  it thus drags itself onwards by an insensibly slow alternate movement which may be compared to that of a strong man suspended by the ends of his fingers to a horizontal pole who works his fingers onwards until he can grasp the pole with the palm of his hand  however this may be the fact is certain that a tendril which has caught a round stick with its extreme point can work itself onwards until it has passed twice or even thrice round the stick and has permanently grasped it  hanburya mexicanathe young internodes and tendrils of this anomalous member of the family revolve in the same manner and at about the same rate as those of the echinocystis  the stem does not twine but can ascend an upright stick by the aid of its tendrils the concave tip of the tendril is very sensitive after it had become rapidly coiled into a ring owing to a single touch it straightened itself in 50 m  the tendril when in full action stands vertically up with the projecting extremity of the young stem thrown a little on one side so as to be out of the way but the tendril bears on the inner side near its base a short rigid branch which projects out at right angles like a spur with the terminal half bowed a little downwards  hence as the main vertical branch revolves the spur from its position and rigidity cannot pass over the extremity of the shoot in the same curious manner as do the three branches of the tendril of the echinocystis namely by stiffening themselves at the proper point  the spur is therefore pressed laterally against the young stem in one part of the revolving course and thus the sweep of the lower part of the main branch is much restricted  a nice case of coadaptation here comes into play  in all the other tendrils observed by me the several branches become sensitive at the same period  had this been the case with the hanburya the inwardly directed spurlike branch from being pressed during the revolving movement against the projecting end of the shoot would infallibly have seized it in a useless or injurious manner  but the main branch of the tendril after revolving for a time in a vertical position spontaneously bends downwards and in doing so raises the spurlike branch which itself also curves upwards so that by these combined movements it rises above the projecting end of the shoot and can now move freely without touching the shoot and now it first becomes sensitive  the tips of both branches when they come into contact with a stick grasp it like any ordinary tendril  but in the course of a few days the lower surface swells and becomes developed into a cellular layer which adapts itself closely to the wood and firmly adheres to it this layer is analogous to the adhesive discs formed by the extremities of the tendrils of some species of bignonia and of ampelopsis but in the hanburya the layer is developed along the terminal inner surface sometimes for a length of 175 inches and not at the extreme tip  the layer is white whilst the tendril is green and near the tip it is sometimes thicker than the tendril itself it generally spreads a little beyond the sides of the tendril and is fringed with free elongated cells which have enlarged globular or retortshaped heads  this cellular layer apparently secretes some resinous cement for its adhesion to the wood was not lessened by an immersion of 24 hrs in alcohol or water but was quite loosened by a similar immersion in ether or turpentine after a tendril has once firmly coiled itself round a stick it is difficult to imagine of what use the adhesive cellular layer can be owing to the spiral contraction which soon ensues the tendrils were never able to remain excepting in one instance in contact with a thick post or a nearly flat surface if they had quickly become attached by means of the adhesive layer this would evidently have been of service to the plant  the tendrils of bryonia dioica cucurbita ovifera and cucumis sativa are sensitive and revolve  whether the internodes likewise revolve i did not observe  in anguria warscewiczii the internodes though thick and stiff revolve  in this plant the lower surface of the tendril some time after clasping a stick produces a coarsely cellular layer or cushion which adapts itself closely to the wood like that formed by the tendril of the hanburya but it is not in the least adhesive  in zanonia indica which belongs to a different tribe of the family the forked tendrils and the internodes revolve in periods between 2 hrs 8 m and 3 hrs 35 m moving against the sun  vitaceaein this family and in the two following namely the sapindaceae and passifloraceae the tendrils are modified flower peduncles and are therefore axial in their nature  in this respect they differ from all those previously described with the exception perhaps of the cucurbitaceae  the homological nature however of a tendril seems to make no difference in its action  vitis viniferathe tendril is thick and of great length one from a vine growing out of doors and not vigorously was 16 inches long  it consists of a peduncle a bearing two branches which diverge equally from it  one of the branches b has a scale at its base it is always as far as i have seen longer than the other and often bifurcates  the branches when rubbed become curved and subsequently straighten themselves  after a tendril has clasped any object with its extremity it contracts spirally but this does not occur palm p 56 when no object has been seized  the tendrils move spontaneously from side to side and on a very hot day one made two elliptical revolutions at an average rate of 2 hrs 15 m  during these movements a coloured line painted along the convex surface appeared after a time on one side then on the concave side then on the opposite side and lastly again on the convex side  the two branches of the same tendril have independent movements  after a tendril has spontaneously revolved for a time it bends from the light towards the dark  i do not state this on my own authority but on that of mohl and dutrochet  mohl p 77 says that in a vine planted against a wall the tendrils point towards it and in a vineyard generally more or less to the north  the young internodes revolve spontaneously but the movement is unusually slight  a shoot faced a window and i traced its course on the glass during two perfectly calm and hot days  on one of these days it described in the course of ten hours a spire representing two and a half ellipses  i also placed a bellglass over a young muscat grape in the hothouse and it made each day three or four very small oval revolutions the shoot moving less than half an inch from side to side  had it not made at least three revolutions whilst the sky was uniformly overcast i should have attributed this slight degree of movement to the varying action of the light  the extremity of the stem is more or less bent downwards but it never reverses its curvature as so generally occurs with twining plants  various authors palm p 55 mohl p 45 lindley c believe that the tendrils of the vine are modified flowerpeduncles  i here give a drawing fig 10 of the ordinary state of a young flowerstalk it consists of the common peduncle a of the flowertendril b which is represented as having caught a twig and of the sub peduncle c bearing the flowerbuds  the whole moves spontaneously like a true tendril but in a less degree the movement however is greater when the subpeduncle c does not bear many flowerbuds  the common peduncle a has not the power of clasping a support nor has the corresponding part of a true tendril the flowertendril b is always longer than the subpeduncle c and has a scale at its base it sometimes bifurcates and therefore corresponds in every detail with the longer scalebearing branch b fig  9 of the true tendril  it is however inclined backwards from the subpeduncle c or stands at right angles with it and is thus adapted to aid in carrying the future bunch of grapes  when rubbed it curves and subsequently straightens itself and it can as is shown in the drawing securely clasp a support  i have seen an object as soft as a young vineleaf caught by one  the lower and naked part of the subpeduncle c is likewise slightly sensitive to a rub and i have seen it bent round a stick and even partly round a leaf with which it had come into contact  that the subpeduncle has the same nature as the corresponding branch of an ordinary tendril is well shown when it bears only a few flowers for in this case it becomes less branched increases in length and gains both in sensitiveness and in the power of spontaneous movement  i have twice seen subpeduncles which bore from thirty to forty flower buds and which had become considerably elongated and were completely wound round sticks exactly like true tendrils  the whole length of another subpeduncle bearing only eleven flowerbuds quickly became curved when slightly rubbed but even this scanty number of flowers rendered the stalk less sensitive than the other branch that is the flowertendril for the latter after a lighter rub became curved more quickly and in a greater degree  i have seen a subpeduncle thickly covered with flowerbuds with one of its higher lateral branchlets bearing from some cause only two buds and this one branchlet had become much elongated and had spontaneously caught hold of an adjoining twig in fact it formed a little subtendril  the increasing length of the subpeduncle c with the decreasing number of the flowerbuds is a good instance of the law of compensation  in accordance with this same principle the true tendril as a whole is always longer than the flowerstalk for instance on the same plant the longest flowerstalk measured from the base of the common peduncle to the tip of the flowertendril was 85 inches in length whilst the longest tendril was nearly double this length namely 16 inches  the gradations from the ordinary state of a flowerstalk as represented in the drawing fig 10 to that of a true tendril fig 9 are complete  we have seen that the subpeduncle c whilst still bearing from thirty to forty flowerbuds sometimes becomes a little elongated and partially assumes all the characters of the corresponding branch of a true tendril  from this state we can trace every stage till we come to a fullsized perfect tendril bearing on the branch which corresponds with the subpeduncle one single flower bud  hence there can be no doubt that the tendril is a modified flowerpeduncle  another kind of gradation well deserves notice  flowertendrils b fig 10 sometimes produce a few flowerbuds  for instance on a vine growing against my house there were thirteen and twentytwo flowerbuds respectively on two flowertendrils which still retained their characteristic qualities of sensitiveness and spontaneous movement but in a somewhat lessened degree  on vines in hothouses so many flowers are occasionally produced on the flowertendrils that a double bunch of grapes is the result and this is technically called by gardeners a cluster  in this state the whole bunch of flowers presents scarcely any resemblance to a tendril and judging from the facts already given it would probably possess little power of clasping a support or of spontaneous movement  such flower stalks closely resemble in structure those borne by cissus  this genus belonging to the same family of the vitaceae produces well developed tendrils and ordinary bunches of flowers but there are no gradations between the two states  if the genus vitis had been unknown the boldest believer in the modification of species would never have surmised that the same individual plant at the same period of growth would have yielded every possible gradation between ordinary flowerstalks for the support of the flowers and fruit and tendrils used exclusively for climbing  but the vine clearly gives us such a case and it seems to me as striking and curious an instance of transition as can well be conceived  cissus discolorthe young shoots show no more movement than can be accounted for by daily variations in the action of the light  the tendrils however revolve with much regularity following the sun and in the plants observed by me swept circles of about 5 inches in diameter  five circles were completed in the following times 4 hrs 45 m 4 hrs 50 m 4 hrs 45 m 4 hrs 30 m and 5 hrs the same tendril continues to revolve during three or four days  the tendrils are from 35 to 5 inches in length  they are formed of a long footstalk bearing two short branches which in old plants again bifurcate  the two branches are not of quite equal length and as with the vine the longer one has a scale at its base  the tendril stands vertically upwards the extremity of the shoot being bent abruptly downwards and this position is probably of service to the plant by allowing the tendril to revolve freely and vertically  both branches of the tendril whilst young are highly sensitive  a touch with a pencil so gentle as only just to move a tendril borne at the end of a long flexible shoot sufficed to cause it to become perceptibly curved in four or five minutes  it became straight again in rather above one hour  a loop of soft thread weighing oneseventh of a grain 925 mg was thrice tried and each time caused the tendril to become curved in 30 or 40 m  half this weight produced no effect  the long footstalk is much less sensitive for a slight rubbing produced no effect although prolonged contact with a stick caused it to bend  the two branches are sensitive on all sides so that they converge if touched on their inner sides and diverge if touched on their outer sides  if a branch be touched at the same time with equal force on opposite sides both sides are equally stimulated and there is no movement  before examining this plant i had observed only tendrils which are sensitive on one side alone and these when lightly pressed between the finger and thumb become curved but on thus pinching many times the tendrils of the cissus no curvature ensued and i falsely inferred at first that they were not at all sensitive  cissus antarcticusthe tendrils on a young plant were thick and straight with the tips a little curved  when their concave surfaces were rubbed and it was necessary to do this with some force they very slowly became curved and subsequently straight again  they are therefore much less sensitive than those of the last species but they made two revolutions following the sun rather more rapidly viz in 3 hrs 30 m and 4 hrs the internodes do not revolve  ampelopsis hederacea virginian creeperthe internodes apparently do not move more than can be accounted for by the varying action of the light  the tendrils are from 4 to 5 inches in length with the main stem sending off several lateral branches which have their tips curved as may be seen in the upper figure fig 11  they exhibit no true spontaneous revolving movement but turn as was long ago observed by andrew knight 31 from the light to the dark  i have seen several tendrils move in less than 24 hours through an angle of 180 degrees to the dark side of a case in which a plant was placed but the movement is sometimes much slower  the several lateral branches often move independently of one another and sometimes irregularly without any apparent cause  these tendrils are less sensitive to a touch than any others observed by me  by gentle but repeated rubbing with a twig the lateral branches but not the main stem became in the course of three or four hours slightly curved but they seemed to have hardly any power of again straightening themselves  the tendrils of a plant which had crawled over a large boxtree clasped several of the branches but i have repeatedly seen that they will withdraw themselves after seizing a stick  when they meet with a flat surface of wood or a wall and this is evidently what they are adapted for they turn all their branches towards it and spreading them widely apart bring their hooked tips laterally into contact with it  in effecting this the several branches after touching the surface often rise up place themselves in a new position and again come down into contact with it  in the course of about two days after a tendril has arranged its branches so as to press on any surface the curved tips swell become bright red and form on their undersides the wellknown little discs or cushions with which they adhere firmly  in one case the tips were slightly swollen in 38 hrs after coming into contact with a brick in another case they were considerably swollen in 48 hrs and in an additional 24 hrs were firmly attached to a smooth board and lastly the tips of a younger tendril not only swelled but became attached to a stuccoed wall in 42 hrs  these adhesive discs resemble except in colour and in being larger those of bignonia capreolata  when they were developed in contact with a ball of tow the fibres were separately enveloped but not in so effective a manner as by b capreolata  discs are never developed as far as i have seen without the stimulus of at least temporary contact with some object 32  they are generally first formed on one side of the curved tip the whole of which often becomes so much changed in appearance that a line of the original green tissue can be traced only along the concave surface  when however a tendril has clasped a cylindrical stick an irregular rim or disc is sometimes formed along the inner surface at some little distance from the curved tip this was also observed p 71 by mohl  the discs consist of enlarged cells with smooth projecting hemispherical surfaces coloured red they are at first gorged with fluid see section given by mohl p 70 but ultimately become woody  as the discs soon adhere firmly to such smooth surfaces as planed or painted wood or to the polished leaf of the ivy this alone renders it probable that some cement is secreted as has been asserted to be the case quoted by mohl p 71 by malpighi  i removed a number of discs formed during the previous year from a stuccoed wall and left them during many hours in warm water diluted acetic acid and alcohol but the attached grains of silex were not loosened immersion in sulphuric ether for 24 hrs loosened them much but warmed essential oils i tried oil of thyme and peppermint completely released every particle of stone in the course of a few hours  this seems to prove that some resinous cement is secreted the quantity however must be small for when a plant ascended a thinly whitewashed wall the discs adhered firmly to the whitewash but as the cement never penetrated the thin layer they were easily withdrawn together with little scales of the whitewash  it must not be supposed that the attachment is effected exclusively by the cement for the cellular outgrowth completely envelopes every minute and irregular projection and insinuates itself into every crevice  a tendril which has not become attached to any body does not contract spirally and in course of a week or two shrinks into the finest thread withers and drops off  an attached tendril on the other hand contracts spirally and thus becomes highly elastic so that when the main footstalk is pulled the strain is distributed equally between all the attached discs  for a few days after the attachment of the discs the tendril remains weak and brittle but it rapidly increases in thickness and acquires great strength  during the following winter it ceases to live but adheres firmly in a dead state both to its own stem and to the surface of attachment  in the accompanying diagram fig 11 we see the difference between a tendril b some weeks after its attachment to a wall with one a from the same plant fully grown but unattached  that the change in the nature of the tissues as well as the spiral contraction are consequent on the formation of the discs is well shown by any lateral branches which have not become attached for these in a week or two wither and drop off in the same manner as does the whole tendril if unattached  the gain in strength and durability in a tendril after its attachment is something wonderful  there are tendrils now adhering to my house which are still strong and have been exposed to the weather in a dead state for fourteen or fifteen years  one single lateral branchlet of a tendril estimated to be at least ten years old was still elastic and supported a weight of exactly two pounds  the whole tendril had five discbearing branches of equal thickness and apparently of equal strength so that after having been exposed during ten years to the weather it would probably have resisted a strain of ten pounds  sapindaceaecardiospermum halicacabumin this family as in the last the tendrils are modified flowerpeduncles  in the present plant the two lateral branches of the main flowerpeduncle have been converted into a pair of tendrils corresponding with the single flowertendril of the common vine  the main peduncle is thin stiff and from 3 to 45 inches in length  near the summit above two little bracts it divides into three branches  the middle one divides and redivides and bears the flowers ultimately it grows half as long again as the two other modified branches  these latter are the tendrils they are at first thicker and longer than the middle branch but never become more than an inch in length  they taper to a point and are flattened with the lower clasping surface destitute of hairs  at first they project straight up but soon diverging spontaneously curl downwards so as to become symmetrically and elegantly hooked as represented in the diagram  they are now whilst the flowerbuds are still small ready for action  the two or three upper internodes whilst young steadily revolve those on one plant made two circles against the course of the sun in 3 hrs 12 m in a second plant the same course was followed and the two circles were completed in 3 hrs 41 m in a third plant the internodes followed the sun and made two circles in 3 hrs 47 m  the average rate of these six revolutions was 1 hr 46 m  the stem shows no tendency to twine spirally round a support but the allied tendrilbearing genus paullinia is said mohl p 4 to be a twiner the flowerpeduncles which stand up above the end of the shoot are carried round and round by the revolving movement of the internodes and when the stem is securely tied the long and thin flower peduncles themselves are seen to be in continued and sometimes rapid movement from side to side  they sweep a wide space but only occasionally revolve in a regular elliptical course  by the combined movements of the internodes and peduncles one of the two short hooked tendrils sooner or later catches hold of some twig or branch and then it curls round and securely grasps it  these tendrils are however but slightly sensitive for by rubbing their under surface only a slight movement is slowly produced  i hooked a tendril on to a twig and in 1 hr 45 m it was curved considerably inwards in 2 hrs 30 m it formed a ring and in from 5 to 6 hours from being first hooked it closely grasped the stick  a second tendril acted at nearly the same rate but i observed one that took 24 hours before it curled twice round a thin twig  tendrils which have caught nothing spontaneously curl up to a close helix after the interval of several days  those which have curled round some object soon become a little thicker and tougher  the long and thin main peduncle though spontaneously moving is not sensitive and never clasps a support  nor does it ever contract spirally 33 although a contraction of this kind apparently would have been of service to the plant in climbing  nevertheless it climbs pretty well without this aid  the seedcapsules though light are of enormous size hence its english name of balloonvine and as two or three are carried on the same peduncle the tendrils rising close to them may be of service in preventing their being dashed to pieces by the wind in the hothouse the tendrils served simply for climbing  the position of the tendrils alone suffices to show their homological nature  in two instances one of two tendrils produced a flower at its tip this however did not prevent its acting properly and curling round a twig  in a third case both lateral branches which ought to have been modified into tendrils produced flowers like the central branch and had quite lost their tendrilstructure  i have seen but was not enabled carefully to observe only one other climbing sapindaceous plant namely paullinia  it was not in flower yet bore long forked tendrils  so that paullinia with respect to its tendrils appears to bear the same relation to cardiospermum that cissus does to vitis  passifloraceaeafter reading the discussion and facts given by mohl p 47 on the nature of the tendrils in this family no one can doubt that they are modified flowerpeduncles  the tendrils and the flowerpeduncles rise close side by side and my son william e darwin made sketches for me of their earliest state of development in the hybrid p floribunda  the two organs appear at first as a single papilla which gradually divides so that the tendril appears to be a modified branch of the flowerpeduncle  my son found one very young tendril surmounted by traces of floral organs exactly like those on the summit of the true flowerpeduncle at the same early age  passiflora gracilisthis wellnamed elegant annual species differs from the other members of the group observed by me in the young internodes having the power of revolving  it exceeds all the other climbing plants which i have examined in the rapidity of its movements and all tendrilbearers in the sensitiveness of the tendrils  the internode which carries the upper active tendril and which likewise carries one or two younger immature internodes made three revolutions following the sun at an average rate of 1 hr 4 m it then made the day becoming very hot three other revolutions at an average rate of between 57 and 58 m so that the average of all six revolutions was 1 hr 1 m  the apex of the tendril describes elongated ellipses sometimes narrow and sometimes broad with their longer axes inclined in slightly different directions  the plant can ascend a thin upright stick by the aid of its tendrils but the stem is too stiff for it to twine spirally round it even when not interfered with by the tendrils these having been successively pinched off at an early age  when the stem is secured the tendrils are seen to revolve in nearly the same manner and at the same rate as the internodes 34  the tendrils are very thin delicate and straight with the exception of the tips which are a little curved they are from 7 to 9 inches in length  a halfgrown tendril is not sensitive but when nearly full grown they are extremely sensitive  a single delicate touch on the concave surface of the tip soon caused one to curve and in 2 minutes it formed an open helix  a loop of soft thread weighing one thirty second of a grain 202 mg placed most gently on the tip thrice caused distinct curvature  a bent bit of thin platina wire weighing only fiftieth of a grain 123 mg twice produced the same effect but this latter weight when left suspended did not suffice to cause a permanent curvature  these trials were made under a bellglass so that the loops of thread and wire were not agitated by the wind  the movement after a touch is very rapid  i took hold of the lower part of several tendrils and then touched their concave tips with a thin twig and watched them carefully through a lens the tips evidently began to bend after the following intervals31 25 32 31 28 39 31 and 30 seconds so that the movement was generally perceptible in half a minute after a touch but on one occasion it was distinctly visible in 25 seconds  one of the tendrils which thus became bent in 31 seconds had been touched two hours previously and had coiled into a helix so that in this interval it had straightened itself and had perfectly recovered its irritability  to ascertain how often the same tendril would become curved when touched i kept a plant in my study which from being cooler than the hothouse was not very favourable for the experiment  the extremity was gently rubbed four or five times with a thin stick and this was done as often as it was observed to have become nearly straight again after having been in action and in the course of 54 hrs it answered to the stimulus 21 times becoming each time hooked or spiral  on the last occasion however the movement was very slight and soon afterwards permanent spiral contraction commenced  no trials were made during the night so that the tendril would perhaps have answered a greater number of times to the stimulus though on the other hand from having no rest it might have become exhausted from so many quickly repeated efforts  i repeated the experiment made on the echinocystis and placed several plants of this passiflora so close together that their tendrils were repeatedly dragged over each other but no curvature ensued  i likewise repeatedly flirted small drops of water from a brush on many tendrils and syringed others so violently that the whole tendril was dashed about but they never became curved  the impact from the drops of water was felt far more distinctly on my hand than that from the loops of thread weighing one thirtysecond of a grain when allowed to fall on it from a height and these loops which caused the tendrils to become curved had been placed most gently on them  hence it is clear that the tendrils either have become habituated to the touch of other tendrils and drops of rain or that they were from the first rendered sensitive only to prolonged though excessively slight pressure of solid objects with the exclusion of that from other tendrils  to show the difference in the kind of sensitiveness in different plants and likewise to show the force of the syringe used i may add that the lightest jet from it instantly caused the leaves of a mimosa to close whereas the loop of thread weighing one thirtysecond of a grain when rolled into a ball and placed gently on the glands at the bases of the leaflets of the mimosa caused no action  passiflora punctatathe internodes do not move but the tendrils revolve regularly  a halfgrown and very sensitive tendril made three revolutions opposed to the course of the sun in 3 hrs 5 m 2 hrs 40 m and 2 hrs 50 m perhaps it might have travelled more quickly when nearly fullgrown  a plant was placed in front of a window and as with twining stems the light accelerated the movement of the tendril in one direction and retarded it in the other the semicircle towards the light being performed in one instance in 15 m less time and in a second instance in 20 m less time than that required by the semicircle towards the dark end of the room  considering the extreme tenuity of these tendrils the action of the light on them is remarkable  the tendrils are long and as just stated very thin with the tip slightly curved or hooked  the concave side is extremely sensitive to a toucheven a single touch causing it to curl inwards it subsequently straightened itself and was again ready to act  a loop of soft thread weighing one fourteenth of a grain 4625 mg caused the extreme tip to bend another time i tried to hang the same little loop on an inclined tendril but three times it slid off yet this extraordinarily slight degree of friction sufficed to make the tip curl  the tendril though so sensitive does not move very quickly after a touch no conspicuous movement being observable until 5 or 10 m had elapsed the convex side of the tip is not sensitive to a touch or to a suspended loop of thread  on one occasion i observed a tendril revolving with the convex side of the tip forwards and in consequence it was not able to clasp a stick against which it scraped whereas tendrils revolving with the concave side forward promptly seize any object in their path  passiflora quadrangularisthis is a very distinct species  the tendrils are thick long and stiff they are sensitive to a touch only on the concave surface towards the extremity  when a stick was placed so that the middle of the tendril came into contact with it no curvature ensued  in the hothouse a tendril made two revolutions each in 2 hrs 22 m in a cool room one was completed in 3 hrs and a second in 4 hrs  the internodes do not revolve nor do those of the hybrid p floribunda  tacsonia manicatahere again the internodes do not revolve  the tendrils are moderately thin and long one made a narrow ellipse in 5 hrs 20 m and the next day a broad ellipse in 5 hrs 7 m  the extremity being lightly rubbed on the concave surface became just perceptibly curved in 7 m distinctly in 10 m and hooked in 20 m  we have seen that the tendrils in the last three families namely the vitaceae sapindaceae and passifloraceae are modified flower peduncles  this is likewise the case according to de candolle as quoted by mohl with the tendrils of brunnichia one of the polygonaceae  in two or three species of modecca one of the papayaceae the tendrils as i hear from prof oliver occasionally bear flowers and fruit so that they are axial in their nature   the spiral contraction of tendrils   this movement which shortens the tendrils and renders them elastic commences in half a day or in a day or two after their extremities have caught some object  there is no such movement in any leaf climber with the exception of an occasional trace of it in the petioles of tropaeolum tricolorum  on the other hand the tendrils of all tendrilbearing plants contract spirally after they have caught an object with the following exceptions  firstly corydalis claviculata but then this plant might be called a leafclimber secondly and thirdly bignonia unguis with its close allies and cardiospermum but their tendrils are so short that their contraction could hardly occur and would be quite superfluous  fourthly smilax aspera offers a more marked exception as its tendrils are moderately long  the tendrils of dicentra whilst the plant is young are short and after attachment only become slightly flexuous in older plants they are longer and then they contract spirally  i have seen no other exceptions to the rule that tendrils after clasping with their extremities a support undergo spiral contraction  when however the tendril of a plant of which the stem is immovably fixed catches some fixed object it does not contract simply because it cannot this however rarely occurs  in the common pea the lateral branches alone contract and not the central stem and with most plants such as the vine passiflora bryony the basal portion never forms a spire  i have said that in corydalis claviculata the end of the leaf or tendril for this part may be indifferently so called does not contract into a spire  the branchlets however after they have wound round thin twigs become deeply sinuous or zigzag  moreover the whole end of the petiole or tendril if it seizes nothing bends after a time abruptly downwards and inwards showing that its outer surface has gone on growing after the inner surface has ceased to grow  that growth is the chief cause of the spiral contraction of tendrils may be safely admitted as shown by the recent researches of h de vries  i will however add one little fact in support of this conclusion  if the short nearly straight portion of an attached tendril of passiflora gracilis and as i believe of other tendrils between the opposed spires be examined it will be found to be transversely wrinkled in a conspicuous manner on the outside and this would naturally follow if the outer side had grown more than the inner side this part being at the same time forcibly prevented from becoming curved  so again the whole outer surface of a spirally wound tendril becomes wrinkled if it be pulled straight nevertheless as the contraction travels from the extremity of a tendril after it has been stimulated by contact with a support down to the base i cannot avoid doubting from reasons presently to be given whether the whole effect ought to be attributed to growth  an unattached tendril rolls itself up into a flat helix as in the case of cardiospermum if the contraction commences at the extremity and is quite regular but if the continued growth of the outer surface is a little lateral or if the process begins near the base the terminal portion cannot be rolled up within the basal portion and the tendril then forms a more or less open spire  a similar result follows if the extremity has caught some object and is thus held fast  the tendrils of many kinds of plants if they catch nothing contract after an interval of several days or weeks into a spire but in these cases the movement takes place after the tendril has lost its revolving power and hangs down it has also then partly or wholly lost its sensibility so that this movement can be of no use  the spiral contraction of unattached tendrils is a much slower process than that of attached ones  young tendrils which have caught a support and are spirally contracted may constantly be seen on the same stem with the much older unattached and uncontracted tendrils in the echinocystis i have seen a tendril with the two lateral branches encircling twigs and contracted into beautiful spires whilst the main branch which had caught nothing remained for many days straight  in this plant i once observed a main branch after it had caught a stick become spirally flexuous in 7 hrs and spirally contracted in 18 hrs  generally the tendrils of the echinocystis begin to contract in from 12 hrs to 24 hrs after catching some object whilst unattached tendrils do not begin to contract until two or three or even more days after all revolving movement has ceased a fullgrown tendril of passiflora quadrangularis which had caught a stick began in 8 hrs to contract and in 24 hrs formed several spires a younger tendril only twothirds grown showed the first trace of contraction in two days after clasping a stick and in two more days formed several spires  it appears therefore that the contraction does not begin until the tendril is grown to nearly its full length  another young tendril of about the same age and length as the last did not catch any object it acquired its full length in four days in six additional days it first became flexuous and in two more days formed one complete spire  this first spire was formed towards the basal end and the contraction steadily but slowly progressed towards the apex but the whole was not closely wound up into a spire until 21 days had elapsed from the first observation that is until 17 days after the tendril had grown to its full length  the spiral contraction of tendrils is quite independent of their power of spontaneously revolving for it occurs in tendrils such as those of lathyrus grandiflorus and ampelopsis hederacea which do not revolve  it is not necessarily related to the curling of the tips round a support as we see with the ampelopsis and bignonia capreolata in which the development of adherent discs suffices to cause spiral contraction  yet in some cases this contraction seems connected with the curling or clasping movement due to contact with a support for not only does it soon follow this act but the contraction generally begins close to the curled extremity and travels downwards to the base  if however a tendril be very slack the whole length almost simultaneously becomes at first flexuous and then spiral  again the tendrils of some few plants never contract spirally unless they have first seized hold of some object if they catch nothing they hang down remaining straight until they wither and drop off  this is the case with the tendrils of bignonia which consist of modified leaves and with those of three genera of the vitaceae which are modified flowerpeduncles  but in the great majority of cases tendrils which have never come in contact with any object after a time contract spirally  all these facts taken together show that the act of clasping a support and the spiral contraction of the whole length of the tendril are phenomena not necessarily connected  the spiral contraction which ensues after a tendril has caught a support is of high service to the plant hence its almost universal occurrence with species belonging to widely different orders  when a shoot is inclined and its tendril has caught an object above the spiral contraction drags up the shoot  when the shoot is upright the growth of the stem after the tendrils have seized some object above would leave it slack were it not for the spiral contraction which draws up the stem as it increases in length  thus there is no waste of growth and the stretched stem ascends by the shortest course  when a terminal branchlet of the tendril of cobaea catches a stick we have seen how well the spiral contraction successively brings the other branchlets one after the other into contact with the stick until the whole tendril grasps it in an inextricable knot when a tendril has caught a yielding object this is sometimes enveloped and still further secured by the spiral folds as i have seen with passiflora quadrangularis but this action is of little importance  a far more important service rendered by the spiral contraction of the tendrils is that they are thus made highly elastic  as before remarked under ampelopsis the strain is thus distributed equally between the several attached branches and this renders the whole far stronger than it otherwise would be as the branches cannot break separately  it is this elasticity which protects both branched and simple tendrils from being torn away from their supports during stormy weather  i have more than once gone on purpose during a gale to watch a bryony growing in an exposed hedge with its tendrils attached to the surrounding bushes and as the thick and thin branches were tossed to and fro by the wind the tendrils had they not been excessively elastic would instantly have been torn off and the plant thrown prostrate  but as it was the bryony safely rode out the gale like a ship with two anchors down and with a long range of cable ahead to serve as a spring as she surges to the storm  when an unattached tendril contracts spirally the spire always runs in the same direction from tip to base  a tendril on the other hand which has caught a support by its extremity although the same side is concave from end to end invariably becomes twisted in one part in one direction and in another part in the opposite direction the oppositely turned spires being separated by a short straight portion  this curious and symmetrical structure has been noticed by several botanists but has not been sufficiently explained 35  it occurs without exception with all tendrils which after catching an object contract spirally but is of course most conspicuous in the longer tendrils  it never occurs with uncaught tendrils and when this appears to have occurred it will be found that the tendril had originally seized some object and had afterwards been torn free commonly all the spires at one end of an attached tendril run in one direction and all those at the other end in the opposite direction with a single short straight portion in the middle but i have seen a tendril with the spires alternately turning five times in opposite directions with straight pieces between them and m leon has seen seven or eight such alternations  whether the spires turn once or more than once in opposite directions there are as many turns in the one direction as in the other  for instance i gathered ten attached tendrils of the bryony the longest with 33 and the shortest with only 8 spiral turns and the number of turns in the one direction was in every case the same within one as in the opposite direction  the explanation of this curious little fact is not difficult  i will not attempt any geometrical reasoning but will give only a practical illustration  in doing this i shall first have to allude to a point which was almost passed over when treating of twiningplants  if we hold in our left hand a bundle of parallel strings we can with our right hand turn these round and round thus imitating the revolving movement of a twining plant and the strings do not become twisted but if we hold at the same time a stick in our left hand in such a position that the strings become spirally turned round it they will inevitably become twisted  hence a straight coloured line painted along the internodes of a twining plant before it has wound round a support becomes twisted or spiral after it has wound round  i painted a red line on the straight internodes of a humulus mikania ceropegia convolvulus and phaseolus and saw it become twisted as the plant wound round a stick  it is possible that the stems of some plants by spontaneously turning on their own axes at the proper rate and in the proper direction might avoid becoming twisted but i have seen no such case  in the above illustration the parallel strings were wound round a stick but this is by no means necessary for if wound into a hollow coil as can be done with a narrow slip of elastic paper there is the same inevitable twisting of the axis  when therefore a free tendril coils itself into a spire it must either become twisted along its whole length and this never occurs or the free extremity must turn round as many times as there are spires formed  it was hardly necessary to observe this fact but i did so by affixing little paper vanes to the extreme points of the tendrils of echinocystis and passiflora quadrangularis and as the tendril contracted itself into successive spires the vane slowly revolved  we can now understand the meaning of the spires being invariably turned in opposite directions in tendrils which from having caught some object are fixed at both ends  let us suppose a caught tendril to make thirty spiral turns all in the same direction the inevitable result would be that it would become twisted thirty times on its own axis  this twisting would not only require considerable force but as i know by trial would burst the tendril before the thirty turns were completed  such cases never really occur for as already stated when a tendril has caught a support and is spirally contracted there are always as many turns in one direction as in the other so that the twisting of the axis in the one direction is exactly compensated by the twisting in the opposite direction  we can further see how the tendency is given to make the later formed coils opposite to those whether turned to the right or to the left which are first made  take a piece of string and let it hang down with the lower end fixed to the floor then wind the upper end holding the string quite loosely spirally round a perpendicular pencil and this will twist the lower part of the string and after it has been sufficiently twisted it will be seen to curve itself into an open spire with the curves running in an opposite direction to those round the pencil and consequently with a straight piece of string between the opposed spires  in short we have given to the string the regular spiral arrangement of a tendril caught at both ends  the spiral contraction generally begins at the extremity which has clasped a support and these firstformed spires give a twist to the axis of the tendril which necessarily inclines the basal part into an opposite spiral curvature  i cannot resist giving one other illustration though superfluous  when a haberdasher winds up ribbon for a customer he does not wind it into a single coil for if he did the ribbon would twist itself as many times as there were coils but he winds it into a figure of eight on his thumb and little finger so that he alternately takes turns in opposite directions and thus the ribbon is not twisted  so it is with tendrils with this sole difference that they take several consecutive turns in one direction and then the same number in an opposite direction but in both cases the selftwisting is avoided   summary on the nature and action of tendrils   with the majority of tendrilbearing plants the young internodes revolve in more or less broad ellipses like those made by twining plants but the figures described when carefully traced generally form irregular ellipsoidal spires  the rate of revolution varies from one to five hours in different species and consequently is in some cases more rapid than with any twining plant and is never so slow as with those many twiners which take more than five hours for each revolution  the direction is variable even in the same individual plant  in passiflora the internodes of only one species have the power of revolving  the vine is the weakest revolver observed by me apparently exhibiting only a trace of a former power in the eccremocarpus the movement is interrupted by many long pauses very few tendrilbearing plants can spirally twine up an upright stick  although the power of twining has generally been lost either from the stiffness or shortness of the internodes from the size of the leaves or from some other unknown cause the revolving movement of the stem serves to bring the tendrils into contact with surrounding objects  the tendrils themselves also spontaneously revolve  the movement begins whilst the tendril is young and is at first slow  the mature tendrils of bignonia littoralis move much slower than the internodes generally the internodes and tendrils revolve together at the same rate in cissus cobaea and most passiflorae the tendrils alone revolve in other cases as with lathyrus aphaca only the internodes move carrying with them the motionless tendrils and lastly and this is the fourth possible case neither internodes nor tendrils spontaneously revolve as with lathyrus grandiflorus and ampelopsis in most bignonias eccremocarpus mutisia and the fumariaceae the internodes petioles and tendrils all move harmoniously together  in every case the conditions of life must be favourable in order that the different parts should act in a perfect manner  tendrils revolve by the curvature of their whole length excepting the sensitive extremity and the base which parts do not move or move but little  the movement is of the same nature as that of the revolving internodes and from the observations of sachs and h de vries no doubt is due to the same cause namely the rapid growth of a longitudinal band which travels round the tendril and successively bows each part to the opposite side  hence if a line be painted along that surface which happens at the time to be convex the line becomes first lateral then concave then lateral and ultimately again convex  this experiment can be tried only on the thicker tendrils which are not affected by a thin crust of dried paint  the extremities are often slightly curved or hooked and the curvature of this part is never reversed in this respect they differ from the extremities of twining shoots which not only reverse their curvature or at least become periodically straight but curve themselves in a greater degree than the lower part  in most other respects a tendril acts as if it were one of several revolving internodes which all move together by successively bending to each point of the compass  there is however in many cases this unimportant difference that the curving tendril is separated from the curving internode by a rigid petiole  with most tendrilbearers the summit of the stem or shoot projects above the point from which the tendril arises and it is generally bent to one side so as to be out of the way of the revolutions swept by the tendril  in those plants in which the terminal shoot is not sufficiently out of the way as we have seen with the echinocystis as soon as the tendril comes in its revolving course to this point it stiffens and straightens itself and thus rising vertically up passes over the obstacle in an admirable manner  all tendrils are sensitive but in various degrees to contact with an object and curve towards the touched side  with several plants a single touch so slight as only just to move the highly flexible tendril is enough to induce curvature  passiflora gracilis possesses the most sensitive tendrils which i have observed  a bit of platina wire 002 of a grain 123 mg in weight gently placed on the concave point caused a tendril to become hooked as did a loop of soft thin cotton thread weighing one thirtysecond of a grain 202 mg  with the tendrils of several other plants loops weighing one sixteenth of a grain 405 mg sufficed  the point of a tendril of passiflora gracilis began to move distinctly in 25 seconds after a touch and in many cases after 30 seconds  asa gray also saw movement in the tendrils of the cucurbitaceous genus sicyos in 30 seconds  the tendrils of some other plants when lightly rubbed moved in a few minutes with dicentra in halfan hour with smilax in an hour and a quarter or half and with ampelopsis still more slowly  the curling movement consequent on a single touch continues to increase for a considerable time then ceases after a few hours the tendril uncurls itself and is again ready to act  when the tendrils of several kinds of plants were caused to bend by extremely light weights suspended on them they seemed to grow accustomed to so slight a stimulus and straightened themselves as if the loops had been removed  it makes no difference what sort of object a tendril touches with the remarkable exception of other tendrils and drops of water as was observed with the extremely sensitivetendrils of passiflora gracilis and of the echinocystis  i have however seen tendrils of the bryony which had temporarily caught other tendrils and often in the case of the vine  tendrils of which the extremities are permanently and slightly curved are sensitive only on the concave surface other tendrils such as those of the cobaea though furnished with horny hooks directed to one side and those of cissus discolor are sensitive on all sides  hence the tendrils of this latter plant when stimulated by a touch of equal force on opposite sides did not bend  the inferior and lateral surfaces of the tendrils of mutisia are sensitive but not the upper surface  with branched tendrils the several branches act alike but in the hanburya the lateral spurlike branch does not acquire for excellent reasons which have been explained its sensitiveness nearly so soon as the main branch  with most tendrils the lower or basal part is either not at all sensitive or sensitive only to prolonged contact  we thus see that the sensitiveness of tendrils is a special and localized capacity  it is quite independent of the power of spontaneously revolving for the curling of the terminal portion from touch does not in the least interrupt the former movement  in bignonia unguis and its close allies the petioles of the leaves as well as the tendrils are sensitive to a touch  twining plants when they come into contact with a stick curl round it invariably in the direction of their revolving movement but tendrils curl indifferently to either side in accordance with the position of the stick and the side which is first touched  the clasping movement of the extremity is apparently not steady but undulatory or vermicular in its nature as may be inferred from the curious manner in which the tendrils of the echinocystis slowly crawled round a smooth stick  as with a few exceptions tendrils spontaneously revolve it may be askedwhy have they been endowed with sensitivenesswhy when they come into contact with a stick do they not like twining plants spirally wind round it  one reason may be that they are in most cases so flexible and thin that when brought into contact with any object they would almost certainly yield and be dragged onwards by the revolving movement  moreover the sensitive extremities have no revolving power as far as i have observed and could not by this means curl round a support  with twining plants on the other hand the extremity spontaneously bends more than any other part and this is of high importance for the ascent of the plant as may be seen on a windy day  it is however possible that the slow movement of the basal and stiffer parts of certain tendrils which wind round sticks placed in their path may be analogous to that of twining plants but i hardly attended sufficiently to this point and it would have been difficult to distinguish between a movement due to extremely dull irritability from the arrestment of the lower part whilst the upper part continued to move onwards  tendrils which are only threefourths grown and perhaps even at an earlier age but not whilst extremely young have the power of revolving and of grasping any object which they touch  these two capacities are generally acquired at about the same period and both fail when the tendril is full grown  but in cobaea and passiflora punctata the tendrils begin to revolve in a useless manner before they have become sensitive  in the echinocystis they retain their sensitiveness for some time after they have ceased to revolve and after they have sunk downwards in this position even if they were able to seize an object such power would be of no service in supporting the stem  it is a rare circumstance thus to detect any superfluity or imperfection in the action of tendrilsorgans which are so excellently adapted for the functions which they have to perform but we see that they are not always perfect and it would be rash to assume that any existing tendril has reached the utmost limit of perfection  some tendrils have their revolving motion accelerated or retarded in moving to or from the light others as with the pea seem indifferent to its action others move steadily from the light to the dark and this aids them in an important manner in finding a support for instance the tendrils of bignonia capreolata bend from the light to the dark as truly as a windvane from the wind  in the eccremocarpus the extremities alone twist and turn about so as to bring their finer branches and hooks into close contact with any dark surface or into crevices and holes  a short time after a tendril has caught a support it contracts with some rare exceptions into a spire but the manner of contraction and the several important advantages thus gained have been discussed so lately that nothing need here be repeated on the subject  tendrils soon after catching a support grow much stronger and thicker and sometimes more durable to a wonderful degree and this shows how much their internal tissues must be changed  occasionally it is the part which is wound round a support which chiefly becomes thicker and stronger i have seen for instance this part of a tendril of bignonia aequinoctialis twice as thick and rigid as the free basal part  tendrils which have caught nothing soon shrink and wither but in some species of bignonia they disarticulate and fall off like leaves in autumn   any one who had not closely observed tendrils of many kinds would probably infer that their action was uniform  this is the case with the simpler kinds which simply curl round an object of moderate thickness whatever its nature may be 36  but the genus bignonia shows us what diversity of action there may be between the tendrils of closely allied species  in all the nine species observed by me the young internodes revolve vigorously the tendrils also revolve but in some of the species in a very feeble manner and lastly the petioles of nearly all revolve though with unequal power  the petioles of three of the species and the tendrils of all are sensitive to contact  in the firstdescribed species the tendrils resemble in shape a birds foot and they are of no service to the stem in spirally ascending a thin upright stick but they can seize firm hold of a twig or branch  when the stem twines round a somewhat thick stick a slight degree of sensitiveness possessed by the petioles is brought into play and the whole leaf together with the tendril winds round it  in b unguis the petioles are more sensitive and have greater power of movement than those of the last species they are able together with the tendrils to wind inextricably round a thin upright stick but the stem does not twine so well  b tweedyana has similar powers but in addition emits aerial roots which adhere to the wood  in b venusta the tendrils are converted into elongated threepronged grapnels which move spontaneously in a conspicuous manner the petioles however have lost their sensitiveness  the stem of this species can twine round an upright stick and is aided in its ascent by the tendrils seizing the stick alternately some way above and then contracting spirally in b littoralis the tendrils petioles and internodes all revolve spontaneously  the stem however cannot twine but ascends an upright stick by seizing it above with both tendrils together which then contract into a spire  the tips of these tendrils become developed into adhesive discs  b speciosa possesses similar powers of movement as the last species but it cannot twine round a stick though it can ascend by clasping the stick horizontally with one or both of its unbranched tendrils  these tendrils continually insert their pointed ends into minute crevices or holes but as they are always withdrawn by the subsequent spiral contraction the habit seems to us in our ignorance useless  lastly the stem of b capreolata twines imperfectly the muchbranched tendrils revolve in a capricious manner and bend from the light to the dark their hooked extremities even whilst immature crawl into crevices and when mature seize any thin projecting point in either case they develop adhesive discs and these have the power of enveloping the finest fibres  in the allied eccremocarpus the internodes petioles and much branched tendrils all spontaneously revolve together  the tendrils do not as a whole turn from the light but their bluntlyhooked extremities arrange themselves neatly on any surface with which they come into contact apparently so as to avoid the light  they act best when each branch seizes a few thin stems like the culms of a grass which they afterwards draw together into a solid bundle by the spiral contraction of all the branches  in cobaea the finely branched tendrils alone revolve the branches terminate in sharp hard double little hooks with both points directed to the same side and these turn by welladapted movements to any object with which they come into contact  the tips of the branches also crawl into dark crevices or holes  the tendrils and internodes of ampelopsis have little or no power of revolving the tendrils are but little sensitive to contact their hooked extremities cannot seize thin objects they will not even clasp a stick unless in extreme need of a support but they turn from the light to the dark and spreading out their branches in contact with any nearly flat surface develop discs  these adhere by the secretion of some cement to a wall or even to a polished surface and this is more than the discs of the bignonia capreolata can effect  the rapid development of these adherent discs is one of the most remarkable peculiarities possessed by any tendrils  we have seen that such discs are formed by two species of bignonia by ampelopsis and according to naudin 37 by the cucurbitaceous genus peponopsis adhaerens  in anguria the lower surface of the tendril after it has wound round a stick forms a coarsely cellular layer which closely fits the wood but is not adherent whilst in hanburya a similar layer is adherent  the growth of these cellular outgrowths depends except in the case of the haplolophium and of one species of ampelopsis on the stimulus from contact  it is a singular fact that three families so widely distinct as the bignoniaceae vitaceae and cucurbitaceae should possess species with tendrils having this remarkable power   sachs attributes all the movements of tendrils to rapid growth on the side opposite to that which becomes concave  these movements consist of revolving nutation the bending to and from the light and in opposition to gravity those caused by a touch and spiral contraction  it is rash to differ from so great an authority but i cannot believe that one at least of these movementscurvature from a touchis thus caused 38  in the first place it may be remarked that the movement of nutation differs from that due to a touch in so far that in some cases the two powers are acquired by the same tendril at different periods of growth and the sensitive part of the tendril does not seem capable of nutation  one of my chief reasons for doubting whether the curvature from a touch is the result of growth is the extraordinary rapidity of the movement  i have seen the extremity of a tendril of passiflora gracilis after being touched distinctly bent in 25 seconds and often in 30 seconds and so it is with the thicker tendril of sicyos  it appears hardly credible that their outer surfaces could have actually grown in length which implies a permanent modification of structure in so short a time  the growth moreover on this view must be considerable for if the touch has been at all rough the extremity is coiled in two or three minutes into a spire of several turns  when the extreme tip of the tendril of echinocystis caught hold of a smooth stick it coiled itself in a few hours as described at p 132 twice or thrice round the stick apparently by an undulatory movement  at first i attributed this movement to the growth of the outside black marks were therefore made and the interspaces measured but i could not thus detect any increase in length  hence it seems probable in this case and in others that the curvature of the tendril from a touch depends on the contraction of the cells along the concave side  sachs himself admits 39 that if the growth which takes place in the entire tendril at the time of contact with a support is small a considerable acceleration occurs on the convex surface but in general there is no elongation on the concave surface or there may even be a contraction in the case of a tendril of cucurbita this contraction amounted to nearly onethird of the original length  in a subsequent passage sachs seems to feel some difficulty in accounting for this kind of contraction  it must not however be supposed from the foregoing remarks that i entertain any doubt after reading de vries observations about the outer and stretched surfaces of attached tendrils afterwards increasing in length by growth  such increase seems to me quite compatible with the first movement being independent of growth  why a delicate touch should cause one side of a tendril to contract we know as little as why on the view held by sachs it should lead to extraordinarily rapid growth of the opposite side  the chief or sole reason for the belief that the curvature of a tendril when touched is due to rapid growth seems to be that tendrils lose their sensitiveness and power of movement after they have grown to their full length but this fact is intelligible if we bear in mind that all the functions of a tendril are adapted to drag up the terminal growing shoot towards the light  of what use would it be if an old and fullgrown tendril arising from the lower part of a shoot were to retain its power of clasping a support  this would be of no use and we have seen with tendrils so many instances of close adaptation and of the economy of means that we may feel assured that they would acquire irritability and the power of clasping a support at the proper agenamely youth and would not uselessly retain such power beyond the proper age    chapter vhook and rootclimbersconcluding remarks    plants climbing by the aid of hooks or merely scrambling over other plantsrootclimbers adhesive matter secreted by the rootlets general conclusions with respect to climbing plants and the stages of their development  hookclimbersin my introductory remarks i stated that besides the two first great classes of climbing plants namely those which twine round a support and those endowed with irritability enabling them to seize hold of objects by means of their petioles or tendrils there are two other classes hookclimbers and rootclimbers  many plants moreover as fritz muller has remarked 40 climb or scramble up thickets in a still more simple fashion without any special aid excepting that their leading shoots are generally long and flexible  it may however be suspected from what follows that these shoots in some cases tend to avoid the light  the few hook climbers which i have observed namely galium aparine rubus australis and some climbing roses exhibit no spontaneous revolving movement  if they had possessed this power and had been capable of twining they would have been placed in the class of twiners for some twiners are furnished with spines or hooks which aid them in their ascent  for instance the hop which is a twiner has reflexed hooks as large as those of the galium some other twiners have stiff reflexed hairs and dipladenia has a circle of blunt spines at the bases of its leaves  i have seen only one tendrilbearing plant namely smilax aspera which is furnished with reflexed spines but this is the case with several branchclimbers in south brazil and ceylon and their branches graduate into true tendrils  some few plants apparently depend solely on their hooks for climbing and yet do so efficiently as certain palms in the new and old worlds  even some climbing roses will ascend the walls of a tall house if covered with a trellis  how this is effected i know not for the young shoots of one such rose when placed in a pot in a window bent irregularly towards the light during the day and from the light during the night like the shoots of any common plant so that it is not easy to understand how they could have got under a trellis close to the wall 41  rootclimbersa good many plants come under this class and are excellent climbers  one of the most remarkable is the marcgravia umbellata the stem of which in the tropical forests of south america as i hear from mr spruce grows in a curiously flattened manner against the trunks of trees here and there it puts forth claspers roots which adhere to the trunk and if the latter be slender completely embrace it  when this plant has climbed to the light it produces free branches with rounded stems clad with sharp pointed leaves wonderfully different in appearance from those borne by the stem as long as it remains adherent  this surprising difference in the leaves i have also observed in a plant of marcgravia dubia in my hothouse  rootclimbers as far as i have seen namely the ivy hedera helix ficus repens and f barbatus have no power of movement not even from the light to the dark  as previously stated the hoya carnosa asclepiadaceae is a spiral twiner and likewise adheres by rootlets even to a flat wall  the tendrilbearing bignonia tweedyana emits roots which curve half round and adhere to thin sticks  the tecoma radicans bignoniaceae which is closely allied to many spontaneously revolving species climbs by rootlets nevertheless its young shoots apparently move about more than can be accounted for by the varying action of the light  i have not closely observed many rootclimbers but can give one curious fact  ficus repens climbs up a wall just like ivy and when the young rootlets are made to press lightly on slips of glass they emit after about a weeks interval as i observed several times minute drops of clear fluid not in the least milky like that exuded from a wound  this fluid is slightly viscid but cannot be drawn out into threads  it has the remarkable property of not soon drying a drop about the size of half a pins head was slightly spread out on glass and i scattered on it some minute grains of sand  the glass was left exposed in a drawer during hot and dry weather and if the fluid had been water it would certainly have dried in a few minutes but it remained fluid closely surrounding each grain of sand during 128 days  how much longer it would have remained i cannot say  some other rootlets were left in contact with the glass for about ten days or a fortnight and the drops of secreted fluid were now rather larger and so viscid that they could be drawn out into threads some other rootlets were left in contact during twentythree days and these were firmly cemented to the glass  hence we may conclude that the rootlets first secrete a slightly viscid fluid subsequently absorb the watery parts for we have seen that the fluid will not dry by itself and ultimately leave a cement  when the rootlets were torn from the glass atoms of yellowish matter were left on it which were partly dissolved by a drop of bisulphide of carbon and this extremely volatile fluid was rendered very much less volatile by what it had dissolved  as the bisulphide of carbon has a strong power of softening indurated caoutchouc i soaked in it during a short time several rootlets of a plant which had grown up a plaistered wall and i then found many extremely thin threads of transparent not viscid excessively elastic matter precisely like caoutchouc attached to two sets of rootlets on the same branch  these threads proceeded from the bark of the rootlet at one end and at the other end were firmly attached to particles of silex or mortar from the wall  there could be no mistake in this observation as i played with the threads for a long time under the microscope drawing them out with my dissecting needles and letting them spring back again  yet i looked repeatedly at other rootlets similarly treated and could never again discover these elastic threads  i therefore infer that the branch in question must have been slightly moved from the wall at some critical period whilst the secretion was in the act of drying through the absorption of its watery parts  the genus ficus abounds with caoutchouc and we may conclude from the facts just given that this substance at first in solution and ultimately modified into an unelastic cement 42 is used by the ficus repens to cement its rootlets to any surface which it ascends  whether other plants which climb by their rootlets emit any cement i do not know but the rootlets of the ivy placed against glass barely adhered to it yet secreted a little yellowish matter  i may add that the rootlets of the marcgravia dubia can adhere firmly to smooth painted wood  vanilla aromatica emits aerial roots a foot in length which point straight down to the ground  according to mohl p 49 these crawl into crevices and when they meet with a thin support wind round it as do tendrils  a plant which i kept was young and did not form long roots but on placing thin sticks in contact with them they certainly bent a little to that side in the course of about a day and adhered by their rootlets to the wood but they did not bend quite round the sticks and afterwards they repursued their downward course  it is probable that these slight movements of the roots are due to the quicker growth of the side exposed to the light in comparison with the other side and not because the roots are sensitive to contact in the same manner as true tendrils  according to mohl the rootlets of certain species of lycopodium act as tendrils 43   concluding remarks on climbing plants   plants become climbers in order as it may be presumed to reach the light and to expose a large surface of their leaves to its action and to that of the free air  this is effected by climbers with wonderfully little expenditure of organized matter in comparison with trees which have to support a load of heavy branches by a massive trunk  hence no doubt it arises that there are so many climbing plants in all quarters of the world belonging to so many different orders  these plants have been arranged under four classes disregarding those which merely scramble over bushes without any special aid  hookclimbers are the least efficient of all at least in our temperate countries and can climb only in the midst of an entangled mass of vegetation  rootclimbers are excellently adapted to ascend naked faces of rock or trunks of trees when however they climb trunks they are compelled to keep much in the shade they cannot pass from branch to branch and thus cover the whole summit of a tree for their rootlets require longcontinued and close contact with a steady surface in order to adhere  the two great classes of twiners and of plants with sensitive organs namely leafclimbers and tendrilbearers taken together far exceed in number and in the perfection of their mechanism the climbers of the two first classes  those which have the power of spontaneously revolving and of grasping objects with which they come in contact easily pass from branch to branch and securely ramble over a wide sunlit surface  the divisions containing twining plants leafclimbers and tendril bearers graduate to a certain extent into one another and nearly all have the same remarkable power of spontaneously revolving  does this gradation it may be asked indicate that plants belonging to one subdivision have actually passed during the lapse of ages or can pass from one state to the other  has for instance any tendril bearing plant assumed its present structure without having previously existed as a leafclimber or a twiner  if we consider leafclimbers alone the idea that they were primordially twiners is forcibly suggested  the internodes of all without exception revolve in exactly the same manner as twiners some few can still twine well and many others in an imperfect manner  several leafclimbing genera are closely allied to other genera which are simple twiners  it should also be observed that the possession of leaves with sensitive petioles and with the consequent power of clasping an object would be of comparatively little use to a plant unless associated with revolving internodes by which the leaves are brought into contact with a support although no doubt a scrambling plant would be apt as professor jaeger has remarked to rest on other plants by its leaves on the other hand revolving internodes without any other aid suffice to give the power of climbing so that it seems probable that leafclimbers were in most cases at first twiners and subsequently became capable of grasping a support and this as we shall presently see is a great additional advantage  from analogous reasons it is probable that all tendrilbearers were primordially twiners that is are the descendants of plants having this power and habit  for the internodes of the majority revolve and in a few species the flexible stem still retains the capacity of spirally twining round an upright stick  tendrilbearers have undergone much more modification than leafclimbers hence it is not surprising that their supposed primordial habits of revolving and twining have been more frequently lost or modified than in the case of leafclimbers  the three great tendrilbearing families in which this loss has occurred in the most marked manner are the cucurbitaceae passifloraceae and vitaceae  in the first the internodes revolve but i have heard of no twining form with the exception according to palm p 29 52 of momordica balsamina and this is only an imperfect twiner  in the two other families i can hear of no twiners and the internodes rarely have the power of revolving this power being confined to the tendrils  the internodes however of passiflora gracilis have the power in a perfect manner and those of the common vine in an imperfect degree so that at least a trace of the supposed primordial habit has been retained by some members of all the larger tendrilbearing groups  on the view here given it may be asked why have the species which were aboriginally twiners been converted in so many groups into leaf climbers or tendrilbearers  of what advantage has this been to them  why did they not remain simple twiners  we can see several reasons  it might be an advantage to a plant to acquire a thicker stem with short internodes bearing many or large leaves and such stems are ill fitted for twining  any one who will look during windy weather at twining plants will see that they are easily blown from their support not so with tendrilbearers or leafclimbers for they quickly and firmly grasp their support by a much more efficient kind of movement  in those plants which still twine but at the same time possess tendrils or sensitive petioles as some species of bignonia clematis and tropaeolum it can readily be observed how incomparably better they grasp an upright stick than do simple twiners  tendrils from possessing this power of grasping an object can be made long and thin so that little organic matter is expended in their development and yet they sweep a wide circle in search of a support tendrilbearers can from their first growth ascend along the outer branches of any neighbouring bush and they are thus always fully exposed to the light twiners on the contrary are best fitted to ascend bare stems and generally have to start in the shade  within tall and dense tropical forests twining plants would probably succeed better than most kinds of tendrilbearers but the majority of twiners at least in our temperate regions from the nature of their revolving movement cannot ascend thick trunks whereas this can be affected by tendrilbearers if the trunks are branched or bear twigs and by some species if the bark is rugged  the advantage gained by climbing is to reach the light and free air with as little expenditure of organic matter as possible now with twining plants the stem is much longer than is absolutely necessary for instance i measured the stem of a kidneybean which had ascended exactly two feet in height and it was three feet in length the stem of a pea on the other hand which had ascended to the same height by the aid of its tendrils was but little longer than the height reached  that this saving of the stem is really an advantage to climbing plants i infer from the species that still twine but are aided by clasping petioles or tendrils generally making more open spires than those made by simple twiners  moreover the plants thus aided after taking one or two turns in one direction generally ascend for a space straight and then reverse the direction of their spire  by this means they ascend to a considerably greater height with the same length of stem than would otherwise have been possible and they do this with safety as they secure themselves at intervals by their clasping petioles or tendrils  we have seen that tendrils consist of various organs in a modified state namely leaves flowerpeduncles branches and perhaps stipules  with respect to leaves the evidence of their modification is ample  in young plants of bignonia the lower leaves often remain quite unchanged whilst the upper ones have their terminal leaflets converted into perfect tendrils in eccremocarpus i have seen a single lateral branch of a tendril replaced by a perfect leaflet in vicia sativa on the other hand leaflets are sometimes replaced by tendrilbranches and many other such cases could be given  but he who believes in the slow modification of species will not be content simply to ascertain the homological nature of different kinds of tendrils he will wish to learn as far as is possible by what actual steps leaves flowerpeduncles c have had their functions wholly changed and have come to serve merely as prehensile organs  in the whole group of leafclimbers abundant evidence has been given that an organ still subserving the functions of a leaf may become sensitive to a touch and thus grasp an adjoining object  with several leafclimbers the true leaves spontaneously revolve and their petioles after clasping a support grow thicker and stronger we thus see that leaves may acquire all the leading and characteristic qualities of tendrils namely sensitiveness spontaneous movement and subsequently increased strength  if their blades or laminae were to abort they would form true tendrils  and of this process of abortion we can follow every step until no trace of the original nature of the tendril is left  in mutisia clematis the tendril in shape and colour closely resembles the petiole of one of the ordinary leaves together with the midribs of the leaflets but vestiges of the laminae are still occasionally retained  in four genera of the fumariaceae we can follow the whole process of transformation  the terminal leaflets of the leaf climbing fumaria officinalis are not smaller than the other leaflets those of the leafclimbing adlumia cirrhosa are greatly reduced those of corydalis claviculata a plant which may indifferently be called a leafclimber or a tendrilbearer are either reduced to microscopical dimensions or have their blades wholly aborted so that this plant is actually in a state of transition and finally in the dicentra the tendrils are perfectly characterized  if therefore we could behold at the same time all the progenitors of dicentra we should almost certainly see a series like that now exhibited by the abovenamed three genera  in tropaeolum tricolorum we have another kind of passage for the leaves which are first formed on the young stems are entirely destitute of laminae and must be called tendrils whilst the later formed leaves have welldeveloped laminae  in all cases the acquirement of sensitiveness by the midribs of the leaves appears to stand in some close relation with the abortion of their laminae or blades  on the view here given leafclimbers were primordially twiners and tendrilbearers when formed of modified leaves were primordially leafclimbers  the latter therefore are intermediate in nature between twiners and tendrilbearers and ought to be related to both this is the case  thus the several leafclimbing species of the antirrhineae of solanum cocculus and gloriosa have within the same family and even within the same genus relatives which are twiners  in the genus mikania there are leafclimbing and twining species  the leafclimbing species of clematis are very closely allied to the tendrilbearing naravelia  the fumariaceae include closely allied genera which are leafclimbers and tendrilbearers lastly a species of bignonia is at the same time both a leafclimber and a tendrilbearer and other closely allied species are twiners  tendrils of another kind consist of modified flowerpeduncles  in this case we likewise have many interesting transitional states  the common vine not to mention the cardiospermum gives us every possible gradation between a perfectly developed tendril and a flowerpeduncle covered with flowers yet furnished with a branch forming the flowertendril  when the latter itself bears a few flowers as we know sometimes is the case and still retains the power of clasping a support we see an early condition of all those tendrils which have been formed by the modification of flower peduncles  according to mohl and others some tendrils consist of modified branches  i have not observed any such cases and know nothing of their transitional states but these have been fully described by fritz muller  the genus lophospermum also shows us how such a transition is possible for its branches spontaneously revolve and are sensitive to contact  hence if the leaves on some of the branches of the lophospermum were to abort these branches would be converted into true tendrils  nor is there anything improbable in certain branches alone being thus modified whilst others remained unaltered for we have seen with certain varieties of phaseolus that some of the branches are thin flexible and twine whilst other branches on the same plant are stiff and have no such power  if we inquire how a petiole a branch or flowerpeduncle first became sensitive to a touch and acquired the power of bending towards the touched side we get no certain answer  nevertheless an observation by hofmeister 44 well deserves attention namely that the shoots and leaves of all plants whilst young move after being shaken kerner also finds as we have seen that the flowerpeduncles of a large number of plants if shaken or gently rubbed bend to this side and it is young petioles and tendrils whatever their homological nature may be which move on being touched  it thus appears that climbing plants have utilized and perfected a widely distributed and incipient capacity which capacity as far as we can see is of no service to ordinary plants  if we further inquire how the stems petioles tendrils and flowerpeduncles of climbing plants first acquired their power of spontaneously revolving or to speak more accurately of successively bending to all points of the compass we are again silenced or at most can only remark that the power of moving both spontaneously and from various stimulants is far more common with plants than is generally supposed to be the case by those who have not attended to the subject  i have given one remarkable instance namely that of the maurandia semperflorens the young flowerpeduncles of which spontaneously revolve in very small circles and bend when gently rubbed to the touched side yet this plant certainly does not profit by these two feebly developed powers a rigorous examination of other young plants would probably show slight spontaneous movements in their stems petioles or peduncles as well as sensitiveness to a touch 45  we see at least that the maurandia might by a little augmentation of the powers which it already possesses come first to grasp a support by its flower peduncles and then by the abortion of some of its flowers as with vitis or cardiospermum acquire perfect tendrils  there is one other interesting point which deserves notice  we have seen that some tendrils owe their origin to modified leaves and others to modified flowerpeduncles so that some are foliar and others axial in their nature  it might therefore have been expected that they would have presented some difference in function  this is not the case  on the contrary they present the most complete identity in their several characteristic powers  tendrils of both kinds spontaneously revolve at about the same rate  both when touched bend quickly to the touched side and afterwards recover themselves and are able to act again  in both the sensitiveness is either confined to one side or extends all round the tendril  both are either attracted or repelled by the light  the latter property is seen in the foliar tendrils of bignonia capreolata and in the axial tendrils of ampelopsis  the tips of the tendrils in these two plants become after contact enlarged into discs which are at first adhesive by the secretion of some cement  tendrils of both kinds soon after grasping a support contract spirally they then increase greatly in thickness and strength  when we add to these several points of identity the fact that the petiole of solanum jasminoides after it has clasped a support assumes one of the most characteristic features of the axis namely a closed ring of woody vessels we can hardly avoid asking whether the difference between foliar and axial organs can be of so fundamental a nature as is generally supposed 46  we have attempted to trace some of the stages in the genesis of climbing plants  but during the endless fluctuations of the conditions of life to which all organic beings have been exposed it might be expected that some climbing plants would have lost the habit of climbing  in the cases given of certain south african plants belonging to great twining families which in their native country never twine but reassume this habit when cultivated in england we have a case in point  in the leafclimbing clematis flammula and in the tendrilbearing vine we see no loss in the power of climbing but only a remnant of the revolving power which is indispensable to all twiners and is so common as well as so advantageous to most climbers  in tecoma radicans one of the bignoniaceae we see a last and doubtful trace of the power of revolving  with respect to the abortion of tendrils certain cultivated varieties of cucurbita pepo have according to naudin 47 either quite lost these organs or bear semimonstrous representatives of them  in my limited experience i have met with only one apparent instance of their natural suppression namely in the common bean all the other species of vicia i believe bear tendrils but the bean is stiff enough to support its own stem and in this species at the end of the petiole where according to analogy a tendril ought to have existed a small pointed filament projects about a third of an inch in length and which is probably the rudiment of a tendril this may be the more safely inferred as in young and unhealthy specimens of other tendrilbearing plants similar rudiments may occasionally be observed  in the bean these filaments are variable in shape as is so frequently the case with rudimentary organs they are either cylindrical or foliaceous or are deeply furrowed on the upper surface  they have not retained any vestige of the power of revolving  it is a curious fact that many of these filaments when foliaceous have on their lower surfaces darkcoloured glands like those on the stipules which excrete a sweet fluid so that these rudiments have been feebly utilized  one other analogous case though hypothetical is worth giving nearly all the species of lathyrus possesses tendrils but l nissolia is destitute of them  this plant has leaves which must have struck everyone with surprise who has noticed them for they are quite unlike those of all common papilionaceous plants and resemble those of a grass  in another species l aphaca the tendril which is not highly developed for it is unbranched and has no spontaneous revolvingpower replaces the leaves the latter being replaced in function by large stipules  now if we suppose the tendrils of l aphaca to become flattened and foliaceous like the little rudimentary tendrils of the bean and the large stipules to become at the same time reduced in size from not being any longer wanted we should have the exact counterpart of l nissolia and its curious leaves are at once rendered intelligible to us  it may be added as serving to sum up the foregoing views on the origin of tendrilbearing plants that l nissolia is probably descended from a plant which was primordially a twiner this then became a leafclimber the leaves being afterwards converted by degrees into tendrils with the stipules greatly increased in size through the law of compensation 48  after a time the tendrils lost their branches and became simple they then lost their revolving power in which state they would have resembled the tendrils of the existing l aphaca and afterwards losing their prehensile power and becoming foliaceous would no longer be thus designated  in this last stage that of the existing l nissolia the former tendrils would reassume their original function of leaves and the stipules which were recently much developed being no longer wanted would decrease in size  if species become modified in the course of ages as almost all naturalists now admit we may conclude that l nissolia has passed through a series of changes in some degree like those here indicated  the most interesting point in the natural history of climbing plants is the various kinds of movement which they display in manifest relation to their wants  the most different organsstems branches flowerpeduncles petioles midribs of the leaf and leaflets and apparently aerial rootsall possess this power  the first action of a tendril is to place itself in a proper position  for instance the tendril of cobaea first rises vertically up with its branches divergent and with the terminal hooks turned outwards the young shoot at the extremity of the stem is at the same time bent to one side so as to be out of the way  the young leaves of clematis on the other hand prepare for action by temporarily curving themselves downwards so as to serve as grapnels  secondly if a twining plant or a tendril gets by any accident into an inclined position it soon bends upwards though secluded from the light  the guiding stimulus no doubt is the attraction of gravity as andrew knight showed to be the case with germinating plants  if a shoot of any ordinary plant be placed in an inclined position in a glass of water in the dark the extremity will in a few hours bend upwards and if the position of the shoot be then reversed the downwardbent shoot reverses its curvature but if the stolen of a strawberry which has no tendency to grow upwards be thus treated it will curve downwards in the direction of instead of in opposition to the force of gravity  as with the strawberry so it is generally with the twining shoots of the hibbertia dentata which climbs laterally from bush to bush for these shoots if placed in a position inclined downwards show little and sometimes no tendency to curve upwards  thirdly climbing plants like other plants bend towards the light by a movement closely analogous to the incurvation which causes them to revolve so that their revolving movement is often accelerated or retarded in travelling to or from the light  on the other hand in a few instances tendrils bend towards the dark  fourthly we have the spontaneous revolving movement which is independent of any outward stimulus but is contingent on the youth of the part and on vigorous health and this again of course depends on a proper temperature and other favourable conditions of life  fifthly tendrils whatever their homological nature may be and the petioles or tips of the leaves of leafclimbers and apparently certain roots all have the power of movement when touched and bend quickly towards the touched side  extremely slight pressure often suffices  if the pressure be not permanent the part in question straightens itself and is again ready to bend on being touched  sixthly and lastly tendrils soon after clasping a support but not after a mere temporary curvature contract spirally  if they have not come into contact with any object they ultimately contract spirally after ceasing to revolve but in this case the movement is useless and occurs only after a considerable lapse of time  with respect to the means by which these various movements are effected there can be little doubt from the researches of sachs and h de vries that they are due to unequal growth but from the reasons already assigned i cannot believe that this explanation applies to the rapid movements from a delicate touch  finally climbing plants are sufficiently numerous to form a conspicuous feature in the vegetable kingdom more especially in tropical forests  america which so abounds with arboreal animals as mr bates remarks likewise abounds according to mohl and palm with climbing plants and of the tendrilbearing plants examined by me the highest developed kinds are natives of this grand continent namely the several species of bignonia eccremocarpus cobaea and ampelopsis  but even in the thickets of our temperate regions the number of climbing species and individuals is considerable as will be found by counting them  they belong to many and widely different orders  to gain some rude idea of their distribution in the vegetable series i marked from the lists given by mohl and palm adding a few myself and a competent botanist no doubt could have added many more all those families in lindleys vegetable kingdom which include twiners leafclimbers or tendrilbearers  lindley divides phanerogamic plants into fiftynine alliances of these no less than thirtyfive include climbing plants of the above kinds hook and rootclimbers being excluded  to these a few cryptogamic plants must be added  when we reflect on the wide separation of these plants in the series and when we know that in some of the largest welldefined orders such as the compositae rubiaceae scrophulariaceae liliaceae c species in only two or three genera have the power of climbing the conclusion is forced on our minds that the capacity of revolving on which most climbers depend is inherent though undeveloped in almost every plant in the vegetable kingdom  it has often been vaguely asserted that plants are distinguished from animals by not having the power of movement  it should rather be said that plants acquire and display this power only when it is of some advantage to them this being of comparatively rare occurrence as they are affixed to the ground and food is brought to them by the air and rain  we see how high in the scale of organization a plant may rise when we look at one of the more perfect tendrilbearers it first places its tendrils ready for action as a polypus places its tentacula  if the tendril be displaced it is acted on by the force of gravity and rights it self  it is acted on by the light and bends towards or from it or disregards it whichever may be most advantageous  during several days the tendrils or internodes or both spontaneously revolve with a steady motion  the tendril strikes some object and quickly curls round and firmly grasps it in the course of some hours it contracts into a spire dragging up the stem and forming an excellent spring  all movements now cease by growth the tissues soon become wonderfully strong and durable the tendril has done its work and has done it in an admirable manner    footnotes

arbeiten des bot instituts in wurzburg heft iii pp 331 336  see also sachs textbook of botany english translation 1875 p 770 who concludes that torsion is the result of growth continuing in the outer layers after it has ceased or begun to cease in the inner layers  7  professor asa gray has remarked to me in a letter that in thuja occidentalis the twisting of the bark is very conspicuous  the twist is generally to the right of the observer but in noticing about a hundred trunks four or five were observed to be twisted in an opposite direction  the spanish chestnut is often much twisted there is an interesting article on this subject in the scottish farmer 1865 p 833  8  it is well known that the stems of many plants occasionally become spirally twisted in a monstrous manner and after my paper was read before the linnean society dr maxwell masters remarked to me in a letter that some of these cases if not all are dependent upon some obstacle or resistance to their upward growth  this conclusion agrees with what i have said about the twisting of stems which have twined round rugged supports but does not preclude the twisting being of service to the plant by giving greater rigidity to the stem  9  the view that the revolving movement or nutation of the stems of twining plants is due to growth is that advanced by sachs and h de vries and the truth of this view is proved by their excellent observations  10 the mechanism by which the end of the shoot remains hooked appears to be a difficult and complex problem discussed by dr h de vries ibid p 337  he concludes that it depends on the relation between the rapidity of torsion and the rapidity of nutation  11  dr h de vries also has shown ibid p 321 and 325 by a better method than that employed by me that the stems of twining plants are not irritable and that the cause of their winding up a support is exactly what i have described  12  dr h de vries states ibid p 322 that the stem of cuscuta is irritable like a tendril  13  see dr h de vries ibid  p 324 on this subject  14  comptes rendus 1844 tom xix p 295 and annales des sc nat 3rd series bot tom ii  p 163  15  i am much indebted to dr hooker for having sent me many plants from kew and to mr veitch of the royal exotic nursery for having generously given me a collection of fine specimens of climbing plants  professor asa gray prof oliver and dr hooker have afforded me as on many previous occasions much information and many references  16  journal of the linn soc bot vol ix p 344  i shall have occasion often to quote this interesting paper in which he corrects or confirms various statements made by me  17  i raised nine plants of the hybrid loasa herbertii and six of these also reversed their spire in ascending a support  18  in another genus namely davilla belonging to the same family with hibbertia fritz muller says ibid p 349 that the stem twines indifferently from left to right or from right to left and i once saw a shoot which ascended a tree about five inches in diameter reverse its course in the same manner as so frequently occurs with loasa  19  fritz muller states ibid p 349 that he saw on one occasion in the forests of south brazil a trunk about five feet in circumference spirally ascended by a plant apparently belonging to the menispermaceae  he adds in his letter to me that most of the climbing plants which there ascend thick trees are rootclimbers some being tendrilbearers  20  fritz muller has published some interesting facts and views on the structure of the wood of climbing plants in bot zeitung 1866 pp 57 66  21  it appears from a kerners interesting observations that the flowerpeduncles of a large number of plants are irritable and bend when they are rubbed or shaken  die schutzmittel des pollens 1873 p 34  22  i have already referred to the case of the twining stem of cuscuta which according to h de vries ibid p 322 is sensitive to a touch like a tendril  23  dr maxwell masters informs me that in almost all petioles which are cylindrical such as those bearing peltate leaves the woody vessels form a closed ring semilunar bands of vessels being confined to petioles which are channelled along their upper surfaces in accordance with this statement it may be observed that the enlarged and clasped petiole of the solanum with its closed ring of woody vessels has become more cylindrical than it was in its original unclasped condition  24  never having had the opportunity of examining tendrils produced by the modification of branches i spoke doubtfully about them in this essay when originally published  but since then fritz muller has described journal of linn soc vol ix p 344 many striking cases in south brazil  in speaking of plants which climb by the aid of their branches more or less modified he states that the following stages of development can be traced  1 plants supporting themselves simply by their branches stretched out at right anglesfor example chiococca  2 plants clasping a support with their unmodified branches as with securidaca  3 plants climbing by the extremities of their branches which appear like tendrils as is the case according to endlicher with helinus  4 plants with their branches much modified and temporarily converted into tendrils but which may be again transformed into branches as with certain papilionaceous plants  5 plants with their branches forming true tendrils and used exclusively for climbingas with strychnos and caulotretus  even the unmodified branches become much thickened when they wind round a support  i may add that mr thwaites sent me from ceylon a specimen of an acacia which had climbed up the trunk of a rather large tree by the aid of tendrillike curved or convoluted branchlets arrested in their growth and furnished with sharp recurved hooks  25  as far as i can make out the history of our knowledge of tendrils is as follows we have seen that palm and von mohl observed about the same time the singular phenomenon of the spontaneous revolving movement of twiningplants  palm p 58 i presume observed likewise the revolving movement of tendrils but i do not feel sure of this for he says very little on the subject  dutrochet fully described this movement of the tendril in the common pea  mohl first discovered that tendrils are sensitive to contact but from some cause probably from observing too old tendrils he was not aware how sensitive they were and thought that prolonged pressure was necessary to excite their movement  professor asa gray in a paper already quoted first noticed the extreme sensitiveness and rapidity of the movements of the tendrils of certain cucurbitaceous plants  26  fritz muller states ibid p 348 that in south brazil the trifid tendrils of haplolophium one of the bignoniaceae without having come into contact with any object terminate in smooth shining discs  these however after adhering to any object sometimes become considerably enlarged  27  comptes rendus tom xvii 1843 p 989  28 lecons de botanique c 1841 p 170  29  i am indebted to prof oliver for information on this head  in the bulletin de la societe botanique de france 1857 there are numerous discussions on the nature of the tendrils in this family  30  gardeners chronicle 1864 p 721  from the affinity of the cucurbitaceae to the passifloraceae it might be argued that the tendrils of the former are modified flowerpeduncles as is certainly the case with those of passion flowers  mr r  holland hardwickes sciencegossip 1865 p 105 states that a cucumber grew a few years ago in my own garden where one of the short prickles upon the fruit had grown out into a long curled tendril  31  trans phil soc 1812 p 314  32  dr mnab remarks trans bot soc edinburgh vol xi p 292 that the tendrils of amp veitchii bear small globular discs before they have came into contact with any object and i have since observed the same fact  these discs however increase greatly in size if they press against and adhere to any surface  the tendrils therefore of one species of ampelopsis require the stimulus of contact for the first development of their discs whilst those of another species do not need any such stimulus  we have seen an exactly parallel case with two species of bignoniaceae  33  fritz muller remarks ibid p 348 that a related genus serjania differs from cardiospermum in bearing only a single tendril and that the common peduncle contracts spirally when as frequently happens the tendril has clasped the plants own stem  34  prof asa gray informs me that the tendrils of p sicyoides revolve even at a quicker rate than those of p gracilis four revolutions were completed the temperature varying from 88 degrees 92 degrees fahr in the following times 40 m 45 m 385 m and 46 m  one halfrevolution was performed in 15 m  35  see m isid leon in bull soc bot de france tom v 1858 p 650  dr h de vries points out p 306 that i have overlooked in the first edition of this essay the following sentence by mohl after a tendril has caught a support it begins in some days to wind into a spire which since the tendril is made fast at both extremities must of necessity be in some places to the right in others to the left  but i am not surprised that this brief sentence without any further explanation did not attract my attention  36  sachs however textbook of botany eng translation 1875 p 280 has shown that which i overlooked namely that the tendrils of different species are adapted to clasp supports of different thicknesses  he further shows that after a tendril has clasped a support it subsequently tightens its hold  37  annales des sc nat bot 4th series tom xii p 89  38  it occurred to me that the movement of notation and that from a touch might be differently affected by anaesthetics in the same manner as paul bert has shown to be the case with the sleepmovements of mimosa and those from a touch  i tried the common pea and passiflora gracilis but i succeeded only in observing that both movements were unaffected by exposure for 15 hrs to a rather large dose of sulphuric ether  in this respect they present a wonderful contrast with drosera owing no doubt to the presence of absorbent glands in the latter plant  39  textbook of botany 1875 p 779  40 journal of linn soc vol ix p 348  professor g jaeger has well remarked in sachen darwins insbesondere contra wigand 1874 p 106 that it is highly characteristic of climbing plants to produce thin elongated and flexible stems  he further remarks that plants growing beneath other and taller species or trees are naturally those which would be developed into climbers anti such plants from stretching towards the light and from not being much agitated by the wind tend to produce long thin and flexible shoots  41  professor asa gray has explained as it would appear this difficulty in his review american journal of science vol xl sept 1865 p 282 of the present work  he has observed that the strong summer shoots of the michigan rose rosa setigera are strongly disposed to push into dark crevices and away from the light so that they would be almost sure to place themselves under a trellis  he adds that the lateral shoots made on the following spring emerged from the trellis as they sought the light  42  mr spiller has recently shown chemical society feb 16 1865 in a paper on the oxidation of indiarubber or caoutchouc that this substance when exposed in a fine state of division to the air gradually becomes converted into brittle resinous matter very similar to shelllac  43  fritz muller informs me that he saw in the forests of south brazil numerous black strings from some lines to nearly an inch in diameter winding spirally round the trunks of gigantic trees  at first sight he thought that they were the stems of twining plants which were thus ascending the trees  but he afterwards found that they were the aerial roots of a philodendron which grew on the branches above  these roots therefore seem to be true twiners though they use their powers to descend instead of to ascend like twining plants  the aerial roots of some other species of philodendron hang vertically downwards sometimes for a length of more than fifty feet  44  quoted by cohn in his remarkable memoir contractile gewebe im pflanzenreiche abhandl der schlesischen gesell  1861 heft i s 35  45  such slight spontaneous movements i now find have been for some time known to occur for instance with the flowerstems of brassica napus and with the leaves of many plants  sachs textbook of botany 1875 pp 766 785  fritz muller also has shown in relation to our present subject jenaischen zeitschrift bd v heft 2 p 133 that the stems whilst young of an alisma and of a linum are continually performing slight movements to all points of the compass like those of climbing plants  46  mr herbert spencer has recently argued principles of biology 1865 p 37 et seq with much force that there is no fundamental distinction between the foliar and axial organs of plants  47  annales des sc nat 4th series bot tom vi 1856 p 31  48  moquintandon elements de teratologie 1841 p 156 gives the case of a monstrous bean in which a
