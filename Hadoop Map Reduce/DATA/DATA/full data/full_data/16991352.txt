16991352	miss sarah jack of spanish town jamaica  by anthony trollope     there is nothing so melancholy as a country in its decadence unless it be a people in their decadence  i am not aware that the latter misfortune can be attributed to the anglosaxon race in any part of the world but there is reason to fear that it has fallen on an english colony in the island of jamaica  jamaica was one of those spots on which fortune shone with the full warmth of all her noonday splendour  that sun has setwhether for ever or no none but a prophet can tell but as far as a plain man may see there are at present but few signs of a coming morrow or of another summer  it is not just or proper that one should grieve over the misfortunes of jamaica with a stronger grief because her savannahs are so lovely her forests so rich her mountains so green and he rivers so rapid but it is so  it is piteous that a land so beautiful should be one which fate has marked for misfortune  had guiana with its flat level unlovely soil become povertystricken one would hardly sorrow over it as one does sorrow for jamaica  as regards scenery she is the gem of the western tropics  it is impossible to conceive spots on the earths surface more gracious to the eye than those steep green valleys which stretch down to the southwest from the blue mountain peak towards the sea and but little behind these in beauty are the rich wooded hills which in the western part of the island divide the counties of hanover and westmoreland  the hero of the tale which i am going to tell was a sugargrower in the latter district and the heroine was a girl who lived under that blue mountain peak  the very name of a sugargrower as connected with jamaica savours of fruitless struggle failure and desolation  and from his earliest growth fruitless struggle failure and desolation had been the lot of maurice cumming  at eighteen years of age he had been left by his father sole possessor of the mount pleasant estate than which in her palmy days jamaica had little to boast of that was more pleasant or more palmy  but those days had passed by before roger cumming the father of our friend had died  these misfortunes coming on the head of one another at intervals of a few years had first stunned and then killed him  his slaves rose against him as they did against other proprietors around him and burned down his house and mills his homestead and offices  those who know the amount of capital which a sugargrower must invest in such buildings will understand the extent of this misfortune  then the slaves were emancipated  it is not perhaps possible that we nowadays should regard this as a calamity but it was quite impossible that a jamaica proprietor of those days should not have done so  men will do much for philanthropy they will work hard they will give the coat from their backnay the very shirt from their body but few men will endure to look on with satisfaction while their commerce is destroyed  but even this mr cumming did bear after a while and kept his shoulder to the wheel  he kept his shoulder to the wheel till that third misfortune came upon himtill the protection duty on jamaica sugar was abolished  then he turned his face to the wall and died  his son at this time was not of age and the large but lessening property which mr cumming left behind him was for three years in the hands of trustees  but nevertheless maurice young as he was managed the estate  it was he who grew the canes and made the sugaror else failed to make it  he was the massa to whom the free negroes looked as the source from whence their wants should be supplied notwithstanding that being free they were ill inclined to work for him let his want of work be ever so sore  mount pleasant had been a very large property  in addition to his sugarcanes mr cumming had grown coffee for his land ran up into the hills of trelawney to that altitude which in the tropics seems necessary for the perfect growth of the coffee berry  but it soon became evident that labour for the double produce could not be had and the coffee plantation was abandoned  wild brush and the thick undergrowth of forest reappeared on the hillsides which had been rich with produce  and the evil recreated and exaggerated itself negroes squatted on the abandoned property and being able to live with abundance from their stolen gardens were less willing than ever to work in the cane pieces  and thus things went from bad to worse  in the good old times mr cummings sugar produce had spread itself annually over some three hundred acres but by degrees this dwindle down to half that extent of land  and then in those old golden days they had always taken a full hogshead from the acrevery often more  the estate had sometimes given four hundred hogsheads in the year  but in the days of which we now speak the crop had fallen below fifty  at this time maurice cumming was eightandtwenty and it is hardly too much to say that misfortune had nearly crushed him  but nevertheless it had not crushed him  he and some few like him had still hoped against hope had still persisted in looking forward to a future for the island which once was so generous with its gifts when his father died he might still have had enough for the wants of life had he sold his property for what it would fetch  there was money in england and the remains of large wealth  but he would not sacrifice mount pleasant or abandon jamaica and now after ten years struggling he still kept mount pleasant and the mill was still going but all other property had parted from his hands  by nature maurice cumming would have been gay and lively a man with a happy spirit and easy temper but struggling had made him silent if not morose and had saddened if not soured his temper  he had lived alone at mount pleasant or generally alone  work or want of money and the constant difficulty of getting labour for his estate had left him but little time for a young mans ordinary amusements  of the charms of ladies society he had known but little  very many of the estates around him had been absolutely abandoned as was the case with his own coffee plantation and from others men had sent away their wives and daughters  nay most of the proprietors had gone themselves leaving an overseer to extract what little might yet be extracted out of the property  it too often happened that that little was not sufficient to meet the demands of the overseer himself  the house at mount pleasant had been an irregular lowroofed picturesque residence built with only one floor and surrounded on all sides by large verandahs  in the old days it had always been kept in perfect order but now this was far from being the case  few young bachelors can keep a house in order but no bachelor young or old can do so under such a doom as that of maurice cumming  every shilling that maurice cumming could collect was spent in bribing negroes to work for him  but bribe as he would the negroes would not work  no massa  me pain here me no workee today and sambo would lay his fat hand on his fat stomach  i have said that he lived generally alone  occasionally his house on mount pleasant was enlivened by visits of an aunt a maiden sister of his mother whose usual residence was at spanish town  it is or should be known to all men that spanish town was and is the seat of jamaica legislature  but maurice was not over fond of his relative  in this he was both wrong and foolish for miss sarah jacksuch was her namewas in many respects a good woman and was certainly a rich woman  it is true that she was not a handsome woman nor a fashionable woman nor perhaps altogether an agreeable woman  she was tall thin ungainly and yellow  her voice which she used freely was harsh  she was a politician and a patriot  she regarded england as the greatest of countries and jamaica as the greatest of colonies  but much as she loved england she was very loud in denouncing what she called the perfidy of the mother to the brightest of her children  and much as she loved jamaica she was equally severe in her taunts against those of her brotherislanders who would not believe that the island might yet flourish as it had flourished in her fathers days  it is because you and men like you will not do your duty by your country she had said some score of times to mauricenot with much justice considering the laboriousness of his life  but maurice knew well what she meant  what could i do there up at spanish town he would answer among such a pack as there are there  here i may do something  and then she would reply with the full swing of her eloquence it is because you and such as you think only of yourself and not of jamaica that jamaica has come to such a pass as this  why is there a pack there as you call them in the honourable house of assembly why are not the best men in the island to be found there as the best men in england are to be found in the british house of commons  a pack indeed  my father was proud of a seat in that house and i remember the day maurice cumming when your father also thought it no shame to represent his own parish  if men like you who have a stake in the country will not go there of course the house is filled with men who have no stake  if they are a pack it is you who send them thereyou and others like you  all had its effect though at the moment maurice would shrug his shoulders and turn away his head from the torrent of the ladys discourse  but miss jack though she was not greatly liked was greatly respected  maurice would not own that she convinced him but at last he did allow his name to be put up as candidate for his own parish and in due time he became a member of the honourable house of assembly in jamaica  this honour entails on the holder of it the necessity of living at or within reach of spanish town for some ten weeks towards the chose of every year  now on the whole face of the uninhabited globe there is perhaps no spot more dull to look at more lethean in its aspect more corpselike or more cadaverous than spanish town  it is the headquarters of the government the seat of the legislature the residence of the governorbut nevertheless it is as it were a city of the very dead  here as we have said before lived miss jack in a large forlorn ghostlike house in which her father and all her family had lived before her  and as a matter of course maurice cumming when he came up to attend to his duties as a member of the legislature took up his abode with her  now at the time of which we are specially speaking he had completed the first of these annual visits  he had already benefited his country by sitting out one session of the colonial parliament and had satisfied himself that he did no other good than that of keeping away some person more objectionable than himself  he was however prepared to repeat this selfsacrifice in a spirit of patriotism for which he received a very meagre meed of eulogy from miss jack and an amount of selfapplause which was not much more extensive  down at mount pleasant i can do something he would say over and over again but what good can any man do up here  you can do your duty miss jack would answer as others did before you when the colony was made to prosper  and then they would run off into a long discussion about free labour and protective duties but at the present moment maurice cumming had another vexation on his mind over and above that arising from his wasted hours at spanish town and his fruitless labours at mount pleasant  he was in love and was not altogether satisfied with the conduct of his ladylove  miss jack had other nephews besides maurice cumming and nieces also of whom marian leslie was one  the family of the leslies lived up near newcastlein the mountains that is which stand over kingston at a distance of some eighteen miles from kingston but in a climate as different from that of the town as the climate of naples is from that of berlin  in kingston the heat is all but intolerable throughout the year by day and by night in the house and out of it in the mountains round newcastle some four thousand feet above the sea it is merely warm during the day and cool enough at night to make a blanket desirable  it is pleasant enough living up amongst those green mountains  there are no roads there for wheeled carriages nor are there carriages with or without wheels  all journeys are made on horseback  every visit paid from house to house is performed in this manner  ladies young and old live before dinner in their ridinghabits  the hospitality is free easy and unembarrassed  the scenery is magnificent  the tropical foliage is wild and luxuriant beyond measure  there may be enjoyed all that a southern climate has to offer of enjoyment without the penalties which such enjoyments usually entail  mrs leslie was a halfsister of miss jack and miss jack had been a halfsister also of mrs cumming but mrs leslie and mrs cumming had in no way been related  and it had so happened that up to the period of his legislative efforts maurice cumming had seen nothing of the leslies  soon after his arrival at spanish town he had been taken by miss jack to shandy hall for so the residence of the leslies was called and having remained there for three days had fallen in love with marian leslie  now in the west indies all young ladies flirt it is the first habit of their natureand few young ladies in the west indies were more given to flirting or understood the science better than marian leslie  maurice cumming fell violently in love and during his first visit at shandy hall found that marian was perfectionfor during this first visit her propensities were exerted altogether in his own favour that little circumstance does make such a difference in a young mans judgment of a girl  he came back fall of admiration not altogether to miss jacks dissatisfaction for miss jack was willing enough that both her nephew and her niece should settle down into married life  but then maurice met his fair one at a governors ballat a ball where red coats abounded and aidesdecamp dancing in spurs and narrowwaisted lieutenants with sashes or epaulettes  the aidesde camp and narrowwaisted lieutenants waltzed better than he did and as one after the other whisked round the ballroom with marian firmly clasped in his arms maurices feelings were not of the sweetest nor was this the worst of it  had the whisking been divided equally among ten he might have forgiven it but there was one specially narrowwaisted lieutenant who towards the end of the evening kept marian nearly wholly to himself  now to a man in love who has had but little experience of either balls or young ladies this is intolerable  he only met her twice after that before his return to mount pleasant and on the first occasion that odious soldier was not there  but a specially devout young clergyman was present an unmarried evangelical handsome young curate fresh from england and marians piety had been so excited that she had cared for no one else  it appeared moreover that the curates gifts for conversion were confined as regarded that opportunity to marions advantage  i will have nothing more to say to her said maurice to himself scowling  but just as he went away marian had given him her hand and called him mauricefor she pretended that they were cousinsand had looked into his eyes and declared that she did hope that the assembly at spanish town would soon be sitting again  hitherto she said she had not cared one straw about it  then poor maurice pressed the little fingers which lay within his own and swore that he would be at shandy hall on the day before his return to mount pleasant  so he was and there he found the narrowwaisted lieutenant not now bedecked with sash and epaulettes but lolling at his ease on mrs leslies sofa in a white jacket while marian sat at his feet telling his fortune with a book about flowers  oh a musk rose mr ewing you know what a musk rose means  then she got up and shook hands with mr cumming but her eyes still went away to the white jacket and the sofa  poor maurice had often been nearly brokenhearted in his efforts to manage his free black labourers but even that was easier than managing such as marion leslie  marian leslie was a creoleas also were miss jack and maurice cumminga child of the tropics but by no means such a child as tropical children are generally thought to be by us in more northern latitudes  she was blackhaired and blackeyed but her lips were as red and her cheeks as rosy as though she had been born and bred in regions where the snow lies in winter  she was a small pretty beautifully made little creature somewhat idle as regards the work of the world but active and strong enough when dancing or riding were required from her  her father was a banker and was fairly prosperous in spite of the poverty of his country  his house of business was at kingston and he usually slept there twice a week but he always resided at shandy hall and mrs leslie and her children knew but very little of the miseries of kingston  for be it known to all men that of all towns kingston jamaica is the most miserable  i fear that i shall have set my readers very much against marian lesliemuch more so than i would wish to do  as a rule they will not know how thoroughly flirting is an institution in the west indiespractised by all young ladies and laid aside by them when they marry exactly as their younglady names and younglady habits of various kinds are laid aside  all i would say of marian leslie is this that she understood the working of the institution more thoroughly than others did  and i must add also in her favour that she did not keep her flirting for sly corners nor did her admirers keep their distance till mamma was out of the way  it mattered not to her who was present  had she been called on to make one at a synod of the clergy of the island she would have flirted with the bishop before all his priests  and there have been bishops in the colony who would not have gainsayed her  but maurice cumming did not rightly calculate all this nor indeed did miss jack do so as thoroughly as she should have done for miss jack knew more about such matters than did poor maurice  if you like marion why dont you marry her  miss jack had once said to him and this coming from miss jack who was made of money was a great deal  she wouldnt have me maurice had answered  thats more than you know or i either was miss jacks reply  but if you like to try ill help you  with reference to this maurice as he left miss jacks residence on his return to mount pleasant had declared that marian leslie was not worth an honest mans love  psha miss jack replied marian will do like other girls  when you marry a wife i suppose you mean to be master  at any rate i shant marry her said maurice  and so he went his way back to hanover with a sore heart  and no wonder for that was the very day on which lieutenant ewing had asked the question about the musk rose  but there was a dogged constancy of feeling about maurice which could not allow him to disburden himself of his love  when he was again at mount pleasant among his sugarcanes and hogsheads he could not help thinking about marian  it is true he always thought of her as flying round that ballroom in ewings arms or looking up with rapt admiration into that young parsons face and so he got but little pleasure from his thoughts  but not the less was he in love with hernot the less though he would swear to himself three times in the day that for no earthly consideration would he marry marian leslie  the early months of the year from january to may are the busiest with a jamaica sugargrower and in this year they were very busy months with maurice cumming  it seemed as though there were actually some truth in miss jacks prediction that prosperity would return to him if he attended to his country for the prices of sugar had risen higher than they had ever been since the duty had been withdrawn and there was more promise of a crop at mount pleasant than he had seen since his reign commenced  but then the question of labour  how he slaved in trying to get work from those free negroes and alas how often he slaved in vain  but it was not all in vain for as things went on it became clear to him that in this year he would for the first time since he commenced obtain something like a return from his land  what if the turningpoint had come and things were now about to run the other way  but then the happiness which might have accrued to him from this source was dashed by his thoughts of marian leslie  why had he thrown himself in the way of that syren  why had he left mount pleasant at all  he knew that on his return to spanish town his first work would be to visit shandy hall and yet he felt that of all places in the island shandy hall was the last which he ought to visit  and then about the beginning of may when he was hard at work turning the last of his canes into sugar and rum he received his annual visit from miss jack  and whom should miss jack bring with her but mr leslie  ill tell you what it is said miss jack i have spoken to mr leslie about you and marian  then you had no business to do anything of the kind said maurice blushing up to his ears  nonsense replied miss jack i understand what i am about  of course mr leslie will want to know something about the estate  then he may go back as wise as he came for hell learn nothing from me  not that i have anything to hide  so i told him  now there are a large family of them you see and of course he cant give marian much  i dont care a straw if he doesnt give her a shilling  if she cared for me or i for her i shouldnt look after her for her money  but a little money is not a bad thing maurice said miss jack who in her time had had a good deal and had managed to take care of it  it is all one to me  but what i was going to say is thishumha  i dont like to pledge myself for fear i should raise hopes which maynt be fulfilled  dont pledge yourself to anything aunt in which marian leslie and i are concerned  but what i was going to say is this my money what little i have you know must go some day either to you or to the leslies  you may give all to them if you please  of course i may and i dare say i shall said miss jack who was beginning to be irritated  but at any rate you might have the civility to listen to me when i am endeavouring to put you on your legs  i am sure i think about nothing else morning noon and night and yet i never get a decent word from you  marian is too good for you thats the truth  but at length miss jack was allowed to open her budget and to make her proposition which amounted to thisthat she had already told mr leslie that she would settle the bulk of her property conjointly on maurice and marian if they would make a match of it  now as mr leslie had long been casting a hankering eye after miss jacks money with a strong conviction however that maurice cumming was her favourite nephew and probable heir this proposition was not unpalatable  so he agreed to go down to mount pleasant and look about him  but you may live for the next thirty years my dear miss jack mr leslie had said  yes i may miss jack replied looking very dry  and i am sure i hope you will continued mr leslie  and then the subject was allowed to drop for mr leslie knew that it was not always easy to talk to miss jack on such matters  miss jack was a person in whom i think we may say that the good predominated over the bad  she was often morose crabbed and self opinionated but then she knew her own imperfections and forgave those she loved for evincing their dislike of them  maurice cumming was often inattentive to her plainly showing that he was worried by her importunities and ill at ease in her company  but she loved her nephew with all her heart and though she dearly liked to tyrannise over him never allow herself to be really angry with him though he so frequently refused to bow to her dictation  and she loved marian leslie also though marian was so sweet and lovely and she herself so harsh and illfavoured  she loved marian though marian would often be impertinent  she forgave the flirting the lightheartedness the love of amusement  marian she said to herself was young and pretty  she miss jack had never known marians temptation  and so she resolved in her own mind that marian should be made a good and happy womanbut always as the wife of maurice cumming  but maurice turned a deaf ear to all these good tidingsor rather he turned to them an ear that seemed to be deaf  he dearly ardently loved that little flirt but seeing that she was a flirt that she had flirted so grossly when he was by he would not confess his love to a human being  he would not have it known that he was wasting his heart for a worthless little chit to whom every man was the same except that those were most eligible whose toes were the lightest and their outside trappings the brightest  that he did love her he could not help but he would not disgrace himself by acknowledging it  he was very civil to mr leslie but he would not speak a word that could be taken as a proposal for marian  it had been part of miss jacks plan that the engagement should absolutely be made down there at mount pleasant without any reference to the young lady but maurice could not be induced to break the ice  so he took mr leslie through his mills and over his canepieces talked to him about the laziness of the niggers while the niggers themselves stood by tittering and rode with him away to the high grounds where the coffee plantation had been in the good old days but not a word was said between them about marian  and yet marian was never out of his heart  and then came the day on which mr leslie was to go back to kingston and you wont have her then said miss jack to her nephew early that morning  you wont be said by me  not in this matter aunt  then you will live and die a poor man you mean that i suppose  its likely enough that i shall  theres this comfort at any rate im used to it  and then miss jack was silent again for a while  very well sir thats enough she said angrily  and then she began again  but maurice you wouldnt have to wait for my death you know  and she put out her hand and touched his arm entreating him as it were to yield to her  oh maurice she said i do so want to make you comfortable  let us speak to mr leslie  but maurice would not  he took her hand and thanked her but said that on this matter he must he his own master  very well sir she exclaimed i have done  in future you may manage for yourself  as for me i shall go back with mr leslie to kingston  and so she did  mr leslie returned that day taking her with him  when he took his leave his invitation to maurice to come to shandy hall was not very pressing  mrs leslie and the children will always be glad to see you said he  remember me very kindly to mrs leslie and the children said maurice  and so they parted  you have brought me down here on a regular fools errand said mr leslie on their journey back to town  it will all come right yet replied miss jack  take my word for it he loves her  fudge said mr leslie  but he could not afford to quarrel with his rich connection  in spite of all that he had said and thought to the contrary maurice did look forward during the remainder of the summer to his return to spanish town with something like impatience it was very dull work being there alone at mount pleasant and let him do what he would to prevent it his very dreams took him to shandy hall  but at last the slow time made itself away and he found himself once more in his aunts house  a couple of days passed and no word was said about the leslies  on the morning of the third day he determined to go to shandy hall hitherto he had never been there without staying for the night but on this occasion he made up his mind to return the same day  it would not be civil of me not to go there he said to his aunt  certainly not she replied forbearing to press the matter further but why make such a terrible hard days work of it  oh i shall go down in the cool before breakfast and then i need not have the bother of taking a bag  and in this way he started  miss jack said nothing further but she longed in her heart that she might be at marians elbow unseen during the visit  he found them all at breakfast and the first to welcome him at the hall door was marian  oh mr cumming we are so glad to see you and she looked into his eyes with a way she had that was enough to make a mans heart wild  but she not call him maurice now  miss jack had spoken to her sister mrs leslie as well as to mr leslie about this marriage scheme  just let them alone was mrs leslies advice  you cant alter marian by lecturing her  if they really love each other theyll come together and if they dont why then theyd better not  and you really mean that youre going back to spanish town today said mrs leslie to her visitor  im afraid i must  indeed i havent brought my things with me and then he again caught marians eye and began to wish that his resolution had not been so sternly made  i suppose you are so fond of that house of assembly said marian that you cannot tear yourself away for more than one day  youll not be able i suppose to find time to come to our picnic next week  maurice said he feared that he should not have time to go to a picnic  oh nonsense said fannyone of the younger girlsyou must come we cant do without him can we  marian has got your name down the first on the list of the gentlemen said another  yes and captain ewings second said bell the youngest  im afraid i must induce your sister to alter her list said maurice in his sternest manner  i cannot manage to go and im sure she will not miss me  marion looked at the little girl who had so unfortunately mentioned the warriors name and the little girl knew that she had sinned  oh we cannot possibly do without you can we marian said fanny its to be at bingleys dell and weve got a bed for you at newcastle quite near you know  and another for began bell but she stopped herself  go away to your lessons bell said marion  you know how angry mamma will be at your staying here all the morning and poor bell with a sorrowful look left the room  we are all certainly very anxious that you should come very anxious for a great many reasons said marian in a voice that was rather solemn and as though the matter were one of considerable import but if you really cannot why of course there is no more to be said  there will be plenty without me i am sure  as regards numbers i dare say there will for we shall have pretty nearly the whole of the two regiments and marian as she alluded to the officers spoke in a tone which might lead one to think that she would much rather be without them but we counted on you as being one of ourselves and as you had been away so long we thoughtwe thought and then she turned away her face and did not finish her speech  before he could make up his mind as to his answer she had risen from her chair and walked out of the room  maurice almost thought that he saw a tear in her eye as she went  he did ride back to spanish town that afternoon after an early dinner but before he went marian spoke to him alone for one minute  i hope you are not offended with me she said  offended oh no how could i be offended with you  because you seem so stern  i am sure i would do anything i could to oblige you if i knew how  it would be so shocking not to be good friends with a cousin like you  but there are so many different sorts of friends said maurice  of course there are  there are a great many friends that one does not care a bit forpeople that one meets at balls and places like that  and at picnics said maurice  well some of them there too but we are not like that are we  what could maurice do but say no and declare that their friendship was of a warmer description  and how could he resist promising to go to the picnic though as he made the promise he knew that misery would be in store for him  he did promise and then she gave him her hand and called him maurice  oh  i am so glad she said  it seemed so shocking that you should refuse to join us  and mind and be early maurice for i shall want to explain it all  we are to meet you know at clifton gate at one oclock but do you be a little before that and we shall be there  maurice cumming resolved within his own breast as he rode back to spanish town that if marian behaved to him all that day at the picnic as she had done this day at shandy hall he would ask her to be his wife before he left her  and miss jack also was to be at the picnic  there is no need of going early said she when her nephew made a fuss about the starting  people are never very punctual at such affairs as that and then they are always quite long enough  but maurice explained that he was anxious to be early and on this occasion he carried his point  when they reached clifton gate the ladies were already there not in carriages as people go to picnics in other and tamer countries but each on her own horse or her own pony  but they were not alone beside miss leslie was a gentleman whom maurice knew as lieutenant graham of the flagship at port royal and at a little distance which quite enabled him to join in the conversation was captain ewing the lieutenant with the narrow waist of the previous year  we shall have a delightful day miss leslie said the lieutenant  oh charming isnt it said marian  but now to choose a place for dinner captain ewingwhat do you say  will you commission me to select  you know im very well up in geometry and all that  but that wont teach you what sort of a place does for a picnic dinnerwill it mr cumming  and then she shook hands with maurice but did not take any further special notice of him  well all go together if you please  the commission is too important to be left to one  and then marian rode off and the lieutenant and the captain rode with her  it was open for maurice to join them if he chose but he did not choose  he had come there ever so much earlier than he need have done dragging his aunt with him because marian had told him that his services would be specially required by her  and now as soon as she saw him she went away with the two officerswent away without vouchsafing him a word  he made up his mind there on the spot that he would never think of her againnever speak to her otherwise than he might speak to the most indifferent of mortals  and yet he was a man that could struggle right manfully with the worlds troubles one who had struggled with them from his boyhood and had never been overcome  now he was unable to conceal the bitterness of his wrath because a little girl had ridden off to look for a green spot for her tablecloth without asking his assistance  picnics are i think in general rather tedious for the elderly people who accompany them  when the joints become a little stiff dinners are eaten most comfortably with the accompaniment of chairs and tables and a roof overhead is an agrement de plus  but nevertheless picnics cannot exist without a certain allowance of elderly people  the miss marians and captains ewing cannot go out to dine on the grass without some one to look after them  so the elderly people go to picnics in a dull tame way doing their duty and wishing the day over  now on the morning in question when marian rode off with captain ewing and lieutenant graham maurice cumming remained among the elderly people  a certain mr pomken a great jamaica agriculturist one of the council a man who had known the good old times got him by the button and held him fast discoursing wisely of sugar and ruin of gadsden pans and recreant negroes on all of which subjects maurice cumming was known to have an opinion of his own  but as mr pomkens words sounded into one ear into the other fell notes listened to from afarthe shrill laughing voice of marian leslie as she gave her happy order to her satellites around her and ever and anon the bass hawhaw of captain ewing who was made welcome as the chief of her attendants  that evening in a whisper to a brother councillor mr pomken communicated his opinion that after all there was not so much in that young cumming as some people said  but mr pomken had no idea that that young cumming was in love  and then the dinner came spread over half an acre  maurice was among the last who seated himself and when he did so it was in an awkward comfortless corner behind mr pomkens back and far away from the laughter and mirth of the day  but yet from his comfortless corner he could see marian as she sat in her pride of power with her friend julia davis near her a flirt as bad as herself and her satellites around her obedient to her nod and happy in her smiles  now i wont allow any more champagne said marian or who will there be steady enough to help me over the rocks to the grotto  oh you have promised me cried the captain  indeed i have not have i julia  miss davis has certainly promised me said the lieutenant  i have made no promise and dont think i shall go at all said julia who was sometimes inclined to imagine that captain ewing should be her own property  all which and much more of the kind maurice cumming could not hear but he could seeand imagine which was worse  how innocent and inane are after all the flirtings of most young ladies if all their words and doings in that line could be brought to paper  i do not know whether there be as a rule more vocal expression of the sentiment of love between a man and woman than there is between two thrushes  they whistle and call to each other guided by instinct rather than by reason  you are going home with the ladies tonight i believe said maurice to miss jack immediately after dinner  miss jack acknowledged that such was her destination for the night  then my going back to spanish town at once wont hurt any onefor to tell the truth i have had enough of this work  why maurice you were in such a hurry to come  the more fool i and so now i am in a hurry to go away  dont notice it to anybody  miss jack looked in his face and saw that he was really wretched and she knew the cause of his wretchedness  dont go yet maurice she said and then added with a tenderness that was quite uncommon with her go to her maurice and speak to her openly and freely once for all you will find that she will listen then  dear maurice do for my sake  he made no answer but walked away roaming sadly by himself among the trees  listen he exclaimed to himself  yes she will alter a dozen times in as many hours  who can care for a creature that can change as she changes  and yet he could not help caring for her  as he went on climbing among rocks he again came upon the sound of voices and heard especially that of captain ewing  now miss leslie if you will take my hand you will soon be over all the difficulty  and then a party of seven or eight scrambling over some stones came nearly on the level on which he stood in full view of him and leading the others were captain ewing and miss leslie  he turned on his heel to go away when he caught the sound of a step following him and a voice saying oh there is mr cumming and i want to speak to him and in a minute a light hand was on his arm  why are you running away from us said marian  becauseoh i dont know  i am not running away  you have your party made up and i am not going to intrude on it  what nonsense  do come now we are going to this wonderful grotto i thought it so illnatured of you not joining us at dinner  indeed you know you had promised  he did not answer her but he looked at herfull in the face with his sad eyes laden with love  she half understood his countenance but only half understood it  what is the matter maurice she said  are you angry with me will you come and join us  no marian i cannot do that  but if you can leave them and come with me for half an hour i will not keep you longer  she stood hesitating a moment while her companion remained on the spot where she had left him  come miss leslie called captain ewing  you will have it dark before we can get down  i will come with you whispered she to maurice but wait a moment  and she tripped back and in some five minutes returned after an eager argument with her friends  there she said i dont care about the grotto one bit and i will walk with you now only they will think it so odd  and so they started off together  before the tropical darkness had fallen upon them maurice had told the tale of his loveand had told it in a manner differing much from that of marians usual admirers he spoke with passion and almost with violence he declared that his heart was so full of her image that he could not rid himself of it for one minute nor would he wish to do so he said if she would be his marian his own marian his very own  but if not and then he explained to her with all a lovers warmth and with almost more than a lovers liberty what was his idea of her being his own his very own and in doing so inveighed against her usual lightheartedness in terms which at any rate were strong enough  but marian here it all well  perhaps she knew that the lesson was somewhat deserved and perhaps she appreciated at its value the love of such a man as maurice cumming weighing in her judgment the difference between him and the ewings and the grahams  and then she answered him well and prudently with words which startled him by their prudent seriousness as coming from her  she begged his pardon heartily she said for any grief which she had caused him but yet how was she to he blamed seeing that she had known nothing of his feelings  her father and mother had said something to her of this proposed marriage something but very little and she had answered by saying that she did not think maurice had any warmer regard for her than of a cousin  after this answer neither father nor mother had pressed the matter further  as to her own feelings she could then say nothing for she then knew nothing nothing but this that she loved no one better than him or rather that she loved no one else  she would ask herself if she could love him but he must give her some little time for that  in the meantimeand she smiled sweetly at him as she made the promiseshe would endeavour to do nothing that would offend him and then she added that on that evening she would dance with him any dances that he liked  maurice with a selfdenial that was not very wise contented himself with engaging her for the first quadrille  they were to dance that night in the messroom of the officers at newcastle  this scheme had been added on as an adjunct to the picnic and it therefore became necessary that the ladies should retire to their own or their friends houses at newcastle to adjust their dresses  marian leslie and julia davis were there accommodated with the loan of a small room by the majors wife and as they were brushing their hair and putting on their dancingshoes something was said between them about maurice cumming  and so you are to be mrs c of mount pleasant said julia  well i didnt think it would come to that at last  but it has not come to that and if it did why should i not be mrs c as you call it  the knight of the rueful countenance i call him  i tell you what then he is an excellent young man and the fact is you dont know him  i dont like excellent young men with long faces  i suppose you wont be let to dance quick dances at all now  i shall dance whatever dances i like as i have always done said marian with some little asperity in her tone  not you or if you do youll lose your promotion  youll never live to be my lady rue  and what will graham say  you know youve given him half a promise  thats not true juliai never gave him the tenth part of a promise  well he says so and then the words between the young ladies became a little more angry  but nevertheless in due time they came forth with faces smiling as usual with their hair brushed and without any signs of warfare  but marian had to stand another attack before the business of the evening commenced and this was from no less doughty an antagonist than her aunt miss jack  miss jack soon found that maurice had not kept his threat of going home and though she did not absolutely learn from him that he had gone so far towards perfecting her dearest hopes as to make a formal offer to marion nevertheless she did gather that things were fast that way tending  if only this dancing were over she said to herself dreading the unnumbered waltzes with ewing and the violent polkas with graham  so miss jack resolved to say one word to mariana wise word in good season said miss jack to herself how sweet a thing it is  marian said she  step here a moment i want to say a word to you  yes aunt sarah said marian following her aunt into a corner not quite in the best humour in the world for she had a dread of some further interference  are you going to dance with maurice tonight  yes i believe sothe first quadrille  well what i was going to say is this  i dont want you to dance many quick dances tonight for a reason i havethat is not a great many  why aunt what nonsense  now my dearest dearest girl it is all for your own sake  well then it must out  he does not like it you know  what he  maurice  well aunt i dont know that im bound to dance or not to dance just as mr cumming may like  papa does not mind my dancing  the people have come here to dance and you can hardly want to make me ridiculous by sitting still  and so that wise word did not appear to be very sweet  and then the amusement of the evening commenced and marian stood up for a quadrille with her lover  she however was not in the very best humour  she had as she thought said and done enough for one day in maurices favour  and she had no idea as she declared to herself of being lectured by aunt sarah  dearest marion he said to her as the quadrille came to a close it is an your power to make me so happyso perfectly happy  but then people have such different ideas of happiness she replied  they cant all see with the same eyes you know  and so they parted  but during the early part of the evening she was sufficiently discreet she did waltz with lieutenant graham and polk with captain ewing but she did so in a tamer manner than was usual with her and she made no emulous attempts to dance down other couples  when she had done she would sit down and then she consented to stand up for two quadrilles with two very tame gentlemen to whom no lover could object  and so marian your wings are regularly clipped at last said julia davis coming up to her  no more clipped than your own said marian  if sir rue wont let you waltz now what will he require of you when youre married to him  i am just as well able to waltz with whom i like as you are julia and if you say so in that way i shall think its envy  hahaha i may have envied you some of your beaux before now i dare say i have  but i certainly do not envy you sir rue  and then she went off to her partner  all this was too much for marians weak strength and before long she was again whirling round with captain ewing  come miss leslie said he let us see what we can do  graham and julia davis have been saying that your waltzing days are over but i think we can put them down  marian as she got up and raised her arm in order that ewing might put his round her waist caught maurices eye as he leaned against a wall and read in it a stern rebuke  this is too bad she said to herself  he shall not make a slave of me at any rate as yet  and away she went as madly more madly than ever and for the rest of the evening she danced with captain ewing and with him alone  there is an intoxication quite distinct from that which comes from strong drink  when the judgment is altogether overcome by the spirits this species of drunkenness comes on and in this way marian leslie was drunk that night  for two hours she danced with captain ewing and ever and anon she kept saying to herself that she would teach the world to knowand of all the world mr cumming especially that she might be lead but not driven  then about four oclock she went home and as she attempted to undress herself in her own room she burst into violent tears and opened her heart to her sister oh fanny i do love him i do love him so dearly and now he will never come to me again  maurice stood still with his back against the wall for the full two hours of marians exhibition and then he said to his aunt before he lefti hope you have now seen enough you will hardly mention her name to me again  miss jack groaned from the bottom of her heart but she said nothing  she said nothing that night to any one but she lay awake in her bed thinking till it was time to rise and dress herself  ask miss marian to come to me she said to the black girl who came to assist her  but it was not till she had sent three times that miss marian obeyed the summons  at three oclock on the following day miss jack arrived at her own hall door in spanish town  long as the distance was she ordinarily rode it all but on this occasion she had provided a carriage to bring her over as much of the journey as it was practicable for her to perform on wheels  as soon as she reached her own hall door she asked if mr cumming was at home  yes the servant said  he was in the small bookroom at the back of the house up stairs silently as if afraid of being heard she stepped up her own stairs into her own drawingroom and very silently she was followed by a pair of feet lighter and smaller than her own  miss jack was usually somewhat of a despot in her own house but there was nothing despotic about her now as she peered into the book room  this she did with her bonnet still on looking round the half opened door as though she were afraid to disturb her nephew he sat at the window looking out into the verandah which ran behind the house so intent on his thoughts that he did not hear her  maurice she said can i come in  come in oh yes of course and he turned round sharply at her  i tell you what aunt i am not well here and i cannot stay out the session  i shall go back to mount pleasant  maurice and she walked close up to him as she spoke maurice i have brought some one with me to ask your pardon  his face became red up to the roots of his hair as he stood looking at her without answering  you would grant it certainly she continued if you knew how much it would be valued  whom do you mean who is it he asked at last  one who loves you as well as you love herand she cannot love you better  come in marian  the poor girl crept in at the door ashamed of what she was induced to do but yet looking anxiously into her lovers face  you asked her yesterday to be your wife said miss jack and she did not then know her own mind  now she has had a lesson  you will ask her once again will you not maurice  what was he to say how was he to refuse when that soft little hand was held out to him when those eyes laden with tears just ventured to look into his face  i beg your pardon if i angered you last night she said  in half a minute miss jack had left the room and in the space of another thirty seconds maurice had forgiven her  i am your own now you know she whispered to him in the course of that long evening yesterday you know but the sentence was never finished  it was in vain that julia davis was illnatured and sarcastic in vain that ewing and graham made joint attempt upon her constancy from that night to the morning of her marriageand the interval was only three monthsmarian leslie was never known to flirt
