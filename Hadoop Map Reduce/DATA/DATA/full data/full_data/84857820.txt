84857820	mr gladstone and genesis  essay 5 from science and hebrew tradition   by thomas henry huxley    in controversy as in courtship the good old rule to be off with the old before one is on with the new greatly commends itself to my sense of expediency and therefore it appears to me desirable that i should preface such observations as i may have to offer upon the cloud of arguments the relevancy of which to the issue which i had ventured to raise is not always obvious put forth by mr gladstone in the january number of this review 1 by an endeavour to make clear to such of our readers as have not had the advantage of a forensic education the present net result of the discussion  i am quite aware that in undertaking this task i run all the risks to which the man who presumes to deal judicially with his own cause is liable but it is exactly because i do not shun that risk but rather earnestly desire to be judged by him who cometh after me provided that he has the knowledge and impartiality appropriate to a judge that i adopt my present course  in the article on the dawn of creation and worship it will be remembered that mr gladstone unreservedly commits himself to three propositions the first is that according to the writer of the pentateuch the waterpopulation the airpopulation and the landpopulation of the globe were created successively in the order named in the second place mr gladstone authoritatively asserts that this as part of his fourfold order has been so affirmed in our time by natural science that it may be taken as a demonstrated conclusion and established fact in the third place mr gladstone argues that the fact of this coincidence of the pentateuchal story with the results of modern investigation makes it impossible to avoid the conclusion first that either this writer was gifted with faculties passing all human experience or else his knowledge was divine and having settled to his own satisfaction that the first branch of the alternative is truly nominal and unreal mr gladstone continues so stands the plea for a revelation of truth from god a plea only to be met by questioning its possibility p 697  i am a simpleminded person wholly devoid of subtlety of intellect so that i willingly admit that there may be depths of alternative meaning in these propositions out of all soundings attainable by my poor plummet still there are a good many people who suffer under a like intellectual limitation and for once in my life i feel that i have the chance of attaining that position of a representative of average opinion which appears to be the modern ideal of a leader of men when i make free confession that after turning the matter over in my mind with all the aid derived from a careful consideration of mr gladstones reply i cannot get away from my original conviction that if mr gladstones second proposition can be shown to be not merely inaccurate but directly contradictory of facts known to every one who is acquainted with the elements of natural science the third proposition collapses of itself  and it was this conviction which led me to enter upon the present discussion i fancied that if my respected clients the people of average opinion and capacity could once be got distinctly to conceive that mr gladstones views as to the proper method of dealing with grave and difficult scientific and religious problems had permitted him to base a solemn plea for a revelation of truth from god upon an error as to a matter of fact from which the intelligent perusal of a manual of palaeontology would have saved him i need not trouble myself to occupy their time and attention 167 with further comments upon his contribution to apologetic literature it is for others to judge whether i have efficiently carried out my project or not it certainly does not count for much that i should be unable to find any flaw in my own case but i think it counts for a good deal that mr gladstone appears to have been equally unable to do so he does indeed make a great parade of authorities and i have the greatest respect for those authorities whom mr gladstone mentions if he will get them to sign a joint memorial to the effect that our present palaeontological evidence proves that birds appeared before the landpopulation of terrestrial reptiles i shall think it my duty to reconsider my positionbut not till then  it will be observed that i have cautiously used the word appears in referring to what seems to me to be absence of any real answer to my criticisms in mr gladstones reply for i must honestly confess that notwithstanding long and painful strivings after clear insight i am still uncertain whether mr gladstones defence means that the great plea for a revelation from god is to be left to perish in the dialectic desert or whether it is to be withdrawn under the protection of such skirmishers as are available for covering retreat  in particular the remarkable disquisition which covers pages 11 to 14 of mr gladstones last contribution has greatly exercised my mind socrates is reported to have said of the works of heraclitus that he who attempted to comprehend them should be a delian swimmer but that for his part what he could understand was so good that he was disposed to believe in the excellence of that which he found unintelligible in endeavouring to make myself master of mr gladstones meaning in these pages i have often been overcome by a feeling analogous to that of socrates but not quite the same that which i do understand has appeared to me so very much the reverse of good that i have sometimes permitted myself to doubt the value of that which i do not understand  in this part of mr gladstones reply in fact i find nothing of which the bearing upon my arguments is clear to me except that which relates to the question whether reptiles so far as they are represented by tortoises and the great majority of lizards and snakes which are land animals are creeping things in the sense of the pentateuchal writer or not  i have every respect for the singer of the song of the three children whoever he may have been i desire to cast no shadow of doubt upon but on the contrary marvel at the exactness of mr gladstones information as to the considerations which affected the method of the mosaic writer nor do i venture to doubt that the inconvenient intrusion of these contemptible reptilesa family fallen from greatness p 14 a miserable decayed aristocracy reduced to mere skulkers about the earth ibidin consequence apparently of difficulties about the occupation of land arising out of the earthhunger of their former serfs the mammalsinto an apologetic argument which otherwise would run quite smoothly is in every way to be deprecated still the wretched creatures stand there importunately demanding notice and however different may be the practice in that contentious atmosphere with which mr gladstone expresses and laments his familiarity in the atmosphere of science it really is of no avail whatever to shut ones eyes to facts or to try to bury them out of sight under a tumulus of rhetoric that is my experience of the elysian regions of science wherein it is a pleasure to me to think that a man of mr gladstones intimate knowledge of english life during the last quarter of a century believes my philosophic existence to have been rounded off in unbroken equanimity  however reprehensible and indeed contemptible terrestrial reptiles may be the only question which appears to me to be relevant to my argument is whether these creatures are or are not comprised under the denomination of everything that creepeth upon the ground  mr gladstone speaks of the author of the first chapter of genesis as the mosaic writer i suppose therefore that he will admit that it is equally proper to speak of the author of leviticus as the mosaic writer whether such a phrase would be used by any one who had an adequate conception of the assured results of modern biblical criticism is another matter but at any rate it cannot be denied that leviticus has as much claim to mosaic authorship as genesis therefore if one wants to know the sense of a phrase used in genesis it will be well to see what leviticus has to say on the matter hence i commend the following extract from the eleventh chapter of leviticus to mr gladstones serious attention     and these are they which are unclean unto you among the creeping    things that creep upon the earth the weasel and the mouse and    the great lizard after its kind and the gecko and the land    crocodile and the sandlizard and the chameleon these are    they which are unclean to you among all that creep v 293l  the merest sundayschool exegesis therefore suffices to prove that when the mosaic writer in genesis i 24 speaks of creeping things he means to include lizards among them  this being so it is agreed on all hands that terrestrial lizards and other reptiles allied to lizards occur in the permian strata it is further agreed that the triassic strata were deposited after these moreover it is well known that even if certain footprints are to be taken as unquestionable evidence of the existence of birds they are not known to occur in rocks earlier than the trias while indubitable remains of birds are to be met with only much later hence it follows that natural science does not affirm the statement that birds were made on the fifth day and everything that creepeth on the ground on the sixth on which mr gladstone rests his order for as is shown by leviticus the mosaic writer includes lizards among his creeping things  perhaps i have given myself superfluous trouble in the preceding argument for i find that mr gladstone is willing to assume he does not say to admit that the statement in the text of genesis as to reptiles cannot in all points be sustained p 16 but my position is that it cannot be sustained in any point so that after all it has perhaps been as well to go over the evidence again and then mr gladstone proceeds as if nothing had happened to tell us that     there remain great unshaken facts to be weighed first the fact    that such a record should have been made at all  as most peoples have their cosmogonies this fact does not strike me as having much value      secondly the fact that instead of dwelling in generalities it     has placed itself under the severe conditions of a chronological     order reaching from the first nisus of chaotic matter to     the consummated production of a fair and goodly a furnished and     a peopled world  this fact can be regarded as of value only by ignoring the fact demonstrated in my previous paper that natural science does not confirm the order asserted so far as living things are concerned and by upsetting a fact to be brought to light presently to wit that in regard to the rest of the pentateuchal cosmogony prudent science has very little to say one way or the other     thirdly the fact that its cosmogony seems in the light of the    nineteenth century to draw more and more of countenance from    the best natural philosophy  i have already questioned the accuracy of this statement and i do not observe that mere repetition adds to its value     and fourthly that it has described the successive origins of    the five great categories of present life with which human    experience was and is conversant in that order which geological    authority confirms  by comparison with a sentence on page 14 in which a fivefold order is substituted for the fourfold order on which the plea for revelation was originally founded it appears that these five categories are plants fishes birds mammals and man which mr gladstone affirms are given to us in genesis in the order of succession in which they are also given by the latest geological authorities  i must venture to demur to this statement i showed in my previous paper that there is no reason to doubt that the term great sea monster used in gen i 21 includes the most conspicuous of great sea animalsnamely whales dolphins porpoises manatees and dugongs 2 and as these are indubitable mammals it is impossible to affirm that mammals come after birds which are said to have been created on the same day moreover i pointed out that as these cetacea and sirenia are certainly modified land animals their existence implies the antecedent existence of land mammals  furthermore i have to remark that the term fishes as used technically in zoology by no means covers all the moving creatures that have life which are bidden to fill the waters in the seas gen i 2022 marine mollusks and crustacea echinoderms corals and foraminifera are not technically fishes but they are abundant in the palaeozoic rocks ages upon ages older than those in which the first evidences of true fishes appear and if in a geological book mr gladstone finds the quite true statement that plants appeared before fishes it is only by a complete misunderstanding that he can be led to imagine it serves his purpose as a matter of fact at the present moment it is a question whether on the bare evidence afforded by fossils the marine creeping thing or the marine plant has the seniority no cautious palaeontologist would express a decided opinion on the matter but if we are to read the pentateuchal statement as a scientific document and in spite of all protests to the contrary those who bring it into comparison with science do seek to make a scientific document of it then as it is quite clear that only terrestrial plants of high organisation are spoken of in verses 11 and 12 no palaeontologist would hesitate to say that at present the records of sea animal life are vastly older than those of any land plant describable as grass herb yielding seed or fruit tree  thus although in mr gladstones defence the old order passeth into new his case is not improved the fivefold order is no more affirmed in our time by natural science to be a demonstrated conclusion and established fact than the fourfold order was natural science appears to me to decline to have anything to do with either they are as wrong in detail as they are mistaken in principle  there is another change of position the value of which is not so apparent to me as it may well seem to be to those who are unfamiliar with the subject under discussion mr gladstone discards his three groups of waterpopulation airpopulation and landpopulation and substitutes for them 1 fishes 2 birds 3 mammals 4 man moreover it is assumed in a note that the higher or ordinary mammals alone were known to the mosaic writer p 6 no doubt it looks at first as if something were gained by this alteration for as i have just pointed out the word fishes can be used in two senses one of which has a deceptive appearance of adjustability to the mosaic account then the inconvenient reptiles are banished out of sight and finally the question of the exact meaning of higher and ordinary in the case of mammals opens up the prospect of a hopeful logomachy but what is the good of it all in the face of leviticus on the one hand and of palaeontology on the other  as in my apprehension there is not a shadow of justification for the suggestion that when the pentateuchal writer says fowl he excludes bats which as we shall see directly are expressly included under fowl in leviticus and as i have already shown that he demonstrably includes reptiles as well as mammals among the creeping things of the land i may be permitted to spare my readers further discussion of the fivefold order on the whole it is seen to be rather more inconsistent with genesis than its fourfold predecessor  but i have yet a fresh order to face mr gladstone p 11 understands the main statements of genesis in successive order of time but without any measurement of its divisions to be as follows  1 a period of land anterior to all life v 9 10 2 a period of vegetable life anterior to animal life v 11 12 3 a period of animal life in the order of fishes v 20 4 another stage of animal life in the order of birds 5 another in the order of beasts v 24 25 6 last of all man v 26 27  mr gladstone then tries to find the proof of the occurrence of a similar succession in sundry excellent works on geology  i am really grieved to be obliged to say that this third or is it fourth modification of the foundation of the plea for revelation originally set forth satisfies me as little as any of its predecessors  for in the first place i cannot accept the assertion that this order is to be found in genesis with respect to no 5 for example i hold as i have already said that great sea monsters includes the cetacea in which case mammals which is what i suppose mr gladstone means by beasts come in under head no 3 and not under no 5 again fowl are said in genesis to be created on the same day as fishes therefore i cannot accept an order which makes birds succeed fishes once more as it is quite certain that the term fowl includes the batsfor in leviticus xi 1319 we read and these shall ye have in abomination among the fowls the heron after its kind and the hoopoe and the batit is obvious that bats are also said to have been created at stage no 3 and as bats are mammals and their existence obviously presupposes that of terrestrial beasts it is quite clear that the latter could not have first appeared as no 5 i need not repeat my reasons for doubting whether man came last of all  as the latter half of mr gladstones sixfold order thus shows itself to be wholly unauthorised by and inconsistent with the plain language of the pentateuch i might decline to discuss the admissibility of its former half  but i will add one or two remarks on this point also does mr gladstone mean to say that in any of the works he has cited or indeed anywhere else he can find scientific warranty for the assertion that there was a period of landby which i suppose he means dry land for submerged land must needs be as old as the separate existence of the seaanterior to all life  it may be so or it may not be so but where is the evidence which would justify any one in making a positive assertion on the subject what competent palaeontologist will affirm at this present moment that he knows anything about the period at which life originated or will assert more than the extreme probability that such origin was a long way antecedent to any traces of life at present known what physical geologist will affirm that he knows when dry land began to exist or will say more than that it was probably very much earlier than any extant direct evidence of terrestrial conditions indicates  i think i know pretty well the answers which the authorities quoted by mr gladstone would give to these questions but i leave it to them to give them if they think fit  if i ventured to speculate on the matter at all i should say it is by no means certain that sea is older than dry land inasmuch as a solid terrestrial surface may very well have existed before the earth was cool enough to allow of the existence of fluid water and in this case dry land may have existed before the sea as to the first appearance of life the whole argument of analogy whatever it may be worth in such a case is in favour of the absence of living beings until long after the hot water seas had constituted themselves and of the subsequent appearance of aquatic before terrestrial forms of life but whether these protoplasts would if we could examine them be reckoned among the lowest microscopic algae or fungi or among those doubtful organisms which lie in the debatable land between animals and plants is in my judgment a question on which a prudent biologist will reserve his opinion  i think that i have now disposed of those parts of mr gladstones defence in which i seem to discover a design to rescue his solemn plea for revelation but a great deal of the proem to genesis remains which i would gladly pass over in silence were such a course consistent with the respect due to so distinguished a champion of the reconcilers  i hope that my clientsthe people of average opinionshave by this time some confidence in me for when i tell them that after all mr gladstone is of opinion that the mosaic record was meant to give moral and not scientific instruction to those for whom it was written they may be disposed to think that i must be misleading them but let them listen further to what mr gladstone says in a compendious but not exactly correct statement respecting my opinions     he holds the writer responsible for scientific precision i look    for nothing of the kind but assign to him a statement general    which admits exceptions popular which aims mainly at producing    moral impression summary which cannot but be open to more or    less of criticism of detail he thinks it is a lecture i think    it is a sermon p 5  i note incidentally that mr gladstone appears to consider that the differentia between a lecture and a sermon is that the former so far as it deals with matters of fact may be taken seriously as meaning exactly what it says while a sermon may not i have quite enough on my hands without taking up the cudgels for the clergy who will probably find mr gladstones definition unflattering  but i am diverging from my proper business which is to say that i have given no ground for the ascription of these opinions and that as a matter of fact i do not hold them and never have held them it is mr gladstone and not i who will have it that the pentateuchal cosmogony is to be taken as science  my belief on the contrary is and long has been that the pentateuchal story of the creation is simply a myth i suppose it to be an hypothesis respecting the origin of the universe which some ancient thinker found himself able to reconcile with his knowledge or what he thought was knowledge of the nature of things and therefore assumed to be true as such i hold it to be not merely an interesting but a venerable monument of a stage in the mental progress of mankind and i find it difficult to suppose that any one who is acquainted with the cosmogonies of other nationsand especially with those of the egyptians and the babylonians with whom the israelites were in such frequent and intimate communicationshould consider it to possess either more or less scientific importance than may be allotted to these  mr gladstones definition of a sermon permits me to suspect that he may not see much difference between that form of discourse and what i call a myth and i hope it may be something more than the slowness of apprehension to which i have confessed which leads me to imagine that a statement which is general but admits exceptions which is popular and aims mainly at producing moral impression summary and therefore open to criticism of detail amounts to a myth or perhaps less than a myth put algebraically it comes to this xabc always remembering that there is nothing to show the exact value of either a or b or c it is true that a is commonly supposed to equal 10 but there are exceptions and these may reduce it to 8 or 3 or 0 b also popularly means 10 but being chiefly used by the algebraist as a moral value you cannot do much with it in the addition or subtraction of mathematical values c also is quite summary and if you go into the details of which it is made up many of them may be wrong and their sum total equal to 0 or even to a minus quantity  mr gladstone appears to wish that i should 1 enter upon a sort of essay competition with the author of the pentateuchal cosmogony 2 that i should make a further statement about some elementary facts in the history of indian and greek philosophy and 3 that i should show cause for my hesitation in accepting the assertion that genesis is supported at any rate to the extent of the first two verses by the nebular hypothesis  a certain sense of humour prevents me from accepting the first invitation i would as soon attempt to put hamlets soliloquy into a more scientific shape but if i supposed the mosaic writer to be inspired as mr gladstone does it would not be consistent with my notions of respect for the supreme being to imagine him unable to frame a form of words which should accurately or at least not inaccurately express his own meaning it is sometimes said that had the statements contained in the first chapter of genesis been scientifically true they would have been unintelligible to ignorant people but how is the matter mended if being scientifically untrue they must needs be rejected by instructed people  with respect to the second suggestion it would be presumptuous in me to pretend to instruct mr gladstone in matters which lie as much within the province of literature and history as in that of science but if any one desirous of further knowledge will be so good as to turn to that most excellent and by no means recondite source of information the encyclopaedia britannica he will find under the letter e the word evolution and a long article on that subject now i do not recommend him to read the first half of the article but the second half by my friend mr sully is really very good he will there find it said that in some of the philosophies of ancient india the idea of evolution is clearly expressed brahma is conceived as the eternal selfexistent being which on its material side unfolds itself to the world by gradually condensing itself to material objects through the gradations of ether fire water earth and other elements and again in the later system of emanation of sankhya there is a more marked approach to a materialistic doctrine of evolution what little knowledge i have of the matterchiefly derived from that very instructive book die religion des buddha by c f koeppen supplemented by hardys interesting worksleads me to think that mr sully might have spoken much more strongly as to the evolutionary character of indian philosophy and especially of that of the buddhists but the question is too large to be dealt with incidentally  and with respect to early greek philosophy 3 the seeker after additional enlightenment need go no further than the same excellent storehouse of information     the early ionian physicists including thales    anaximander and anaximenes seek to explain the world as    generated out of a primordial matter which is at the same time    the universal support of things this substance is endowed with    a generative or transmutative force by virtue of which it passes    into a succession of forms they thus resemble modern    evolutionists since they regard the world with its infinite    variety of forms as issuing from a simple mode of matter  further on mr sully remarks that heraclitus deserves a prominent place in the history of the idea of evolution and he states with perfect justice that heraclitus has foreshadowed some of the special peculiarities of mr darwins views it is indeed a very strange circumstance that the philosophy of the great ephesian more than adumbrates the two doctrines which have played leading parts the one in the development of christian dogma the other in that of natural science the former is the conception of the word greek textlogos which took its jewish shape in alexandria and its christian form 4 in that gospel which is usually referred to an ephesian source of some five centuries later date and the latter is that of the struggle for existence the saying that strife is father and king of all greek text ascribed to heraclitus would be a not inappropriate motto for the origin of species  i have referred only to mr sullys article because his authority is quite sufficient for my purpose but the consultation of any of the more elaborate histories of greek philosophy such as the great work of zeller for example will only bring out the same fact into still more striking prominence i have professed no minute acquaintance with either indian or greek philosophy but i have taken a great deal of pains to secure that such knowledge as i do possess shall be accurate and trustworthy  in the third place mr gladstone appears to wish that i should discuss with him the question whether the nebular hypothesis is or is not confirmatory of the pentateuchal account of the origin of things mr gladstone appears to be prepared to enter upon this campaign with a light heart i confess i am not and my reason for this backwardness will doubtless surprise mr gladstone it is that rather more than a quarter of a century ago namely in february 1859 when it was my duty as president of the geological society to deliver the anniversary address 5 i chose a topic which involved a very careful study of the remarkable cosmogonical speculation originally promulgated by immanuel kant and subsequently by laplace which is now known as the nebular hypothesis with the help of such little acquaintance with the principles of physics and astronomy as i had gained i endeavoured to obtain a clear understanding of this speculation in all its bearings i am not sure that i succeeded but of this i am certain that the problems involved are very difficult even for those who possess the intellectual discipline requisite for dealing with them and it was this conviction that led me to express my desire to leave the discussion of the question of the asserted harmony between genesis and the nebular hypothesis to experts in the appropriate branches of knowledge and i think my course was a wise one but as mr gladstone evidently does not understand how there can be any hesitation on my part unless it arises from a conviction that he is in the right i may go so far as to set out my difficulties  they are of two kindsexegetical and scientific it appears to me that it is vain to discuss a supposed coincidence between genesis and science unless we have first settled on the one hand what genesis says and on the other hand what science says  in the first place i cannot find any consensus among biblical scholars as to the meaning of the words in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth some say that the hebrew word bara which is translated create means made out of nothing i venture to object to that rendering not on the ground of scholarship but of common sense omnipotence itself can surely no more make something out of nothing than it can make a triangular circle what is intended by made out of nothing appears to be caused to come into existence with the implication that nothing of the same kind previously existed it is further usually assumed that the heaven and the earth means the material substance of the universe hence the mosaic writer is taken to imply that where nothing of a material nature previously existed this substance appeared that is perfectly conceivable and therefore no one can deny that it may have happened but there are other very authoritative critics who say that the ancient israelite 6 who wrote the passage was not likely to have been capable of such abstract thinking and that as a matter of philology bara is commonly used to signify the fashioning or forming of that which already exists now it appears to me that the scientific investigator is wholly incompetent to say anything at all about the first origin of the material universe the whole power of his organon vanishes when he has to step beyond the chain of natural causes and effects no form of the nebular hypothesis that i know of is necessarily connected with any view of the origination of the nebular substance kants form of it expressly supposes that the nebular material from which one stellar system starts may be nothing but the disintegrated substance of a stellar and planetary system which has just come to an end therefore so far as i can see one who believes that matter has existed from all eternity has just as much right to hold the nebular hypothesis as one who believes that matter came into existence at a specified epoch in other words the nebular hypothesis and the creation hypothesis up to this point neither confirm nor oppose one another  next we read in the revisers version in which i suppose the ultimate results of critical scholarship to be embodied and the earth was waste without form in the authorised version and void most people seem to think that this phraseology intends to imply that the matter out of which the world was to be formed was a veritable chaos devoid of law and order if this interpretation is correct the nebular hypothesis can have nothing to say to it the scientific thinker cannot admit the absence of law and order anywhere or anywhen in nature sometimes law and order are patent and visible to our limited vision sometimes they are hidden but every particle of the matter of the most fantasticlooking nebula in the heavens is a realm of law and order in itself and that it is so is the essential condition of the possibility of solar and planetary evolution from the apparent chaos 7  waste is too vague a term to be worth consideration without form intelligible enough as a metaphor if taken literally is absurd for a material thing existing in space must have a superficies and if it has a superficies it has a form the wildest streaks of marestail clouds in the sky or the most irregular heavenly nebulae have surely just as much form as a geometrical tetrahedron and as for void how can that be void which is full of matter as poetry these lines are vivid and admirable as a scientific statement which they must be taken to be if any one is justified in comparing them with another scientific statement they fail to convey any intelligible conception to my mind  the account proceeds and darkness was upon the face of the deep so be it but where then is the likeness to the celestial nebulae of the existence of which we should know nothing unless they shone with a light of their own and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters i have met with no form of the nebular hypothesis which involves anything analogous to this process  i have said enough to explain some of the difficulties which arise in my mind when i try to ascertain whether there is any foundation for the contention that the statements contained in the first two verses of genesis are supported by the nebular hypothesis the result does not appear to me to be exactly favourable to that contention the nebular hypothesis assumes the existence of matter having definite properties as its foundation whether such matter was created a few thousand years ago or whether it has existed through an eternal series of metamorphoses of which our present universe is only the last stage are alternatives neither of which is scientifically untenable and neither scientifically demonstrable but science knows nothing of any stage in which the universe could be said in other than a metaphorical and popular sense to be formless or empty or in any respect less the seat of law and order than it is now one might as well talk of a freshlaid hens egg being without form and void because the chick therein is potential and not actual as apply such terms to the nebulous mass which contains a potential solar system  until some further enlightenment comes to me then i confess myself wholly unable to understand the way in which the nebular hypothesis is to be converted into an ally of the mosaic writer 8  but mr gladstone informs us that professor dana and professor guyot are prepared to prove that the first or cosmogonical portion of the proem not only accords with but teaches the nebular hypothesis there is no one to whose authority on geological questions i am more readily disposed to bow than that of my eminent friend professor dana but i am familiar with what he has previously said on this topic in his wellknown and standard work into which strangely enough it does not seem to have occurred to mr gladstone to look before he set out upon his present undertaking and unless professor danas latest contribution which i have not yet met with takes up altogether new ground i am afraid i shall not be able to extricate myself by its help from my present difficulties  it is a very long time since i began to think about the relations between modern scientifically ascertained truths and the cosmogonical speculations of the writer of genesis and as i think that mr gladstone might have been able to put his case with a good deal more force if he had thought it worth while to consult the last chapter of professor danas admirable manual of geology so i think he might have been made aware that he was undertaking an enterprise of which he had not counted the cost if he had chanced upon a discussion of the subject which i published in 1877 9  finally i should like to draw the attention of those who take interest in these topics to the weighty words of one of the most learned and moderate of biblical critics 10     a propos de cette premiere page de la bible on a coutume de    nos jours de disserter a perte de vue sur laccord du recit    mosaique avec les sciences naturelles et comme cellesci tout    eloignees quelles sont encore de la perfection absolue ont    rendu populaires et en quelque sorte irrefragables un certain    nombre de faits generaux ou de theses fondamentales de la    cosmologie et de la geologie cest le texte sacre quon    severtue a torturer pour le faire concorder avec    ces donnees  in my paper on the interpreters of nature and the interpreters of genesis while freely availing myself of the rights of a scientific critic i endeavoured to keep the expression of my views well within those bounds of courtesy which are set by selfrespect and consideration for others i am therefore glad to be favoured with mr gladstones acknowledgment of the success of my efforts i only wish that i could accept all the products of mr gladstones gracious appreciation but there is one about which as a matter of honesty i hesitate in fact if i had expressed my meaning better than i seem to have done i doubt if the particular proffer of mr gladstones thanks would have been made  to my mind whatever doctrine professes to be the result of the application of the accepted rules of inductive and deductive logic to its subjectmatter and which accepts within the limits which it sets to itself the supremacy of reason is science whether the subjectmatter consists of realities or unrealities truths or falsehoods is quite another question i conceive that ordinary geometry is science by reason of its method and i also believe that its axioms definitions and conclusions are all true however there is a geometry of four dimensions which i also believe to be science because its method professes to be strictly scientific it is true that i cannot conceive four dimensions in space and therefore for me the whole affair is unreal but i have known men of great intellectual powers who seemed to have no difficulty either in conceiving them or at any rate in imagining how they could conceive them and therefore fourdimensioned geometry comes under my notion of science so i think astrology is a science in so far as it professes to reason logically from principles established by just inductive methods to prevent misunderstanding perhaps i had better add that i do not believe one whit in astrology but no more do i believe in ptolemaic astronomy or in the catastrophic geology of my youth although these in their day claimedand to my mind rightly claimedthe name of science if nothing is to be called science but that which is exactly true from beginning to end i am afraid there is very little science in the world outside mathematics among the physical sciences i do not know that any could claim more than that it is true within certain limits so narrow that for the present at any rate they may be neglected if such is the case i do not see where the line is to be drawn between exactly true partially true and mainly untrue forms of science and what i have said about the current theology at the end of my paper supra pp 160163 leaves i think no doubt as to the category in which i rank it for all that i think it would be not only unjust but almost impertinent to refuse the name of science to the summa of st thomas or to the institutes of calvin  in conclusion i confess that my supposed unjaded appetite for the sort of controversy in which it needed not mr gladstones express declaration to tell us he is far better practised than i am though probably without another express declaration no one would have suspected that his controversial fires are burning low is already satiated  in elysium we conduct scientific discussions in a different medium and we are liable to threatenings of asphyxia in that atmosphere of contention in which mr gladstone has been able to live alert and vigorous beyond the common race of men as if it were purest mountain air i trust that he may long continue to seek truth under the difficult conditions he has chosen for the search with unabated energyi had almost said fire     may age not wither him nor custom stale    his infinite variety  but elysium suits my less robust constitution better and i beg leave to retire thither not sorry for my experience of the other regionno one should regret experiencebut determined not to repeat it at any rate in reference to the plea for revelation     note on the proper sense of the mosaic narrative of the creation  it has been objected to my argument from leviticus suprà p 170 that the hebrew words translated by creeping things in genesis i 24 and leviticus xi 29 are different namely rehmes in the former shehretz in the latter the obvious reply to this objection is that the question is not one of words but of the meaning of words to borrow an illustration from our own language if crawling things had been used by the translators in genesis and creeping things in leviticus it would not have been necessarily implied that they intended to denote different groups of animals shehretz is employed in a wider sense than rehmes there are shehretz of the waters of the earth of the air and of the land leviticus speaks of land reptiles among other animals as shehretz genesis speaks of all creeping land animals among which land reptiles are necessarily included as rehmes our translators therefore have given the true sense when they render both shehretz and rehmes by creeping things  having taken a good deal of trouble to show what genesis iii 4 does not mean in the preceding pages perhaps it may be well that i should briefly give my opinion as to what it does mean i conceive that the unknown author of this part of the hexateuchal compilation believed and meant his readers to believe that his words as they understood themthat is to say in their ordinary natural senseconveyed the actual historical truth when he says that such and such things happened i believe him to mean that they actually occurred and not that he imagined or dreamed them when he says day i believe he uses the word in the popular sense when he says made or created i believe he means that they came into being by a process analogous to that which the people whom he addressed called making or creating and i think that unless we forget our present knowledge of nature and putting ourselves back into the position of a phoenician or a chaldaean philosopher start from his conception of the world we shall fail to grasp the meaning of the hebrew writer we must conceive the earth to be an immovable more or less flattened body with the vault of heaven above the watery abyss below and around we must imagine sun moon and stars to be set in a firmament with or in which they move and above which is yet another watery mass we must consider light and darkness to be things the alternation of which constitutes day and night independently of the existence of sun moon and stars we must further suppose that as in the case of the story of the deluge the hebrew writer was acquainted with a gentile probably chaldaean or accadian account of the origin of things in which he substantially believed but which he stripped of all its idolatrous associations by substituting elohim for ea anu bel and the like  from this point of view the first verse strikes the keynote of the whole in the beginning elohim 11 created the heaven and the earth heaven and earth were not primitive existences from which the gods proceeded as the gentiles taught on the contrary the powers preceded and created heaven and earth whether by creation is meant causing to be where nothing was before or shaping of something which preexisted seems to me to be an insoluble question  as i have pointed out the second verse has an interesting parallel in jeremiah iv 23 i beheld the earth and lo it was waste and void and the heavens and they had no light i conceive that there is no more allusion to chaos in the one than in the other the earthdisk lay in its watery envelope like the yolk of an egg in the glaire and the spirit or breath of elohim stirred the mass light was created as a thing by itself and its antithesis darkness as another thing it was supposed to be the nature of these two to alternate and a pair of alternations constituted a day in the sense of an unit of time  the next step was necessarily the formation of that firmament or dome over the earthdisk which was supposed to support the celestial waters and in which sun moon and stars were conceived to be set as in a sort of orrery the earth was still surrounded and covered by the lower waters but the upper were separated from it by the firmament beneath which what we call the air lay a second alternation of darkness and light marks the lapse of time  after this the waters which covered the earthdisk under the firmament were drawn away into certain regions which became seas while the part laid bare became dry land in accordance with the notion universally accepted in antiquity that moist earth possesses the potentiality of giving rise to living beings the land at the command of elohim put forth all sorts of plants they are made to appear thus early not i apprehend from any notion that plants are lower in the scale of being than animals which would seem to be inconsistent with the prevalence of tree worship among ancient people but rather because animals obviously depend on plants and because without crops and harvests there seemed to be no particular need of heavenly signs for the seasons  these were provided by the fourth days work light existed already but now vehicles for the distribution of light in a special manner and with varying degrees of intensity were provided i conceive that the previous alternations of light and darkness were supposed to go on but that the light was strengthened during the daytime by the sun which as a source of heat as well as of light glided up the firmament from the east and slid down in the west each day very probably each days sun was supposed to be a new one and as the light of the day was strengthened by the sun so the darkness of the night was weakened by the moon which regularly waxed and waned every month the stars are as it were thrown in and nothing can more sharply mark the doctrinal purpose of the author than the manner in which he deals with the heavenly bodies which the gentiles identified so closely with their gods as if they were mere accessories to the almanac  animals come next in order of creation and the general notion of the writer seems to be that they were produced by the medium in which they live that is to say the aquatic animals by the waters and the terrestrial animals by the land but there was a difficulty about flying things such as bats birds and insects the cosmogonist seems to have had no conception of air as an elemental body his elements are earth and water and he ignores air as much as he does fire birds fly above the earth in the open firmament or on the face of the expanse of heaven they are not said to fly through the air the choice of a generative medium for flying things therefore seemed to lie between water and earth and if we take into account the conspicuousness of the great flocks of waterbirds and the swarms of winged insects which appear to arise from water i think the preference of water becomes intelligible however i do not put this forward as more than a probable hypothesis as to the creation of aquatic animals on the fifth that of land animals on the sixth day and that of man last of all i presume the order was determined by the fact that man could hardly receive dominion over the living world before it existed and that the cattle were not wanted until he was about to make his appearance the other terrestrial animals would naturally be associated with the cattle  the absurdity of imagining that any conception analogous to that of a zoological classification was in the mind of the writer will be apparent when we consider that the fifth days work must include the zoologists cetacea sirenia and seals 12 all of which are mammalia all birds turtles seasnakes and presumably the fresh water reptilia and amphibia with the great majority of invertebrata  the creation of man is announced as a separate act resulting from a particular resolution of elohim to make man in our image after our likeness to learn what this remarkable phrase means we must turn to the fifth chapter of genesis the work of the same writer in the day that elohim created man in the likeness of elohim made he him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name adam in the day when they were created and adam lived an hundred and thirty years and begat a son in his own likeness after his image and called his name seth i find it impossible to read this passage without being convinced that when the writer says adam was made in the likeness of elohim he means the same sort of likeness as when he says that seth was begotten in the likeness of adam whence it follows that his conception of elohim was completely anthropomorphic  in all this narrative i can discover nothing which differentiates it in principle from other ancient cosmogonies except the rejection of all gods save the vague yet anthropomorphic elohim and the assigning to them anteriority and superiority to the world it is as utterly irreconcilable with the assured truths of modern science as it is with the account of the origin of man plants and animals given by the writer of the second chief constituent of the hexateuch in the second chapter of genesis this extraordinary story starts with the assumption of the existence of a rainless earth devoid of plants and herbs of the field the creation of living beings begins with that of a solitary man the next thing that happens is the laying out of the garden of eden and the causing the growth from its soil of every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the third act is the formation out of the ground of every beast of the field and every fowl of the air the fourth and last the manufacture of the first woman from a rib extracted from adam while in a state of anaesthesia  yet there are people who not only profess to take this monstrous legend seriously but who declare it to be reconcilable with the elohistic account of the creation     footnotes   footnote 1 the nineteenth century 1886  footnote 2 both

calculation it is merely a conjecture more or less plausible but perhaps in some degree necessarily true if our present laws of heat as we understand them admit of the extreme application here
