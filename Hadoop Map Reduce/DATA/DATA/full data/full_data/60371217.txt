60371217	the rise of iskander  by benjamin disraeli      chapter 1   the sun had set behind the mountains and the rich plain of athens was suffused with the violet glow of a grecian eye a light breeze rose the olivegroves awoke from their noonday trance and rustled with returning animation and the pennons of the turkish squadron that lay at anchor in the harbour of piræus twinkled in the lively air from one gate of the city the women came forth in procession to the fountain from another a band of sumptuous horsemen sallied out and threw their wanton javelins in the invigorating sky as they galloped over the plain the voice of birds the buzz of beauteous insects the breath of fragrant flowers the quivering note of the nightingale the pattering call of the grasshopper and the perfume of the violet shrinking from the embrace of the twilight breeze filled the purple air with music and with odour  a solitary being stood upon the towering crag of the acropolis amid the ruins of the temple of minerva and gazed upon the inspiring scene around him rose the matchless memorials of antique art immortal columns whose symmetry baffles modern proportion serene caryatides bearing with greater grace a graceful burthen carvings of delicate precision and friezes breathing with heroic life apparently the stranger though habited as a moslemin was not insensible to the genius of the locality nor indeed would his form and countenance have misbecome a contemporary of pericles and phidias in the prime of life and far above the common stature but with a frame the muscular power of which was even exceeded by its almost ideal symmetry white forehead his straight profile his oval countenance and his curling lip exhibited the same visage that had inspired the sculptor of the surrounding demigods  the dress of the stranger although gorgeous was however certainly not classic a crimson shawl was wound round his head and glittered with a trembling aigrette of diamonds his vest which set tight to his form was of green velvet richly embroidered with gold and pearls over this he wore a very light jacket of crimson velvet equally embroidered and lined with sable he wore also the full white camese common among the albanians and while his feet were protected by sandals the lower part of his legs was guarded by greaves of embroidered green velvet from a broad belt of scarlet leather peeped forth the jewelled hilts of a variety of daggers and by his side was an enormous scimitar in a scabbard of chased silver  the stranger gazed upon the wide prospect before him with an air of pensive abstraction beautiful greece he exclaimed thou art still my country a mournful lot is mine a strange and mournful lot yet not uncheered by hope i am at least a warrior and this arm though trained to war against thee will not well forget in the quick hour of battle the blood that flows within it themistocles saved greece and died a satrap i am bred one let me reverse our lots and die at least a patriot  at this moment the evening hymn to the virgin arose from a neighbouring convent the stranger started as the sacred melody floated towards him and taking a small golden cross from his heart he kissed it with devotion and then descending the steep of the citadel entered the city  he proceeded alone the narrow winding streets of athens until he at length arrived in front of a marble palace in the construction of which the architect had certainly not consulted the surrounding models which time bad spared to him but which however it might have offended a classic taste presented altogether a magnificent appearance halfadozen guards whose shields and helmets somewhat oddly contrasted with the two pieces of cannon one of which was ostentatiously placed on each side of the portal and which had been presented to the prince of athens by the republic of venice lounged before the entrance and paid their military homage to the stranger as he passed them he passed them and entered a large quadrangular garden surrounded by arcades supported by a considerable number of thin low pillars of barbarous workmanship and variouscoloured marbles in the midst of the garden rose a fountain whence the bubbling waters flowed in artificial channels through vistas of orange and lemon trees by the side of the fountain on a luxurious couch his eyes fixed upon a richlyilluminated volume reposed nicæus the youthful prince of athens  ah is it you said the prince looking up with a smile as the stranger advanced you have arrived just in time to remind me that we must do something more than read the persæ we must act it  my dear nicæus replied the stranger i have arrived only to bid you farewell  farewell exclaimed the prince in a tone of surprise and sorrow and he rose from the couch why what is this  it is too true said the stranger and he led the way down one of the walks events have occurred which entirely baffle all our plans and prospects and place me in a position as difficult as it is harrowing hunniades has suddenly crossed the danube in great force and carried everything before him i am ordered to proceed to albania instantly and to repair to the camp at the head of the epirots  indeed said nicæus with a thoughtful air my letters did not prepare me for this tis sudden is amurath himself in the field  no karam bey commands i have accounted for my delay to the sultan by pretended difficulties in our treaty and have held out the prospect of a larger tribute  when we are plotting that that tribute should be paid no longer added nicæus with a smile  alas my dear friend replied the turkish commander my situation has now become critical hitherto my services for the moslemin have been confined to acting against nations of their own faith i am now suddenly summoned to combat against my secret creed and the best allies of what i must yet call my secret country the movement it appears to me must be made now or never and i cannot conceal from myself that it never could have been prosecuted under less auspicious circumstances  what you desponding exclaimed nicæus then i must despair your sanguine temper has alone supported me throughout all our dangerous hopes  and Æschylus said the stranger smiling  and Æschylus certainly replied nicæus but i have lived to find even Æschylus insipid i pant for action  it may be nearer than we can foresee replied the stranger there is a god who fashions all things he will not desert a righteous cause he knoweth that my thoughts are as pure as my situation is difficult i have some dim ideas still brooding in my mind but we will not discuss them now i must away dear prince the breeze serves fairly have you ever seen hunniades  i was educated at the court of transylvania replied nicæus looking down with a somewhat embarrassed air he is a famous knight christendoms chief bulwark  the turkish commander sighed when we meet again he said may we meet with brighter hopes and more buoyant spirits at present i must indeed say farewell  the prince turned with a dejected countenance and pressed his companion to his heart tis a sad end said he to all our happy hours and lofty plans  you are as yet too young to quarrel with fortune replied the stranger and for myself i have not yet settled my accounts with her however for the present farewell dear nicæus  farewell replied the prince of athens farewell dear iskander    chapter 2   iskander was the youngest son of the prince of epirus who with the other grecian princes had at the commencement of the reign of amurath the second in vain resisted the progress of the turkish arms in europe the prince of epirus had obtained peace by yielding his four sons as hostages to the turkish sovereign who engaged that they should be educated in all the accomplishments of their rank and with a due deference to their faith on the death of the prince of epirus however amurath could not resist the opportunity that then offered itself of adding to his empire the rich principality he had long coveted a turkish force instantly marched into epirus and seized upon croia the capital city and the children of its late ruler were doomed to death the beauty talents and valour of the youngest son saved him however from the fate of his poisoned brothers iskander was educated at adrianople in the moslemin faith and as he at a very early age exceeded in feats of arms all the moslemin warriors he became a prime favourite of the sultan and speedily rose in his service to the highest rank  at this period the irresistible progress of the turkish arms was the subject of alarm throughout all christendom  constantinople then the capital of the greek empire had already been more than once besieged by the predecessors of amurath and had only been preserved by fortunate accidents and humiliating terms the despots of bosnia servia and bulgaria and the grecian princes of etolia macedon epirus athens phocis boeotia and indeed of all the regions to the straits of corinth were tributaries to amurath and the rest of europe was only preserved from his grasp by the valour of the hungarians and the poles whom a fortunate alliance had now united under the sovereignty of uladislaus who incited by the pious eloquence of the cardinal of st angelo the legate of the pope and yielding to the tears and supplications of the despot of servia had at the time our story opens quitted buda at the head of an immense army crossed the danube and joining his valiant viceroy the famous john hunniades vaivode of transylvania defeated the turks with great slaughter relieved all bulgaria and pushed on to the base of mount hæmus known in modern times as the celebrated balkan here the turkish general karam bey awaited the christians and hither to his assistance was iskander commanded to repair at the head of a body of janissaries who had accompanied him to greece and the tributary epirots  had iskander been influenced by vulgar ambition his loftiest desires might have been fully gratified by the career which amurath projected for him the turkish sultan destined for the grecian prince the hand of one of his daughters and the principal command of his armies he lavished upon him the highest dignities and boundless wealth and whether it arose from a feeling of remorse or of affection for a warrior whose unexampled valour and unrivalled skill had already added some of the finest provinces of asia to his rule it is certain that iskander might have exercised over amurath a far greater degree of influence than was enjoyed by any other of his courtiers but the heart of iskander responded with no sympathy to these flattering favours his turkish education could never eradicate from his memory the consciousness that he was a greek and although he was brought up in the moslemin faith he had at an early period of his career secretly recurred to the creed of his christian fathers he beheld in amurath the murderer of his dearest kinsmen and the oppressor of his country and although a certain calmness of temper and coolness of judgment which very early developed themselves in his character prevented him from ever giving any indication of his secret feelings iskander had long meditated on the exalted duty of freeing his country  dispatched to greece to arrange the tributes and the treaties of the grecian princes iskander became acquainted with the young nicæus and their acquaintance soon matured into friendship nicæus was inexperienced but nature had not intended him for action the young prince of athens would loll by the side of a fountain and dream of the wonders of old days surrounded by his eunuchs his priests and his courtiers he envied leonidas and would have emulated themistocles he was passionately devoted to the ancient literature of his country and had the good taste rare at that time to prefer demosthenes and lysias to chrysostom and gregory and the choruses of the grecian theatre to the hymns of the greek church the sustained energy and noble simplicity of the character of iskander seemed to recall to the young prince the classic heroes over whom he was so often musing while the enthusiasm and fancy of nicæus and all that apparent weakness of will and those quick vicissitudes of emotion to which men of a fine susceptibility are subject equally engaged the sympathy of the more vigorous and constant and experienced mind of his companion  to nicæus iskander had for the first time in his life confided much of his secret heart and the young prince fired at the inspiring tale often they consulted over the fortunes of their country and excited by their mutual invention at length even dared to hope that they might effect its deliverance when iskander was summoned to the army it was a mournful parting both of them felt that the last few months of their lives had owed many charms to their companionship the parting of friends united by sympathetic tastes is always painful and friends unless this sympathy subsist had much better never meet iskander stepped into the ship sorrowful but serene nicæus returned to his palace moody and fretful lost his temper with his courtiers and when he was alone even shed tears    chapter 3   three weeks bad elapsed since the parting of iskander and nicæus when the former at the head of ten thousand men entered by a circuitous route the defiles of mount hæmus and approached the turkish camp which had been pitched upon a vast and elevated tableground commanded on all sides by superior heights which however were fortified and wellgarrisoned by janissaries the epirots halted and immediately prepared to raise their tents while their commander attended by a few of his officers instantly proceeded to the pavilion of karam bey  the arrival of iskander diffused great joy among the soldiery and as he passed through the encampment the exclamations of the turkish warriors announced how ready they were to be led to the charge by a chieftain who had been ever successful a guard of honour by the orders of karam bey advanced to conduct iskander to his presence and soon entering the pavilion the grecian prince exchanged courtesies with the turkish general after the formal compliments had passed karam bey waved his hand and the pavilion was cleared with the exception of mousa the chief secretary and favourite of karam  you have arrived in good time iskander to assist in the destruction of the christian dogs said the bey flushed with their accursed success they have advanced too far twice they have endeavoured to penetrate the mountains and each time they have been forced to retire with great loss the passages are well barricadoed with timber and huge fragments of rock the dogs have lost all heart and are sinking under the joint sufferings of hunger and cold our scouts tell me they exhibit symptoms of retreat we must rush down from the mountains and annihilate them  is hunniades here in person inquired iskander  he is here replied karam in person the dog of dogs come iskander his head would be a fine ramadan present to amurath tis a head worth three tails i guess  mousa the chief secretary indulged in some suppressed laughter at this joke iskander smiled  if they retreat we must assuredly attack them observed iskander musingly i have a persuasion that hunniades and myself will soon meet  if there be truth in the prophet exclaimed karam i have no doubt of it hunniades is reserved for you bey we shall hold up our heads at court yet iskander you have had letters lately  some slight words  no mention of us of course  nothing except some passing praise of your valour and discretion  we do our best we do our best will isa bey have Ætolia think you  i have no thoughts our royal father will not forget his children and isa bey is a most valiant chieftain  you heard not that he was coming here inquired karam  have you responded the cautious iskander  a rumour a rumour replied karam he is at adrianople think you  it may be so i am you know from athens  true true we shall beat them iskander we shall beat them  for myself i feel sanguine replied the prince and he arose to retire i must at present to my men we must ascertain more accurately the movements of the christians before we decide on our own i am inclined myself to reconnoitre them how far may it be  there is not room to form our array between them and the mountains replied karam  tis well success attend the true believers by tomorrows dawn we shall know more    chapter 4   iskander returned to his men night was coming on fires and lights blazed and sparkled in every direction the air was clear but very cold he entered his tent and muffling himself up in his pelisse of sables he mounted his horse and declining any attendance rode for some little distance until he had escaped from the precincts of the camp then he turned his horse towards one of the wildest passes of the mountain and galloping at great speed never stopped until he had gained a considerable ascent the track became steep and rugged the masses of loose stone rendered his progress slow but his anatolian charger still bore him at intervals bravely and in three hours time he had gained the summit of mount hæmus a brilliant moon flooded the broad plains of bulgaria with shadowy light at the base of the mountainous range the red watchfires denoted the situation of the christian camp  iskander proceeded down the descent with an audacious rapidity but his charger was thoroughbred and his moments were golden ere midnight he had reached the outposts of the enemy and was challenged by a sentinel  who goes there  a friend to christendom  the word  i have it notnay calmly i am alone but i am not unarmed i do not know the word i come from a far country and bear important tidings to the great hunniades conduct me to that chief  may i be crucified if i will responded the sentinel before i know who and what you are come keep off unless you wish to try the effect of a polish lance continued the sentinel tis something i assure you not less awkward than your greek fire if greek indeed you be  my friend you are a fool said iskander but time is too precious to argue any longer so saying the turkish commander dismounted and taking up the brawny sentinel in his arms with the greatest ease threw him over his shoulder and threatening the astounded soldier with instant death if he struggled covered him with his pelisse and entered the camp  they approached a watchfire around which several soldiers were warming themselves  who goes there inquired a second sentinel  a friend to christendom answered iskander  the word  iskander hesitated  the word or ill let fly said the sentinel elevating his cross bow  the bridge of buda instantly replied the terrified prisoner beneath the pelisse of iskander  why did not you answer before then said one of the guards  and why do you mock us by changing your voice said another come get on with you and no more jokes  iskander proceeded through a street of tents in some of which were lights but all of which were silent at length he met the esquire of a polish knight returning from a convivial meeting not a little elevated  who are you inquired iskander  i am an esquire replied the gentleman  a shrewd man i doubt not who would make his fortune replied iskander you must know great things have happened being on guard i have taken a prisoner who has deep secrets to divulge to the lord hunniades thither to his pavilion i am now bearing him but he is a stout barbarian and almost too much for me assist me in carrying him to the pavilion of hunniades and you shall have all the reward and half the fame  you are a very civil spoken young gentleman said the esquire i think i know your voice your name if i mistake not is leckinski  a relative we had a common ancestor  i thought so i know the leckinskies ever by their voice i am free to help you on the terms you mentionall the reward and half the fame tis a strong barbarian is it we cannot cut his throat or it will not divulge all the reward and half the fame i will be a knight tomorrow it seems a sort of fish and has a smell  the esquire seized the shoulders of the prisoner who would have spoken had he not been terrified by the threats of iskander who carrying the legs of the sentinel allowed the polish gentleman to lead the way to the pavilion of hunniades thither they soon arrived and iskander dropping his burthen and leaving the prisoner without to the charge of his assistant entered the pavilion of the general of the hungarians  he was stopped in a small outer apartment by an officer who inquired his purpose and to whom he repeated his desire to see the hungarian leader without loss of time on important business the officer hesitated but summoning several guards left iskander in their custody and stepping behind a curtain disappeared iskander heard voices but could distinguish no words soon the officer returned and ordering the guards to disarm and search iskander directed the grecian prince to follow him drawing aside the curtain iskander and his attendant entered a low apartment of considerable size it was hung with skins a variety of armour and dresses were piled on couches a middleaged man of majestic appearance muffled in a pelisse of furs with long chestnut hair and a cap of crimson velvet and ermine was walking up and down the apartment and dictating some instructions to a person who was kneeling on the ground and writing by the bright flame of a brazen lamp the bright flame of the blazing lamp fell full upon the face of the secretary iskander beheld a most beautiful woman  she looked up as iskander entered her large dark eyes glanced through his soul her raven hair descended to her shoulders in many curls on each side of her face and was braided with strings of immense pearls a broad cap of white foxskin crowned her whiter forehead her features were very small but sharply moulded and a delicate tint gave animation to her clear fair cheek she looked up as iskander entered with an air rather of curiosity than embarrassment  hunniades stopped and examined his visitor with a searching inquisition whence come you inquired the hungarian chieftain  from the turkish camp was the answer  an envoy or a deserter  neither  what then  a convert  your name  lord hunniades said iskander that is for your private ear i am unarmed and were i otherwise the first knight of christendom can scarcely fear i am one in birth and rank your equal if not in fame at least i trust in honour my time is allprecious i can scarcely stay here while my horse breathes dismiss your attendant  hunniades darted a glance at his visitor which would have baffled a weaker brain but iskander stood the scrutiny calm and undisturbed go stanislaus said the vaivode to the officer this lady sir continued the chieftain is my daughter and one from whom i have no secrets  iskander bowed lowly as the officer disappeared  and now said hunniades to business your purpose  i am a grecian prince and a compulsory ally of the moslemin in a word my purpose here is to arrange a plan by which we may effect at the same time your triumph and my freedom  to whom then have i the honour of speaking inquired hunniades  my name great hunniades is perhaps not altogether unknown to you they call me iskander  what the right arm of amurath the conqueror of caramania the flower of turkish chivalry do i indeed behold that matchless warrior exclaimed hunniades and he held forth his hand to his guest and ungirding his own sword offered it to the prince iduna continued hunniades to his daughter you at length behold iskander  my joy is great sir replied iduna if i indeed rightly understand that we may count the prince iskander a champion of the cross  iskander took from his heart his golden crucifix and kissed it before her this has been my companion and consolation for long years lady said iskander you perhaps know my mournful history hunniades hitherto my pretended sovereign has not required me to bare my scimitar against my christian brethren that hour however has at length arrived and it has decided me to adopt a line of conduct long meditated karam bey who is aware of your necessities the moment you commence your retreat will attack you i shall command his left wing in spite of his superior power and position draw up in array and meet him with confidence i propose at a convenient moment in the day to withdraw my troops and with the epirots hasten to my native country and at once raise the standard of independence it is a bold measure but success is the child of audacity we must assist each other with mutual diversions singlehanded it is in vain for me to commence a struggle which with all adventitious advantages will require the utmost exertion of energy skill and patience but if yourself and the king uladislaus occupy the armies of amurath in bulgaria i am not without hope of ultimate success since i have to inspire me all the most urgent interests of humanity and combat at the same time for my god my country and my lawful crown  brave prince i pledge you my troth said hunniades coming forward and seizing his hand and while iskander and hunniades live they will never cease until they have achieved their great and holy end  it is a solemn compact said iskander more sacred than if registered by all the scribes of christendom lady iduna your prayers  they are ever with the champions of the cross replied the daughter of hunniades she rose the large cloak in which she was enveloped fell from her exquisite form noble iskander this rosary is from the holy sepulchre continued iduna wear it for the sake and memory of that blessed saviour who died for our sins  iskander held forth his arm and touched her delicate hand as he received the rosary which pressing to his lips he placed round his neck  great hunniades said the grecian prince i must cross the mountains before dawn let me venture to entreat that we should hear tomorrow that the christian camp is in retreat  let it be even so said the hungarian after some thought and may tomorrows sun bring brighter days to christendom and with these words terminated the brief and extraordinary visit of iskander to the christian general    chapter 5   the intelligence of the breaking up of the christian camp and the retreat of the christian army soon reached the divan of karam bey who immediately summoned iskander to consult on the necessary operations the chieftains agreed that instant pursuit was indispensable and soon the savage hæmus poured forth from its green bosom swarms of that light cavalry which was perhaps even a more fatal arm of the turkish power than the famous janissaries themselves they hovered on the rear of the retreating christians charged the wavering captured the unwary it was impossible to resist their sudden and impetuous movements which rendered their escape as secure as their onset was overwhelming wearied at length by the repeated assaults hunniades who attended by some chosen knights had himself repaired to the rear gave orders for the army to halt and offer battle  their pursuers instantly withdrew to a distance and gradually forming into two divisions awaited the arrival of the advancing army of the turks the moslemin came forward in fierce array and with the sanguine courage inspired by expected triumph very conspicuous was iskander bounding in his crimson vest upon his ebon steed and waving his gleaming scimitar  the janissaries charged calling upon allah with an awful shout the christian knights invoking the christian saints received the turks at the points of their lances but many a noble lance was shivered that morn and many a bold rider and worthy steed bit the dust of that field borne down by the irresistible numbers of their fierce adversaries everywhere the balls and the arrows whistled through the air and sometimes an isolated shriek heard amid the general clang announced another victim to the fell and mysterious agency of the greek fire  hunniades while he performed all the feats of an approved warrior watched with anxiety the disposition of the turkish troops hitherto from the nature of their position but a portion of both armies had interfered in the contest and as yet iskander had kept aloof but now as the battle each instant raged with more fury and as it was evident that ere long the main force of both armies must be brought into collision hunniades with a terrible suspense watched whether the grecian prince were willing or even capable of executing his plan without this fulfilment the christian hero could not conceal from himself that the day must be decided against the cross  in the meantime iskander marked the course of events with not less eagerness than hunniades already karam bey had more than once summoned him to bring the epirots into action he assented but an hour passed away without changing his position at length more from astonishment than rage the turkish commander sent his chief secretary mousa himself to impress his wishes upon his colleague and obtain some explanation of his views and conduct mousa found iskander surrounded by some of the principal epirot nobles all mounted on horseback and standing calmly under a widespreading plane tree the chief secretary of karam bey was too skilful a courtier to permit his countenance to express his feelings and he delivered himself of a mission rather as if he had come to request advice than to communicate a reprimand  your master is a wise man mousa replied iskander but even karam bey may be mistaken he deems that a battle is not to be won by loitering under a shadowy tree now i differ with him and i even mean to win this day by such a piece of truancy however it may certainly now be time for more active work you smile encouragement good mousa giorgio demetrius to your duty  at these words two stout epirots advanced to the unfortunate secretary seized and bound him and placed him on horseback before one of their comrades  now all who love their country follow me exclaimed iskander so saying and at the head of five thousand horsemen iskander quitted the field at a rapid pace    chapter 6   with incredible celerity iskander and his cavalry dashed over the plains of roumelia and never halted except for short and hurried intervals of rest and repose until they had entered the mountainous borders of epirus and were within fifty miles of its capital croia on the eve of entering the kingdom of his fathers iskander ordered his guards to produce the chief secretary of karam bey exhausted with fatigue vexation and terror the disconsolate mousa was led forward  cheer up worthy mousa said iskander lying his length on the green turf we have had a sharp ride but i doubt not we shall soon find ourselves by the blessing of god in good quarters there is a city at hand which they call croia and in which once as the rumour runs the son of my father should not have had to go seek for an entrance no matter methinks worthy mousa thou art the only man in our society that can sign thy name come now write me an order signed karam bey to the governor of this said city for its delivery up to the valiant champion of the crescent iskander and thou shalt ride in future at a pace more suitable to a secretary  the worthy mousa humbled himself to the ground and then talking his writing materials from his girdle inscribed the desired order and delivered it to iskander who glancing at the inscription pushed it into his vest  i shall proceed at once to croia with a few friends said iskander do you my bold companions follow me this eve in various parties and in various routes at dead of the second night collect in silence before the gates of croia  thus speaking iskander called for his now refreshed charger and accompanied by two hundred horsemen bade farewell for a brief period to his troops and soon having crossed the mountains descended into the fertile plains of epirus  when the sun rose in the morning iskander and his friends beheld at the further end of the plain a very fine city shining in the light it was surrounded with lofty turreted walls flanked by square towers and was built upon a gentle eminence which gave it a very majestic appearance behind it rose a lofty range of purple mountains of very picturesque form and the highest peaks capped with snow a noble lake from which troops of wild fowl occasionally rose expanded like a sheet of silver on one side of the city the green breast of the contiguous hills sparkled with white houses  behold croia exclaimed iskander our old fathers could choose a site comrades we shall see whether they expended their time and treasure for strangers or their own seed so saying he spurred his horse and with panting hearts and smiling faces iskander and his company had soon arrived in the vicinity of the city  the city was surrounded by a beautiful region of cornfields and fruittrees the road was arched with the overhanging boughs the birds chirped on every spray it was a blithe and merry morn iskander plucked a bunch of olives as he cantered along dear friends he said looking round with an inspiring smile let us gather our first harvest and thereupon each putting forth his rapid hand seized as he rushed by the emblem of possession and following the example of his leader placed it in his cap  they arrived at the gates of the city which was strongly garrisoned and iskander followed by his train galloped up the height of the citadel alighting from his horse he was ushered into the divan of the governor an ancient pacha who received the conqueror of caramania with all the respect that became so illustrious a champion of the crescent after the usual forms of ceremonious hospitality iskander with a courteous air presented him the order for delivering up the citadel and the old pacha resigning himself to the loss of his post with oriental submission instantly delivered the keys of the citadel and town to iskander and requested permission immediately to quit the scene of his late command  quitting the citadel iskander now proceeded through the whole town and in the afternoon reviewed the turkish garrison in the great square as the late governor was very anxious to quit croia that very day iskander insisted on a considerable portion of the garrison accompanying him as a guard of honour and returning the next morning the rest he divided in several quarters and placed the gates in charge of his own companions  at midnight the epirots faithful to their orders arrived and united beneath the walls of the city and after interchanging the signals agreed upon the gates were opened a large body instantly marched and secured the citadel the rest conducted by appointed leaders surrounded the turks in their quarters and suddenly in the noon of night in that great city arose a clang so dreadful that people leapt up from their sleep and stared with stupor instantly the terrace of every house blazed with torches and it became as light as day troops of armed men were charging down the streets brandishing their scimitars and yataghans and exclaiming the cross the cross liberty greece iskander and epirus the townsmen recognised their countrymen by their language and their dress the name of iskander acted as a spell they stopt not to inquire a magic sympathy at once persuaded them that this great man had by the grace of heaven recurred to the creed and country of his fathers and so every townsman seizing the nearest weapon with a spirit of patriotic frenzy rushed into the streets crying out the cross the cross liberty greece iskander and epirus ay even the women lost all womanly fears and stimulated instead of soothing the impulse of their masters they fetched them arms they held the torches they sent them forth with vows and prayers and imprecations their children clinging to their robes and repeating with enthusiasm phrases which they could not comprehend  the turks fought with the desperation of men who feel that they are betrayed and must be victims the small and isolated bodies were soon massacred all with cold steel for at this time although some of the terrible inventions of modern warfare were introduced their use was not general the citadel indeed was fortified with cannon but the greater part of the soldiery trusted to their crooked swords and their unerring javelins the main force of the turkish garrison had been quartered in an old palace of the archbishop situate in the middle of the city on a slightly rising and open ground a massy building of rustic stone here the turks although surrounded defended themselves desperately using their cross bows with terrible effect and hither the rest of the city being now secured iskander himself repaired to achieve its complete deliverance  the greeks had endeavoured to carry the principal entrance of the palace by main force but the strength of the portal had resisted their utmost exertions and the arrows of the besieged had at length forced them to retire to a distance iskander directed that two pieces of cannon should be dragged down from the citadel and then played against the entrance in the meantime he ordered immense piles of damp faggots to be lit before the building the smoke of which prevented the besieged from taking any aim the ardour of the people was so great that the cannon were soon served against the palace and their effects were speedily remarked the massy portal shook a few blows of the battering ram and it fell the turks sallied forth were received with a shower of greek fire and driven in with agonising yells some endeavoured to escape from the windows and were speared or cut down some appeared wringing their hands in despair upon the terraced roof suddenly the palace was announced to be on fire a tall whiteblueish flame darted up from a cloud of smoke and soon as if by magic the whole back of the building was encompassed with rising tongues of red and raging light amid a babel of shrieks and shouts and cheers and prayers and curses the roof of the palace fell in with a crash which produced amid the besiegers an awful and momentary silence but in an instant they started from their strange inactivity and rushing forward leapt into the smoking ruins and at the same time completed the massacre and achieved their freedom    chapter 7   at break of dawn iskander sent couriers throughout all epirus announcing the fall of croia and that he had raised the standard of independence in his ancient country he also despatched a trusty messenger to prince nicæus at athens and to the great hunniades the people were so excited throughout all epirus at this great and unthoughtof intelligence that they simultaneously rose in all the open country and massacred the turks and the towns were only restrained in a forced submission to amurath by the strong garrisons of the sultan  now iskander was very anxious to effect the removal of these garrisons without loss of time in order that if amurath sent a great power against him as he expected the invading army might have nothing to rely upon but its own force and that his attention might not in any way be diverted from effecting their overthrow therefore as soon as his troops had rested and he had formed his new recruits into some order which with their willing spirits did not demand many days iskander set out from croia at the head of twelve thousand men and marched against the strong city of petrella meeting in his way the remainder of the garrison of croia on their return who surrendered themselves to him at discretion petrella was only one days march from croia and when iskander arrived there he requested a conference with the governor and told his tale so well representing the late overthrow of the turks by hunniades and the incapacity of amurath at present to relieve him that the turkish commander agreed to deliver up the place and leave the country with his troops particularly as the alternative of iskander to these easy terms was ever conquest without quarter and thus by a happy mixture of audacity and adroitness the march of iskander throughout epirus was rather like a triumph than a campaign the turkish garrisons imitating without any exception the conduct of their comrades at petrella and dreading the fate of their comrades at the capital in less than a month iskander returned to epirus having delivered the whole country from the moslemin yoke  hitherto iskander had heard nothing either of hunniades or nicæus he learnt therefore with great interest as he passed through the gates of the city that the prince of athens had arrived at croia the preceding eve and also that his messenger had returned from the hungarian camp amid the acclamations of an enthusiastic people iskander once more ascended the citadel of croia nicæus received him at the gate iskander sprang from his horse and embraced his friend hand in hand and followed by their respective trains they entered the fortress palace  dear friend said iskander when they were once more alone you see we were right not to despair two months have scarcely elapsed since we parted without prospect or with the most gloomy one and now we are in a fair way of achieving all that we can desire epirus is free  i came to claim my share in its emancipation said nicæus with a smile but iskander is another cæsar  you will have many opportunities yet believe me nicæus of proving your courage and your patriotism replied iskander amurath will never allow this affair to pass over in this quiet manner i did not commence this struggle without a conviction that it would demand all the energy and patience of a long life i shall be rewarded if i leave freedom as an heritage to my countrymen but for the rest i feel that i bid farewell to every joy of life except the ennobling consciousness of performing a noble duty in the meantime i understand a messenger awaits me here from the great hunniades unless that shield of christendom maintain himself in his present position our chance of ultimate security is feeble with his constant diversion in bulgaria we may contrive here to struggle into success you sometimes laugh at my sanguine temper nicæus to say the truth i am more serene than sanguine and was never more conscious of the strength of my opponent than now when it appears that i have beaten him hark the people cheer i love the people nicæus who are ever influenced by genuine and generous feelings they cheer as if they had once more gained a country alas they little know what they must endure even at the best nay look not gloomy we have done great things and will do more who waits without there demetrius call the messenger from lord hunniades  an epirot bearing a silken packet was now introduced which he delivered to iskander reverently touching the hand of his chieftain the messenger then kissed his own and withdrew iskander broke the seal and drew forth a letter from the silken cover  so this is well exclaimed the prince with great animation as he threw his quick eye over the letter as i hoped and deemed a most complete victory karam bey himself a prisoner baggage standards great guns treasure brave soldier of the cross may i prove so your perfectlydevised movement poh poh hah what is this exclaimed iskander turning pale his lip quivered his eye looked dim he walked to an arched window his companion who supposed that he was reading did not disturb him  poor poor hunniades at length exclaimed iskander shaking his head  what of him inquired nicæus quickly  the sharpest accident of war replied iskander it quite clouds my spirit we must forget these things we must forget epirus he is not a patriot who can spare a thought from thee and yet so young so beautiful so gifted so worthy of a hero when i saw her by her great fathers side sharing his toils aiding his councils supplying his necessities methought i gazed upon a ministering angel upon  stop stop in mercys name iskander exclaimed nicæus in a very agitated tone what is all this surely no surely not surely iduna  tis she  dead exclaimed nicæus rushing up to his companion and seizing his arm  worse much worse  god of heaven exclaimed the young prince with almost a frantic air tell me all tell me all this suspense fires my brain iskander you know not what this woman is to me the sole object of my being the bane the blessing of my life speak dear friend speak i beseech you where is iduna  a prisoner to the turk  iduna a prisoner to the turk ill not believe it why do we wear swords wheres chivalry iduna a prisoner to the turk tis false it cannot be iskander you are a coward i am a coward all are cowards a prisoner to the turk iduna what the rose of christendom has it been plucked by such a turbaned dog as amurath farewell epirus farewell classic athens farewell bright fields of greece and dreams that made them brighter the sun of all my joy and hope is set and set for ever  so saying nicæus tearing his hair and garments flung himself upon the floor and hid his face in his robes  iskander paced the room with a troubled step and thoughtful brow after some minutes he leant down by the prince of athens and endeavoured to console him  it is in vain iskander it is in vain said nicæus i wish to die  were i a favoured lover in such a situation replied iskander i should scarcely consider death my duty unless the sacrifice of myself preserved my mistress  hah exclaimed nicæus starting from the ground do you conceive then the possibility of rescuing her  if she live she is a prisoner in the seraglio at adrianople you are as good a judge as myself of the prospect that awaits your exertions it is without doubt a difficult adventure but such methinks as a christian knight should scarcely shun  to horse exclaimed nicæus to horseand yet what can i do were she in any other place but the capital i might rescue her by force but in the heart of their empire it is impossible is there no ransom that can tempt the turk my principality would rise in the balance beside this jewel  that were scarcely wise and certainly not just replied iskander but ransom will be of no avail hunniades has already offered to restore karam bey and all the prisoners of rank and the chief trophies and amurath has refused to listen to any terms the truth is iduna has found favour in the eyes of his son the young mahomed  holy virgin hast thou no pity on this christian maid exclaimed nicæus the young mahomed shall this licentious infidelah iskander dear dear iskander you who have so much wisdom and so much courage you who can devise all things and dare all things help me help me on my knees i do beseech you take up this trying cause of foul oppression and for the sake of all you love and reverence your creed your country and perchance your friend let your great genius like some solemn angel haste to the rescue of the sweet iduna and save her save her  some thoughts like these were rising in my mind when first i spoke replied iskander this is a better cue far more beseeming princes than boyish tears and all the outward misery of woe a tattered garment and dishevelled locks come nicæus we have to struggle with a mighty fortune let us be firm as fate itself    chapter 8   immediately after his interview with nicæus iskander summoned some of the chief citizens of croia to the citadel and submitting to them his arrangements for the administration of epirus announced the necessity of his instant departure for a short interval and the same evening ere the moon had risen himself and the prince of athens quitted the city and proceeded in the direction of adrianople they travelled with great rapidity until they reached a small town upon the frontiers where they halted for one day here in the bazaar iskander purchased for himself the dress of an armenian physician in his long dark robes and large round cap of black wool his face and hands stained and his beard and mustachios shaven it seemed impossible that he could be recognised nicæus was habited as his page in a dress of coarse red cloth setting tight to his form with a red cap with a long blue tassel he carried a large bag containing drugs some surgical instruments and a few books in this guise as soon as the gates were open on the morrow iskander mounted on a very small mule and nicæus on a very large donkey the two princes commenced the pass of the mountainous range an arm of the balkan which divided epirus from roumelia  i broke the wind of the finest charger in all asia when i last ascended these mountains said iskander i hope this days journey way be accepted as a sort of atonement  faith there is little doubt i am the best mounted of the two said nicæus however i hope we shall return at a sharper pace  how came it my nicæus said iskander that you never mentioned to me the name of iduna when we were at athens i little supposed when i made my sudden visit to hunniades that i was about to appeal to so fair a host she is a rarely gifted lady  i knew of her being at the camp as little as yourself replied the prince of athens and for the rest the truth is iskander there are some slight crosses in our loves which time i hope will fashion rightly so saying nicæus pricked on his donkey and flung his stick at a bird which was perched on the branch of a tree iskander did not resume a topic to which his companion seemed disinclined their journey was tedious towards nightfall they reached the summit of the usual track and as the descent was difficult they were obliged to rest until daybreak  on the morrow they had a magnificent view of the rich plains of roumelia and in the extreme distance the great city of adrianople its cupolas and minarets blazing and sparkling in the sun this glorious prospect at once revived all their energies it seemed that the moment of peril and of fate had arrived they pricked on their sorry steeds and on the morning of the next day presented themselves at the gates of the city the thorough knowledge which iskander possessed of the turkish character obtained them an entrance which was at one time almost doubtful from the irritability and impatience of nicæus they repaired to a caravansera of good repute in the neighbourhood of the seraglio and having engaged their rooms the armenian physician attended by his page visited several of the neighbouring coffeehouses announcing at the same time his arrival his profession and his skill  as iskander felt pulses examined tongues and distributed drugs and charms he listened with interest and amusement to the conversation of which he himself was often the hero he found that the turks had not yet recovered from their consternation at his audacity and success they were still wondering and if possible more astounded than indignant the politicians of the coffeehouses chiefly consisting of janissaries were loud in their murmurs the popularity of amurath had vanished before the triumph of hunniades and the rise of iskander  but allah has in some instances favoured the faithful remarked iskander i heard in my travels of your having captured a great princess of the giaours  god is great said an elderly turk with a long white heard the hakim congratulates the faithful because they have taken a woman  not so merely replied iskander i heard the woman was a princess if so the people of franguestan will pay any ransom for their great women and by giving up this fair giaour you may free many of the faithful  mashallah said another ancient turk sipping his coffee the hakim speaks wisely  may i murder my mother exclaimed a young janissary with great indignation but this is the very thing that makes me wild against amurath is not this princess a daughter of that accursed giaour that dog of dogs hunniades and has he not offered for her ransom our brave karam bey himself and his chosen warriors and has not amurath said nay and why has he said nay because his son the prince of mahomed instead of fighting against the giaours has looked upon one of their women and has become a mejnoun pah may i murder my mother but if the giaours were in full march to the city id not fight and let him tell this to the cadi who dares for there are ten thousand of us and we have sworn by the kettle but we will not fight for giaours or those who love giaours  if you mean me ali about going to the cadi said the chief eunuch of mahomed who was standing by let me tell you i am no talebearer and scorn to do an unmanly act the young prince can beat the giaours without the aid of those who are noisy enough in a coffeehouse when they are quiet enough in the field and for the rest of the business you may all ease your hearts for the frangy princess you talk of is pining away and will soon die the sultan has offered a hundred purses of gold to any one who cures her but the gold will never be counted by the hasnadar or i will double it  try your fortune hakim said several laughing loungers to iskander  allah has stricken the frangy princess said the old turk with a white beard  he will strike all giaours said his ancient companion sipping his coffee it is so written  well i do not like to hear of women slaves pining to death said the young janissary in a softened tone particularly when they are young amurath should have ransomed her or he might have given her to one of his officers or any young fellow that had particularly distinguished himself and so twirling his mustachios and flinging down his piastre the young janissary strutted out of the coffeehouse  when we were young said the old turk with the white beard to his companion shaking his head when we were young  we conquered anatolia and never opened our mouths rejoined his companion  i never offered an opinion till i was sixty said the old turk and then it was one which had been in our family for a century  no wonder hunniades carries everything before him said his companion  and that accursed iskander said the old man  the chief eunuch finishing his vase of sherbet moved away the armenian physician followed him    chapter 9   the chief eunuch turned into a burialground through which a way led by an avenue of cypresstrees to the quarter of the seraglio the armenian physician accompanied by his page followed him  noble sir said the armenian physician may i trespass for a moment on your lordships attention  worthy hakim is it you replied the chief eunuch turning round with an encouraging smile of courteous condescension your pleasure  i would speak to you of important matters said the physician  the eunuch carelessly seated himself on a richlycarved tomb and crossing his legs with an air of pleasant superiority adjusted a fine emerald that sparkled on his finger and bade the hakim address him without hesitation  i am a physician said the armenian  the eunuch nodded  and i heard your lordship in the coffeehouse mention that the sultan our sublime master had offered a rich reward to any one who could effect the cure of a favourite captive  no less a reward than one hundred purses of gold remarked the eunuch the reward is proportioned to the exigency of the cue believe me worthy sir it is desperate  with mortal means replied the armenian but i possess a talisman of magical influence which no disorder can resist i would fain try its efficacy  this is not the first talisman that has been offered us worthy doctor said the eunuch smiling incredulously  but the first that has been offered on these terms said the armenian let me cure the captive and of the one hundred purses a moiety shall belong to yourself ay so confident am i of success that i deem it no hazard to commence our contract by this surety and so saying the armenian took from his finger a gorgeous carbuncle and offered it to the eunuch the worthy dependent of the seraglio had a great taste in jewellery he examined the stone with admiration and placed it on his finger with complacency i require no inducements to promote the interests of science and the purposes of charity said the eunuch with a patronising air tis assuredly a pretty stone and as the memorial of an ingenious stranger whom i respect i shall with pleasure retain it you were saying something about a talisman are you serious i doubt not that there are means which might obtain you the desired trial but the prince mahomed is as violent when displeased or disappointed as munificent when gratified cure this christian captive and we may certainly receive the promised purses fail and your head will as assuredly be flung into the seraglio moat to say nothing of my own  most noble sir said the physician i am willing to undertake the experiment on the terms you mention rest assured that the patient if alive must with this remedy speedily recover you marvel believe me had you witnessed the cures which it has already effected you would only wonder at its otherwise incredible influence  you have the advantage replied the eunuch of addressing a man who has seen something of the world i travel every year to anatolia with the prince mahomed were i a narrowminded bigot and had never been five miles from adrianople in the whole course of my life i might indeed be sceptical but i am a patron of science and have heard of talismans how much might this ring weigh think you  i have heard it spoken of as a carbuncle of uncommon size replied the armenian  where did you say you lodged hakim  at the khan of bedreddin  a very proper dwelling well we shall see have you more jewels i might perhaps put you in the way of parting with some at good prices the khan of bedreddin is very conveniently situated i may perhaps towards evening taste your coffee at the khan of bedreddin and we will talk of this said talisman allah be with you worthy hakim the eunuch nodded not without encouragement and went his way  anxiety alone enabled me to keep my countenance said nicæus a patron of science forsooth of all the insolent shallowbrained rapacious coxcombs  hush my friend said iskander with a smile the chief eunuch of the heir apparent of the turkish empire is a far greater man than a poor prince or a proscribed rebel this worthy can do our business and i trust will he clearly bites and a richer bait will perhaps secure him in the meantime we must be patient and remember whose destiny is at stake    chapter 10   the chief eunuch did not keep the adventurous companions long in suspense for before the muezzin had announced the close of day from the minarets he had reached the khan of bedreddin and inquired for the armenian physician  we have no time to lose said the eunuch to iskander bring with you whatever you may require and follow me  the eunuch led the way iskander and nicæus maintaining a respectful distance after proceeding down several streets they arrived at the burialground where they had conversed in the morning and when they had entered that more retired spot the eunuch fell back and addressed his companion  now worthy hakim he said if you deceive me i will never patronize a man of science again i found an opportunity of speaking to the prince this afternoon of your talisman and he has taken from my representations such a fancy for its immediate proof that i found it quite impossible to postpone its trial even until tomorrow i mentioned the terms i told the prince your life was the pledge i said nothing of the moiety of the reward worthy hakim that is an affair between ourselves i trust to your honour and i always act thus with men of science  i shall not disgrace my profession or your confidence rest assured replied iskander and am i to see the captive tonight  i doubt it not are you prepared we might perhaps gain a little time if very necessary  by no means sir truth is ever prepared  thus conversing they passed through the burialground and approached some high broad walls forming a terrace and planted with young sycamoretrees the eunuch tapped with his silver stick at a small gate which opened and admitted them into a garden full of large clumps of massy shrubs through these a winding walk led for some way and then conducted them to an open lawn on which was situate a vast and irregular building as they approached the pile a young man of very imperious aspect rushed forward from a gate and abruptly accosted iskander  are you the armenian physician he inquired  iskander bowed assent  have you got your talisman you know the terms cure this christian girl and you shall name your own reward fail and i shall claim your forfeit head  the terms are well understood mighty prince said iskander for the young man was no less a personage than the son of amurath and future conqueror of constantinople but i am confident there will be no necessity for the terror of christendom claiming any other heads than those of his enemies  kaflis will conduct you at once to your patient said mahomed for myself i cannot rest until i know the result of your visit i shall wander about these gardens and destroy the flowers which is the only pleasure now left me  kaflis motioned to his companions to advance and they entered the seraglio  at the end of a long gallery they came to a great portal which kaflis opened and iskander and nicæus for a moment supposed that they had arrived at the chief hall of the tower of babel but they found the shrill din only proceeded from a large company of women who were employed in distilling the rare atar of the jasmine flower all their voices ceased on the entrance of the strangers as if by a miracle but when they had examined them and observed that it was only a physician and his boy their awe or their surprise disappeared and they crowded round iskander some holding out their wrists others lolling out their tongues and some asking questions which perplexed alike the skill and the modesty of the adventurous dealer in magical medicine the annoyance however was not of great duration for kaflis so belaboured their fair shoulders with his official baton that they instantly retreated with precipitation uttering the most violent shrieks and bestowing on the eunuch so many titles that iskander and his page were quite astounded at the intuitive knowledge which the imprisoned damsels possessed of that vocabulary of abuse which is in general mastered only by the experience of active existence  quitting this chamber the eunuch and his companions ascended a lofty staircase they halted at length before a door this is the chamber of the tower said their guide and here we shall find the fair captive he knocked the door was opened by a female slave and iskander and nicæus with an anxiety they could with difficulty conceal were ushered into a small but sumptuous apartment in the extremity was a recess covered with a light gauzy curtain the eunuch bidding them keep in the background advanced and cautiously withdrawing the curtain slightly aside addressed some words in a low voice to the inmate of the recess in a few minutes the eunuch beckoned to iskander to advance and whispered to him she would not at first see you but i have told her you are a christian the more the pity and she consents so saying he withdrew the curtain and exhibited a veiled female figure lying on a couch  noble lady said the physician in greek which he had ascertained the eunuch did not comprehend pardon the zeal of a christian friend though habited in this garb i have served under your illustrious sire i should deem my life well spent in serving the daughter of the great hunniades  kind stranger replied the captive i was ill prepared for such a meeting i thank you for your sympathy but my sad fortunes are beyond human aid  god works by humble instruments noble lady said iskander and with his blessing we may yet prosper  i fear that i must look to death as my only refuge replied iduna and still more i fear that it is not so present a refuge as my oppressors themselves imagine but you are a physician tell me then how speedily nature will make me free  she held forth her hand which iskander took and involuntarily pressed noble lady he said my skill is a mere pretence to enter these walls the only talisman i bear with me is a message from your friends  indeed said iduna in an agitated tone  restrain yourself noble lady said iskander interposing restrain yourself were you any other but the daughter of hunniades i would not have ventured upon this perilous exploit but i know that the lady iduna has inherited something more than the name of her great ancestorstheir heroic soul if ever there were a moment in her life in which it behoved her to exert all her energies that moment has arrived the physician who addresses her and his attendant who waits at hand are two of the lady idunas most devoted friends there is nothing that they will not hazard to effect her delivery and they have matured a plan of escape which they are sanguine must succeed yet its completion will require on her part great anxiety of mind greater exertion of body danger fatigue privation is the lady iduna prepared for all this endurance and all this hazard  noble friend replied iduna for i cannot deem you a stranger and none but a most chivalric knight could have entered upon this almost forlorn adventure you have not i trust miscalculated my character i am a slave and unless heaven will interpose must soon be a dishonoured one my freedom and my fame are alike at stake there is no danger and no suffering which i will not gladly welcome provided there be even a remote chance of regaining my liberty and securing my honour  you are in the mind i counted on now mark my words dear lady seize an opportunity this evening of expressing to your gaolers that you have already experienced some benefit from my visit and announce your rising confidence in my skill in the meantime i will make such a report that our daily meetings will not be difficult for the present farewell the prince mahomed waits without and i would exchange some words with him before i go  and must we part without my being acquainted with the generous friends to whom i am indebted for an act of devotion which almost reconciles me to my sad fate said iduna you will not perhaps deem the implicit trust reposed in you by one whom you have no interest to deceive and who if deceived cannot be placed in a worse position than she at present fills as a very gratifying mark of confidence yet that trust is reposed in you and let me at least soothe the galling dreariness of my solitary hours by the recollection of the friends to whom i am indebted for a deed of friendship which has filled me with a feeling of wonder from which i have not yet recovered  the person who has penetrated the seraglio of constantinople in disguise to rescue the lady iduna answered iskander is the prince nicæus  nicæus exclaimed iduna in an agitated tone the voice to which i listen is surely not that of the prince nicæus nor the form on which i gaze she added as she unveiled beside her stood the tall figure of the armenian physician she beheld his swarthy and unrecognised countenance she cast her dark eyes around with an air of beautiful perplexity  i am a friend of the prince nicæus said the physician he is here shall he advance alexis called cut iskander not waiting for her reply the page of the physician came forward but the eunuch accompanied him all is right said iskander to kaflis we are sure of our hundred purses but without doubt with any other aid the case were desperate  there is but one god said the eunuch polishing his carbuncle with a visage radiant as the gem i never repented patronizing men of science the prince waits without come along he took iskander by the arm where is your boy what are you doing there sir inquired the eunuch sharply of nicæus who was tarrying behind and kissing the hand of iduna  i was asking the lady for a favour to go to the coffeehouse with replied nicæus you forget that i am to have none of the hundred purses  true said the eunuch there is something in that here boy here is a piastre for you i like to encourage men of science and all that belong to them do not go and spend it all in one morning boy and when the fair captive is cured if you remind me boy perhaps i may give you another    chapter 11   kaflis and his charge again reached the garden the twilight was nearly past a horseman galloped up to them followed by several running footmen it was the prince  well hakim he inquired in his usual abrupt style can you cure her  yes answered iskander firmly  now listen hakim said mahomed i must very shortly leave the city and proceed into epirus at the head of our troops i have sworn two things and i have sworn them by the holy stone ere the new moon i will have the heart of iduna and the head of iskander  the physician bowed  if you can so restore the health of this frangy girl continued mahomed that she may attend me within ten days into epirus you shall claim from my treasury what sum you like and become physician to the seraglio what say you  my hope and my belief is replied iskander that within ten days she may breathe the air of epirus  by my fathers beard you are a man after my own heart exclaimed the prince and since thou dealest in talismans hakim can you give me a charm that you will secure me a meeting with this epirot rebel within the term so that i may keep my oath what say you what say you  there are such spells replied iskander but mark i can only secure the meeting not the head  that is my part said mahomed with an arrogant sneer but the meeting the meeting  you know the fountain of kallista in epirus its virtues are renowned  i have beard of it  plunge your scimitar in its midnight waters thrice on the eve of the new moon and each time summon the enemy you would desire to meet he will not fail you  if you cure the captive i will credit the legend and keep the appointment replied mahomed thoughtfully  i have engaged to do that replied the physician  well then i shall redeem my pledge said the prince  but mind said the physician while i engage to cure the lady and produce the warrior i can secure your highness neither the heart of the one nor the head of the other  tis understood said mahomed    chapter 12   the armenian physician did not fail to attend his captive patient at an early hour on the ensuing morn his patron kaflis received him with an encouraging smile  the talisman already works said the eunuch she has passed a good night and confesses to an improvement our purses are safe methinks i already count the gold but i say worthy hakim come hither come hither and kaflis looked around to be sure that no one was within hearing i say and here he put on a very mysterious air indeed the prince is generous you understand we go shares we shall not quarrel i never yet repented patronizing a man of science and i am sure i never shall the prince you see is violent but generous i would not cure her too soon eh  you take a most discreet view of affairs responded iskander with an air of complete assent and they entered the chamber of the tower  iduna performed her part with great dexterity but indeed it required less skill than herself and her advisers had at first imagined her malady although it might have ended fatally was in its origin entirely mental and the sudden prospect of freedom and of restoration to her country and her family at a moment when she had delivered herself up to despair afforded her a great and instantaneous benefit she could not indeed sufficiently restrain her spirits and smiled incredulously when iskander mentioned the impending exertion and fatigues with doubt and apprehension his anxiety to return immediately to epirus determined him to adopt the measures for her rescue without loss of time and on his third visit he prepared her for making the great attempt on the ensuing morn hitherto iskander had refrained from revealing himself to iduna he was induced to adopt this conduct by various considerations he could no longer conceal from himself that the daughter of hunniades exercised an influence over his feelings which he was unwilling to encourage his sincere friendship for nicæus and his conviction that it was his present duty to concentrate all his thought and affection in the cause of his country would have rendered him anxious to have resisted any emotions of the kind even could he have flattered himself that there was any chance of their being returned by the object of his rising passion but iskander was as modest as he was brave and gifted the disparity of age between himself and iduna appeared an insuperable barrier to his hopes even had there been no other obstacle iskander struggled with his love and with his strong mind the struggle though painful was not without success he felt that he was acting in a manner which must ultimately tend to the advantage of his country the happiness of his friend and perhaps the maintenance of his own selfrespect for he had too much pride not to be very sensible to the bitterness of rejection  had he perceived more indications of a very cordial feeling subsisting between nicæus and iduna he would perhaps not have persisted in maintaining his disguise but he had long suspected that the passion of the prince of athens was not too favourably considered by the daughter of hunniades and he was therefore exceedingly anxious that nicæus should possess all the credit of the present adventure which iskander scarcely doubted if successful would allow nicæus to urge irresistible claims to the heart of a mistress whom he had rescued at the peril of his life from slavery and dishonour to offer rank reputation and love iskander took therefore several opportunities of leading iduna to believe that he was merely the confidential agent of nicæus and that the whole plan of her rescue from the seraglio of adrianople bad been planned by his young friend in the meantime during the three days on which they had for short intervals met very few words had been interchanged between nicæus and his mistress those words indeed had been to him of the most inspiring nature and expressed such a deep scale of gratitude and such lively regard that nicæus could no longer resist the delightful conviction that he had at length created a permanent interest in her heart often he longed to rush to her couch and press her hand to his lips even the anticipation of future happiness could not prevent him from envying the good fortune of iskander who was allowed to converse with her without restraint and bitterly on their return to the khan did he execrate the pompous eunuch for all the torture which he occasioned him by his silly conversation and the petty tyranny of office with which kaflis always repressed his attempts to converse for a moment with iduna  in the meantime all adrianople sounded with the preparations for the immediate invasion of epirus and the return of iskander to his country became each hour more urgent everything being prepared the adventurers determined on the fourth morning to attempt the rescue they repaired as usual to the serail and were attended by kaflis to the chamber of the tower who congratulated iskander on their way on the rapid convalescence of the captive when they had fairly entered the chamber the physician being somewhat in advance nicæus who was behind commenced proceedings by knocking down the eunuch and iskander instantly turning round to his assistance they succeeded in gagging and binding the alarmed and astonished kaflis iduna then exhibited herself in a costume exactly similar to that worn by nicæus and which her friends had brought to her in their big iskander and iduna then immediately quitted the serail without notice or suspicion and hurried to the khan where they mounted their horses that were in readiness and hastened without a moments loss of time to a fountain without the gates where they awaited the arrival of nicæus with anxiety after remaining a few minutes in the chamber of the tower the prince of athens stole out taking care to secure the door upon kaflis he descended the staircase and escaped through the serail without meeting any one and had nearly reached the gate of the gardens when he was challenged by some of the eunuch guard at a little distance  hilloa exclaimed one i thought you passed just now  so i did replied nicæus with nervous effrontery but i came back for my bag which i left behind and giving them no time to reflect he pushed his way through the gate with all the impudence of a page he rushed through the burialground hurried through the streets mounted his horse and galloped through the gates iskander and iduna were in sight he waved his hand for them at once to proceed and in a moment without exchanging a word they were all galloping at full speed nor did they breathe their horses until sunset  by nightfall they had reached a small wood of chestnuttrees where they rested for two hours more for the sake of their steeds than their own refreshment for anxiety prevented iduna from indulging in any repose as much as excitement prevented her from feeling any fatigue iskander lit a fire and prepared their rough meal unharnessed the horses and turned them out to their pasture nicæus made iduna a couch of fern and supported her head while in deference to his entreaties she endeavoured in vain to sleep before midnight they were again on their way and proceeded at a rapid pace towards the mountains until a few hours before noon when their horses began to sink under the united influence of their previous exertions and the increasing heat of the day iskander looked serious and often threw a backward glance in the direction of adrianople  we must be beyond pursuit said nicæus i dare say poor kaflis is still gagged and bound  could we but reach the mountains replied his companion i should have little fear but i counted upon our steeds carrying us there without faltering we cannot reckon upon more than three hours start prince our friend kaflis is too important a personage to be long missed  the holy virgin befriend us said the lady iduna i ca urge my poor horse no more  they had now ascended a small rising ground which gave the wide prospect over the plain iskander halted and threw an anxious glance around him  there are some horsemen in the distance whom i do not like said the physician  i see them said nicæus travellers like ourselves  let us die sooner than be taken said iduna  move on said the physician and let me observe these horsemen alone i would there were some forest at hand in two hours we may gain the mountains  the daughter of hunniades and the prince of athens descended the rising ground before them but at a considerable distance was a broad and rapid river crossed by a ruinous roman bridge the opposite bank of the river was the termination of a narrow plain which led immediately to the mountains  fair iduna you are safe said the prince of athens  dear nicæus replied his companion imagine what i feel  it is too wild a moment to express my gratitude  i trust that iduna will never express her gratitude to nicæus answered the prince it is not i assure you a favourite word with him  their companion rejoined them urging his wearied horse to its utmost speed  nicæus he called out halt  they stopped their willing horses  how now my friend said the prince you look grave  lady iduna said the armenian we are pursued  hitherto the prospect of success and the consciousness of the terrible destiny that awaited failure had supported iduna under exertions which under any other circumstances must have proved fatal but to learn at the very moment that she was congratulating herself on the felicitous completion of their daring enterprise that that dreaded failure was absolutely impending demanded too great an exertion of her exhausted energies she turned pale she lifted up her imploring hands and eyes to heaven in speechless agony and then bending down her head wept with unrestrained and harrowing violence the distracted nicæus sprung from his horse endeavoured to console the almost insensible iduna and then woefully glancing at his fellow adventurer wrung his hands in despair his fellow adventurer seemed lost in thought  they come said nicæus starting methinks i see one on the brow of the hill away fly let us at least die fighting dear dear iduna would that my life could ransom thine o god this is indeed agony  escape is impossible said iduna in a tone of calmness which astonished them they must overtake us alas brave friends i have brought ye to this pardon me pardon me i am ashamed of my selfish grief ascribe it to other causes than a narrow spirit and a weak mind one course alone is left to us we must not be taken prisoners ye are warriors and can die as such i am only a woman but i am the daughter of hunniades nicæus you are my fathers friend i beseech you sheathe your dagger in my breast  the prince in silent agony pressed his hands to his sight his limbs quivered with terrible emotion suddenly he advanced and threw himself at the feet of his hitherto silent comrade oh iskander exclaimed nicæus great and glorious friend my head and heart are both too weak for these awful trials save her save her  iskander exclaimed the thunderstruck iduna iskander  i have indeed the misfortune to be iskander beloved lady he replied this is indeed a case almost of desperation but if i have to endure more than most men i have to inspire me influences which fall to the lot of few yourself and epirus come nicæus there is but one chance we must gain the bridge thus speaking iskander caught iduna in his arms and remounting his steed and followed by the prince of athens hurried towards the river  the water is not fordable said iskander when they had arrived at its bank the bridge i shall defend and it will go hard if i do not keep them at bay long enough for you and iduna to gain the mountains away think no more of me nay no tear dear lady or you will unman me an ins inspiring smile and all will go well hasten to croia and let nothing tempt you to linger in the vicinity with the hope of my again joining you believe me we shall meet again but act upon what i say as if they were my dying words god bless you nicæus no murmuring for once let the physician indeed command his page gentle lady commend me to your father would i had such a daughter in epirus to head my trusty brethren if i fall tell the great hunniades my legacy to him is my country farewell farewell  i will not say farewell exclaimed iduna i too can fight i will stay and die with you  see they come believe me i shall conquer fly fly thou noble girl guard her well nicæus god bless thee boy live and be happy nay nay not another word the farther ye are both distant trust me the stronger will be my arm indeed indeed i do beseech ye fly  nicæus placed the weeping iduna in her saddle and after leading her horse over the narrow and broken bridge mounted his own and then they ascended together the hilly and winding track iskander watched them as they went often iduna waved her kerchief to her forlorn champion in the meantime iskander tore off his armenian robes and flung them into the river tried his footing on the position he had taken up stretched his limbs examined his daggers flourished his scimitar  the bridge would only permit a single rider to pass abreast it was supported by three arches the centre one of very considerable size the others small and rising out of the shallow water on each side in many parts the parapet wall was broken in some even the pathway was almost impassable from the masses of fallen stone and the dangerous fissures in the centre of the middle arch was an immense keystone on which was sculptured in high relief an enormous helmet which indeed gave among the people of the country a title to the bridge  a band of horsemen dashed at full speed with a loud shout down the bill they checked their horses when to their astonishment they found iskander with his drawn scimitar prepared to resist their passage but they paused only for a moment and immediately attempted to swim the river but their exhausted horses drew back with a strong instinct from the rushing waters one of the band alone mounted on a magnificent black mare succeeding in his purpose the rider was halfway in the stream his highbred steed snorting and struggling in the strong current iskander with the same ease as if he were plucking the ripe fruit from a tree took up a ponderous stone and hurled it with fatal precision at his adventurous enemy the rider shrieked and fell and rose no more the mare relieved from her burthen exerted all her failing energies and succeeded in gaining the opposite bank there rolling herself in the welcome pasture and neighing with a note of triumph she revelled in her hard escape  cut down the giaour exclaimed one of the horsemen and he dashed at the bridge his fragile blade shivered into a thousand pieces as it crossed the scimitar of iskander and in a moment his bleeding head fell over the parapet  instantly the whole band each emulous of revenging his comrades rushed without thought at iskander and endeavoured to overpower him by their irresistible charge his scimitar flashed like lightning the two foremost of his enemies fell but the impulse of the numbers prevailed and each instant although dealing destruction with every blow he felt himself losing ground at length he was on the centre of the centre arch an eminent position which allowed him for a moment to keep them at bay and gave him breathing time suddenly he made a desperate charge clove the head of the leader of the band in two and beat them back several yards then swiftly returning to his former position he summoned all his supernatural strength and stamping on the mighty but mouldering keystone he forced it from its form and broke the masonry of a thousand years amid a loud and awful shriek horses and horsemen and the dissolving fragments of the scene for a moment mingled as it were in airy chaos and then plunged with a horrible plash into the fatal depths below some fell and stunned by the massy fragments rose no more others struggled again into light and gained with difficulty their old shore amid them iskander unhurt swam like a river god and stabbed to the heart the only strong swimmer that was making his way in the direction of epirus drenched and exhausted iskander at length stood upon the opposite margin and wrung his garments while he watched the scene of strange destruction  three or four exhausted wretches were lying bruised and breathless on the opposite bank one drowned horse was stranded near them caught by the rushes of all that brave company the rest had vanished and the broad and blue and sunny waters rushed without a shadow beneath the two remaining arches  iduna thou art safe exclaimed iskander now for epirus so saying he seized the black mare renovated by her bath and pasture and vaulting on her back was in a few minutes bounding over his native hills    chapter 13   in the meantime let us not forget the prince of athens and the lady iduna these adventurous companions soon lost sight of their devoted champion and entered a winding ravine which gradually brought them to the summit of the first chain of the epirot mountains from it they looked down upon a vast and rocky valley through which several mule tracks led in various directions and entered the highest barrier of the mountains which rose before them covered with forests of chestnut and ilex nicæus chose the track which he considered least tempting to pursuit and towards sunset they had again entered a ravine washed by a mountain stream the course of the waters had made the earth fertile and beautiful wild shrubs of gay and pleasant colours refreshed their wearied eyesight and the perfume of aromatic plants invigorated their jaded senses upon the bank of the river too a large cross of roughlycarved wood brought comfort to their christian hearts and while the holy emblem filled them with hope and consolation and seemed an omen of refuge from their moslemin oppressors a venerable eremite with a long white beard descending over his dark robes and leaning on a staff of thorn came forth from an adjoining cavern to breathe the evening air and pour forth his evening orisons  iduna and nicæus had hitherto prosecuted their sorrowful journey almost in silence exhausted with anxiety affliction and bodily fatigue with difficulty the daughter of hunniades could preserve her seat upon her steed one thought alone interested her and by its engrossing influence maintained her under all her sufferings the memory of iskander since she first met him at the extraordinary interview in her fathers pavilion often had the image of the hero recurred to her fancy often had she mused over his great qualities and strange career his fame so dangerous to female hearts was not diminished by his presence and now when iduna recollected that she was indebted to him for all that she held dear that she owed to his disinterested devotion not only life but all that renders life desirable honour and freedom country and kindred that image was invested with associations and with sentiments which had iskander himself been conscious of their existence would have lent redoubled vigour to his arm and fresh inspiration to his energy more than once iduna had been on the point of inquiring of nicæus the reason which had induced alike him and iskander to preserve so strictly the disguise of his companion but a feeling which she did not choose to analyse struggled successfully with her curiosity she felt a reluctance to speak of iskander to the prince of athens in the meantime nicæus himself was not apparently very anxious of conversing upon the subject and after the first rapid expressions of fear and hope as to the situation of their late comrade they relapsed into silence seldom broken by nicæus but to deplore the sufferings of his mistress lamentations which iduna answered with a faint smile  the refreshing scene wherein they had now entered and the cheering appearance of the eremite were subjects of mutual congratulation and nicæus somewhat advancing claimed the attention of the holy man announcing their faith imprisonment escape and sufferings and entreating hospitality and refuge the eremite pointed with his staff to the winding path which ascended the bank of the river to the cavern and welcomed the pilgrims in the name of their blessed saviour to his wild abode and simple fare  the cavern widened when they entered and comprised several small apartments it was a work of the early christians who had found a refuge in their days of persecution and art had completed the beneficent design of nature the cavern was fresh and sweet and clean heaven smiled upon its pious inmate through an aperture in the roof the floor was covered with rushes in one niche rested a brazen cross and in another a perpetual lamp burnt before a picture where madonna smiled with meek tenderness upon her young divinity  the eremite placed upon a block of wood the surface of which he had himself smoothed some honey some dried fish and a wooden bowl filled from the pure stream that flowed beneath them a simple meal but welcome his guests seated themselves upon a rushy couch and while they refreshed themselves he gently inquired the history of their adventures as it was evident that the eremite from her apparel mistook the sex of iduna nicæus thought fit not to undeceive him but passed her off as his brother he described themselves as two athenian youths who had been captured while serving as volunteers under the great hunniades and who had effected their escape from adrianople under circumstances of great peril and difficulty and when he had gratified the eremites curiosity respecting their christian brethren in paynim lands and sympathetically marvelled with him at the advancing fortunes of the crescent nicæus who perceived that iduna stood in great need of rest mentioned the fatigues of his more fragile brother and requested permission for him to retire whereupon the eremite himself fetching a load of fresh rushes arranged them in one of the cells and invited the fair iduna to repose the daughter of hunniades first humbling herself before the altar of the virgin and offering her gratitude for all the late mercies vouchsafed unto her and then bidding a word of peace to her host and her companion withdrew to her hardearned couch soon was buried in a sleep as sweet and innocent as herself  but repose fell not upon the eyelids of nicæus in spite of all labours the heart of the athenian prince was distracted by two most powerful of passionslove and jealousyand when the eremite pointing out to his guest his allotted restingplace himself retired to his regular and simple slumbers nicæus quitted the cavern and standing upon the bank of the river gazed in abstraction upon the rushing waters foaming in the moonlight the prince of athens with many admirable qualities was one of those men who are influenced only by their passions and who in the affairs of life are invariably guided by their imagination instead of their reason at present all thought and feeling all considerations and all circumstances merged in the overpowering love he entertained for iduna his determination to obtain her at all cost and peril and his resolution that she should never again meet iskander except as the wife of nicæus compared with this paramount object the future seemed to vanish the emancipation of his country the welfare of his friend even the maintenance of his holy creed all those great and noble objects for which under other circumstances he would have been prepared to sacrifice his fortune and his life no longer interested or influenced him and while the legions of the crescent were on the point of pouring into greece to crush that patriotic and christian cause over which iskander and himself had so often mused whose interests the disinterested absence of iskander occasioned solely by his devotion to nicæus had certainly endangered and perhaps could the events of the last few hours be known even sacrificed the prince of athens resolved unless iduna would consent to become his at once to carry off the daughter of hunniades to some distant country nor indeed even with his easily excited vanity was nicæus sanguine of obtaining his purpose by less violent means he was already a rejected suitor and under circumstances which scarcely had left hope nothing but the sole credit of her chivalric rescue could perhaps have obtained for him the interest in the heart of iduna which he coveted for while this exploit proffered an irresistible claim to her deepest gratitude it indicated also on the part of her deliverer the presence and possession of all those great qualities the absence of which in the character and conduct of her suitor iduna had not at a former period endeavoured to conceal to be the principal came of his rejection and now by the unhappy course of circumstances the very deed on which he counted with sanguine hope as the sure means of his success seemed as it were to have placed him in a more inferior situation than before the constant society of his mistress had fanned to all its former force and ardour the flame which apart from her and hopeless he had endeavoured to repress while on the other hand he could not conceal from himself that iduna must feel that he had played in these rest proceeding but a secondary part that all the genius and all the generosity of the exploit rested with iskander who after having obtained her freedom by so much energy peril sagacity and skill had secured it by a devoted courage which might shame all the knights of christendom perhaps too had secured it by his own life  what if iskander were no more it was a great contingency the eternal servitude of greece and the shameful triumph of the crescent were involved perhaps in that single event and could the possession of iduna compensate for such disgrace and infamy let us not record the wild response of passion  it was midnight ere the restless nicæus more exhausted by his agitating reverie than by his previous exertions returned into the cavern and found refuge in sleep from all his disquietudes    chapter 14   the eremite rose with the sun and while he was yet at matins was joined by iduna refreshed and cheerful after her unusual slumbers after performing their devotions her venerable host proposed that they should go forth and enjoy the morning air so descending the precipitous bank of the river he led the way to a small glen the bed of a tributary rivulet now nearly exhausted beautiful clumps of birchtrees and tall thin poplars rose on each side among the rocks covered with bright mosses and parasitical plants of gay and various colours one side of the glen was touched with the golden and grateful beams of the rising sun and the other was in deep shadow  here you can enjoy nature and freedom in security said the eremite for your enemies if they have not already given up their pursuit will scarcely search this sweet solitude  it is indeed sweet holy father said iduna but the captive who has escaped from captivity can alone feel all its sweetness  it is true said the eremite i also have been a captive  indeed holy father to the infidels  to the infidels gentle pilgrim  have you been at adrianople  my oppressors were not the paynim replied the eremite but they were enemies far more dire my own evil passions time was when my eye sparkled like thine gentle pilgrim and my heart was not as pure  god is merciful said iduna and without his aid the strongest are but shadows  ever think so replied the eremite and you will deserve rather his love than his mercy thirty long years have i spent in this solitude meditating upon the past and it is a theme yet fertile in instruction my hours are never heavy and memory is to me what action is to other men  you have seen much holy father  and felt more yet you will perhaps think the result of all my experience very slight for i can only say unto thee trust not in thyself  it is a great truth remarked iduna and leads to a higher one  even so replied the eremite we are full of wisdom in old age as in winter this river is full of water but the fire of youth like the summer sun dries up the stream  iduna did not reply the eremite attracted her attention to a patch of cresses on the opposite bank of the stream every morn i rise only to discover fresh instances of omnipotent benevolence he exclaimed yesterday ye tasted my honey and my fish today i can offer ye a fresh dainty we will break our fast in this pleasant glen rest thou here gentle youth and i will summon thy brother to our meal i fear me much he does not bear so contented a spirit as thyself  he is older and has seen more replied iduna  the eremite shook his head and leaning on his staff returned to the cavern iduna remained seated on a mossy rock listening to the awakening birds and musing over the fate of iskander while she was indulging in this reverie her name was called she looked up with a blush and beheld nicæus  how fares my gentle comrade inquired the prince of athens  as well as i hope you are dear nicæus we have been indeed fortunate in finding so kind a host  i think i may now congratulate you on your safety said the prince this unfrequented pass will lead us in two days to epirus nor do i indeed now fear pursuit  acts and not words must express in future how much we owe to you said iduna my joy would be complete if my father only knew of our safety and if our late companion were here to share it  fear not for my friend replied nicæus i have faith in the fortune of iskander  if any one could succeed under such circumstances he doubtless is the man rejoined iduna but it was indeed an awful crisis in his fate  trust me dear lady it is wise to banish gloomy thoughts  we can give him only our thoughts said iduna and when we remember how much is dependent on his life can they be cheerful  mine must be so when i am in the presence of iduna replied nicæus  the daughter of hunniades gathered moss from the rock and threw it into the stream  dear lady said the prince of athens seating himself by her side and stealing her gentle hand pardon me if an irrepressible feeling at this moment impels me to recur to a subject which i would fain hope were not so unpleasing to you as once unhappily you deemed it o iduna iduna best and dearest we are once more together once more i gaze upon that unrivalled form and listen to the music of that matchless voice i sought you i perhaps violated my pledge but i sought you in captivity and sorrow pardon me pity me iduna oh iduna if possible love me  she turned away her head she turned away her streaming eyes it is impossible not to love my deliverers she replied in a low and tremulous voice even could he not prefer the many other claims to affection which are possessed by the prince of athens i was not prepared for this renewal of a most painful subject perhaps not under any circumstances but least of all under those in which we now find ourselves  alas exclaimed the prince i can no longer control my passion my life not my happiness merely depends upon iduna becoming mine bear with me my beloved bear with me were you nicæus you too would need forgiveness  i beseech you cease exclaimed iduna in a firmer voice and withdrawing her hand she suddenly rose this is neither the time nor place for such conversation i have not forgotten that but a few days back i was a hopeless captive and that my life and fame are even now in danger great mercies have been vouchsafed to me but still i perhaps need the hourly interposition of heavenly aid other than such worldly thoughts should fill my mind and do dear nicæus she continued in a more soothing tone you have nobly commenced a most heroic enterprise fulfil it in like spirit  he would have replied but at this moment the staff of the eremite sounded among the rocks baffled and dark with rage and passion the prince of athens quitted iduna and strolled towards the upper part of the glen to conceal his anger and disappointment  eat gentle youth said the eremite will not thy brother join us what may be his name  nicæus holy father  and thine  iduna blushed and hesitated at length in her confusion she replied iskander  nicæus called out the eremite iskander and myself await thee  iduna trembled she was agreeably surprised when the prince returned with a smiling countenance and joined in the meal with many cheerful words  now i propose said the eremite that yourself and your brother iskander should tarry with me some days if indeed my simple fare have any temptation  i thank thee holy father replied nicæus but our affairs are urgent nor indeed could i have tarried here at all had it not been for my young iskander here who as you may easily believe is little accustomed to his late exertions but indeed towards sunset we must proceed  bearing with us added iduna a most grateful recollection of our host  god be with ye wherever ye may proceed replied the eremite  my trust is indeed in him rejoined iduna    chapter 15   and so two hours before sunset mounting their refreshed horses nicæus and iduna quitted with many kind words the cavern of the eremite and took their way along the winding bank of the river throughout the moonlit night they travelled ascending the last and highest chain of mountains and reaching the summit by dawn the cheerful light of morning revealed to them the happy plains of a christian country with joyful spirits they descended into the fertile land and stopped at a beautiful greek village embowered in orchards and groves of olivetrees  the prince of athens instantly inquired for the primate or chief personage of the village and was conducted to his house but its master he was informed was without supervising the commencement of the vintage leaving iduna with the family of the primate nicæus went in search of him the vineyard was full of groups busied in the most elegant and joyous of human occupations gathering with infinite bursts of merriment the harvest of the vine some mounted on ladders fixed against the festooning branches plucked the rich bunches and threw them below where girls singing in chorus caught them in panniers or their extended drapery in the centre of the vineyard a middleaged man watched with a calm but vigilant eye the whole proceedings and occasionally stimulated the indolent or prompted the inexperienced  christo said the prince of athens when he had approached him the primate turned round but evidently did not immediately recognise the person who addressed him  i see continued the prince that my meditated caution was unnecessary my strange garb is a sufficient disguise  the prince nicæus exclaimed the primate he is indeed disguised but will i am sure pardon his faithful servant  not a word christo replied the prince to be brief i have crossed the mountains from roumelia and have only within this hour recognised the spot whither i have chanced to arrive i have a companion with me i would not be known you comprehend affairs of state i take it for granted that there are none here who will recognise me after three years absence in this dress  you may feel secure my lord replied christo if you puzzled me who have known you since you were no bigger than this bunch of grapes you will quite confound the rest  tis well i shall stay here a day or two in order to give them an opportunity to prepare for my reception in the meantime it is necessary to send on a courier at once you must manage all this for me christo how are your daughters  so so please your highness replied christo a man with seven daughters has got trouble for every day in the week  but not when they are so pretty as yours are  poh poh handsome is that handsome does and as for alexina she wants to be married  very natural let her marry by all means  but helena wants to do the same  more natural still for if possible she is prettier for my part i could marry them both  ay ay that is all very well but handsome is that handsome does i have no objection to alexina marrying and even helena but then there is lais  hah hah hah exclaimed the prince i see my dear christo that my foster sisters give you a very proper portion of trouble however i must be off to my travelling companion come in as soon as you can my dear fellow and will settle everything a good vintage to you and only as much mischief as necessary so saying the prince tripped away  well who would have thought of seeing him here exclaimed the worthy primate the same gay dog as ever what can he have been doing at roumelia affairs of state indeed ill wager my new epiphany scarf that whatever the affairs are there is a pretty girl in the case    chapter 16   the fair iduna after all her perils and sufferings was at length sheltered in safety under a kind and domestic roof alexina and helena and lais and all the other sisters emulated each other in the attentions which they lavished upon the two brothers but especially the youngest their kindness indeed was only equalled by their ceaseless curiosity and had they ever waited for the answers of iduna to their questions the daughter of hunniades might perhaps have been somewhat puzzled to reconcile her responses with probability helena answered the questions of alexina lais anticipated even helena all that iduna had to do was to smile and be silent and it was universally agreed that iskander was singularly shy as well as excessively handsome in the meantime when nicæus met iduna in the evening of the second day of their visit he informed her that he had been so fortunate as to resume an acquaintance with an old companion in arms in the person of a neighbouring noble who had invited them to rest at his castle at the end of their next days journey he told her likewise that he had dispatched a courier to croia to inquire after iskander who he expected in the course of a few days would bring them intelligence to guide their future movements and decide whether they should at once proceed to the capital of epirus or advance into bulgaria in case hunniades was still in the field on the morrow therefore they proceeded on their journey nicæus had procured a litter for iduna for which her delicate health was an excuse to alexina and her sisters and they were attended by a small body of wellarmed cavalry for according to the accounts which nicæus had received the country was still disturbed they departed at break of day nicæus riding by the side of the litter and occasionally making the most anxious inquiries after the wellbeing of his fair charge an hour after noon they rested at a well surrounded by olivetrees until the extreme heat was somewhat allayed and then remounting proceeded in the direction of an undulating ridge of green hills that partially intersected the wide plain towards sunset the prince of athens withdrew the curtains of the litter and called the attention of iduna to a very fair castle rising on a fertile eminence and sparkling in the quivering beams of dying light  i fear said nicæus that my friend justinian will scarcely have returned but we are old comrades and he desired me to act as his seneschal for your sake i am sorry iduna for i feel convinced that he would please you  it is indeed a fair castle replied iduna and none but a true knight deserves such a noble residence  while she spoke the commander of the escort sounded his bugle and they commenced the ascent of the steep a winding road cut through a thick wood of evergreen shrubs the gradual and easy ascent soon brought them to a portal flanked with towers which admitted them into the outworks of the fortification here they found several soldiers on guard and the commander again sounding his bugle the gates of the castle opened and the seneschal attended by a suite of many domestics advanced and welcomed nicæus and iduna the prince of athens dismounting assisted his fair companion from the litter and leading her by the band and preceded by the seneschal entered the castle  they passed through a magnificent hall hung with choice armour and ascending a staircase of pentelic marble were ushered into a suite of lofty chambers lined with oriental tapestry and furnished with many costly couches and cabinets while they admired a spectacle so different to anything they had recently beheld or experienced the seneschal followed by a number of slaves in splendid attire advanced and offered them rare and choice refreshments coffee and confectionery sherbets and spiced wines when they had partaken of this elegant cheer nicæus intimated to the seneschal that the lady iduna might probably wish to retire and instantly a discreet matron followed by six most beautiful girls each bearing a fragrant torch of cinnamon mind roses advanced and offered to conduct the lady iduna to her apartments  the matron and her company of maidens conducted the daughter of hunniades down a long gallery which led to a suite of the prettiest chambers in the world the first was an antechamber painted like a bower but filled with the music of living birds the second which was much larger was entirely covered with venetian mirrors and resting on a bright persian carpet were many couches of crimson velvet covered with a variety of sumptuous dresses the third room was a bath made in the semblance of a gigantic shell its roof was of transparent alabaster glowing with shadowy light    chapter 17   a flourish of trumpets announced the return of the lady iduna and the prince of athens magnificently attired came forward with a smile and led her with a compliment on her resuming the dress of her sex if not of her country to the banquet iduna was not uninfluenced by that excitement which is insensibly produced by a sudden change of scene and circumstances and especially by an unexpected transition from hardship peril and suffering to luxury security and enjoyment their spirits were elevated and gay she smiled upon nicæus with a cheerful sympathy they feasted they listened to sweet music they talked over their late adventures and animated by their own enjoyment they became more sanguine as to the fate of iskander  in two or three days we shall know more said nicæus in the meantime rest is absolutely necessary to you it is only now that you will begin to be sensible of the exertion you have made if iskander be at croia he has already informed your father of your escape if he have not arrived i have arranged that a courier shall be dispatched to hunniades from that city do not be anxious try to be happy i am myself sanguine that you will find all well come pledge me your fathers health fair lady in this goblet of tenedos  how know i that at this moment he may not be at the point of death replied iduna when i am absent from those i love i dream only of their unhappiness  at this moment also rejoined nicæus he dreams perhaps of your imprisonment among barbarians yet how mistaken let that consideration support you come here is to the eremite  as willing if not as sumptuous a host as our present one said iduna and when bythebye do you think that your friend the lord justinian will arrive  oh never mind him said nicæus he would have arrived tomorrow but the great news which i gave him has probably changed his plans i told him of the approaching invasion and he has perhaps found it necessary to visit the neighbouring chieftains or even to go on to croia  welladay exclaimed iduna i would we were in my fathers camp  we shall soon be there dear lady replied the prince come worthy seneschal he added turning to that functionary drink to this noble ladys happy meeting with her friends    chapter 18   three or four days passed away at the castle of justinian in which nicæus used his utmost exertions to divert the anxiety of iduna one day was spent in examining the castle on another he amused her with a hawking party on a third he carried her to the neighbouring ruins of a temple and read his favourite Æschylus to her amid its lone and elegant columns it was impossible for any one to be more amiable and entertaining and iduna could not resist recognising his many virtues and accomplishments the courier had not yet returned from croia which nicæus accounted for by many satisfactory reasons the suspense however at length became so painful to iduna that she proposed to the prince of athens that they should without further delay proceed to that city as usual nicæus was not wanting in many plausible arguments in favour of their remaining at the castle but iduna was resolute  indeed dear nicæus she said my anxiety to see my father or hear from him is so great that there is scarcely any danger which i would not encounter to gratify my wish i feel that i have already taxed your endurance too much but we are no longer in a hostile land and guards and guides are to be engaged let me then depart alone  iduna exclaimed nicæus reproachfully alas iduna you are cruel but i did not expect this  dear nicæus she answered you always misinterpret me it would infinitely delight me to be restored to hunniades by yourself but these are no common times and you are no common person you forget that there is one that has greater claims upon you even than a forlorn maiden your country and whether iskander be at croia or not greece requires the presence and exertions of the prince of athens  i have no country replied nicæus mournfully and no object for which to exert myself  nicæus is this the poetic patriot who was yesterday envying themistocles  alas iduna yesterday you were my muse i do not wonder you are wearied of this castle continued the prince in a melancholy tone this spot contains nothing to interest you but for me it holds all that is dear and o gentle maiden one smile from you one smile of inspiration and i would not envy themistocles and might perhaps rival him  they were walking together in the hall of the castle iduna stepped aside and affected to examine a curious buckler nicæus followed her and placing his arm gently in hers led her away  dearest iduna he said pardon me but men struggle for their fate mine is in your power it is a contest between misery and happiness glory and perhaps infamy do not then wonder that i will not yield my chance of the brighter fortune without an effort once more i appeal to your pity if not to your love were iduna mine were she to hold out but the possibility of her being mine there is no career solemnly i avow what solemnly i feel there is no career of which i could not be capable and no condition to which i would not willingly subscribe but this certainty or this contingency i must have i cannot exist without the alternative and now upon my knees i implore her to grant it to me  nicæus said iduna this continued recurrence to a forbidden subject is most ungenerous  alas iduna my life depends upon a word which you will not speak and you talk of generosity no iduna it is not i that i am ungenerous  let me say then unreasonable prince nicæus  say what you like iduna provided you say that you are mine  pardon me sir i am free  free you have ever underrated me iduna to whom do you owe this boasted freedom  this is not the first time remarked iduna that you have reminded me of an obligation the memory of which is indelibly impressed upon my heart and for which even the present conversation cannot make me feel less grateful i can never forget that i owe all that is dear to yourself and your companion  my companion replied the prince of athens pale and passionate my companion am i ever to be reminded of my companion  nicæus said iduna if you forget what is due to me at least endeavour to remember what is due to yourself  beautiful being said the prince advancing and passionately seizing her hand pardon me pardon me i am not master of my reason i am nothing i am nothing while iduna hesitates  she does not hesitate nicæus i desire i require that this conversation shall cease shall never never be renewed  and i tell thee haughty woman said the prince of athens grinding his teeth and speaking with violent action that i will no longer be despised with impunity iduna is mine or is no one elses  is it possible exclaimed the daughter of hunniades is it indeed come to this but why am i surprised i have long known nicæus i quit this castle instantly  you are a prisoner replied the prince very calmly and leaning with folded arms against the wall  a prisoner exclaimed iduna a little alarmed a prisoner i defy you sir you are only a guest like myself i will appeal to the seneschal in the absence of his lord he will never permit the honour of his masters flag to be violated by the irrational caprice of a passionate boy  what lord inquired nicæus  your friend the lord justinian answered iduna he could little anticipate such an abuse of his hospitality  my friend the lord justinian replied nicæus with a malignant smile i am surprised that a personage of the lady idunas deep discrimination should so easily be deceived by a passionate boy is it possible that you could have supposed for a moment that there was any other lord of this castle save your devoted slave  what exclaimed iduna really frightened  i have indeed the honour of finding the lady iduna my guest continued nicæus in a tone of bitter raillery this castle of kallista the fairest in all epirus i inherit from my mother of late i have seldom visited it but indeed it will become a favourite residence of mine if it be as i anticipate the scene of my nuptial ceremony  iduna looked around her with astonishment then threw herself upon a couch and burst into tears the prince of athens walked up and down the hall with an air of determined coolness  perfidious exclaimed iduna between her sobs  lady iduna said the prince and he seated himself by her side i will not attempt to palliate a deception which your charms could alone inspire and can alone justify hear me lady iduna hear me with calmness i love you i love you with a passion which has been as constant as it is strong my birth my rank my fortunes do not disqualify me for an union with the daughter of the great hunniades if my personal claims may sink in comparison with her surpassing excellence i am yet to learn that any other prince in christendom can urge a more effective plea i am young the ladies of the court have called me handsome by your great fathers side i have broken some lances in your honour and even iduna once confessed she thought me clever come come be merciful let my beautiful athens receive a fitting mistress a holy father is in readiness dear maiden come now one smile in a few days we shall reach your fathers camp and then we will kneel as i do now and beg a blessing on our happy union as he spoke he dropped upon his knee and stealing her hand looked into her face it was sorrowful and gloomy  it is in vain nicæus said iduna to appeal to your generosity it is useless to talk of the past it is idle to reproach you for the present i am a woman alone and persecuted where i could least anticipate persecution nicæus i never can be yours and now i deliver myself to the mercy of almighty god  tis well said nicæus from the tower of the castle you may behold the waves of the ionian sea you will remain here a close prisoner until one of my galleys arrive from piræus to bear us to italy mine you must be iduna it remains for you to decide under what circumstances continue in your obstinacy and you may bid farewell for ever to your country and to your father be reasonable and a destiny awaits you which offers everything that has hitherto been considered the source or cause of happiness thus speaking the prince retired leaving the lady iduna to her own unhappy thoughts    chapter 19   the lady iduna was at first inclined to view the conduct of the prince of athens as one of those passionate and passing ebullitions in which her long acquaintance with him had taught her he was accustomed to indulge but when on retiring soon after to her apartments she was informed by her attendant matron that she must in future consider herself a prisoner and not venture again to quit them without permission she began to tremble at the possible violence of an illregulated mind she endeavoured to interest her attendant in her behalf but the matron was too well schooled to evince any feeling or express any opinion on the subject and indeed at length fairly informed iduna that she was commanded to confine her conversation to the duties of her office  the lady iduna was very unhappy she thought of her father she thought of iskander the past seemed a dream she was often tempted to believe that she was still and had ever been a prisoner in the serail of adrianople and that all the late wonderful incidents of her life were but the shifting scenes of some wild slumber and then some slight incident the sound of a bell or the sign of some holy emblem assured her she was in a christian land and convinced her of the strange truth that she was indeed in captivity and a prisoner above all others to the fond companion of her youth her indignation at the conduct of nicæus roused her courage she resolved to make an effort to escape her rooms were only lighted from above she determined to steal forth at night into the gallery the door was secured she hastened back to her chamber in fear and sorrow and wept  twice in the course of the day the stern and silent matron visited iduna with her food and as she retired secured the door this was the only individual that the imprisoned lady ever beheld and thus heavily rolled on upwards of a week on the eve of the ninth day iduna was surprised by the matron presenting her a letter as she quitted the chamber for the night iduna seized it with a feeling of curiosity not unmixed with pleasure it was the only incident that had occurred during her captivity she recognised the handwriting of nicæus and threw it down with vexation at her silliness in supposing for a moment that the matron could have been the emissary of any other person  yet the letter must be read and at length she opened it it informed her that a ship had arrived from athens at the coast and that tomorrow she must depart for italy it told her also that the turks under mahomed had invaded albania and that the hungarians under the command of her father had come to support the cross it said nothing of iskander but it reminded her that little more than the same time that would carry her to the coast to embark for a foreign land would were she wise alike enable nicæus to place her in her fathers arms and allow him to join in the great struggle for his country and his creed the letter was written with firmness but tenderly it left however on the mind of iduna an impression of the desperate resolution of the writer  now it so happened that as this unhappy lady jumped from her couch and paced the room in the perturbation of her mind the wind of her drapery extinguished her lamp as her attendant or visitor had paid her last visit for the day there seemed little chance of its being again illumined the miserable are always more unhappy in the dark light is the greatest of comforters and so this little misfortune seemed to the forlorn iduna almost overwhelming and as she attempted to look around and wrung her hands in very woe her attention was attracted by a brilliant streak of light upon the wall which greatly surprised her she groped her way in its direction and slowly stretching forth her hand observed that it made its way through a chink in the frame of one of the great mirrors which were inlaid in the wall and as she pressed the frame she felt to her surprise that it sprang forward had she not been very cautious the advancing mirror would have struck her with great force but she had presence of mind to withdraw her hand very gradually repressing the swiftness of the spring the aperture occasioned by the opening of the mirror consisted of a recess formed by a closedup window an old wooden shutter or blind in so ruinous a state that the light freely made its way was the only barrier against the elements iduna seizing the handle which remained at once drew it open with little difficulty  the captive gazed with gladdened feelings upon the free and beautiful scene beneath her rose the rich and aromatic shrubs tinged with the soft and silver light of eve before her extended wide and fertile champaign skirted by the dark and undulating mountains in the clear sky glittering and sharp sparkled the first crescent of the new moon an auspicious omen to the moslemin invaders  iduna gazed with joy upon the landscape and then hastily descending from the recess she placed her hands to her eyes so long unaccustomed to the light perhaps too she indulged in momentary meditation for suddenly seizing a number of shawls which were lying on one of the couches she knotted them together and then striving with all her force she placed the heaviest coach on one end of the costly cord and then throwing the other out of the window and entrusting herself to the merciful care of the holy virgin the brave daughter of hunniades successfully dropped down into the garden below  she stopped to breathe and to revel in her emancipated existence it was a bold enterprise gallantly achieved but the danger had now only commenced she found that she had alighted at the back of the castle she stole along upon tiptoe timid as a fawn she remembered a small wicketgate that led into the open country she arrived at the gate it was of course guarded the single sentinel was kneeling before an image of st george beside him was an empty drinkingcup and an exhausted wineskin  holy saint exclaimed the pious sentinel preserve us from all turkish infidels iduna stole behind him shall men who drink no wine conquer true christians continued the sentinel iduna placed her hand upon the lock we thank thee for our good vintage said the sentinel iduna opened the gate with the noiseless touch which a feminine finger can alone command and for the rise of the lord iskander added the sentinel iduna escaped  now she indeed was free swiftly she ran over the wide plain she hoped to reach some town or village before her escape could be discovered and she hurried on for three hours without resting she came to a beautiful grove of olivetrees that spread in extensive ramifications about the plain and through this beautiful grove of olivetrees her path seemed to lead so she entered and advanced and when she had journeyed for about a mile she came to an open and very verdant piece of ground which was as it were the heart of the grove in its centre rose a fair and antique structure of white marble shrouding from the noonday sun the perennial flow of a very famous fountain it was near midnight iduna was wearied and she sat down upon the steps of the fountain for rest and while she was musing over all the strange adventures of her life she heard a rustling in the wood and being alarmed she rose and hid herself behind a tree  and while she stood there with palpitating heart the figure of a man advanced to the fountain from an opposite direction of the grove he went up the steps and looked down upon the spring as if he were about to drink but instead of doing that he drew his scimitar and plunged it into the water and called out with a loud voice the name of iskander three times whereupon iduna actuated by an irresistible impulse came forward from her hidingplace but instantly gave a loud shriek when she beheld the prince mahomed  oh night of glory exclaimed the prince advancing do i indeed behold the fair iduna this is truly magic  away away exclaimed the distracted iduna as she endeavoured to fly from him  he has kept his word that cunning leech better than i expected said mahomed seizing her  as well as you deserve ravisher exclaimed a majestic voice a tall figure rushed forward from the wood and dashed back the turk  i am here to complete my contract prince mahomed said the stranger drawing his sword  iskander exclaimed the prince  we have met before prince let us so act now that we may meet for the last time  infamous infernal traitor exclaimed mahomed dost thou indeed imagine that i will sully my imperial blade with the blood of my runaway slave no i came here to secure thy punishment but i cannot condescend to become thy punisher advance guards and seize him seize them both  iduna flew to iskander who caught her in one arm while he waved his scimitar with the other the guards of mahomed poured forth from the side of the grove whence the prince had issued  and dost thou indeed think mahomed said iskander that i have been educated in the seraglio to be duped by moslemin craft i offer thee single combat if thou desirest it but combat as we may the struggle shall be equal he whistled and instantly a body of hungarians headed by hunniades himself advanced from the side of the grove whence iskander had issued  come on then said mahomed each to his man their swords clashed but the principal attendants of the son of amurath deeming the affair under the present circumstances assumed the character of a mere rash adventure bore away the turkish prince  tomorrow then this fray shall be decided on the plains of kallista said mahomed  epirus is prepared replied iskander  the turks withdrew iskander bore the senseless form of iduna to her father hunniades embraced his longlost child they sprinkled her face with water from the fountain she revived  where is nicæus inquired iskander and how came you again dear lady in the power of mahomed  alas noble sir my twice deliverer answered iduna i have indeed again been doomed to captivity but my persecutor i blush to say was this time a christian prince  holy virgin exclaimed iskander who can this villain be  the villain lord iskander is your friend and your pupil dear father  nicæus of athens exclaimed hunniades  iskander was silent and melancholy  thereupon the lady iduna recounted to her father and iskander sitting between them on the margin of the fount all that had occurred to her since herself and nicæus parted with iskander nor did she omit to relate to hunniades all the devotion of iskander respecting which like a truly brave man he had himself been silent the great hunniades scarcely knew which rather to do to lavish his affection on his beloved child or his gratitude upon iskander thus they went on conversing for some time iskander placing his own cloak around iduna and almost unconsciously winding his arm around her unresisting form  just as they were preparing to return to the christian camp a great noise was heard in the grove and presently in the direction whence iduna had arrived there came a band of men bearing torches and examining the grove in all directions in great agitation iskander and hunniades stood upon their guard but soon perceived they were greeks their leader seeing a group near the fountain advanced to make inquiries respecting the object of his search but when he indeed recognised the persons who formed the group the torch fell from his grasp and he turned away his head and hid his face in his hands  iduna clung to her father iskander stood with his eyes fixed upon the ground but hunniades stern and terrible disembarrassing himself of the grasp of his daughter advanced and laid his hand upon the stranger  young man said the noble father were it contrition instead of shame that inspired this attitude it might be better i have often warned you of the fatal consequences of a reckless indulgence of the passions more than once i have predicted to you that however great might be your confidence in your ingenuity and your resources the hour would arrive when such a career would place you in a position as despicable as it was shameful that hour has arrived and that position is now filled by the prince of athens you stand before the three individuals in this world whom you have most injured and whom you were most bound to love and to protect here is a friend who hazarded his prosperity and his existence for your life and your happiness and you have made him a mere pander to your lusts and then deserted him in his greatest necessities this maiden was the companion of your youth and entitled to your kindest offices you have treated her infinitely worse than her turkish captor and for myself sir your father was my dearest friend i endeavoured to repay his friendship by supplying his place to his orphan child how i discharged my duty it becomes not me to say how you have discharged yours this lady here my daughter your late prisoner sir can best prove  oh spare me spare me sir said the prince of athens turning and falling upon his knee i am most wretched every word cuts to my very core just providence has baffled all my arts and i am grateful whether this lady can indeed forgive me i hardly dare to think or even hope and yet forgiveness is a heavenly boon perhaps the memory of old days may melt her as for yourself sirbut ill not speak i cannot noble iskander if i mistake not you may whisper words in that fair ear less grating than my own may you be happy i will not profane your prospects with my vows and yet ill say farewell  the prince of athens turned away with an air of complete wretchedness and slowly withdrew iskander followed him  nicæus said iskander but the prince entered the grove and did not turn round  dear nicæus said iskander the prince hesitated  let us not part thus said iskander iduna is most unhappy she bade me tell you she had forgotten all  god bless her and god bless you too replied nicæus i pray you let me go  nay dear nicæus are we not friends  the best and truest iskander i will to the camp and meet you in your tent ere morning break at present i would be alone  dear nicæus one word you have said upon one point what i could well wish unsaid and dared to prophesy what may never happen i am not made for such supreme felicity epirus is my mistress my nicæus as there is a living god my friend most solemnly i vow i have had no thoughts in this affair but for your honour  i know it my dear friend i know it replied nicæus i keenly feel your admirable worth say no more say no more she is a fit wife for a hero and you are one    chapter 20   after the battle of the bridge iskander had hurried to croia without delay in his progress he had made many fruitless inquiries after iduna and nicæus but he consoled himself for the unsatisfactory answers he received by the opinion that they had taken a different course and the conviction that all must now be safe the messenger from croia that informed hunniades of the escape of his daughter also solicited his aid in favour of epirus against the impending invasion of the turks and stimulated by personal gratitude as well as by public duty hunniades answered the solicitation in person at the head of twenty thousand lances  hunniades and iskander had mutually flattered themselves when apart that each would be able to quell the anxiety of the other on the subject of iduna the leader of epirus flattered himself that his late companions had proceeded at once to transylvania and the vaivode himself had indulged in the delightful hope that the first person he should embrace at croia would be his longlost child when therefore they met and were mutually incapable of imparting any information on the subject to each other they were filled with astonishment and disquietude events however gave them little opportunity to indulge in anxiety or grief on the day that hunniades and his lances arrived at croia the invading army of the turks under the prince mahomed crossed the mountains and soon after pitched their camp on the fertile plain of kallista  as iskander by the aid of hunniades and the neighbouring princes and the patriotic exertions of his countrymen was at this moment at the head of a force which the turkish prince could not have anticipated he resolved to march at once to meet the ottomans and decide the fate of greece by a pitched battle  the night before the arrival of iduna at the famous fountain the christian army had taken up its position within a few miles of the turks the turbaned warriors wished to delay the engagement until the new moon the eve of which was at hand and it happened on that said eve that iskander calling to mind his contract with the turkish prince made in the gardens of the seraglio at adrianople and believing from the superstitious character of mahomed that he would not fail to be at the appointed spot resolved as we have seen to repair to the fountain of kallista  and now from that fountain the hero retired bearing with him a prize scarcely less precious than the freedom of his country for which he was to combat on the morrows morn  ere the dawn had broken the christian power was in motion iskander commanded the centre hunniades the right wing the left was entrusted at his urgent request to the prince of athens a mist that hung about the plain allowed nicæus to charge the right wing of the turks almost unperceived he charged with irresistible fury and soon disordered the ranks of the moslemin mahomed with the reserve hastened to their aid a mighty multitude of janissaries shouting the name of allah and his prophet penetrated the christian centre hunniades endeavoured to attack them on their flank but was himself charged by the turkish cavalry the battle was now general and raged with terrible fury iskander had secreted in his centre a new and powerful battery of cannon presented to him by the pope and which had just arrived from venice this battery played upon the janissaries with great destruction he himself mowed them down with his irresistible scimitar infinite was the slaughter awful the uproar but of all the christian knights this day no one performed such mighty feats of arms as the prince of athens with a reckless desperation he dashed about the field and everything seemed to yield to his inspired impulse his example animated his men with such a degree of enthusiasm that the division to which he was opposed although encouraged by the presence of mahomed himself could no longer withstand the desperate courage of the christians and fled in all directions then rushing to the aid of iskander nicæus at the head of a body of picked men dashed upon the rear of the janissaries and nearly surrounded them hunniades instantly made a fresh charge upon the left wing of the turks a panic fell upon the moslemin who were little prepared for such a demonstration of strength on the part of their adversaries in a few minutes their order seemed generally broken and their leaders in vain endeavoured to rally them waving his bloody scimitar and bounding on his black charger iskander called upon his men to secure the triumph of the cross and the freedom of epirus pursuit was now general    chapter 21   the turks were massacred by thousands mahomed when he found that all was lost fled to the mountains with a train of guards and eunuchs and left the care of his dispersed host to his pachas the hills were covered with the fugitives and their pursuers some fled also to the seashore where the turkish fleet was at anchor the plain was strewn with corpses and arms and tents and standards the sun was now high in the heavens the mist had cleared away but occasional clouds of smoke still sailed about  a solitary christian knight entered a winding pass in the green hills apart from the scene of strife the slow and trembling step of his wearied steed would have ill qualified him to join in the triumphant pursuit even had he himself been physically enabled but the christian knight was covered with gore unhappily not alone that of his enemies he was indeed streaming with desperate wounds and scarcely could his fainting form retain its tottering seat  the winding pass which for some singular reason he now pursued in solitude instead of returning to the busy camp for aid and assistance conducted the knight to a small green valley covered with sweet herbs and entirely surrounded by hanging woods in the centre rose the ruins of a doric fane three or four columns grey and majestic all was still and silent save that in the clear blue sky an eagle flew high in the air but whirling round the temple  the knight reached the ruins of the doric fane and with difficulty dismounting from his charger fell upon the soft and flowery turf and for some moments was motionless his horse stole a few yards away and though scarcely less injured than its rider instantly commenced cropping the inviting pasture  at length the christian knight slowly raised his head and leaning on his arm sighed deeply his face was very pale but as he looked up and perceived the eagle in the heaven a smile played upon his pallid cheek and his beautiful eye gleamed with a sudden flash of light  glorious bird murmured the christian warrior once i deemed that my career might resemble thine tis over now and greece for which i would have done so much will soon forget my immemorial name i have stolen here to die in silence and in beauty this blue air and these green woods and these lone columns which oft to me have been a consolation breathing of the poetic past and of the days wherein i fain had lived i have escaped from the fell field of carnage to die among them farewell my country farewell to one more beautiful than greece farewell iduna  these were the last words of nicæus prince of athens    chapter 22   while the unhappy lover of the daughter of hunniades breathed his last words to the solitary elements his more fortunate friend received in the centre of his scene of triumph the glorious congratulations of his emancipated country the discomfiture of the turks was complete and this overthrow coupled with their recent defeat in bulgaria secured christendom from their assaults during the remainder of the reign of amurath the second surrounded by his princely allies and the chieftains of epirus the victorious standards of christendom and the triumphant trophies of the moslemin iskander received from the great hunniades the hand of his beautiful daughter thanks to these brave warriors said the hero i can now offer to your daughter a safe an honourable and a christian home  it is to thee great sir that epirus owes its security said an ancient chieftain addressing iskander its national existence and its holy religion all that we have to do now is to preserve them nor indeed do i see that we can more effectually obtain these great objects than by entreating thee to mount the redeemed throne of thy ancestors therefore i say god save iskander king of epirus  and all the people shouted and said god save the king god save iskander king of epirus
