the bosom of a joyful land spread true religion and her genuine fruits the excursionbook vi    prefatory note 1    the following sermons could not be arranged according to any proper  sequence  those however which refer to doctrine and the church seasons  will mostly be found at the beginning of the volume whilst those which  deal with practical subjects are placed at the close  a few of the sermons have already appeared in good words but by far  the greater number were never prepared by their author for the press   they were written out very roughlysometimes at an hours notice as  occasion demandedand were only intended for delivery from the pulpit  the original mss have been adhered to as closely as possible  it is thought that many to whom the late rector of eversley was dear will  welcome the publication of these earnest words and find them helpful in  the christian life  blessed are the dead which die in the lord from henceforth  yea saith  the spirit that they may rest from their labours and their works do  follow them    sermon i  all saints day    westminster abbey  november 1 1874  revelation vii 912  after this i beheld and lo a great multitude  which no man could number of all nations and kindreds and people and  tongues stood before the throne and before the lamb clothed with white  robes and palms in their hands and cried with a loud voice saying  salvation to our god which sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb   and all the angels stood round about the throne and about the elders and  the four beasts and fell before the throne on their faces and  worshipped god saying amen  blessing and glory and wisdom and  thanksgiving and honour and power and might be unto our god for ever  and ever  amen  today is all saints day  on this day we commemorateand as far as  our dull minds will let us contemplatethe saints the holy ones of  god the pure and the triumphantbe they who they may or whence they  may or where they may  we are not bidden to define and limit their  number  we are expressly told that they are a great multitude which no  man could number of all nations and kindreds and peoples and tongues  and most blessed news that is for all who love god and man  we are not  told againand i beg you all to mark this wellthat this great  multitude consists merely of those who according to the popular notion  have gone to heaven as it is called simply because they have not gone  to hell  not so not so  the great multitude whom we commemorate on all  saints day are saints  they are the holy ones the heroes and heroines  of mankind the elect the aristocracy of grace  these are they who have  kept themselves unspotted from the world  they are the pure who have  washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb which  is the spirit of selfsacrifice  they are those who carry the palm branch of triumph who have come out of great tribulation who have  dared and fought and suffered for god and truth and right  nay  there are those among them and many thank godweak women too among  themwho have resisted unto blood striving against sin  and who are easygoing folk like you and me that we should arrogate to  ourselves a place in that grand company  not so  what we should do on  all saints day is to place ourselves with all humility if but for an  hour where we can look afar off upon our betters and see what they are  like and what they do  and what are they like those blessed beings of whom the text speaks   the gospel for this day describes them to us and we may look on that  description as complete for he who gives it is none other than our lord  himself  blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of  heaven  blessed are they that mourn  for they shall be comforted   blessed are the meek  for they shall inherit the earth  blessed are  they who hunger and thirst after righteousness  for they shall be  filled  blessed are the merciful  for they shall obtain mercy  blessed  are the pure in heart  for they shall see god  blessed are the peace makers  for they shall be called the children of god  blessed are they  which are persecuted for righteousness sake  for theirs is the kingdom  of heaven  blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you  and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake   rejoice and be exceeding glad  for great is your reward in heaven  this is what they are like and what we i fear too many of us are not  like  but in proportion as we grow like them by the grace of god just  so far shall we enter into the communion of saints and understand the  bliss of that everlasting all saints day which st john saw in heaven  and what do they do those blessed beings  whatever else they do or do  not do this we are told they dothey worship  they satisfy it would  seem in perfection that mysterious instinct of devotionthat inborn  craving to look upward and adore which let false philosophy say what it  will proves the most benighted idolater to be a man and not a brutea  spirit and not a merely natural thing  they have worshipped and so are blest  they have hungered and thirsted  after righteousness and now they are filled  they have longed for  toiled for it may be died for the true the beautiful and the good  and now they can gaze upward at the perfect reality of that which they  saw on earth only as in a glass darkly dimly and afar and can  contemplate the utterly free the utterly beautiful and the utterly good  in the character of god and the face of jesus christ  they entered while  on earth into the mystery and the glory of selfsacrifice and now they  find their bliss in gazing on the one perfect and eternal sacrifice and  rejoicing in the thought that it is the cause and ground of the whole  universe even the lamb slain before the foundation of the world  i say not that all things are clear to them  how can they be to any  finite and created being  they and indeed angels and archangels must  walk for ever by faith and not by sight  but if there be mysteries in  the universe still hidden from them they know who has opened the sealed  book of gods secret counsels even the lamb who is the lion and the  lion who is the lamb and therefore if all things are not clear to them  all things at least are bright for they can trust that lamb and his  selfsacrifice  in him and through him light will conquer darkness  justice injustice truth ignorance order disorder love hate till god  be all in all and pain and sorrow and evil shall have been exterminated  out of a world for which christ stooped to die  therefore they worship  and the very act of worshipunderstand it wellis that great reward in  heaven which our lord promised them  adoration is their very bliss and  life  it must be so  for what keener what nobler enjoyment for  rational and moral beings than satisfaction with and admiration of a  being better than themselves  therefore they worship and their worship  finds a natural vent in words most fit though few but all expressing  utter trust and utter satisfaction in the worthiness of god  therefore  they worship and by worship enter into communion and harmony not only  with each other not only with angels and archangels but with all the  powers of nature the four beings which are around the throne and with  every creature which is in heaven and in earth and under the earth and  in the sea  for them likewise st john heard saying blessing and  glory and honour and power be unto him that sitteth on the throne and  to the lamb for ever and ever  and why  i think with all humility that the key to all these hymns whether of angels or of men or of mere natural thingsis the first hymn  of all the hymn which shows that however grateful to god for what he  has done for them those are whom the lamb has redeemed by his blood to  god out of every kindred and nation and tongue yet nevertheless the  hymn of hymns is that which speaks not of gratitude but of absolute  moral admirationthe hymn which glorifies god not for that which he is  to man not for that which he is to the universe but for that which he  is absolutely and in himselfthat which he was before all worlds and  would be still though the whole universe all created things and time  and space and matter and every created spirit likewise should be  annihilated for ever  and what is that  holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is to come  ah what a gospel lies within those words  a gospel  ay if you will  receive it the root of all other possible gospels and good news for all  created beings  what a gospel and what an everlasting fount of comfort   surely of those words it is true blessed are they who going through  the vale of misery find therein a well and the pools are filled with  water  know you not what i mean  happier perhaps are youthe young  at least among youif you do not know  but some of you must know too  well  it is to them i speak  were you never not merely puzzledall  thinking men are thatbut crushed and sickened at moments by the mystery  of evil  sickened by the follies the failures the ferocities the  foulnesses of mankind for ages upon ages past  sickened by the sins of  the unholy manysickened alas by the imperfections even of the holiest  few  and have you never cried in your hearts with longing almost with  impatience surely surely there is an ideal holy one somewhere or else  how could have arisen in my mind the conception however faint of an  ideal holiness  but where oh where  not in the world around strewed  with unholiness  not in myselfunholy too without and withinseeming  to myself sometimes the very worst company of all the bad company i meet  because it is the only bad company from which i cannot escape  oh is  there a holy one whom i may contemplate with utter delight and if so  where is he  oh that i might behold if but for a moment his perfect  beauty even though as in the fable of semele of old the lightning of  his glance were death  nay more has it not happened to some hereto  clergyman lawyer physician perhaps alas to some pureminded noble hearted womanto be brought in contact perforce with that which truly  sickens themwith some case of human folly baseness foulnesswhich  however much their soul revolts from it they must handle they must toil  over many weeks and months in hope that that which is crooked may be  made somewhat straight till their whole soul was distempered all but  degraded by the continual sight of sin till their eyes seemed full of  nothing but the dance of death and their ears of the gibbering of  madmen and their nostrils with the odours of the charnel house and they  longed for one breath of pure air one gleam of pure light one strain of  pure music to wash their spirits clean from those foul elements into  which their duty had thrust them down perforce  and then oh then has there not come to such an onei know that it has  comethat for which his spirit was athirst the very breath of pure air  the very gleam of pure light the very strain of pure music for it is  the very music of the spheres in those same words holy holy holy  lord god almighty which was and is and is to come and he has  answered with a flush of keenest joy yes  whatever else is unholy  there is an holy one spotless and undefiled serene and selfcontained   whatever else i cannot trust there is one whom i can trust utterly   whatever else i am dissatisfied with there is one whom i can contemplate  with utter satisfaction and bathe my stained soul in that eternal fount  of purity  and who is he  who save the cause and maker and ruler of  all things past present and to come  ah gospel of all gospels that  god himself the almighty god is the eternal and unchangeable  realisation of all that i and all mankind in our purest and our noblest  moments have ever dreamed concerning the true the beautiful and the  good  even though he slay me the unholy yet will i trust in him  for  he is holy holy holy and can do nothing to me or any creature save  what he ought  for he has created all things and for his pleasure they  are and were created  whosoever has entered though but for a moment however faintly  partially stupidly into that thought of thoughts has entered in so far  into the communion of the elect and has had his share in the everlasting  all saints day which is in heaven  he has been though but for a  moment in harmony with the polity of the living god the heavenly  jerusalem and with an innumerable company of angels and the church of  the firstborn who are written in heaven and with the spirits of just  men made perfect and with all past present and to come in this and in  all other worlds of whom it is written blessed are the poor in spirit   for theirs is the kingdom of heaven  blessed are they who hunger and  thirst after righteousness  for they shall be filled  blessed are the  pure in heart  for they shall see god  blessed are they who are  persecuted for righteousness sake  for theirs is the kingdom of  heaven  great indeed is their reward for it is no less than the very  beatific vision to contemplate and adore  that supreme moral beauty of  which all earthly beauty all nature all art all poetry all music are  but phantoms and parables hints and hopes dim reflected rays of the  clear light of that everlasting day of which it is writtenthat the  city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it  for  the glory of god did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof    sermon ii  preparation for advent    westminster abbey  november 15 1874  amos iv 12  prepare to meet thy god o israel  we read today for the first lesson parts of the prophecy of amos   they are somewhat difficult here and there to understand but  nevertheless amos is perhaps the grandest of the hebrew prophets next to  isaiah  rough and homely as his words are there is a strength a  majesty and a terrible earnestness in them which it is good to listen  to and specially good now that advent draws near and we have to think  of the coming of our lord jesus christ and what his coming means   prepare to meet thy god says amos in the text  perhaps he will tell  us how to meet our god  amos is specially the poor mans prophet for he was a poor man himself  not a courtier like isaiah or a priest like jeremiah or a sage like  daniel but a herdsman and a gatherer of sycamore fruit in tekoa near  bethlehem where amos was born  yet to this poor man looking after  sheep and cattle on the downs and pondering on the wrongs and misery  around the word of the lord came and he knew that god had spoken to  him and that he must go and speak to men at the risk of his life what  god had bidden against all the nations round and their kings and  against the king and nobles and priests of israel and the king and  nobles and priests of judah and tell them that the day of the lord is at  hand and that they must prepare to meet their god  and he said what he  felt he must say with a noble freedom with a true independence such as  the grace of god alone can give  amaziah the priest of bethel who was  worshipping absurd as it may seem to us god and the golden calf at the  same time in king jeroboams court complained loudly it would seem of  amoss plain speaking  how uncourteous to prophesy that jeroboam should  die by the sword and israel be carried captive out of their own land   let him go home into his own land of judah and prophesy there but not  prophesy at bethel for it was the kings chapel and the kings court   amos went i presume in fear of his life  but he left noble words  behind him  i was no prophet he said to amaziah nor a prophets  son but a herdsman and a gatherer of wild figs  and the lord took me  as i followed the flock and said go prophesy unto my people israel   and then he turned on that smooth courtpriest amaziah and pronounced  against him in the name of the lord a curse too terrible to be repeated  here  now what was the secret of this inspired herdsmans strength  what  helped him to face priests nobles and kings  what did he believe   what did he preach  he believed and preached the kingdom of god and his  righteousness the simple but infinite difference between right and  wrong and the certain doom of wrong if wrong was persisted in  he  believed in the kingdom of god  he told the kings and the people of all  the nations round that they had committed cruel and outrageous sins not  against the jews merely but against each other  in the case of moab  the culminating crime was an insult to the dead  he had burned the bones  of the king of edom into lime  in the case of ammon it was brutal  cruelty to captive women but in the cases of gaza of tyre and of edom  it was slavemaking and slavetrading invasions of palestine  thus  saith the lord  for three transgressions of gaza and for four i will  not turn away the punishment thereof because they carried away captive  the whole captivity to deliver them up to edom  but i will send a fire  upon the wall of gaza which shall devour the palaces thereof  yes  slavehunting and slavetrading warsthat was and is an iniquity  which the just and merciful ruler of the earth would not and will not  pardon  and honour to those who as in africa of late put down those  foul deeds wheresoever they are done who at the risk of their own  lives dare free the captives from their chains and who if interfered  with in their pious work dare execute on armed murderers and manstealers  the vengeance of a righteous god  for the lord god was their king and  their judge whether they knew it or not  and for three transgressions  of theirs and for four the lord would not turn away their punishment  but would send fire and sword among them and they should be carried away  captive as they had carried others away  but to go back  amos next  turns to his own countrymento judah and israel who were then two  separate nations  for three transgressions of judah and for four the  lord would not turn away their punishment because they had despised the  law of the lord and had not walked in his commandments  therefore he  would send a fire on judah and it should devour the palaces of  jerusalem  but amos is most bitter against israel against the court of  king jeroboam at samaria and against the rich men of israel the bulls  of bashan as he calls them  for three transgressions and for four the  lord would not turn away their punishment  and why  now see what i meant when i said that amos believed not only in the  kingdom of god but in the righteousness of god  it was not merely that  they were worshipping idolsgolden calves at dan and bethel and  samaria at the same time that they worshipped the true god  that was  bad but there was more behind  these men were bad proud luxurious  cruel they were selling their countrymen for slavesselling he says so  twice as if it was some notorious and special case an honest man for  silver and the poor for a pair of shoes  they were lying down on  clothes taken on pledge by every altar  they were breaking the seventh  commandment in an abominable way  they were falsifying weights and  measures and selling the refuse of the wheat  they stored up the fruits  of violence and robbery in their palaces  they hated him who rebuked  them and abhorred him that spoke uprightly  they trod upon the poor and  crushed the needy and then said to their stewards bring wine and let  us drink  therefore though they had built houses of hewn stone they  should not live in them  they had planted pleasant vineyards but should  not drink of them  and all the while these superstitious and wicked rich  men were talking of the day of the lord and hoping that the day of the  lord would appear  you if you have read your bibles carefully and reverently must surely  be aware that the day of the lord either in the old testament or in the  new does not mean merely the final day of judgment but any striking  event any great crisis in the worlds history which throws a divine  light upon that history and shows to menat least to those who have  eyes wherewith to seethat verily there is a god who judges the earth in  righteousness and ministers true judgment among the peoplea god whom  men and all their institutions should always be prepared to meet lest  coming suddenly he find them sleeping  if you are not aware of this  the real meaning of a day of the lord a day of the son of man let me  entreat you to go and search the scriptures for yourselves for in them  ye think ye have eternal life and they are they which testify of the  lord of that eternal son of whom the second psalm speaks in words which  mobs and tyrants the atheist and the superstitious are alike willing to  forget  in the time of amos the rich tyrants of israel seem to have meant by the  day of the lord some vague hope that in those dark and threatening  times god would interfere to save them if they were attacked by foreign  armies  but woe to you that desire the day of the lord says amos the  herdsman  what do you want with it  you will find it very different  from what you expect  there is a day of the lord coming he says  therefore prepare to meet your god  but you are unprepared and you will  find the day of the lord very different from what you expect  it will be  a day in which you will learn the righteousness of god  because he is  righteous he will not suffer your unrighteousness  because he is good  he will not permit you to be bad  the day of the lord to you will be  darkness and not light not as you dream deliverance from the invaders  but ruin by the invaders from which will be no escape  as if a man did  flee from a lion and a bear met him or went into the house and leaned  his hand on the wall and a serpent bit him  there will be no escape  for those wicked men  though they dug into hell gods hand would take  them though they climbed up into heaven god would fetch them down  though they hid in the bottom of the sea god would command the serpent  and it should bite them  he would sift the house of israel among all  nations like corn in a sieve and not a grain should fall to the earth   and all the sinners among gods people should die by the sword who say  the evil shall not overtake us  this was amoss notion of the kingdom of god and his righteousness   these israelites would not obey the laws of gods kingdom and be  righteous and good  but amos told them they could not get rid of gods  kingdom  the lord was king in spite of them and they would find it out  to their sorrow  if they would not seek his kingdom and his government  his government would seek them and find them and find their evildoings  out  if they would not seek gods righteousness his righteousness would  seek them and execute righteous judgment on them  no wonder that the  israelites thought amos a most troublesome and insolent person  no  wonder that the smooth priest amaziah begged him to begone and talk in  that way somewhere else  he saw plainly enough that either amos must  leave samaria or he must leave it  the two could no more work together  than fire and water  amos wanted to make men repent of their sins while  amaziah wanted only to make them easy in their minds and no man can do  both at once  so it was then my friends and so it will be till the end of this wicked  world  the way to please men and be popular always was and always  will be amaziahs way to tell men that they may worship god and the  golden calf at the same time that they may worship god and money  worship god and follow the ways of this wicked world which suit their  fancy and their interest to tell them the kingdom of god is not over you  now christ is not ruling the world now that the kingdom of god will  only come when christ comes at the last day and meanwhile if people  will only believe what they are told and live tolerably respectable  lives they may behave in all things else as if there was no god and no  judgments of god  seeking the righteousness of god say these preachers  of amaziahs school only means that if christs righteousness is  imputed to you need not be righteous yourselves but will go to heaven  without having been good men here on earth  that is the comfortable  message which the world delights to hear and for which the world will  pay a high price to its flatterers  but if any man dares to tell his fellowmen what amos told them and say  the kingdom of god is among you and within you and over you whether  you like or not and you are in it the lord is king be the people never  so unquiet and all power is given to him in heaven and earth already  and at the last great day when he comes in glory he will show that he  has been governing the world and the inhabitants thereof all along  whether they cared to obey him or notif he tell men that the  righteousness of god means thisto pray for the spirit of god and of  christ that they may be perfect as their father in heaven is perfect  and holy as christ is holy for without holiness no man shall see the  lord  if he tell men that the wrath of god was revealed from heaven at  the fall of man and has been revealed continuously ever since against  all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men that indignation and wrath  tribulation and anguish will fall upon every soul of man that doeth evil  and glory honour and peace to every man that worketh goodwhen a man  dares to preach that he is no more likely to be popular with the wicked  world for it is a wicked world than amos was popular or st paul was  popular or our lord jesus christ who gave both to amos and to st paul  their messages was popular  false preachers will dislike that man  because he wishes to make sinners uneasy while they wish to make them  easy  philosophers falsely socalled will dislike that man because he  talks of the kingdom of god the providence of god and they are busyat  least just nowin telling men that there is no providence and no god at least no living god  the covetous and worldly will dislike that man  for they believe that the world is governed not by god but by money   politicians will dislike that man because they think that not god but  they govern the world by those very politics and knavish tricks which  we pray god to confound whenever we sing god save the queen  and the  common peoplethe masseswho ought to hear such a man gladly for his  words are to them if they would understand them a gospel and good news  of divine hope and deliverance from sin and ignorance oppression and  miserythe masses i say will dislike that man because he tells them  that gods will is law and must be obeyed at all risks  and the poor  fools have got into their heads just now that not gods will but the  will of the people is law and that not the eternal likeness of god but  whatever they happen to decide by the majority of the moment is right  and so such a preacher will not be popular with the many  they will  dismiss him at best as they might a public singer or lecturer with  compliments and thanks and so excuse themselves from doing what he tells  them  and he must look for his sincere hearers in the hearts of those and there are such i verily believe in this congregationwho have a  true love and a true fear of christ their incarnate godwho believe  indeed that christ is their king and the king of all the earth who  think that to please him is the most blessed as well as the most  profitable thing which man can do to displease him the most horrible  as well as the most dangerous thing which man can do and who  therefore try to please him by becoming like him by really renouncing  the world and all its mean and false and selfish ways and putting on his  new pattern of man which is created after gods likeness in  righteousness and true holiness  blessed are they for of them it is  written blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after  righteousness for they shall be filled  even christ himself shall fill  them  blessed are they and all that they take in hand for of them it  is written blessed are all they that fear the lord and walk in his  ways  for thou shalt eat the labours of thine hands  the lord is  righteous in all his ways and holy in all his works  the lord is nigh  unto all them that call upon him yea all such as call upon him  faithfully  he will fulfil the desire of them that fear him  he also  will hear their cryay and will help them  happy ay blest will such souls be let the day of the lord appear when  it will or how it will  it may appearthe day of the lord as it has  appeared again and again in historyin the thunder of some mighty war   it may appear after some irresistible though often silent revolution  whether religious or intellectual social or political  it will appear  at last as that great day of days which will conclude so we believe  the drama of human history and all men shall give account for their own  works  but however and whenever it shall appear they at least will  watch its dawning neither with the selfish assurance of modern  pharisaism nor with the abject terror of mediaeval superstition but  with that manful faith with which he who sang the 98th psalm saw the day  of the lord dawn once in the far east more than two thousand years ago  and cried with solemn joy in the glorious words which you have just  heard sungwords which the church of england has embodied in her daily  evening service in order i presume to show her true children how they  ought to look at days of judgment and so prepare to meet their god  show yourselves joyful unto the lord all ye lands  sing rejoice and  give thanks  let the sea make a noise and all that therein is  the round world and  they that dwell therein  let the floods clap their hands and let the hills be joyful together  before the lord  for he cometh to judge the earth  with righteousness shall he judge the world  and the people with  equity  glory be to the father and to the son and to the holy ghost  as it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be world without end   amen    sermon iii  the purifying hope    eversley 1869  windsor castle 1869  1 john iii 2  beloved now are we the sons of god and it doth not yet  appear what we shall be  but we know that when he shall appear we  shall be like him for we shall see him as he is  and every man that  hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure  let us consider this noble text and see something at least of what it  has to tell us  it is like all gods messages all gods laws ay like  gods world in which we live and breathe at once beautiful and awful  full of lifegiving hope but full too of chastening fear  hope for  the glorious future which it opens to poor human beings like us fear  lest so great a promise being left us we should fall short of it by our  own fault  behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed on us  that we should be called the sons of god  there is the root and beginning of all christianityof all true  religion  we are the sons of god and the infinite absolute eternal  being who made this world and all worlds is our father  we are the  children of god  it is not for us to say who are not gods children   that is gods concern not ours  all that we have to do with is the  awful and blessed fact that we are  we were baptised into gods kingdom  in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost  let us  believe the gospel and good news which baptism brings us and say each of  usnot for our own goodness and deserving not for our own faith or  assurance not for anything which we have thought felt or done but  simply out of the free grace and love of god seeking out us unconscious  infants we are children of god  beloved now are we the sons of god  and it doth not yet appear what we shall be  it doth not yet appear  what the next life will be like or what we shall be like in it  that  there will be a next lifethat death does not end all for us the new  testament tells us  yea our own hearts and reasons tell us  that  sentiment of immortality that instinct that the death of our body will  not cannot destroy our souls or ourselvesall men have had that  except a few and it is a question whether they had it not once and have  only lost it by giving way to their brute animal nature  but be that as  it may it concerns us i think very little  for we at least believe  that we shall live again  that we shall live again in some state or  other is as certain to our minds as it was to the minds of our  forefathers even while they were heathens as certain to us as it is  that we are alive now  but in that future state what we shall be like  we know not  st john says that he did not know and we certainly have  no more means of knowing than st john  therefore let us not feed our fancies with pictures of what the next  world will be likepictures i say which are but waking dreams of men  intruding into those things which they have not seen vainly puffed up in  their fleshly mindsthat is in their animal and mortal brain  let us be  content with what st john tells us which is a matter not for our  brains but for our hearts not for our imaginations but for our  conscience which is indeed our highest reason  whatever we do not know  about the next world this he says we do knowthat when god in christ  shall appear we shall be like him  like god  no more  no  but no  less  to be like god it appears is the very end and aim of our being   that we might be like god god our father sent us forth from his eternal  bosom which is the ground of all life in heaven and in earth  that we  might be like god he clothed us in mortal flesh and sent us into this  world of sense  that we might be like god he called us from our  infancy into his church  that we might be like god he gave us the  divine sense of right and wrong and more by the inspiration of his holy  spirit that inward witness that light of god which lightens every man  that cometh into the world he taught us to love the right and hate the  wrong  that we might be like god god is educating us from our cradle to  our grave by every event even the smallest which happens to us  that  we might be like god it is in god that we live and move and have our  being that as the raindrop which falls from heaven rises again surely  soon or late to heaven again so each soul of man coming forth from god  at first should return again to god as many of them as have eternal  life having become like to god from whom it came at first  and how  shall we become like god or rather like christ who is both god and man   to become like god the fatherthat is impossible for finite and created  beings as we are  but to become somewhat at least like god the son  like jesus christ our lord who is the brightness of his fathers glory  and the express image of his person that is not impossible  for he has  revealed himself as a man in the soul and body of a man that our sinful  souls might be made like his pure soul our sinful bodies like his  glorious body and that so he might be the first born among many  brethren  and how  we know that when he appears we shall be like him  for we shall see him as he is  for we shall see him as he is  herein is a great mystery and one which  i do not pretend to fathom  only this i can try to doto shew how it  may seem possible and reasonable from what is called analogy that is by  judging of an unknown thing from a known thing which is at least  something like it  now do we not all know how apt we are to become like  those whom we see with whom we spend our hoursand above all like  those whom we admire and honour  for good and for evil alas  for evil for those who associate with evil or frivolous persons are too apt to  catch not only their low tone but their very manner their very  expression of face speaking and thinking and acting  not only do they  become scornful if they live with scorners false if they live with  liars mean if they live with covetous men but they will actually catch  the very look of their faces  the companions of affected frivolous  people men or women grow to look affected frivolous  indulging in the  same passions they mould their own countenances and their very walk  also the very tones of their voice as well as their dress into the  likeness of those with whom they associate nay of those whose fashions  as they are called they know merely by books and pictures  but thank  god who has put into the hearts of christian people the tendency towards  godjust in the same way does good company tend to make men good high minded company to make them highminded kindly company to make them  kindly modest company to make them modest honourable company to make  them honourable and pure company to make them pure  if the young man or  woman live with such look up to such as their ideal that is the  pattern which they ought to emulatethen as a fact the spirit of god  working in them does mould them into something of the likeness of those  whom they admire and love  i have lived long enough to see more than one  man of real genius stamp his own character thought even his very manner  of speaking for good or for evil on a whole school or party of his  disciples  it has been said and truly i believe that children cannot  be brought up among beautiful picturesi believe even among any  beautiful sights and soundswithout the very expression of their faces  becoming more beautiful purer gentler nobler so that in them are  fulfilled the words of the great and holy poet concerning the maiden  brought up according to god and the laws of god      and she shall bend her ear    in many a secret place where rivulets dance their wayward round and beauty born of murmuring sound    shall pass into her face   but if mere human beings can have this personal influence as it is  called over each others characters if even inanimate things if they  be beautiful can have itwhat must be the personal influence of our  lord jesus christ  of him who is the man of all men the son of man  the perfect and ideal manand more who is very god of very god the  author of all life power wisdom genius in every human being whether  they use to good or abuse to ill his divine gifts the author too of  all natural beauty from the sun over our heads to the flower beneath our  feet  think of that steadily accurately rationally  think of who  christ is and what christ isand then think what his personal influence  must bequite infinite boundless miraculous  so that the very  blessedness of heaven will not be merely the sight of our lord it will  be the being made holy and kept holy by that sight  if only we be fit  for it  for let us ask ourselves the questionif st johns words come  true of us if we should see him as he is would the sight of his all glorious countenance warm us into such life love longing for virtue and  usefulness as we never felt before  or would it crush us into the very  earth with utter shame and humiliation full and awful knowledge of how  weak and foolish sinful and unworthy we wereas it does to gerontius  in the poem when he dreams that after death he demanded rashly and  ambitiously to see our lord and had his wish  that is the question which every one must try to answer for himself in  fear and trembling for he that hath this hope in him purifieth himself  even as he is pure  the common sense of menwhich is often their  conscience and highest reasonhas taught them this more or less  clearly in all countries and all ages  there are very few religions  which have not made purifying of some kind a part of their duty  the  very savage when he enters as he fancies the presence of his god will  wash and adorn himself that he may be fit poor creature for meeting the  paltry god which he has invented out of his own brain and he is right as  far as he goes  the englishman when he dresses himself in his best to  go to church obeys the same reasonable instinct  and indeed is not  holy baptism a sign that this instinct is a true onethat if god be  pure he who enters the presence of god must purify himself even as god  is pure  else why when each person whether infant or adult is  received into christs church is washing with water whether by  sprinkling as now or as of old by immersion the very sign and  sacrament of his being received into gods kingdom  the instinct i say  is reasonable and has its root in the very heart of man  whatsoever we  respect and admire we shall also try to copy if it be only for a time   if we are going into the presence of a wiser man than ourselves we shall  surely recollect and summon up what little wisdom or knowledge we may  have if into the presence of a holier person we shall try to call up in  ourselves those better and more serious thoughts which we so often  forget that we may be even for a few minutes fit for that good  company  and if we go into the presence of a purer person than  ourselves we shall surely unless we be base and brutal call up our  purest and noblest thoughts and try to purify ourselves even as they  are pure  it is true what poets have said again and again that there  are women whose mere presence whose mere look drives all bad thoughts  awaywomen before whom men dare no more speak or act nay even think  basely than they would dare before the angels of god  but if it be soand so it iswhat must we be to be fit to appear  before him who is purity itselfbefore that spotless christ in whom is  no sin and who knows what is in man who is quick and piercing as a two edged sword even to the dividing asunder of the joints and marrow so  that all things are naked and open in the sight of him with whom we have  to do  what purity can we bring into his presence which will not seem  impure to him  what wisdom which will not seem folly  what humility  which will not seem selfconceit  what justice which will not seem  unjust  what love which will not seem hardness of heart in the sight of  him who charges his angels with folly and the very heavens are not clean  in his sight  who loved him better and whom did he love better than st  john  yet what befel st john when in the spirit he saw him even  somewhat as he isand i fell at his feet as dead  if st john himself  was struck down with awe what shall we feel even the best and purest  among us  all we can do is to cast ourselves now and for ever in life  in death and in the day of judgment on his boundless mercy and love who stooped from heaven to die for us and cry god be merciful to me a  sinner  therefore i have many fears for some who are ready enough to talk of  their fulness of hope and their assurance of salvation and to join in  hymns which express weariness of this life and longings for the joys of  heaven and prayers that they may depart and be with christ  if they are  not in earnest in such words they mock god but if they are in earnest  some of them i fear much tempt god  what if he took them at their  word  what if he gave them their wish  what if they departed and  entered the presence of christ only to meet with a worse fate than that  of gerontius  only to be overwhelmed with shame and terror because  though they have been talking of being with christ they have not been  trying to be like christ because they have not sought after holiness  without which no man shall see the lord because they have not tried to  purify themselves even as he is pure and have poor heedless souls  gone out of the world with all their sins upon their head to enter a  place for which they will find themselves utterly unfit because it is a  place into which nothing can enter which defileth or committeth  abomination or maketh a lie and from which the covetous are specially  excluded and in which will be fulfilled the parable of the man who came  to the feast not having on a wedding garmenttake him bind him hand  and foot and cast him into the outer darkness  there shall be wailing  and gnashing of teeth  assurance my friends may be reasonable enough when it is founded on  repentance and hatred of evil and love and practice of what is good   but again assurance may be as unreasonable as it is offensive  we  blame a man who has too much assurance about earthly things  let us  beware that we have not too much assurance about heavenly things  for  our assurance will surely be too great unreasonable built upon the  sand if it be built on mere selfconceit of our own orthodoxy and our  own privileges or our own special connection with god  meanwhile it has been my comfort to meet with somewould god they were  more numerouswho instead of talking of their assurance of salvation  lived in a state of noble selfdiscontent and holy humility who could  see nothing but their own faults and failings who though they were  holier than others considered themselves as unholy though they were  doing more good than others thought themselves useless whose standard  of duty was so lofty that they could think of nothing but how far they  had failed in reaching it who measured themselves not by other men but  by christ himself and doing that had nought to say save god be  merciful to me a sinner  and for such people i have had full assurance  just because they had no assurance themselves  and i have said in my  heart these are worthy just because they think themselves unworthy   these are fit to appear in the presence of god just because they believe  themselves unfit  these are they who will cry at the day of judgment in  wondering humilitylord when saw we thee hungry or thirsty or naked  or in prison and visited thee  and will receive for answerinasmuch  as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have  done it unto me  thou hast been faithful over a few things i will  make thee ruler over many things  enter into the joy of thy lord  to which end may god of his mercy bring us and all we love  amen    sermon iv  the lord coming to his temple    westminster abbey  november 1874  malachi iii 1 2  the lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his  temple     but who may abide the day of his coming and who shall  stand when he appeareth for he is like a refiners fire and like  fullers sope  we believe that this prophecy was fulfilled at the first coming of our  lord jesus christ  we believe that it will be fulfilled again in that  great day when he shall judge the quick and the dead  but it is of  neither of these events i wish to speak to you just now  i wish to speak  of an event which has not as far as we know happened which will  probably never happen but which is still perfectly possible and one  too which it is good for us to face now and then and ask ourselves if  this thing came to pass what should i think and what should i do  i shall touch the question with all reverence and caution  i shall try  to tread lightly as one who is indeed on hallowed ground  for the  question which i have dared to ask you and myself is none other than  thisif the lord suddenly came to this temple or any other in this  land if he appeared among us as he did in judea eighteen hundred years  ago what should we think of him  should we recognise or should we  reject our saviour and our lord  it is an awful thought the more we  look at it  but for that very reason it may be the more fit to be asked  once and for all  now to put this question safely and honestly we must keep within those  words which i just saidas he appeared in judea eighteen hundred years  ago  we must limit our fancy to the historic christ to the sayings  doings character which are handed down to us in the four gospels and  ask ourselves nothing butwhat should i think if such a personage were  to meet me now  to imagine himas has been too often doneas doing  deeds speaking words and even worse entertaining motives which are  not written in the four gospels is as unfair morally as it is illogical  critically  it creates a phantom a fictitious character and calls that  christ  it makes each writer each thinkeror rather dreamerhowever  shallow his heart and stupid his brainand all our hearts are but too  shallow and all our brains too stupidthe measure of a personage so  vast and so unique that all christendom for eighteen hundred years has  seen in him and we of course hold seen truly the incarnate god  no we  must think of nothing save what is set down in holy writ  and yet alas we cannot use in our days that which eighteen hundred  years ago was the most simple and obvious test of our lords  truthfulness namely his miraculous powers  the folly and sin of man  have robbed us of what is as it were one of the natural rights of  reasoning man  lying prodigies and juggleries forged and pretended  miracles evenoh shameimitations of his most sacred wounds have  up to our own time made all rational men more and more afraid of aught  which seems to savour of the miraculous till most of us i think would  have to ask forgivenessas i myself should have to askif tantalized  and insulted again and again by counterfeit miracles we failed to  recognise real miracles and him who performed them  therefore for good  or evil we should be driven back upon that test alone which after all  perhaps is the most sure as well as the most convincingthe moral test the test of character  what manner of personage would he be did he  condescend to appear among us  of that thank god the gospels ought to  leave us in no doubt  what acts he might condescend to perform what  words he might condescend to speak it is not for such beings as we to  guess  but how he would demean himself we know for holy writ has told  us how he demeaned himself in judea eighteen hundred years ago and he is  the same yesterday today and for ever and can be only like himself   but should we know him merely by his bearing and character  should we  see in him an utterly ideal personagethe son of man and therefore ere  we lost sight of him once more the son of god  let us think  first  therefore we must believe thatas in judea of oldchrist would meet  men with all consideration and courtesy  he would not break the bruised  reed nor quench the smoking flax  he would not strive nor cry nor let  his voice be heard in the streets  he would not cause any of gods  little ones to offend to stumble  in plain words he would not shock  and repel them by any conduct of his  therefore as in judea of old he  would be careful of even indulgent to the usages of society as long as  they were innocent  he would never outrage the code of manners however  imperfect however conventional which this or any other civilised nation  may have agreed on to express and keep up respect selfrestraint  delicacy of man toward man of man toward woman of the young ward the  old of the living toward the dead  no  as i said just now he would never cause by any act or word of his one  of gods little ones to stumble and fall away  i used just now that word manners  let me beg your very serious  attention to it  i use it remember in its true its ancientthat is  in its moral and spiritual sense  i use it as the old greeks the old  romans used their corresponding words as our wise forefathers used it  when they said well that manners maketh man that manners are at once  the efficient cause of a mans success and the proof of his deserving to  succeed  the outward and visible sign of whatsoever inward and spiritual  grace or disgrace there may be in him  i mean by the word what our  lord meant when he reproved the pushing and vulgar arrogance of the  scribes and pharisees and laid down the golden rule of all good manners  whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister and  whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant  next i beg you to remember that all or almost all good manners which  we have among uscourtesies refinements selfrestraint and mutual  respectall which raises us socially and morally above our forefathers  of fifteen hundred years agodeephearted men valiant and noble but  coarse and arrogant and quarrelsomeall that or almost all we owe to  christ to the influence of his example and to that bible which  testifies of him  yes the bible has been for christendom in the  cottage as much as in the palace the school of manners and the saying  that he who becomes a true christian becomes a true gentleman is no  rhetorical boast but a solid historic fact  now imagine christ to reappear on earth with that perfect outward beauty  of characterwith what greeks and romans and our own ancestors would  have called those perfect mannerswhich if we are to believe the  gospels he shewed in judea of old which won then so many hearts  especially of the common people sounder judges often of true nobility  than many who fancy themselves their betters  conceivebut which of us  can conceivehis perfect tenderness patience sympathy graciousness  and grace combined with perfect strength stateliness even awfulness  when awe was needed  remember that if again the gospels are to be  believed  he alone of all personages of whom history tells us solved  in his own words and deeds the most difficult paradox of human character to be at once utterly conscious and yet utterly unconscious of self  to combine with perfect selfsacrifice a perfect selfassertion  whether  or not his being able to do that proved him to have been that which he  was the son of god it proves him at least to have been the son of man the unique and unapproachable ideal of humanity utterly inspired by the  holy spirit of god  but again  he condescended in his teaching of old to the level of  jewish knowledge at that time  we may therefore believe that he would  condescend to the level of our modern knowledge and what would that  involve  it would leave him however less than himself at least master  of all that the human race has thought or discovered in the last eighteen  hundred years  think of that  and think again that if he condescended  as in judea of old to employ that knowledge in teaching menhe who knew  what was in man and needed not that any should bear witness to him of  manhe would manifest a knowledge of human nature to which that of a  shakspeare would be purblind and dull a knowledge of which the scripture  nobly says that the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than  any twoedged sword even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and  of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents  of the heart so that all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of  him with whom we have to do  and consider that in the light of that  knowledge he might adapt himself as perfectly to us of this great city  as he did to the villagers of galilee or to the townsmen of jerusalem  consider again that he who spoke as never man yet spake in jerusalem  might speak as man never yet spoke on english soil that he who was  listened to gladly once because he spake with authority and not as the  scribes at second hand and by rule and precedent might be listened to  gladly here once more  for he might speak here not as we poor scribes  can speak at best but with an authority originality earnestness as  well as an eloquence which might exercise a fascination which would be  to all with whom he came in contact what malachi calls it a refiners  firemost purifying though often most painful to the very best a  fascination which might be to every one who came under its spell a  veritable judgment and day of the lord shewing each man with fearful  clearness to which side he really inclined at heart in the struggle  between truth and falsehood good and evil a fascination therefore  equally attractive to those who wished to do right and intolerable to  those who wished to do wrong  consider that last thought  and consider too that those to whom the  fascination of such a personage might be so intolerable that it might  turn to utter hate would probably be those whose moral sense was so  perverted that they thought they were doing right when they were doing  wrong and speaking truth when they were telling lies  it is an awful  thought  but we know that there were such men and too many among the  scribes and pharisees of jerusalem  and human nature is the same in  every age  be that as it mayhowever retired his life he could not  long be hid  he would shortly exercise almost without attempting it an  enormous public influence  but yet as in judea of old would he not be only too successful  would  he not be at once too liberal for some and too exacting for others   would he not as in judea of old encounter not merely the active envy of  the vain and the ambitious which would follow one who spoke as never man  spoke not merely the active malignity of those who wish their fellow creatures to be bad and not good not merely the bigotry of every sect  and party but that mere restless love of new excitements and that dull  fear and suspicion of new truths and even of old truths in new words  which beset the uneducated of every rank and class and in no age more  than in our own  and therefore i must ask in sober sadness how long  would his influence last  it lasted we know in judea of old for some  three years  and then  but i am not going to say that any such  tragedy is possible now  it would be an insult to him an insult to the  gracious influences of his spirit the gracious teaching of his church  to say that of our generation however unworthy we may be of our high  calling in christ  and yet if he had appeared in any country of  christendom only four hundred years ago might he not have endured an  even more dreadful death than that of the cross  but doubtless no personal harm would happen to him here  only there  might come a day in which as in judea of old after he had said these  things many were offended and walked no more with him when his  hearers and admirers would grow fewer and more few some through bigotry  some through envy some through fickleness some through cowardice till  he was left alone with a little knot of earnest disciples who might  diminish alas but too rapidly when they found at he as in judea of  old did not intend to become the head of a new sect and to gratify  their ambition and vanity by making them his delegates  and so the  world the religious world as well as the rest might let him go his way  and vanish from the eyes and minds of men leaving behind little more  than a regret that one so gifted and so fascinating should have provedi  hardly like to say the words and yet they must be saidso unsafe and so  unsound a teacher  i shall not give now the reasons which have led me and not in haste to  this melancholy conclusion  i shall only say that i have come to it  with pain and shame and fear  with shame and fear  for when i ask you  the solemn question would you know christ if he came among you do i not  ask myself a question which i dare not answer  how can i tell whether i  should recognise after all my saviour and my lord  how do i know that  if he said as he but too certainly might something which clashed  seriously with my preconceived notions of what he ought to say i should  not be offended and walk no more with him  how do i know that if he  said as in judea of old will ye too go away i should answer with st  peter lord to whom shall we go  thou hast the words of eternal life  and we believe and are sure that thou art the christ the son of the  living god  i dare not ask that question of myself  how then dare i  ask it of you  i know not  i can only say lord i believe  help thou  mine unbelief  i know not  but this i knowthat in this or any other  world if you or i did recognise him it would be with utter shame and  terror unless we had studied and had striven to copy either himself or  whatsoever seems to us most like him  yes to study the good the  beautiful and the true in him and wheresoever else we find itfor all  that is good beautiful and true throughout the universe are nought but  rays from him the central sunto obey st paul of old and whatsoever  things are true venerable just pure lovely and of good reportif  there be any virtue and if there be any praise to think on these  thingson these scattered fragmentary sacraments of him whose number  is not two nor seven but seventytimes seven that is the wayi  think the only wayto be ready to recognise our saviour and to prepare  to meet our god that he may be to us too as a refiners fire and  refine usour thoughts our deeds our characters throughout  and i think too that this is the way perhaps the only way to rid  ourselves of the fancy that we can be accounted righteous before god for  any works or deservings of our own  those in whom that fancy lingers  must have but a paltry standard of what righteousness is a mean  conception of moralthat is spiritualperfection  but those who look  not inwards but upwards not at themselves but at christ and all  spiritual perfectionthey become more and more painfully aware of their  own imperfections  the beauty of christs character shows them the  ugliness of their own  his purity shows them their own foulness  his  love their own hardness  his wisdom their own folly  his strength their  own weakness  the higher their standard rises the lower falls their  estimate of themselves till in utter humiliation and selfdistrust  they seek comfort ere alone it can be foundin faithin utter faith and  trust in that very moral perfection of christ which shames and dazzles  them and yet is their only hope  to trust in him for themselves and all  they love  to trust that just because christ is so magnificent he will  pity and not despise our meanness  just because he is so pure and  righteous and true and lovely he will appreciate and not abhor our  struggles after purity righteousness truth love however imperfect  however soiled with failureand with worse  just because he is so  unlike us he will smile graciously upon out feeblest attempts to be like  him  just because he has borne the sins and carried the sorrows of  mankind therefore those who come to him he will in no wise cast out   amen    sermon v  advent lessons    westminster abbey first sunday in advent 1873  romans vii 2225  i delight in the law of god after the inward man   but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind  and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members   o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this  death  i thank god through jesus christ our lord  this is the first sunday in advent  today we have prayed that god would  give us grace to put away the works of darkness and put on us the armour  of light  next sunday we shall pray that by true understanding of the  scriptures we may embrace and hold fast the blessed hope of everlasting  life  the sunday after that the ministers and stewards of gods  mysteries may prepare his way by turning the hearts of the disobedient to  the wisdom of the justthe next that his grace and mercy may speedily  help and deliver us from the sins which hinder us in running the race set  before us  but i do not think that we shall understand those collects  or indeed the meaning of advent itself or the reason why we keep the  season of advent year by year unless we first understand the prayer  which we offered up last sunday stir up o lord the wills of thy  faithful peopleand we shall understand that prayer just in proportion  as we have in us the spirit of god or the spirit of the world which is  the spirit of unbelief  worldly people sayand say openly just nowthat this prayer is all a  dream  they say god will not stir up mens wills to do good any more  than to do harm  he leaves men to themselves to get through life as they  can  this heavenly father of whom you speak will not give his holy  spirit to those who ask him  he does not as one of your collects says  put into mens minds good desiresthey come to a man entirely from  outside a man from his early teaching his youthful impressions as they  are called nowadays  he does not either give men grace and power to  put these desires into practice  that depends entirely on the natural  strength of a mans character and that again depends principally on  the state of his brain  so says the world if you wish your own  character to improve you must improve it yourself for god will not  improve it for you  but after all why should you try to improve why  not be content to be just what you are you did not make yourself and  you are not responsible for being merely what god has chosen to make you  this is what worldly men say or at least what they believe and act on  and this is the reason why there is so little improvement in the world  because men do not ask god to improve their hearts and stir up their  wills  i say very little improvement  men talk loudly of the  enlightenment of the age and the progress of the species and the spread  of civilisation and so forth  but when i read old books and compare  old times with these i confess i do not see so much of it as all this  hopeful talk would lead me to expect  men in general have grown more  prudent more cunning from long experience  they have found out that  certain sins do not paythat is they interfere with peoples comfort  and their power of making money and therefore they prudently avoid them  themselves and put them down by law in other mens cases  men have  certainly grown more goodnatured in some countries in that they  dislike more than their ancestors did to inflict bodily torture on human  beings but they are just as ready or even more ready to inflict on  those whom they dislike that moral and mental torture which to noble  souls is worse than any bodily pain  as for any real improvement in  human naturewhere is it  there is just as much falsehood cheating  and covetousness i believe in the world as ever there was just as much  cant and hypocrisy and perhaps more just as much envy hatred malice  and all uncharitableness  is not the condition of the masses in many  great cities as degraded and as sad as ever was that of the serfs in the  middle ages  do not the poor still die by tens of thousands of fevers  choleras and other diseases which we know perfectly how to prevent and  yet have not the will to prevent  is not the adulteration of food just  now as scandalous as it is unchecked  the sins and follies of human  nature have been repressed in one direction only to break out another   and as for open and coarse sin people complain even now and i fear with  justice that there is more drunkenness in england at this moment than  there ever was  so much for our boasted improvement  look again at the wars of the world  fiveandtwenty years ago one used  to be told that the human race was grown too wise to go to war any more  and that we were to have an advent of universal peace and plenty and  since then we have seen some seven great wars the last the most terrible  of alland ever since all the nations of europe have been watching  each other in distrust and dread increasing their armaments working  often night and day at forging improved engines of destruction wherewith  to kill their fellowmen  not that i blame that  it is necessary  yes  but the hideous thing is that it should be necessary  does that state  of things look much like progress of the human race  can we say that  mankind is much improved either in wisdom or in love while all the  nations of europe are spending millions merely to be ready to fight they  know not whom they know not why  no my good friends obey the wise man and clear your minds of cant mans pretensions mans boastfulness mans power of blinding his own  eyes to plain factsabove all to the plain fact that he does not  succeed even in this world of which he fancies himself the master  because he lives without god in the world  all this saddens i had  almost said sickens a thoughtful man till he turns away from this  noisy sham improvement of mankindthe wages of sin which are death to  st johns account of the true improvement of mankind the true progress  of the speciesthe gift of god which is eternal life  and i saw a new  heaven and a new earth  for the first heaven and the first earth were  passed away  and i saw the holy citynew jerusalem coming down from  god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband  and i  heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god  is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people  and god himself shall be with them and be their god  and god shall wipe  away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither  sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain  for the former  things are passed away  does that sound much like a general increase of armaments or like bills  for the prevention of pestilence or of drunkennesswhich even if they  pass will both probably fail to do the good which they propose  no   and if this wicked world is to be mended then god must stir up the wills  of his faithful people and we must pray without ceasing for ourselves  and for all for whom we are bound to pray that he would stir them up   for what we want is not knowledge we have enough of that and too much   too much for knowing so much and doing so little what an account will  be required of us at the last day  no  it is the will which we want in a hundred cases  take that of  pestilential dwellinghouses in our great towns  every one knows that  they ought to be made healthy every one knows that they can be made  healthy  but the will to make them healthy is not here and they are  left to breed disease and death  and so as in a hundred instances  shallow philosophers are proved by facts to be mistaken when they tell  us that man will act up to the best of his knowledge without gods help   for that is exactly what man does not  what is wrong with the world in  general is wrong likewise more or less with you and me and with all  human beings for after all the world is made up of human beings and  the sin of the world is nothing save the sins of each and all human  beings put together and the world will be renewed and come right again  just as far and no farther as each human being is renewed and comes  right  the only sure method therefore of setting the world right is  to begin by setting our own little part of the world rightin a word  setting ourselves right  but if we begin to try that we find is just what we cannot do  when a  man begins to hunger and thirst after righteousness and discontented  with himself attempts to improve himself he soon begins to find a  painful truth in many a word of the bible and the prayer book to which he  gave little heed as long as he was contented with himself and with  doing just what pleased him right or wrong  he soon finds out that he  has no power of himself to help himself that he is tied and bound with  the burden of his sins and that he cannot by reason of his frailty  stand uprightthat he actually is sore let and hindered by his own sins  from running the race set before him and doing his duty where god has  put him  all these sayings come home to him as actual facts most  painful facts but facts which he cannot deny  he soon finds out the  meaning and the truth of that terrible struggle between the good in him  and the evil in him of which st paul speaks so bitterly in the text   how when he tries to do good evil is present with him  how he delights  in the law of god with his inward mind and yet finds another law in his  body warring against the law of god and bringing him into captivity to  the law of sin  how he is crippled by old bad habits weakened by  cowardice by laziness by vanity by general inability of will till he  is readydisgusted at himself and his own weaknessto cry who shall  deliver me from the body of this death  let him but utter that cry honestly  let him once find out that he wants  something outside himself to help him to deliver him to strengthen him  to stir up his weak will to give him grace and power to do what he knows  instead of merely admiring it and leaving it undone  let a man only  find out that  let him see that he needs a helper a deliverer a  strengthenerin one word a saviourand he will find one  i verily  believe that sooner or later the lord jesus christ will reveal to that  man what he revealed to st paul that he himself will deliver him and  that like st paul after crying o wretched man that i am who shall  deliver me from the body of this death he will be able to answer  himself i thank godgod will through jesus christ our lord  christ  will deliver me from the bonds of my sins christ will stir up this weak  will of mine christ will give me strength and power faithfully to  fulfil all my good desires because he himself has put them into my heart  not to mock me not to disappoint menot to make me wretched with the  sight of noble graces and virtues to which i cannot attain but to fulfil  his work in me  what he has begun in me he will carry on in me  he has  sown the seed in me and he will make it bear fruit if only i pray to  him day by day for strength to do what i know i ought to do and cry  morning and night to him the fount of life stir up my will o lord  that i may bring forth the fruit of good works for then by thee i shall  be plentifully rewarded  so the man gains hope and heart for himself and so if he will but think  rationally and humbly he may gain hope and heart for this poor sinful  world  for what has come true for him may come true for any man  who is  he that god should care more for him than for others  who is he that god  should help him when he prays more than he will help his whole church if  it will but pray  he says to himself all this knowledge of what is  right all these good desires all these longings after a juster purer  nobler happier state of things there they are up and down the world  already though alas they have borne little enough fruit as yet  be it  so  but god put them into my heart  and who save god has put them into  the worlds heart  it was god who sowed the seed in me surely it is god  who has sowed it in other men  and if god has made it bear even the  poorest fruit in me why should he not make it bear fruit in other men  and in all the world  all they need is that god should stir up their  wills that they may do the good they know and attain the blessedness  after which they long  and then if the man have a truly human truly reasonable heart in him he feels that he can pray for others as well as for himself  he feels  that he must pray for them and crythou alone canst make men strong to  do the right thing and thou wilt make them  stir up their wills o  lord  thou canst not mean that all the good seed which is sown about the  world should die and wither and bring no fruit to perfection  surely  thy word will not return to thee void but be like the rain which comes  down from heaven and gives seed to the sower and bread to the eater   oh strengthen such as stand and comfort and help the weakhearted and  raise up them that fall and finally beat down satan and all the powers  of evil under our feet and pour out thy spirit on all flesh that so  their fathers name may be hallowed his kingdom come his will be done  on earth as it is in heaven  and so will come the one and only true  progress of the human racewhich is that all men should become faithful  and obedient citizens of the holy city the kingdom of god which is the  church of christ  to which may god in his mercy bring us all and our  children after us  amen  this then is the lesson why we are met together this advent day  we  are met to pray that god would so help us by his grace and mercy that we  may bring forth the fruit of good works and that when our lord jesus  christ shall come in his glorious majesty to judge the quick and the  dead we and our descendants after us may be found an acceptable people  in his sight  we are met to pray in a national church for the whole nation of  england that all orders and degrees therein may each in his place and  station help forward the hallowing of gods name the coming of his  kingdom the doing of his will on earth  we are met to pray for the  queen and all that are in authority that these advent collects may be  fulfilled in them and by them for the good of the whole people for the  ministers and stewards of christs mysteries that the same collects may  be fulfilled by them and in them till they turn the hearts of the  disobedient to the wisdom of the just for the commons of this nation  that each man may he delivered by gods grace and mercy from the  special sin which besets him in this faithless and worldly generation and  hinders him from running the race of duty which is set before him and  get strength from god so to live that in that dread day he may meet his  judge and king not in tenor and in shame but in loyalty and in humble  hope  but morewe are here to worship god in christ both god and man  to  confess that without him we can do nothing that unless he enlighten our  understandings we are dark unless he stir up our wills we are powerless  for good  to confess that though we have forgotten him yet he has not  forgotten us   that he is the same gracious and generous giver and  saviour  that though we deny him he cannot deny himself  that he is the  same yesterday today and for ever as when he came to visit this earth  in great humility  that the lord is king though the earth be moved  he  sitteth upon his throne be the nations never so unquiet  we are here to  declare to ourselves and all men and the whole universe that we at  least believe that the heavens and earth are full of his glory  we are  here to declare that whether or not the kings of the earth are wise  enough or the judges of it learned enough to acknowledge christ for  their king we at least will worship the son lest he be angry and so we  perish from the right way for if his wrath be kindled yea but a little  then blessed are they and they only who put their trust in him  we are  here to join our songs with angels round the throne and with those pure  and mighty beings who in some central sanctuary of the universe cry for  ever thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honour and power   for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were  created  we do so in ancient words ancient music ancient ceremonies for a token  that christs rule and glory is an ancient rule and an eternal glory  that it is no new discovery of our own and depends not on our own  passing notions and feelings about it but is like christ the same now  as in the days of our forefathers the same as it was fifteen hundred  years ago the same as it has been since the day that he stooped to be  born of the virgin mary the same that it will be till he shall come in  his glory to judge the quick and the dead  therefore we delight in the  ancient ceremonial as like as we can make it to that of the earlier and  purer ages of the church when christianity was still as it were fresh  from the hand of its creator ere yet it had been debased and defiled by  the idolatrous innovations of the church of rome  for so we confess  ourselves bound by links of gratitude to the apostles and the successors  of the apostles and to all which has been best purest and truest in  the ages since  so we confess that we worship the same godman of whom  apostles preached of whom fathers philosophised and for whom martyrs  died  that we believe like them that he alone is king of kings and  lord of lords that there is no progress civilization or salvation in  this life or the life to come but through his undeserved mercy and his  strengthening grace that he has reigned from the creation of the world  reigns now and will reign unto that last dread day when he shall have  put all enemies under his feet and delivered up the kingdom to god even  the father that god may be all in all  unto which day may he in his  mercy bring us all through faith and good works  amen    sermon vi  capital punishment    eversley  quinquagesima sunday 1872  genesis ix 1 3 4 5 6  and god blessed noah and his sons and said  unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth      every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you     but flesh  with the life thereof which is the blood thereof shall ye not eat  and  surely your blood of your lives will i require  at the hand of every  beast will i require it and at the hand of man at the hand of every  mans brother will i require the life of man  whoso sheddeth mans  blood by man shall his blood be shed  for in the image of god made he  man  this is gods blessing on mankind  this is our charter from god who  made and rules this earth  this is the end and duty of our mortal life to be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it  but  is that all  is there no hint in this blessing of god of something more  than our mortal lifesomething beyond our mortal life  surely there is   those wordsin the image of god made he man must mean if they mean  anything that man can if he will but be a true man share the eternal  life of god  but i will not speak of that today but rather of a  question about his mortal life in this world which is thiswhat is the  reason why man has a right over the lives of animals why he may use them  for his food and at the same time what is the reason why he has not the  same right over the lives of his fellowmen why he may not use them for  food  it is thisthat in the image of god made he man  man is made in the  image and likeness of god therefore he is a sacred creature a creature  not merely an animal and the highest of all animals only cunninger than  all animals more highly organised more delicately formed than all  animals but something beyond an animal  he is in the likeness of god  therefore he is consecrated to god  he is the one creature on earth whom  god so far as we know is trying to make like himself  therefore  whosoever kills a man sins not only against that man nor against  society  he sins against god  and god will require that mans blood at  the hand of him who slays him  but how  at the hand of every beast will  he require it and at the hand of every man  what that first part of the law means i cannot tell  how god will  require from the lion or the crocodile or the shark who eats a human  being the blood of their victims is more than i can say  but this i  can saythat the feeling not only of horror and pity but of real rage  and indignation with which men see what god grant you never may see a  wild beast kill a man is a witness in mans conscience that the text is  true somehow though how we know not  i received a letter a few weeks  since from an officer a very remarkable person in which he described  his horror and indignation at seeing a friend of his struck down and  eaten by a tiger and how when next day he stood over what had been but  the day before a human being he looked up to heaven and kept repeating  the words of the text in the image of god made he man in rage and  shame and almost accusing god for allowing his image to be eaten by a  brute beast  it shook for the moment his faith in gods justice and  goodness  that man was young then and has grown calmer and wiser now  and has regained a deeper and sounder faith in god  but the shock he  said was dreadful to him  he felt that the matter was not merely  painful and pitiable but that it was a wrong and a crime and on the  faith of this very text a wrong and a crime i believe it to be and one  which god knows how to avenge and to correct when man cannot  somehow for he has ways of which we poor mortals do not dreamat the hand of  every beast will he require the blood of man  but more at the hand of every man will he require it  and how  the  text tells us whoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be  shed  for in the image of god made he man  now i do not doubt but  that the allseeing god looking back on what had most probably happened  on this earth already and looking forward to what would happen and  happens alas too often now meant to warn men against the awful crime  of cannibalism of eating their fellowmen as they would eat an animal   by so doing they not only treated their fellowmen as beasts but they  behaved like beasts themselves  they denied that their victim was made  in the likeness of god they denied that they were made in the likeness  of god they willingly and deliberately put on the likeness of beasts  and as beasts they were to perish  now this is certain that savages  who eat menand alas there are thousands even now who do sousually  know in their hearts that they are doing wrong  as soon as their  consciences are the least awakened they are ashamed of their  cannibalism they lie about it try to conceal it and as soon as gods  grace begins to work on them it is the very first sin that they give up   and next this is certain that there is a curse upon it  no cannibal  people so far as i can find have ever risen or prospered in the world  and the cannibal peoples nowadays and for the last three hundred  years have been dying out  by their own vices diseases and wars they  perish off the face of the earth in the midst of comfort and plenty  and in spite of all the efforts of missionaries even their children and  grandchildren after giving up the horrid crime and becoming  christians seem to have no power of living and increasing but dwindle  away and perish off the earth  yes gods laws work in strange and  subtle ways so darkly so slowly that the ungodly and sinners often  believe that there are no laws of god and saytush how should god  perceive it  is there knowledge in the most high  but the laws work  nevertheless whether men are aware of them or not  the mills of god  grind slowly but sooner or later they grind the sinner to powder  and now i will leave this hateful subject and go on to another on which  i am moved to speak once and for all because it is much in mens minds  just nowi mean what is vulgarly called capital punishment the  punishing of murder by death  now the text which is the ancient  covenant of god with man speaks very clearly on this point  whosoever  sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed  man is made in  the likeness of god  that is the ground of our law about murder as it  is the ground of all just and merciful law that gives man his right to  slay the murderer that makes it his duty to slay the murderer  he has  to be jealous of gods likeness and to slay in the name of god the man  who by murder outrages the likeness of god in himself and in his  victim  you all know that there is nowadays a strong feeling among some persons  about capital punishment that there are those who will move heaven and  earth to interfere with the course of justice and beg off the worst of  murderers on any grounds however unreasonable fanciful even unfair  simply because they have a dislike to human beings being hanged  i  believe from long consideration that these persons strange dislike  proceeds from their not believing sufficiently that man is made in the  image of god  and alas it proceeds i fear in some of them from not  believing in a god at allbelieving perhaps in some mere maker of the  world but not in the living god which scripture sets forth  for how  else can they say as i have known some say that capital punishment is  wrong because we have no right to usher a man into the presence of his  maker  into the presence of his maker  why where else is every man you and i  heathen and christian bad and good save in the presence of his maker  already  do we not live and move and have our being in god  whither can  we go from his spirit or whither can we flee from his presence  if we  ascend into heaven he is there  if we go down to hell he is there also   and if the law puts a man to death it does not usher him into the  presence of his maker for he is there already  it simply says to him  god has judged you on earth not we  god will judge you in the next  world not we  all we know is that you are not fit to live in this  world  all our duty is to send you out of it  where you will go in the  other world is gods matter not ours and the lord have mercy on your  soul  and this want of faith in a living god lies at the bottom of another  objection  we are to keep murderers alive in order to convert and  instruct and amend them  the answer is we shall be most happy to amend  anybody of any fault however great  but the experience of ages is that  murderers are past mending that the fact of a mans murdering another is  a plain proof that he has no moral sense and has become simply a brute  animal our duty is to punish not to amend and to say to the murderer  if you can be amended god will amend you and so have mercy on your  soul  god must amend you if you are to be amended  if god cannot amend  you we cannot  if god will not amend you certainly we cannot force him  to do so if we kept you alive for a thousand years  that would seem  reasonable as well as reverent and faithful to god  but men nowadays  fancy that they love their fellow creatures far better than god loves  them and can deal far more wisely and lovingly with them than god is  willing to deal  of these objections i take little heed  i look on them  as merely loose cant which does not quite understand the meaning of its  own words and i trust to sound hard english common sense to put them  aside  but there is another objection to capital punishment which we must deal  with much more respectfully and tenderly for it is made by certain good  people people whom we must honour though we differ from them for no  set of people have done more according to their numbers for education  for active charity and for benevolence and for peace and good will  among the nations of the earth  and they say you must not take the life  of a murderer just because he is made in gods image  well i should  have thought that god himself was the best judge of that  that if god  truly said that man was made in his image and said moreover as it were  at the same moment that therefore whoso sheds mans blood by man  shall his blood be shedour duty was to trust god to obey god and to  do our duty against the murderer however painful to our feelings it  might be  but i believe these good people make their mistake from  forgetting this that if the murderer be made in gods image and  likeness so is the man whom he murders and so also is the jury who  convict him the judge who condemns him and the nation the society of  men for whom they act  and this my dear friends brings us to the very root of the meaning of  law  man has sense to make laws which animals cannot do just because  he is made in the likeness of god and has the sense of right and wrong   man has the right to enforce laws to see right done and wrong punished  just because he is made in the likeness of god  the laws of a country  as far as they are just and righteous are the copy of what the men of  that country have found out about right and wrong and about how much  right they can get done and how much wrong punished  so just as the  men of a country are in spite of all their sins made in the likeness of  god so the laws of a country in spite of all their defects are a copy  of gods will as to what men should or should not do  and that and no  other is the true reason why the judge or magistrate has authority over  either property liberty or life  he is gods servant the servant of  christ who is king of this land and of all lands and of all  governments and all kings and rulers of the earth  he sits there in  gods name to see gods will done as far as poor fallible human beings  can get it done  and because he is not merely as a man but by his  special authority in the likeness of god who has power over life and  death therefore he also as far as his authority goes has power over  life and death  that is my opinion and that was the opinion of st  paul  for what does he sayand say not remember always of christian  magistrates in a christian country but actually of heathen roman  magistrates  let every soul be subject unto the higher powers  for  there is no power but of god  the powers that be are ordained of god   whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god   and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation  thus spoke  out the tenderesthearted most christlike human being perhaps who  ever trod this earth who in his intense longing to save sinners  endured a life of misery and danger and finished it by martyrdom  but  there was no sentimentality no soft indulgence in him  he knew right  from wrong common sense from cant duty from public opinion and divine  charity from the mere cowardly dislike of witnessing pain not so much  because it pains the person punished as because it pains the spectator   he knew that christ was king of kings and what christs kingdom was  like  he had discovered the divine and wonderful order of men and  angels  he saw that one part of that order wasthe soul that sinneth  it shall die  but some say that capital punishment is inconsistent with the mild  religion of christthe religion of mercy and love  the mild religion  of christ  do these men know of whom they talk  do they know that if  the bible be true the god who said whoso sheddeth mans blood by man  shall his blood be shed is the very same being the very same god who  was born of the virgin mary crucified under pontius pilatethe very  same christ who took little children up in his arms and blessed them the  very same word of god too of whom it is written that out of his mouth  goeth a twoedged sword that he may smite the nations and he shall rule  them with a rod of iron and he treadeth the wine press of the fierceness  and wrath of almighty god  these are awful words but my dear friends  i can only ask you if you think them too awful to be true  do you  believe the christian religion  do you believe the creeds  do you  believe the bible  for if you do then you believe that the lord christ  who was born of the virgin mary and crucified under pontius pilate is  the maker the master the ruler of this world and of all worlds  by  what laws he rules other worlds we know not save that they are because  they must bejust and merciful laws  but of the laws by which he rules  this world we do know by experience that his laws are of most terrible  and unbending severity as i have warned you again and again and shall  warn you as long as there is a liar or an idler a drunkard or an  adulteress in this parish  and if this be soif christ be a god of severity as well as a god of  love a god who punishes sinners as well as a god who forgives penitents what then  we are he tells us made in his likeness  then according  to his likeness we must behave  we must copy his love by helping the  poor and afflicted the weak and the oppressed  but we must copy his  severity by punishing whenever we have the power without cowardice or  indulgence all wilful offenders and above all the man who destroys  gods image in himself by murdering and destroying the mortal life of a  man made in the image of god  and more if we be made in the likeness of  god and of christ we must remember morning and night and all day long  that most awful and most blessed fact  we must say to ourselves again  and again i am not a mere animal and like a mere animal i must not  behave i dare not behave like a mere animal for i was made in the  likeness of god and when i was baptised the spirit of god took  possession of me to restore me to gods likeness and to call out and  perfect gods likeness in me all my life long  therefore i am no mere  animal and never was intended to be  i am the temple of god my body  and soul belong to god and not to my own fancies and passions and lusts  and whosoever defiles the temple of god him will god destroy  therefore this is our duty this is our only hope or safetyto do our  best to keep alive and strong the likeness of god in ourselves to try to  grow not more and more mean and brutal and carnal but more and more  noble and human and spiritual to crush down our base passions our  selfish inclinations by the help of the spirit of god and to think of  and to pray for whatsoever is like christ and like god to pray for a  noble love of what is good and noble for a noble hate of what is bad  and whatsoever things are pure and lovely and of good report to think of  these things  and to pray too for forgiveness from christ and for the  sake of christ whenever we have yielded to our low passions and defiled  the likeness of god in us and grieved his spirit lest at the last day  it be said to us if not in words yet in acts which there will be no  mistaking no escapingi made thee in my likeness in the beginning of  the creation i redeemed thee into my likeness on the cross i baptised  thee into my likeness by my holy spirit and what hast thou hast done  with my likeness  thou hast cast it away thou hast let it die out in  thee thou hast lived after the flesh and not after the spirit and hast  put on the likeness of the carnal man the likeness of the brute  thou  hast copied the vanity of the peacock the silliness of the ape the  cunning of the fox the rapacity of the tiger the sensuality of the  swine but thou hast not copied god thy god who died that thou mightest  live and be a man  then thou hast destroyed gods likeness for thou  hast destroyed it in thyself  thou hast slain a man for thou hast slain  thy own manhood and art thine own murderer and thine own blood shall be  required at thy hand  that which thou hast done to gods likeness in  thee shall be done to that which remains of thee in a second death  and from that may christ in his mercy deliver us all  amen    sermon vii  temptation    eversley 1872  chester cathedral 1872  st matt iv 3  and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be  the son of god command that these stones be made bread  let me say a few words today about a solemn subject namely temptation   i do not mean the temptations of the fleshthe temptations which all men  have to yield to the low animal nature in them and behave like brutes   i mean those deeper and more terrible temptations which our lord  conquered in that great struggle with evil which is commonly called his  temptation in the wilderness  these were temptations of an evil spirit the temptations which entice some men at least to behave like devils  now these temptations specially beset religious menmen who are or  fancy themselves superior to their fellowmen more favoured by god and  with nobler powers and grander work to do than the common average of  mankind  but specially i say they beset those who are or fancy  themselves the children of god  and therefore i humbly suppose our  lord had to endure and to conquer these very temptations because he was  not merely a child of god but the son of godthe perfect man made in  the perfect likeness of his father  he had to endure these temptations  and to conquer them that he might be able to succour us when we are  tempted seeing that he was tempted in like manner as we are yet without  sin  now it has been said and i think well said that what proves our  lords three temptations to have been very subtle and dangerous and  terrible is thisthat we cannot see at first sight that they were  temptations at all  the first two do not look to us to be wrong  if our  lord could make stones into bread to satisfy his hunger why should he  not do so  if he could prove to the jews that he was the son of god  their divine king and saviour by casting himself down from the pinnacle  of the temple and being miraculously supported in the air by angelsif  he could do that why should he not do it  and lastly the third  temptation looks at first sight so preposterous that it seems silly of  the evil spirit to have hinted at it  to ask any man of piety much less  the son of god himself to fall down and worship the devil seems  perfectly absurda request not to be listened to for a moment but put  aside with contempt  well my friends and the very danger of these spiritual temptations is that they do not look like temptations  they do not look ugly absurd  wrong they look pleasant reasonable right  the devil says the apostle transforms himself at times into an angel of  light  if so then he is certainly far more dangerous than if he came as  an angel of darkness and horror  if you met some venomous snake with  loathsome spots upon his scales his eyes full of rage and cunning his  head raised to strike at you hissing and showing his fangs there would  be no temptation to have to do with him  you would know that you had to  deal with an evil beast and must either kill him or escape from him at  once  but if again you met as you may meet in the tropics a lovely  little coral snake braided with red and white its mouth so small that  it seems impossible that it can bite and so gentle that children may  take it up and play with it then you might be tempted as many a poor  child has been ere now to admire it fondle it wreathe it round the  neck for a necklace or round the arm for a bracelet till the play goes  one step too far the snake loses its temper gives one tiny scratch upon  the lip or finger and that scratch is certain death  that would be a  temptation indeed one all the more dangerous because there is i am  told another sort of coral snake perfectly harmless which is so exactly  like the deadly one that no child and few grown people can know them  apart  even so it is with our worst temptations  they look sometimes so exactly  like what is good and noble and useful and religious that we mistake the  evil for the good and play with it till it stings us and we find out  too late that the wages of sin are death  thus religious people just  because they are religious are apt to be specially tempted to mistake  evil for good to do something specially wrong when they think they are  doing something specially right and so give occasion to the enemies of  the lord to blaspheme till as a hard and experienced man of the world  once said  whenever i hear a man talking of his conscience i know that  he is going to do something particularly foolish whenever i hear of a  man talking of his duty i know that he is going to do something  particularly cruel  do i say this to frighten you away from being religious  god forbid   better to be religious and to fear and love god though you were tempted  by all the devils out of the pit than to be irreligious and a mere  animal and be tempted only by your own carnal nature as the animals  are  better to be tempted like the hermits of old and even to fall and  rise again singing rejoice not against me o mine enemy when i fall i  shall arise than to live the life of the flesh like a beast with  lower pleasures like a beast with lower pains  it is the price a man  must pay for hungering and thirsting after righteousness for longing to  be a child of god in spirit and in truth  the devil says a wise man  of old does not tempt bad men because he has got them already he  tempts good men because he has not got them and wants to get them  but how shall we know these temptations  god knows my friends better  than i and i trust that he will teach you to know according to what  each of you needs to know  but as far as my small experience goes the  root of them all is pride and selfconceit  whatsoever thoughts or  feelings tempt us to pride and selfconceit are of the devil not of god   the devil is specially the spirit of pride and therefore whatever  tempts you to fancy yourself something different from your fellowmen  superior to your fellow men safer than them more favoured by god than  them that is a temptation of the spirit of pride  whatever tempts you  to think that you can do without gods help and gods providence  whatever tempts you to do anything extraordinary and show yourself off  that you may make a figure in the world and above all whatever tempts  you to antinomianism that is to fancy that god will overlook sins in  you which he will not overlook in other menall these are temptations  from the spirit of pride  they are temptations like our lords  temptations  these temptations came on our lord more terribly than they  ever can on you and me just because he was the son of man the perfect  man and therefore had more real reason for being proud if such a  thing could be than any man or than all men put together  but he  conquered the temptations because he was perfect man led by the spirit  of god and therefore he knew that the only way to be a perfect man was  not to be proud however powerful wise and glorious he might be but to  submit himself humbly and utterly as every man should do to the will of  his father in heaven from whom alone his greatness came  now the spirit of pride cannot understand the beauty of humility and the  spirit of selfwill cannot understand the beauty of obedience and  therefore it is reasonable to suppose the devil could not understand our  lord  if he be the son of god so might satan argue he has all the more  reason to be proud and therefore it is all the more easy to tempt him  into shewing his pride into proving himself a conceited selfwilled  rebellious beingin one word an evil spirit  and therefore as you will see at first sight the first two temptations  were clearly meant to tempt our lord to pride for would they not tempt  you and me to pride  if we could feed ourselves by making bread of  stones would not that make us proud enough  so proud i fear that we  should soon fancy that we could do without god and his providence and  were masters of nature and all her secrets  if you and i could make the  whole city worship and obey us by casting ourselves off this cathedral  unhurt would not that make us proud enough  so proud i fear that we  should end in committing some great folly or great crime in our conceit  and vainglory  now whether our lord could or could not have done these wonderful deeds  one thing is plainthat he would not do them and therefore we may  presume that he ought not to have done them  it seems as if he did not  wish to be a wonderful man  but only a perfectly good man and he would  do nothing to help himself but what any other man could do  he answered  the evil spirit simply out of scripture as any other pious man might  have done  when he was bidden to make the stones into bread he answers  not as the eternal son of god but simply as a man  it is writtenit  is the belief of moses and the old prophets of my people that man doth  not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the  mouth of godas much as to say if i am to be delivered out of this  need god will deliver me by some means or other just as he delivers  other men out of their needs  when he was bidden cast himself from the  temple and so save himself probably from sorrow poverty persecution  and the death on the cross he answers out of scripture as any other jew  would have done  it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy  god  he says nothingthis is most importantof his being the eternal  son of god  he keeps that in the background  there the fact was but he  veiled the glory of his godhead that he might assert the rights of his  manhood and shew that mere man by the help of the spirit of god could  obey god and keep his commandments  i say these last words with all diffidence and humility and trusting  that the lord will pardon any mistake which i may make about his divine  words  i only say them because wiser men than i have often taken the  same view already  of course there is more far more in this wonderful  saying than we can understand or ever will understand  but this i think  is plainthat our lord determined to behave as any and every other man  ought to have done in his place in order to shew all gods children the  example of perfect humility and perfect obedience to god  but again the devil asked our lord to fall down and worship him  now  how could that be a temptation to pride  surely that was asking our lord  to do anything but a proud action rather the most humiliating and most  base of all actions  my friends it seems to me that if our lord had  fallen down and worshipped the evil spirit he would have given way to  the spirit of pride utterly and boundlessly and i will tell you why  the devil wanted our lord to do evil that good might come  it would have  been a blessing that all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of man  should be our lordsthe very blessing for this poor earth which he  came to buy and which he bought with his own precious blood  and here  the devil offered him the very prize for which he came down on earth  without struggle or difficulty if he would but do for one moment one  wrong thing  what temptation that would be to our lord as god i dare  not say  but that to our lord as man it must have been the most  terrible of all temptations i can well believe  because history shews  us and alas our own experience in modern times shews us persons  yielding to that temptation perpetually pious people benevolent people  people who long to spread the bible to convert sinners to found  charities to amend laws to set the world right in some way or other  and who fancy that therefore in carrying out their fine projects they  have a right to do evil that good may come  this is a very painful subject all the more painful just now because i  sometimes think it is the special sin of this country and this  generation and that god will bring on us some heavy punishment for it   but all who know the world in its various phases and especially what are  called the religious world and the philanthropic world and the  political world know too well that men not otherwise bad men will do  things and say things to carry out some favourite project or movement  or to support some party religious or other which they would i hope  be ashamed to say and do for their own private gain  now what is this  but worshipping the evil spirit in order to get power over this world  that they may as they fancy amend it  and what is this but self conceitruinous i had almost said blasphemous  these people think  themselves so certainly in the right and their plans so absolutely  necessary to the good of the world that god has given them a special  licence to do what they like in carrying them out that he will excuse in  them falsehoods and meannesses even tyranny and violences which he will  excuse in no one else  now is not this selfconceit  what would you think of a servant who  disobeyed you cheated you and yet said to himselfno matter my master  dare not turn me off  i am so useful that he cannot do without me  even  so in all ages and now as much as or more than ever have men said we  are so necessary to god and gods cause that he cannot do without us  and therefore though he hates sin in everyone else he will excuse sin in  us as long as we are about his business  therefore my dear friends whenever we are tempted to do or say anything  rash or vain or mean because we are the children of god whenever we  are inclined to be puffed up with spiritual pride and to fancy that we  may take liberties which other men must not take because we are the  children of god let us remember the words of the text and answer the  tempter when he says if thou be the son of god do this and that as  our lord answered himif i be the child of god what then  thisthat  i must behave as if god were my father  i must trust my god utterly and  i must obey him utterly  i must do no rash or vain thing to tempt god  even though it looks as if i should have a great success and do much  good thereby  i must do no mean or base thing nor give way for a moment  to the wicked ways of this wicked world even though again it looks as if  i should have a great success and do much good thereby  in one word i  must worship my father in heaven and him only must i serve  if he wants  me he will use me  if he does not want me he will use some one else   who am i that god cannot govern the world without my help  my business  is to refrain my soul and keep it low even as a weaned child and not  to meddle with matters too high for me  my business is to do the little  simple everyday duties which lie nearest me and be faithful in a few  things and then if christ will he may make me some day ruler over many  things and i shall enter into the joy of my lord which is the joy of  doing good to my fellow men  but i shall never enter into that by  thrusting myself into christs way with grand schemes and hasty  projects as if i knew better than he how to make his kingdom come  if i  do my pride will have a fall  because i would not be faithful over a  few things i shall be tempted to be unfaithful over many things and  instead of entering into the joy of my lord i shall be in danger of the  awful judgment pronounced on those who do evil that good may come who  shall say in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name  and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful  works  and then will he protest unto themi never knew you  depart  from me ye that work iniquity  oh my friends in all your projects for good as in all other matters  which come before you in your mortal life keep innocence and take heed  to the thing that is right  for that and that alone shall bring a man  peace at the last  to which may god in his mercy bring us all  amen    sermon viii  mothers love    eversley second sunday in lent 1872  st matthew xv 2228  and behold a woman of canaan came out of the  same coasts and cried unto him saying have mercy on me o lord thou  son of david my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil  but he  answered her not a word  and his disciples came and besought him  saying send her away for she crieth after us  but he answered and  said i am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel  then  came she and worshipped him saying lord help me  but he answered and  said it is not meet to take the childrens bread and to cast it to  dogs  and she said truth lord  yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which  fall from their masters table  then jesus answered and said unto her o  woman great is thy faith  be it unto thee even as thou wilt  and her  daughter was made whole from that very hour  if you want a proof from scripture that there are two sides to our  blessed lords characterthat he is a judge and an avenger as well as a  saviour and a pardonerthat he is infinitely severe as well as  infinitely mercifulthat while we may come boldly to his throne of  grace to find help and mercy in time of need we must at the same time  tremble before his throne of justiceif you want a proof of all this i  say then look at the epistle and the gospel for this day  put them side  by side and compare them and you will see how perfectly they shew one  after the other the two sides  the epistle for the day tells men and women that they must lead moral  pure and modest lives  it does not advise them to do so  it does not  say it will be better to do so more proper and conducive to the good of  society more likely to bring you to heaven at last  it says you must  for it is the commandment of the lord jesus and the will of god  let no  man encroach on or defraud his brother in the matter says st paul by  which he means thou shalt not covet thy neighbours wife  and why   because that the lord is the avenger of all such as we also have  forewarned you and testified  my friends people talk loosely of the thunder of sinai and the rigour of  moses law and set them against what they call the gentle voice of the  gospel and the mild religion of christ  why here are the thunders of  sinai uttered as loud as ever from the very foot of the cross of christ  and the terrible thou shalt not of moses law with the curse of god  for a penalty on the sinner uttered by the apostle of faith and  freedom in the name of christ and of god  st paul is not afraid to call  christ an avenger  how could he be  he believed that it was christ who  spoke to moses on sinaithe very same christ who prayed for his  murderers father forgive them for they know not what they do  and  he knew that christ was the eternal son of god the same yesterday to day and for ever that he had not changed since moses time and could  never change that what he forbade in moses time hated in moses time  and avenged in moses time he would forbid and hate and avenge for  ever  and that therefore he who despises the warnings of the law  despises not man merely but god who has also given to us his holy  spirit to know what is unchangeable the everlastingly right from what  is everlastingly wrong  so much for that side of our lords character  so much for sinners who after their hardness and impenitent hearts  treasure up for themselves wrath against the day of wrath and revelation  of the righteous judgment of god in the day when god shall judge the  secrets of men by jesus christ according to st pauls gospel  but when we turn to the gospel for the day we see the other side of our  lords character boundless condescension and boundless charity  we see  him there still a judge as he always is and always will be judging the  secrets of a poor womans heart and that woman a heathen  he judges her  openly in public before his disciples  but he is a judge who judges  righteous judgment and not according to appearances who is no respecter  of persons who is perfectly fair even though the woman be a heathen   and instead of condemning her and driving her away he acquits her he  grants her prayer he heals her daughter even though that daughter was  also a heathen and one who knew him not  i say our lord judged the  woman after he had tried her as gold is tried in the fire  why he did  so we cannot tell  perhaps he wanted by the trial to make her a  better woman to bring out something noble which lay in her heart unknown  to her though not to him who knew what was in man  perhaps he wished to  shew his disciples who looked down on her as a heathen dog that a  heathen too could have faith humility nobleness and grace of heart   be that as it may when the poor woman came crying to him he answered  her not a word  his disciples besought him to send her awayand i am  inclined to think that they wished him to grant her what she asked  simply to be rid of her  send her away they said for she crieth  after us  our lord we learn from st mark did not wish to be known in  that place just then  the poor woman with her crying was drawing  attention to them and perhaps gathering a crowd  somewhat noisy and  troublesome perhaps she was in her motherly eagerness  but our lord  was still seemingly stern  he would not listen it seemed to his  disciples any more than to the heathen woman  i am not sent but unto  the lost sheep of the house of israel  so our lord said and what is  worth remembering if he said so what he said was true  he was the king  of the people of israel the royal prince of davids line and as a man  his duty was only to his own people  and this woman was a greek a syro phenician by nationof a mixed race of people notoriously low and  profligate and old enemies of the jews  then it seems he went into a house and would have no man know it   but says st mark he could not be hid  the mothers wit found our  lord out and the mothers heart urged her on and in spite of all his  rebuffs she seems to have got into the house and worshipped him  she  fell at his feet says st markdoubtless bowing her forehead to the  ground in the fashion of those landsan honour which was paid i  believe only to persons who were royal or divine  so she confessed that  he was a kingperhaps a god come down on earthand again she cried to  him  lord help me  and what was our lords answerseemingly more  stern than ever  let the children first be filled  for it is not meet  to take the childrens bread and cast it unto the dogs  hard words   yes  but all depends on how they were spoken  all depends on our lords  look as he spoke them and even more on the tone of his voice  we all  know that two men may use the very same words to usand the one shall  speak sneeringly brutally and raise in us indignation or despair  another shall use the same words but solemnly tenderly and raise in us  confidence and hope  and so it may have beenso i fancy it must have  beenwith the tone of our lords voice with the expression of his face   did he speak with a frown or with something like a smile  there must  have been some tenderness meaningness pity in his voice which the quick  womans wit caught instantly and the quick mothers heart interpreted as  a sign of hope  let him call her a dog if he would  what matter to a mother to be called  a dog if she could thereby save her child from a devil  perhaps she was  little better than a dog  they were a bad people these syrians quick witted highly civilised but vicious and teaching vice to other  nations till some of the wisest romans cursed the day when the syrians  first spread into rome and debauched the sturdy romans with their new fangled foreign sins  they were a bad people and perhaps she had  been as bad as the rest  but if she were a dog at least she felt that  the dog had found its master and must fawn on him if it were but for  the hope of getting something from him  and so in the poor heathen mothers heart there rose up a whole heaven  of perfect humility faith adoration  if she were base and mean yet  our lord was great and wise and good and that was all the more reason  why he should be magnanimous generous condescending like a true king  to the basest and meanest of his subjects  she asked not for money or  honour or this worlds fine things  but simply for her childs health  her childs deliverance from some mysterious and degrading illness   surely there was no harm in asking for that  it was simply a mothers  prayer a simply human prayer which our lord must grant if he were  indeed a man of woman born if he had a mother and could feel for a  mother if he had human tenderness human pity in him  and so with her  quick syrian wit she answers our lord with those wonderful words perhaps the most pathetic words in the whole bibleso full of humility  of reverence and yet with a certain archness almost playfulness in  them as it were turning our lords words against him and by that very  thing shewing how utterly she trusted himtruth lord  yet the dogs  eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters table  those were the beautiful wordsmore beautiful to me than whole volumes  of poetrywhich our lord had as it were crushed out of the womans  heart  doubtless he knew all the while that they were in her heart  though not as yet shaped into words  doubtless he was trying her to  shew his disciplesand all christians who should ever read the bible what was in her heart what she was capable of saying when it came to the  point  so he tried her and judged her and acquitted her  out of the  abundance of her heart her mouth had spoken  by her words she was  justified  by those few words she proved her utter faith in our lords  power and goodnessperhaps her faith in his godhead  by those words she  proved the gentleness and humility the graciousness and gracefulness of  her own character  by those words she proved tooand oh you that are  mothers is that nothingthe perfect disinterestedness of her mothers  love  and so she conqueredas the blessed lord loves to be conquered as all noble souls who are like their blessed lord love to be conquered by the prayer of faith of humility of confidence of earnestness and  she had her reward  o woman said he the maker of all heaven and  earth great is thy faith  for this saying go thy way  be it unto thee  even as thou wilt  the devil is gone out of thy daughter  she went  full of faith and when she was come to her house she found the devil  gone out and her daughter laid upon the bed  one word more and i have done  i do not think that any one who really  took in the full meaning of this beautiful story would ever care to pray  to saints or to the blessed virgin for help fancying that they and  specially the blessed virgin being a woman are more humane than our  lord and can feel more quickly if not more keenly for poor creatures  in distress  we are not here to judge these people or any people  to  their own master they stand or fall  but for the honour of our lord we  may say does not this story shew that the lord is humane enough tender  enough to satisfy all mankind  does not this story shew that even if he  seem silent at first and does not grant our prayers yet still he may be  keeping us waiting as he kept this heathen woman only that he may be  gracious to us at last  does not this story shew us especially that our  lord can feel for mothers and with mothers that he actually allowed  himself to be won overif i may use such a word in all reverenceby the  wit and grace of a mother pleading for her child  was it not so  o  woman great is thy faith  for this saying go thy way  be it unto thee  even as thou wilt  ah are not those gracious words a comfort to every  mother bidding her in the lords own name to come boldly where  mothersof all human beingshave oftenest need to come to the throne  of christs grace to find mercy and grace to help in time of need  yes my friends such is our lord and such is our god  infinite in  severity to the scornful the proud the disobedient  infinite in  tenderness to the earnest the humble the obedient  let us come to him  earnest humble obedient and we shall find him indeed a refuge of the  soul and body in spirit and in truth   thou o lord art all i want all and more in thee i find  amen    sermon ix  good friday    eversley 1856  st luke xxiv 5 6  why seek ye the living among the dead  he is not  here but is risen  this is a very solemn day for on this day the lord jesus christ was  crucified  the question for us is how ought we to keep it that is  what sort of thoughts ought to be in our minds upon this day  now many  most excellent and pious persons and most pious books seem to think  that we ought today to think as much as possible of the sufferings of  our blessed lord and because we cannot of course understand or imagine  the sufferings of his spirit to think of what we can that is his  bodily sufferings  they therefore seem to wish to fill our minds with  the most painful pictures of agony and shame and death and sorrow and  not only with our lords sorrows but with those of his blessed mother  and of the disciples and the holy women who stood by his cross they  wish to stir us up to pity and horror and to bring before us the saddest  parts of holy scripture such as the lamentations of jeremiah as well as  dwell at great length upon very painful details which may be all quite  true but of which scripture says nothing as so to make this day a day  of darkness and sorrow and horror just such as it would have been to  us if we had stood by christs cross like these holy women without  expecting him to rise again and believing that all was overthat all  hope of israels being redeemed was gone and that the wicked jews had  really conquered that perfectly good and admirable saviour and put him  out of the world for ever  now i judge no man to his own master he standeth or falleth yea and  he shall stand for god is able to make him stand  but it does seem to  me that these good people are seeking the living among the dead and  forgetting that christ is neither on the cross nor in the tomb but that  he is risen and it seems to me better to bid you follow today the bible  and the church service and to think of what they tell you to think of  now the bible it is most remarkable never enlarges anywhere upon even  the bodily sufferings of our dear and blessed lord  the evangelists keep  a silence on that point which is most lofty dignified and delicate   what sad and dreadful things might not st john the beloved apostle as  he was have said if he had chosen about what he saw and what he felt  as he stood by that cross on calvarywords which would have stirred to  pity the most cruel and drawn tears from a heart of stone  and yet all  he says is they crucified him and two other with him on either side  one and jesus in the midst  he passes it over as it were as a thing  which he ought not to dwell on and why should we put words into st  johns mouth which he did not think fit to put into his own  he wrote by  the spirit of god and therefore he knew best what to say and what not  to say  why should we try and say anything more for him  scripture is  perfect  let us be content with it  the apostles too in their  epistles never dwell on christs sufferings  i entreat you to remark  this  they never mention his death except in words of cheerfulness and  triumph  they seem so full of the glorious fruits of his death that  they have as it were no time to speak of the death itself  who for  the joy which was set before him endured the cross despising the shame  and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god  that is the  apostles keynote  for gods sake let it be ours too unless we fancy  that we can improve on scripture or that we can feel more for our lord  than st paul did  in the lessons the psalms the epistle and gospel  for this day you find just the same spirit  all except one psalm are  songs of hope joy deliverance triumph  the collects for this day  which are particularly remarkable being three in number and evidently  meant to teach us the keynote of good friday make no mention of our  lords sufferings save to say that he was contented contented to be  betrayed and given up into the hands of wicked men and to suffer death  upon the cross but are full of prayers that the glorious fruits of his  death may be fulfilled not only in us and all christians but in the  very heathen who have not known him drawing us away as it were from  looking too closely upon the cross itself lest we should forget what the  cross meant what the cross conquered what the cross gained for us and  mankind  surely this was not done without a reason  and i cannot but think the  reason was to keep us from seeking the living among the dead to keep us  from knowing christ any longer after the flesh and spending tears and  emotions over his bodily sufferings to keep us from thinking and  sorrowing too much over the dead christ lest we should forget as some  do that he is alive for evermore and while they weep over the dead  christ or the crucifix go to the blessed virgin and the saints to do for  them all that the living christ is longing to do for them if they would  but go straight to him to whom all power is given in heaven and earth  whom st john saw no longer hanging on the accursed tree but with his  hair as white as snow and his eyes like a flame of fire and his voice  like the sound of many waters and his countenance as the sun when he  shineth in his strength saying unto him fear not i am the first and  the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive for  evermore  this is what christ is now  in this shape he is looking at  us now  in this shape he is hearing me speak  in this shape he is  watching every feeling of your hearts discerning your most secret  intents seeing through and through the thoughts which you would confess  to no human being hardly even to yourselves  this is he a living  christ an almighty christ an allseeing christ and yet a most patient  and loving christ  he needs not our pity but our gratitude our  obedience our worship  why seek him among the dead  he is not there  he is risen  he is not there he is here  bow yourselves before him  now for he is in the midst of you and those eyes of his more piercing  than the midday sunbeams are upon you and your hearts and your  thoughts and upon mine also  god have mercy upon me a sinner  yes my friends why seek the living among the dead  he is not there  but here  we may try to put ourselves in the place of the disciples and  the virgin mary as they stood by jesus cross but we cannot do it for  they saw him on the cross and thought that he was lost to them for ever  they saw him die and gave up all hope of his rising again  and we know  that christ is not lost to us for ever  we know christ is not on the  cross but at the right hand of god in bliss and glory unspeakable  we  may be told to watch with the three maries at the tomb of christ  but we  cannot do as they did for they thought that all was over and brought  sweet spices to embalm his body which they thought was in the tomb and  we know that all was not over that his body is not in the tomb that the  grave could not hold him that his body is ascended into heaven that  instead of his body needing spices to embalm it it is his body which  embalms all heaven and earth and is the very life of the world and food  which preserves our souls and bodies to everlasting life  we are not in  the place of those blessed women god has not put us in their place and  we cannot put ourselves into their place and if we could and did by any  imaginations of our own we should only tell ourselves a lie  good  friday was to them indeed a day of darkness horror disappointment all  but despair because easter day had not yet come and christ had not yet  risen  but good friday cannot be a day of darkness to us because christ  has risen and we know it and cannot forget it we cannot forget that  easter dawn when the sun of righteousness arose never to set again   has not the light of that resurrection morning filled with glory the  cross and the grave yea the very agony in the garden and hell itself  which christ harrowed for us  has it not risen a light to lighten the  gentiles a joy to angels and archangels and saints and all the elect  of god ay to the whole universe of god so that the very stars in their  courses the trees as they bud each spring yea the very birds upon the  bough are singing for ever in the ears of those who have ears to hear  christ is risen  and shall we under pretence of honouring christ and  of bestowing on him a pity which he needs least of all try to spend good  friday and passion week in forgetting easter day try to think of  christs death as we should if he had not risen and try to make out  ourselves and the world infinitely worse off than we really know that we  are  christ has died but he has risen again and we must not think of  one without the other  heavenly things are too important too true too  realchrist is too near us and too loving to us too earnest about our  salvation for us to spend our thoughts on any such attempts however  reverently meant at imaginative playacting in our own minds about his  hanging on his cross while we know that he is not on his cross and  about watching by his tomb when we know that he is not in his tomb  let  us thank him bless him serve him die for him if need be in return  for all he endured for us  but let us keep our sorrow and our pity and  our tears for our own daily sinswe have enough of them to employ all  our sorrow and moreand not in voluntary humility and willworship  against which st paul warns us lose sight of our real christ of him who  was dead and is alive for evermore and dwells in us by faith now and  for ever amen and hath the keys of death and hell and has opened them  for us and for our fathers before us and for our children after us and  for nations yet unborn  true this is a solemn day for on it the son of god fought such a fight  that he could only win it at the price of his own lifes blood and a  humiliating day for our sins helped to nail him on the crossand  therefore a day of humiliation and of humility  proud selfwilled  thoughts are surely out of place today and what day are they in place   on this day god agonised for man  but it is a day of triumph and  deliverance and we must go home as men who have stood by and seen a  fearful fighta fight which makes the blood of him who watches it run  cold but we have seen too a glorious victorysuch a victory as never  was won on earth before or since and we therefore must think cheerfully  of the battle for the sake of the victory that was won and remember  that on this day death was indeed swallowed up in victorybecause death  was the victory itself  the question on which the fate of the whole world depended was whether  christ dare die and he dared die  whether christ would endure to the  end and he did endure  whether he would utterly drink the cup which his  father had given him and he drank it to the dregs and so by his very  agony he showed himself noble beautiful glorious adorable beyond all  that words can express  and so the cross was his throne of glory the  prints of the nails in his hands and feet were the very tokens of his  triumph his very sorrows were his bliss and those last words it is  finished were no cry of despair but a trumpetcall of triumph which  rang from the highest heaven to the lowest hell proclaiming to all  created things that the very fountain of life by dying had conquered  death that good had conquered evil love had conquered selfishness god  had conquered man and all the enemies of man and that he who died was  the first begotten from the dead and the king of all the princes of the  earth who was going to fulfil more and more as the years and the ages  rolled on the glorious prayer which we have prayed this day graciously  to behold that family for whom he had been contented to die and wisely  and orderly to call each man to a vocation and a ministry in which he  might duly serve god and be a blessing to all around him by the  inspiration of christs holy spirit and to have mercy in his own good  time upon all jews turks heathens and infidels and bring them home  to his flock that they may be saved and made one fold under one  shepherdhim who was dead and is alive for evermore  therefore my dear friends if we wish to keep good friday in spirit and  in truth we cannot do so better than by trying to carry out the very end  for which christ died on this day and doing our part small though it  be toward bringing those poor heathens home into christs fold and  teaching them the gospel and good news that for them too christ died  and over them too christ reigns alive for evermore and bringing them  home into his flock that they too may find a place in his great  family and have their calling and ministry appointed to them among the  nations of those who are saved and walk in the light of god and of the  lamb  i have refrained till now from speaking to you much about missionaries  and the duty which lies on us all of helping missions  it seemed to me  that i must first teach you to understand these first and second collects  before i went on to the third that i must first teach you that you  belonged to christs family and that he had called each of you and  appointed each of you to some order and degree in his holy church  but  now if indeed you have learnt thatif my preaching here for fourteen  years has had any effect to teach you who and what you are and what your  duty is let me entreat you to go on and take the lesson of that third  collect and think of those poor jews turks infidels and heretics who  stillmany a million of themsit or rather wander and fall and lie  miserably wallowing in darkness and the shadow of death and think  whether you cannot do something toward helping them  what you can do  and how it is to be done i will tell you hereafter and by gods grace  i hope to see men of god in this pulpit who having been missionaries  themselves can tell you better than i what remains to be done and how  you can help to do it  but take home this one thought with you this  good fridaychrist who liveth and was dead and behold he is alive for  evermore if he be indeed precious to you if you indeed feel for his  sufferings if you indeed believe that what he bought by those sufferings  was a right to all the souls on earth then do what you can toward  repaying him for his sufferings by seeing of the travail of his soul  and being satisfied  all the reward he asks or ever asked is the  hearts of sinners that he may convert them the souls of sinners that  he may save them and they belong to him already for he bought them this  day with his own most precious blood  do something then toward helping  christ to his own    sermon x  the image of the earthly and the heavenly    eversley easter day

the true old sense of that word for it is the  season which ought to comfort us mostthat is it gives us strength  strength to live like men and strength to die like men when our time  comes  strength to live like men  strength to fight against the  temptation which solomon felt when he said  i have seen all the works  which are done under the sun and behold all is vanity and vexation of  spirit  for what has a man of all his labour and of the vexation of his  heart wherein he has laboured under the sun  for all his days are  sorrow and his travail grief  yea his heart taketh not rest in the  night  this also is vanity  for that which befalleth the sons of men  befalleth beasts  as the one dieth so dieth the other  yea they have  all one breath  so that a man has no preeminence over a beast for all  is vanity  all go to one place  all are of the dust and all turn to  dust again  who knoweth the spirit of man that it goeth upward and the  spirit of the beast that it goeth downward to the earth  so thought  solomon in his temptation and made up his mind that there was nothing  better for a man than that he should eat and drink and make his soul  enjoy good in his labour  so thought solomon in spite of all his wisdom because he had not heard  the good news of easter day  and so think many now who are called wise  men and philosophers because they alas for them will not believe the  good news of easter day  but what says easter day  easter day says man has preeminence over a  beast  the man is redeemed from the death of the beasts by christ who  rose on easter day  easter day says wherever the spirit of the beast  goes wherever the spirit of the brutal and the wicked man goes the  spirit of the true christian goes upward to christ who bought it with  his precious blood  easter day says the body may turn to the dust from  which it was taken but the spirit lives for ever before god who shall  give it another body as it shall please him as he gives to every seed  its own body  and therefore easter day says there is something better  for a man than to eat and drink and enjoy himself for tomorrow he may  die and all be over and that something is to labour not merely for the  meat which perishes with the perishing body but to labour after the  fruits of the spiritlove joy peace longsuffering gentleness  goodness faith meekness temperance  these the life of the body does  not give us and these the death of the body not take away from us for  they are spiritual and heavenly eternal and divine and he who has them  cannot die for ever  and therefore we may comfort ourselves in all our  labour if only we labour at the one useful work on earth to be good  and to do good and to make others good likewise  true it is as st paul says that if in this life only we have hope in  christ we are of all men most miserable  for we do not care to be of the  earth earthy  we long to be of the heaven heavenly  we do not care to  spend our time in eating and drinking mean covetousness ambition and  the base pleasures of the flesh  we long after high and noble things  which we cannot get on earth or at best only in fragments and at rare  moments after the holiness and the blessedness of ourselves and our  fellowcreatures  but we have hope in christ for the next life as well  as for this  hope that in the next life he will give us power to  succeed where we failed here that he will enable us to be good and to  do good and if not to make others good for there we trust all will  be good together to enjoy the fulness of that pleasure for which we  have been longing on earththe pleasure of seeing others good as christ  is good and perfect as their father in heaven is perfect  to be good ourselves and to live for ever in good companyah my  friends that is true bliss  if we cannot reach that after death it  were better for us that death should make an end of us and that when our  body decays in the grave we should be annihilated and become nothing for  ever  but easter day says to us if you labour to create good company in this  life by trying to make other people round you good you shall enjoy for  ever in the next world the good company which you have helped to make   if you labour to make yourself good in this life you shall enjoy the  fruit of your labour in the next life by being good and therefore  blessed for ever  easter day says your labour is not vanity and  vexation of spirit  it is solid work which shall receive solid pay from  god hereafter  easter day is a pledgei may say a sacramentfrom god  to us that he will righteously reward all righteous work and that  therefore it is worth any mans while to labour to suffer if need be  even to die in trying to be good noble useful selfsacrificing as  christ toiled and suffered and died and sacrificed himself to do good   for then he will share christs reward as he has shared christs labour  and be rewarded as christ was by resurrection to eternal life  and so easter day should give us strength to live like menthe only  truly manly truly human life the life of being good and doing good  and strength to die  men are afraid of dying principally i believe  because they fear the unknown  it is not that they are afraid of the  pain of dying  it is not that they are afraid of going to hell for in  all my experience at least i have met with but one person who thought  that he was going to hell  neither is it that they are afraid of not  going to heaven  their expectation almost always is that they are going  thither  but they do not care much to go to heaven  they are willing  enough to go there because they know that they must go somewhere  but  their notions of what heaven will be like are by no means clear  they  have sung rapturous hymns in church or chapel about the heavenly  jerusalem and passing jordan safe to canaans shore with no very clear  notion of what the words meantand small blame to them  but when they think of actually dying they feel as if to go into the  next world was to be turned out into the dark night into an unknown  land away from house and home and all they have known and all they  have loved and they are ready to say with the good old heathen emperor  when he lay adying   little soul of mine wandering kindly companion and guest of my body into what place art thou now departing shivering naked and pale   and so they shrink from death  they must shrink from death unless they  will believe with their whole hearts the good news of easter day  the  more thoughtful and clever they are the more they will shrink from  death and dread the thought of losing their bodies  they have always  had bodies here on earth  they only know themselves as souls embodied  living in bodies and they cannot think of themselves in the next world  with any comfort if they may not think of themselves as having bodies  and the more loving and affectionate they are the more they will shrink  from death unless they believe with their whole hearts the good news of  easter day  for those whom they have loved on earth have bodies   through their bodiesthrough their voices their looks their actions  they have known them and thus they have loved them and if their beloved  ones are to have no bodies in the world to come how shall they see them  how shall they know them how shall they converse with them  it seems to  them in that case neither they nor those they love would be the same  persons in the world to come they are here and that thought is lonely  and dreadful till they accept the good news of easter day the thrice  blessed words of st paul in his epistle to the corinthians which they  hear at the burial of those whom they love and lose  oh blessed news  for us and for those we love those without whose company the world to  come would be lonely and cheerless to us  for now we can say tell me  not that as the beast dies so dies the man  tell me not that as adam  died because of sin so must i die and all i love  tell me not that it  is the universal law of nature that all things born in time must die in  time and that every human being animal and plant carries in itself  from its beginning to its end a law of death the seed of its own  destruction  i know all that but i care little for it because i know  more than that  i know that the mans body dies as the beasts body  dies but i know that the body is not the man but only the husk the  shell of the man that the true man the true woman lives on after the  loss of his mortal body and that there is an eternal law of life which  conquers the law of death and by that law a fresh body will grow up  round the true man the immortal spirit and will be as fitay far  fitterto do his work than this poor mortal body which has turned to  death on earth  tell me not that because i am descended from a mortal  and sinful old adam of whom it is written that he was of the earth  earthly therefore my soul is a part of my body and dies when my body  dies  i belong not to the old adam but to the new adamthe new head of  men who is the lord from heaven the author of eternal life to all who  obey him  do not tell me that i have nothing in me but the likeness of  the old adam for that seems to me and to st paul nothing but the  likeness of the fallen savage and the brute in human form  i know i have  more in meinfinitely morethan that  what may be in store for the  savage the brutal the wicked is gods concern not mine  but what is  in store for me i knowthat as i have borne the image of the earthly so  shall i bear the image of the heavenly if only the spirit of christ the  new adam be in me  for if christ be in us the body is dead because of  sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness  and if the spirit  of him which raised up jesus from the dead dwell in us he that raised up  christ from the dead shall also quicken our mortal bodies by his spirit  that dwelleth in us  how he will do it i know not neither do i care to  know  when he will do it i know not but it will be when it ought to be  and that is enough for me  that he can do it i know for he is the maker  of the universe and to him all power is given in heaven and earth and  as for its being strange wonderful past understanding that matters  little to me  that will be but one wonder more in a world where all is  wonderfulone more mystery in an utterly mysterious universe  and so as easter day has given us strength to live let easter day too  give us strength to die    sermon xi  easter day    chester cathedral 1870  st john xii 24 25  verily verily i say unto you except a corn of  wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone  but if it die it  bringeth forth much fruit  he that loveth his life shall lose it and he  that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal  this is our lords own parable  in it he tells us that his death his  resurrection his ascension is a mystery which we may believe not only  because the bible tells us of it but because it is reasonable and  according to the laws of his universe a fulfilment rather say the  highest fulfilment of one of those laws which runs through the world of  nature and through the spiritual and heavenly world likewise  except a  corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alonebarren  useless and truly dead to the rest of the world around it because it is  shut up in itself and its hidden life with all its wondrous powers of  growth and fertility remains undeveloped and will remain so till it  decays away a worthless thing into worthless dust  but if it be buried  in the earth a while then the rich life which lay hid in it is called  out by that seeming death and it sprouts tillers and flowers and  ripens its grainfortyfold sixtyfold an hundredfold and so it  shows gods mind and will concerning it  it shows what is really in it  and develops the full capabilities of its being  even so says our lord  would his death his resurrection his ascension be  he speaks of his own resurrection and ascension yes but he speaks first  of his own death  before the corn can bring forth fruit and show what  is in it fulfilling the law of its being it must fall into the ground  and die  before our lord could fulfil the prophecy thou wilt not leave  my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see  corruption he must fulfil the darker prophecy of that awful 88th psalm  the only one of all the psalms which ends in sorrow in all but despair  my soul is full of trouble and my life draweth nigh unto hell  i am  counted as one of them that go down into the pit  and i have been even  as a man that hath no strength  free among the dead like unto them that  are wounded and lie in the grave who are out of remembrance and are cut  away from thy hand  so it was to be  so we may believe it needed to  be  christ must suffer before he entered into his glory  he must die  before he could rise  he must descend into hell before he ascended into  heaven  for this is the law of gods kingdom  without a good friday  there can be no easter day  without selfsacrifice there can be no  blessedness neither in earth nor in heaven  he that loveth his life  will lose it  he that hateth his life in this paltry selfish  luxurious hypocritical world shall keep it to life eternal  our lord  jesus christ fulfilled that law because it is the law the law not of  moses but of the kingdom of heaven and must be fulfilled by him who  would fulfil all righteousness and be perfect even as his father in  heaven is perfect  bear this in mind i pray you and whenever you think of our lords  resurrection and ascension remember always that the background to his  triumph isa tomb  remember that it is the triumph over suffering a  triumph of one who still bears the prints of the nails in his hands and  in his feet and the wound of the spear in his side like many a poor  soul who has followed him triumphant at last and yet scarred and only  not maimed in the hard battle of life  remember for ever the adorable  wounds of christ  remember for ever that st john saw in the midst of the  throne of god the likeness of a lamb as it had been slain  for so alone  you will learn what our lords resurrection and ascension are to all who  have to suffer and to toil on earth  for if our lords triumph had had  no suffering before itif he had conquered as the hindoos represent  their gods as conquering their enemies without effort without pain  destroying them with careless ease by lightnings hurled by a hundred  hands and aided by innumerable armies of spiritswhat would such a  triumph have been to us  what comfort what example to us here  struggling often sinning in this piecemeal world  we wantand blessed  be god we havea captain of our salvation who has been made perfect by  sufferings  we wantand blessed be god we havean high priest who can  be touched with the feeling of our infirmities because he has been  tempted in all things like as we are yet without sin  we wantand  blessed be god we havea king who was glorified by suffering that if  we are ever called on to sacrifice ourselves we may hope by suffering  to share his glory  and when we have remembered this and fixed it in  our minds we may go on safely to think of his glory and see that as i  said at first his resurrection and ascension satisfy our consciences satisfy that highest reason and moral sense within us which is none  other than the voice of the holy spirit of god  for see  our lord proved himself to be the perfectly righteous being by  his very passion  he proved it by being righteous utterly against his  own interest by enduring shame torment death for righteousness sake   but we feel that our lords history could not must not end there  our  conscience which is our highest reason shrinks from that thought  if  our lord had died and never risen then would his history be full of  nothing but despair to all who long to copy him and do right at all  costs  our consciences demand that god should be just  we say with  abraham shall not the judge of all the earth do right  shall not he  who suffered without hope of reward have his reward nevertheless  shall  not he who cried my god my god why hast thou forsaken me be  justified by having it proved to all the world that god had not forsaken  him  but we surely cannot be more just than god  if we expect god to do  right we shall surely find that he has done right and more right than  we could expect or dream  therefore we may believei say that we must  believe if we be truly reasonable beingswhat the bible tells us that  christ who suffered more than all was rewarded more than all that  christ who humbled himself more than all was exalted more than all and  that his resurrection and ascension as st paul tells us again and again  was meant to show men thisto show them that god the father has been  infinitely just to the infinite merits of god the son jesus christ our  lordto justify our lord to all mankind by his triumph over death and  hell and in justifying him to justify his father and our father his god  and our god  and what is true of christ must be true of us the members of christ  he  is entered into his rest and you desire to enter into it likewise  you  have a right to desire it for it is written there remaineth a rest for  the people of god  remember then that true rest can only be attained  as he attained it through labour  you desire to be glorified with  christ  remember that true glory can only be attained in earth or heaven  through selfsacrifice  whosoever will save his life shall lose it  whosoever will lose his life shall save it  if that eternal moral law  held good enough for the sinless christ who though he were a son yet  learned obedience by the things which he suffered how much more must it  hold good of you and me and all moral and rational beingsyea for the  very angels in heaven  they have not sinned  that we know and we do  not know and i presume cannot know that they have ever suffered  but  this at least we know that they have submitted  they have obeyed and  have given up their own wills to be the ministers of gods will  in them  is neither selfwill nor selfishness and therefore by faith that is by  trust and loyalty they stand  and so by consenting to lose their  individual life of selfishness they have saved their eternal life in  god the life of blessedness and holiness just as all evil spirits have  lost their eternal life by trying to save their selfish life and be  something in themselves and of themselves without respect to god  this is a great mystery indeed it is the mystery of the eternal  divine and blessed life to which god of his mercy bring us all  and  therefore good friday easter day ascension day are set as great lights  in the firmament of the spiritual yearto remind us that we are not  animals born to do what we like and fulfil the sinful lusts of the  flesh the ways whereof are death but that we are moral and rational  beings members of christ children of god inheritors of the kingdom of  heaven and that therefore i say it again like christ our lord we  must die in order to live stoop in order to conquer  they remind us  that honour must grow out of humility that freedom must grow out of  discipline that sure conquest must be born of heavy struggles righteous  joy out of righteous sorrow pure laughter out of pure tears true  strength out of the true knowledge of our own weakness sound peace of  mind out of sound contrition and that the heart which has a right to  cry the lord is on my side i will not fear what man doeth unto me  must be born out of the heart which has cried god be merciful to me a  sinner they remind us that in all things as says our lord there  cannot be joy because a man is born into the world unless there first  be sorrow because the hour of birth is come and that he who would be  planted into the likeness of christs resurrection must like the corn  of wheat be first planted into the likeness of his death and die to sin  and self that he may live to righteousness and to god and like the  corn of wheat become truly living truly strong truly rich truly  useful and develop the hidden capabilities of his being fulfilling the  mind and will of god concerning him  again i say this is a great  mystery  but again i say this is the law not moses law but the  gospel lawthe law of liberty by which a man becomes truly free  because he has trampled under foot the passions of his own selfish flesh  till his immortal spirit can ascend free into the light of god and into  the love of god and into the beneficence of god  my dear friends  remember these words for they are true  remember that st paul always  couples with the resurrection and ascension of our bodies in the next  life the resurrection and ascension of our souls in this life for  without that the resurrection of our bodies would be but a resurrection  to fresh sin and therefore to fresh misery and ruin  remember his great  words about that moral resurrection and ascension of our wills our  hearts our characters our actions  god he says who is rich in  mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead  in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace are ye saved  and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly  places in christ jesus  and what are those heavenly places  and what is our duty in them  let  st paul himself answer  if ye then be risen with christ seek those  things which are above where christ sitteth at the right hand of god  and what are they  let st paul answer once more who should know better  than he save christ alone  whatsoever things are true honest just  pure lovely of good report  if there be any virtue and if there be  any praise think on these things  yes think of these thingsand thinking of them ask the holy spirit  of god to inspire you and make a whitsuntide in your hearts even as he  has made i trust a good friday and an eastertide and an ascension day  that so knowing these things you may be blessed in doing them that so and so onlymay be fulfilled in you and me or any rational being those  blessed promises which were fulfilled in christ our lord  they that sow  in tears shall reap in joy  he that now goeth on his way weeping and  beareth forth good seed shall doubtless come again with joy and bring  his sheaves with him  blessed is the man whose strength is in thee in  whose heart are thy ways who going through the vale of misery use it  for a well and the pools are filled with water  they will go from  strength to strength  and unto the god of gods appeareth every one of  them in sion  to which may god in his great mercy bring us all  amen    sermon xii  presence in absence    eversley third sunday after easter 1862  st john xvi 16  a little while and ye shall not see me  and again a  little while and ye shall see me because i go to the father  divines differ and perhaps have always differed about the meaning of  these words  some think that our lord speaks in them of his death and  resurrection  others that he speaks of his ascension and coming again in  glory  i cannot decide which is right  i dare not decide  it is a very  solemn thingtoo solemn for meto say of any words of our lords they  mean exactly this or that and no more  for if wise mens words have as  they often have more meanings than one and yet all true then surely  the words of jesus the son of god who spake as never man spakehis  words i say may have many meanings yea meanings without end meanings  which we shall never fully understand perhaps even in heaven and yet  all alike true  but i think it is certain that most of the early christians understood  these words of our lords ascension and coming again in glory  they  believed that he was coming again in a very little while during their own  lifetime in a few months or years to make an end of the world and to  judge the quick and the dead  and as they waited for his coming one  generation after another and yet he did not come a sadness fell upon  them  christ seemed to have left the world  the little while that he  had promised to be away seemed to have become a very long while   hundreds of years passed and yet christ did not come in glory  and as  i said a sadness fell on all the church  surely they said this is the  time of which christ said we were to weep and lament till we saw him  againthis is the time of which he said that the bridegroom should be  taken from us and we should fast in those days  and they did fast and  weep and lament and their religion became a very sad and melancholy  onemost sad in those who were most holy and loved their lord best and  longed most for his coming in glory  what happened after that again i could tell you but we have nothing to  do with it today  we will rather go back and see what the lords  disciples thought he meant when he saida little while and ye shall  not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me because i go  to the father  one would think surely that they must have taken those  words to mean his death and resurrection  they heard him speak them on  the very night that he was betrayed  they saw him taken from them that  very night  in horror and agony they saw him mocked and scourged  crucified dead and buried as they thought for ever and the world  around rejoicing over his death  surely they wept and lamented then   surely they thought that he had gone away and left them then  and the third day beyond all hope or expectation they beheld him alive  again unchanged perfect and gloriousas near them and as faithful to  them as ever  surely that was seeing him again after a little while   surely then their sorrow was turned to joy  surely then a man the man  of all men was born into the world a second time and in them was  fulfilled our lords most exquisite parablemost human and yet most  divineof the mother remembering no more her anguish for joy that a man  is born into the world  i think too that we may see by the disciples conduct that they took  these words of the text to speak of christs death and resurrection  for  when he ascended to heaven out of their sight did they consider that was  seeing him no more  did they think that he had gone away and left them   did they therefore as would have been natural weep and lament  on the  contrary we are told expressly by st luke that they returned to  jerusalem with great joy and were continually in the temple not  weeping and lamenting but praising and blessing god  plainly they did  not consider that christ was parted from them when he ascended into  heaven  he had been training them during the forty days between easter  day and ascension day to think of him as continually near them whether  they saw him or not  suddenly he came and went again  mysteriously he  appeared and disappeared  he showed them that though they saw not him  he saw them heard their words knew the thoughts and intents of their  hearts  he was always near them they felt with them to the end of the  world whether in sight or out of sight  and when they saw him ascend  into heaven it seemed to them no separation no calamity no change in  his relation to them  he was gone to heaven  surely he had been in  heaven during those forty days whenever they had not seen him  he had  gone to the father  might he not have been with the father during those  forty days whenever they had not seen him  nay was he not always in  heaven  was not heaven very near them  did not christ bring heaven with  him whithersoever he went  was he not always with the father the father  who fills all things in whom all created things live and move and have  their being  how could they have thought otherwise about our lord when  almost his last words to them were not lo i leave you alone but lo  i am with you alway even to the end of the world  my friends these may seem deep words to somedoubtless they are for  they are the words of the bibleso deep that plain unlearned people can  make no use of them and draw no lesson from them  i do not think so  i  think it is of endless use and endless importance to you how you think  about christ and therefore how you think about these forty days  between our lords resurrection and ascension  you may think of our lord  in two ways  you may think of him as having gone very far away millions  of millions of miles into the sky and not to return till the last day and then i do not say that you will weep and lament  there are not many  who have that notion about our lord and yet love him enough to weep and  lament at the thought of his having gone away  but your religion when  it wakes up in you will be a melancholy and terrifying one  i say when  it wakes up in youfor you will be tempted continually to let it go to  sleep  there will come over you the feelinggod forgive us does it not  come over us all but too oftenchrist is far away  does he see me   does he hear me  will he find me out  does it matter very much what i  say and do now provided i make my peace with him before i die  and so  will come over you not merely a carelessness about religious duties  about prayer reading churchgoing but worse still a carelessness  about right and wrong  you will be in danger of caring little about  controlling your passions about speaking the truth about being just and  merciful to your fellowmen  and then when your conscience wakes you up  at times and cries prepare to meet thy god you will be terrified and  anxious at the thought of judgment and shrink from the thought of  christs seeing you  my friends that is a fearful state though a very  common one  what is it but a foretaste of that dreadful terror in which  those who would not see in christ their lord and saviour will call on the  mountains to fall on them and the hills to cover them from him that  sitteth on the throne and from the anger of the lamb  but again  you may think of christ as his truest servants though they  might have been long in darkness in all ages and countries have thought  of him sooner or later  and they thought of him as the disciples did  as of one who was about their path and about their bed and spying out  all their ways as one who was in heaven but who for that very reason  was bringing heaven down to earth continually in the gracious  inspirations of his holy spirit as one who brought heaven down to them  as often as he visited their hearts and comforted them with sweet  assurance of his love his faithfulness his poweras god grant that he  may comfort those of you who need comfort  and that thought that christ  was always with them even to the end of the world sobered and steadied  them and yet refreshed and comforted them  it sobered them  what else  could it do  does it not sober us to see even a picture of christ  crucified  how must it have sobered them to carry as good st ignatius  used to say of himself christ crucified in his heart  a man to whom  christ as it were showed perpetually his most blessed wounds and said  behold what i have enduredhow dare he give way to his passion  how  dare he be covetous ambitious revengeful false  and yet it cheered  and comforted them  how could it do otherwise to know all day long that  he who was wounded for their iniquities and by whose stripes they were  healed was near them day and night watching over them as a father over  his child saying to themfear not i am he that was dead and am  alive for evermore and i hold the keys of death and hell  though thou  walkest through the fires i will be with thee  i will never leave thee  nor forsake thee  yes my friends if you wish your lifeand therefore  your religion which ought to be the very life of your lifeto be at  once sober and cheerful full of earnestness and full of hope believe  our lords words which he spoke during these very forty dayslo i am  with you alway even to the end of the world  believe that heaven has  not taken him away from you but brought him nearer to you and that he  has ascended up on high not that he in whom alone is life might empty  this earth of his presence but that he might fill all things not this  earth only but all worlds past present and to come  believe that  wherever two or three are gathered together in christs name there he is  in the midst of them that the holy communion is the sign of his  perpetual presence and that when you kneel to receive the bread and  wine christ is as near youspiritually indeed and invisibly but  really and trulyas near you as those who are kneeling by your side  and if it be so with christ then it is so with those who are christs  with those whom we love  it is the christ in them which we love and  that christ in them is their hope of glory and that glory is the glory  of christ  they are partakers of his death therefore they are partakers  of his resurrection  let us believe that blessed news in all its  fulness and be at peace  a little while and we see them and again a  little while and we do not see them  but why  because they are gone to  the father to the source and fount of all life and power all light and  love that they may gain life from his life power from his power light  from his light love from his loveand surely not for nought  surely not for nought my friends  for if they were like christ on  earth and did not use their powers for themselves alone if they are to  be like christ when they shall see him as he is then more surely will  they not use their powers for themselves but as christ uses his for  those they love  surely like christ they may come and go even now unseen  like  christ they may breathe upon our restless hearts and say peace be unto  youand not in vain  for what they did for us when they were on earth  they can more fully do now that they are in heaven  they may seem to  have left us and we like the disciples may weep and lament  but the  day will come when the veil shall be taken from our eyes and we shall  see them as they are with christ and in christ for ever and remember  no more our anguish for joy that a man is born into the world that  another human being has entered that one true real and eternal world  wherein is neither disease disorder change decay nor death for it is  none other than the bosom of the father    sermon xiii  ascension day    eversley  chester cathedral 1872  st john viii 58  before abraham was i am  let us consider these words awhile  they are most fit for our thoughts  on this glorious day on which the lord jesus ascended to his father and  to our father to his god and to our god that he might be glorified  with the glory which he had with the father before the making of the  world  for it is clear that we shall better understand ascension day  just as we shall better understand christmas or eastertide the better we  understand who it was who was born at christmas suffered and rose at  eastertide and as on this day ascended into heaven  who then was he  whose ascent we celebrate  what was that glory which as far as we can  judge of divine things he resumed as on this day  let us think a few minutes with all humility not rashly intruding  ourselves into the things we have not seen or meddling with divine  matters which are too hard for us but taking our lords words simply as  they stand and where we do not understand them believing them  nevertheless  now it is clear that the book of exodus and our lords words speak of the  same person  the old testament tells of a personage who appeared to  moses in the wilderness and who called himself the lord god of abraham  isaac and jacob  but this personage also calls himself i am  i am  that i am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of  israel i am hath sent me unto you  in the new testament we read of a personage who calls himself the son of  god is continually called the lord and who tells his disciples to call  him by that name without reproving them though they and he knew well  what it meantthat it meant no less than this that he jesus of  nazareth poor mortal man as he seemed was still the lord the god of  abraham isaac and jacob  i do not say that the disciples saw that at  first clearly or fully till after our lords resurrection  but there  was one moment shortly before his death when they could have had no  doubt who he assumed himself to be  for the unbelieving jews had no  doubt and considered him a blasphemer and these were his awful and  wonderful wordsi do not pretend to understand themi take them simply  as i find them and believe and adore  your father abraham rejoiced to  see my day and he saw it and was glad  then said the jews unto him  thou art not yet fifty years old and hast thou seen abraham  one  cannot blame them for asking that question for abraham had been dead  then nearly two thousand years  but what is our lords solemn answer   verily verily i say unto you before abraham was i am  i am  the same name by which our lord god had revealed himself to  moses in the wilderness some sixteen hundred years before  if these  words were trueand the lord prefaces them with verily verily amen  amen which was as solemn an asseveration as any oath could bethen the  lord jesus christ is none other than the god of abraham the god of  moses the god of the jews the god of the whole universe past present  and to come  let us think awhile over this wonder of all wonders  the more we think  over it we shall find it not only the wonder of all wonders but the  good news of all good news  the deepest and soundest philosophers will tell us that there must be an  i am  that is as they would say a selfexistent being neither made  nor created but who has made and created all things who is without  parts and passions and is incomprehensible that is cannot be  comprehended limited made smaller or weaker or acted on in any way by  any of the things that he has made  so that this selfexisting being  whom we call god would be exactly what he is now if the whole universe  sun moon and stars were destroyed this moment and would be exactly  what he is now if there had never been any universe at all or any thing  or being except his own perfect and selfexistent self  for he lives and  moves and has his being in nothing  but all things live and move and  have their being in him  he was before all things and by him all things  consist  and this is the catholic faith and not only that this is  according to sound and right reason  but more  the soundest  philosophers will tell you that god must be not merely a selfexistent  being but the i am that if god is a spirit and not merely a name for  some powers and laws of brute nature and matter he must be able to say  to himself i am that he must know himself that he must be conscious  of himself of who and what he is as you and i are conscious of  ourselves and more or less of who and what we are  and this also i  believe to be true and rational and necessary to the catholic faith  but they will tell you againand this too is surely truethat i am  must be the very name of god because god alone can say perfectly i  am and no more  you and i dare not if we think accurately say of  ourselves i am  we may say i am this or that i am a man i am an  englishman but we must not say i am that is i exist of myself   we must saynot i am but i become or have become i was made i was  created i am growing changing i depend for my very existence on god  and gods will and if he willed i should be nothing and nowhere in a  moment  god alone can say i am and there is none beside me and never  has nor can be  i exist absolutely and simply because i choose to  exist and get life from nothing for i am the life and give life to all  things  but you may say what is all this to us  it is very difficult  to understand and dreary and even awful  why should we care for it  even if it be true  yes my friends philosophy may be true and yet be  dreary and awful and have no gospel and good news in it at all  i  believe it never can have that only in revelation and in the revelation  of our lord jesus christ can poor human beings find any gospel and good  news at all  and sure i am that that is an awful thought a dreary  thought a crushing thought which makes a man feel as small and  worthless and helpless and hopeless as a grain of dust or a mote in  the sunbeamthat thought of god for ever contained in himself and  saying for ever to himself i am and there is none beside me  but the gospel the good news of the old testament the gospel the good  news of the new testament is the revelation of god and gods ways which  began on christmas day and finished on ascension day  and what is that   what but this  that god does not merely say to himself in majesty i  am but that he goes out of himself in love and says to men i am   that he is a god who has spoken to poor human beings and told them who  he was and that he the i am the selfexistent one the cause of life  of all things even the maker and ruler of the universe can stoop to  manand not merely to perfect men righteous men holy men wise men  but to the enslaved the sinful the brutishthat he may deliver them  and teach them and raise them from the death of sin to his own life of  righteousness  do you not see the difference the infinite difference and the good news  in that  do you not see a whole heaven of new hope and new duty is  opened to mankind in that one factgod has spoken to man  he the i am  the selfexistent who needs no one and no thing has turned aside as  it were and stooped from the throne of heaven again and again during  thousands of years to say to you and me and millions of mankind i am  your god  how do you prosperwhat do you needwhat are you doing for if you are doing justice to yourself and your fellowmen then fear  not that i shall be just to you  and more  when that i am the selfexistent god could not set sinful  men right by saying this then did he stoop once more from the throne of  the heavens to do that infinite deed of love of which it is written  that he who called himself i am the god of abraham was conceived of  the holy ghost born of the virgin mary crucified under pontius pilate  rose again the third day and ascended into heaventhat he might send  down the spirit of the i am the holy spirit who proceedeth from the  father and the son upon all who ask him that they may be holy as god is  holy and perfect as god is perfect  yes my dear friends remember  that and live in the light of that the gospel of good news of the  incarnation of jesus christ very god of very god begotten  know that  god has spoken to you as he spoke to abraham and saidi am the  almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect  know that he has  spoken to you as he spoke to moses sayingi am the lord thy god who  have brought you and your fathers before you out of the spiritual egypt  of heathendom and ignorance sin and wickedness into the knowledge of  the one true and righteous god  but know more that he has spoken to  you by the mouth of jesus christ sayingi am he that died in the form  of mortal man upon the cross for you  and behold i am alive for  evermore and to me all power is given in heaven and earth  yes my friends let us lay to heart even upon this joyful day the  awful warnings of the epistle to the hebrewsgod the i am has spoken  to us god the i am is speaking to us now  see that you refuse not him  that speaketh for if they escaped not who refused moses that spake on  earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that  speaketh from heaven wherefore follow peace with all men and holiness  without which no man shall see the lord and have grace whereby we may  serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear  for our god is a  consuming fire  to those who disobey him eternal wrath to those who  love him eternal love  yes my friends  let us believe that and live in the light of that  with reverence and godly fear all the year round  but let us specially  today as far as our dull feelings and poor imaginations will allow us  let us i say adore the ascended saviour who rules for ever a man in  the midst of the throne of the universe and that manoh wonder of  wondersslain for us and let us say with st paul of old with all our  hearts and minds and soulsnow to the king of the ages immortal  invisible with the father and the holy spirit be honour and glory for  ever and ever  amen    sermon xiv  the comforter    eversley  sunday after ascension day 1868  st john xv 26  when the comforter is come whom i will send unto you  from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the  father he shall testify of me  some writers especially when they are writing hymns have fallen nowa days into a habit of writing of the holy spirit of god in a tone of  which i dare not say that it is wrong or untrue but of which i must say  that it is onesided  and if there are two sides to a matter it must do  us harm to look at only one of them  and i think that it does people  harm to hear the holy spirit of god the holy ghost the comforter  spoken of in terms not of reverence but of endearment  for consider   he is the      creatorspirit by whose aid the worlds foundations first were laid   the lifegiving spirit of whom it is written thou sendest forth thy  spirit and things live and thou renewest the face of the earth  but he is the destroying spirit too who can when he will produce not  merely life but death who can and does send earthquakes storm and  pestilence of whom isaiah writesall flesh is as grass and all the  goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field  the grass withereth  the flower fadeth because the spirit of the lord bloweth upon it  i  think it does people harm to hear this awful and almighty being i say  spoken of merely as the sweet spirit and gentle dovewords which  are true but only true if we remember other truths equally true of  him concerning whom they are spoken  the spirit of god it seems to me  is too majestic a being to be talked of hastily as sweet  words may be  true and yet it may not be always quite reverent to use them  an  earthly sovereign may be full of all human sweetness and tenderness yet  we should not dare to address him as sweet  but indeed some of this talk about the holy spirit is not warranted by  scripture at all  in one of the hymns for instance in our hymnbook an excellent hymn in other respects there is a line which speaks of the  holy spirit as possessing the brooding of the gentle dove  now this line is really little but pretty sentiment made up of false  uses of scripture  the scripture speaks once of the holy spirit of god  brooding like a bird over its nest  but where  in one of the most  mysterious awful and important of all texts  and the earth was  without form and void  and the spirit of god moved brooded over the  face of the deep  what has thisthe magnificent picture of the life giving spirit brooding over the dead world to bring it into life again  and create from it sea and land heat and fire and cattle and creeping  things after their kind and at last man himself the flower and crown of  thingswhat has that to do with the brooding of a gentle dove  but the holy spirit is spoken of in scripture under the likeness of a  dove  true and here is another confusion  the dove is not the emblem  of gentleness in the bible  but the lamb  the dove is the emblem of  something else pure and holy but not of gentleness and therefore the  holy spirit is not spoken of in scripture as brooding as a gentle dove  but very differently as it seems to me  st matthew and st john say  that at our lords baptism the holy spirit was seen not brooding but  descending from heaven as a dove  to any one who knows anything of  doves who will merely go out into the field or the farmyard and look at  them and who will use his own eyes that figure is striking enough and  grand enough  it is the swiftness of the dove and not its fancied  gentleness that is spoken of  the dove appearing as you may see it  again and again like a speck in the far off sky rushing down with a  swiftness which outstrips the very eagle returning surely to the very  spot from which it set forth though it may have flown over hundreds of  miles of land and through the very clouds of heaven  it is the sky cleaving force and swiftness the unerring instinct of the dove and not  a sentimental gentleness to which scripture likens that holy spirit  which like the rushing mighty wind bloweth whither it listeth and thou  hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh or  whither it goeththat holy spirit who when he fell on the apostles  fell in tongues of fire and shook all the house where they were sitting  that holy spirit of whom one of the wisest christians who ever lived who  knew well enough the work of the spirit arguing just as i am now against  the fancy of associating the holy spirit merely with pretty thoughts of  our own and pleasant feelings of our own and sentimental raptures of  our own said wouldst thou know the manner of spiritual converse  of  the way in which the spirit of god works in man  then it is this  he  hath taken me up and dashed me down  like a lion i look that he will  break all my bones  from morning till evening thou wilt make an end of  me  but people are apt to forget this  and therefore they fall into two  mistakes  they think of the holy spirit as only a gentle and what they  call a dovelike being and they forget what a powerful awful literally  formidable being he is  they lose respect for the holy spirit  they  trifle with him and while they sing hymns about his gentleness and  sweetness they do things which grieve and shock him forgetting the  awful warning which he at the very outset of the christian church gave  against such taking of liberties with god the holy ghosthow ananias  and sapphira thought that the holy spirit was one whom they might honour  with their lips and more with their outward actions but who did not  require truth in the inward parts and did not care for their telling a  slight falsehood that they might appear more generous than they really  were in the eyes of men and how the answer of the holy spirit of god was  that he struck them both dead there and then for a warning to all such  triflers till the end of time  another mistake which really pious and good people commit is that they  think the holy spirit of god to be merely or little beside certain  pleasant frames and feelings and comfortable assurances in their own  minds  they do not know that these pleasant frames and feelings really  depend principally on their own health  and then when they get out of  health or when their brain is overworked and the pleasant feelings go  they are terrified and disheartened and complain of spiritual dryness  and cry out that gods spirit has deserted them and are afraid that god  is angry with them or even that they have committed the unpardonable  sin  not knowing that god is not a man that he should lie nor a son of  man that he should repent that god is as near them in the darkness as in  the light that whatever their own health or their own feelings may be  yet still in god they live and move and have their being that to gods  spirit they owe all which raises them above the dumb animals that  nothing can separate them from the love of him who promised that he would  not leave us comfortless but send to us his holy ghost to comfort us  and exalt us to the same place whither he has gone before  now why do i say all this  to take away comfort from you  to make you  fear and dread the spirit of god  god forbid  who am i to take away  comfort from any human being  i say it to give yon true comfort to make  you trust and love the holy spirit utterly to know himhis strength and  his wisdom as well as his tenderness and gentleness  you know that afflictions do cometerrible bereavements sorrows sad and  strange  my sermon does not make them come  there they are god help us  all and too many of them in this world  but from whom do they come   who is lord of life and death  who is lord of joy and sorrow  is not  that the question of all questions  and is not the answer the most  essential of all answers  it is the holy spirit of god the spirit who  proceedeth from the father and the son the spirit of the father who so  loved the world that he spared not his only begotten son the spirit of  the son who so loved the world that he stooped to die for it upon the  cross the spirit who is promised to lead you into all truth that you  may know god and in the knowledge of him find everlasting life the  spirit who is the comforter and says i have seen thy ways and will heal  thee i will lead thee also and restore comforts to thee and to thy  mourners  i speak peace to him that is near and to him that is far off  saith the lord and i will heal him  is it not the most blessed news  that he who takes away is the very same as he who gives  that he who  afflicts is the very same as he who comforts  that he of whom it is  written that as a lion so will he break all my bones from day even to  night wilt thou make an end of me is the same as he of whom it is  written he shall gather the lambs in his arms and carry them and  shall gently lead those that are with young and again as a beast  goeth down into the valley so the spirit of the lord caused him to  rest  that he of whom it is written our god is a consuming fire is  the same as he who has said when thou walkest through the fire thou  shalt not be burned  that he who brings us into the valley of the  shadow of death is the same as he of whom it is said thy rod and thy  staff they comfort me  is not that blessed news  is it not the news of  the gospel and the only good news which people will really care for  when they are tormented not with superstitious fears and doctrines of  devils which mans diseased conscience has originated but tormented with  the real sorrows the rational fears of this stormy human life  we all like comfort  but what kind of comfort do we not merely like but  need  merely to be comfortableto be free from pain anxiety sorrow to have only pleasant faces round us and pleasant things said to us   if we want that comfort we shall very seldom have it  it will be very  seldom good for us to have it  the comfort which poor human beings want  in such a world as this is not the comfort of ease but the comfort of  strength  the comforter whom we need is not one who will merely say kind  things but give helphelp to the weary and heavy laden heart which has  no time to rest  we need not the sunny and smiling face but the strong  and helping arm  for we may be in that state that smiles are shocking to  us and mere kindnessthough we may be grateful for itof no more  comfort to us than sweet music to a drowning man  we may be miserable  and unable to help being miserable and unwilling to help it too  we do  not wish to flee from our sorrow we do not wish to forget our sorrow   we dare not it is so awful so heartrending so plain spoken that god  the master and tutor of our hearts must wish us to face it and endure it   our father has given us the cupshall we not drink it  but who will  help us to drink the bitter cup  who will be the comforter and give us  not mere kind words but strength  who will give us the faith to say  with job though he slay me yet will i trust in him  who will give us  the firm reason to look steadily at our grief and learn the lesson it  was meant to teach  who will give us the temperate will to keep sober  and calm amid the shocks and changes of mortal life  above all i may  saywho will lead us into all truth  how much is our sorrow increased how much of it is caused by simple ignorance  why has our anxiety come   how are we to look at it  what are we to do  oh that we had a  comforter who would lead us into all truthnot make us infallible or  all knowing but lead us into truth at least put us in the way of truth  put things in their true light to us and give us sound and rational  views of life and duty  oh for a comforter who would give us the spirit  of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and ghostly strength  the spirit of knowledge and true godliness and fill us with that spirit  of gods holy fear which would make us not superstitious not slavish  not anxious but simply obedient loyal and resigned  if we had such a comforter as that could we not take evil from his  hands as well as good  we have had fathers of our flesh who corrected  us and we gave them reverence  they chastised us but we loved and  trusted them because we knew that they loved and trusted uschastised  us to make us betterchastised us because they trusted us to become  better  but if we can find a father of our spirits of our souls shall  we not rather be in subjection to him and live  if he sent us a  comforter to comfort and guide and inspire and strengthen us shall we  not say of that comforterthough he slay me yet will i trust in him  if we had such a comforter as that we should not care if he seemed at  times stern as well as kind we could endure rebuke and chastisement  from him if we could only get from him wisdom to understand the rebuke  and courage to bear the chastisement  where is that comforter  god  answersthat comforter am i the god of heaven and earth  there are  comforters on earth who can help thee with wise words and noble counsel  can be strong as man and tender as woman  then god can be more strong  than man and more tender than woman likewise  and when the strong arm  of man supports thee no longer yet under thee are the everlasting arms  of god  oh blessed news that god himself is the comforter  blessed news that  he who strikes will also heal  that he who gives the cup of sorrow will  also give the strength to drink it  blessed news that chastisement is  not punishment but the education of a father  blessed news that our  whole duty is the duty of a childof the son who said in his own agony  father not my will but thine be done  blessed news that our  comforter is the spirit who comforted christ the son himself who  proceeds both from the father and from the son and who will therefore  testify to us both of the father and the son and tell us that in christ  we are indeed really and literally the children of god who may cry to  him father with full understanding of all that that royal word  contains  blessed too to find that in the power of the divine majesty  we can acknowledge the unity and know and feel that the father son and  holy ghost are all one in love to the creatures whom they have made their glory equal for the glory of each and all is perfect charity and  their majesty coeternal because it is a perfect majesty whose justice  is mercy whose power is goodness its very sternness love love which  gives hope and counsel and help and strength and the true life which  this worlds death cannot destroy    sermon xv  thou art worthy   eversley 1869  chester cathedral 1870  trinity sunday  revelation iv 11  thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honour  and power  for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they  are and were created  i am going to speak to you on a deep matter the deepest and most  important of all matters and yet i hope to speak simply  i shall say  nothing which you cannot understand if you will attend  i shall say  nothing indeed which you could not find out for yourselves if you will  think and use your own common sense  i wish to speak to you of  theologyof god himself  for this trinity sunday of all the sundays of  the year is set apart for thinking of god himselfnot merely of our own  souls though we must never forget them nor of what god has done for our  souls though we must never forget thatbut of what god is himself what  he would be if we had no soulsif there were and had been from the  beginning no human beings at all upon the earth  now if we look at any living thingan animal say or a flower and  consider how curiously it is contrived our common sense will tell us at  once that some one has made it and if any one answersoh the flower  was not made it grewour common sense would tell us that that was only  a still more wonderful contrivance and that there must be some one who  gave it the power of growing and who makes it grow  and so our common  sense would tell us as it told the heathens of old that there must be  godsbeings whom we cannot see who made the world  but if we watch  things more closely we should find out that all things are made more or  less upon the same plan that and i tell you that this is true strange  as it may seem all animals however different they may seem to our eyes  are made upon the same plan all plants and flowers however different  they may seem are made upon the same plan all stones and minerals and  earths however different they may seem are made upon the same plan   then common sense would surely tell us one god made all the animals one  god made all the plants one god made all the earths and stones  but if  we watch more closely still we should find that the plants could not  live without the animals nor the animals without the plants nor either  of them without the soil beneath our feet and the air and rain above our  heads  that everything in the world worked together on one plan and  each thing depended on everything else  then common sense would tell us  one god must have made the whole world  but if we watched more closely  again or rather if we asked the astronomers who study the stars and  heavens they would tell us that all the worlds over our heads all the  stars that spangle the sky at night were made upon the same plan as our  earththat sun and moon and all the host of heaven move according to  the same laws by which our earth moves and as far as we can find out  have been made in the same way as our earth has been made and that these  same laws must have been going on making worlds after worlds for  hundreds of thousands of years and ages beyond counting and will in  all probability go on for countless ages more  then common sense will  tell us the same god has made all worlds past present and to come   there is but one god the same yesterday today and for ever  so we should learn something of how all things were made and then would  come a second question why all things were made  why did god make the  worlds  let us begin with a very simple example  simple things will often teach  us most  you see a flower growing not in a garden but wild in a field  or wood  you admire its beautiful colours or if it is fragrant its  sweet scent  now why was that flower put there  you may answer to  please me  my dear friends i should be the last person to deny that   i can never see a child picking a nosegay much less a little london  child born and bred and shut up among bricks and mortar when it gets  for the first time into a green field and throws itself instinctively  upon the buttercups and daisies as if they were precious jewels and  goldi never can see that sight i say without feeling that there are  such things as final causesi mean that the great father in heaven put  those flowers into that field on purpose to give pleasure to his human  children  but then comes the question of all the flowers in a single  field is one in ten thousand ever looked at by child or by men  and yet  they are just as beautiful as the rest and god has so to speak taken  just as much pains with the many beautiful things which men will never  see as with the few very few which men may see  and when one thinks  further about thiswhen one thinks of the vast forests in other lands  which the foot of man has seldom or never trod and which when they are  entered are found to be full of trees flowers birds butterflies so  beautiful and glorious that anything which we see in these islands is  poor and plain in comparison with them and when we remember that these  beautiful creatures have been going on generation after generation age  after age unseen and unenjoyed by any human eyes one must ask why has  god been creating all that beauty simply to let it all as it were run  to waste till after thousands of years one traveller comes and has a  hasty glimpse of it  impossible  or againand this is an example still  more strange and yet it is true  we used to think till within a very  few years past that at the bottom of the deep sea there were no living  thingsthat miles below the surface of the ocean in total darkness and  under such a weight of water as would crush us to a jelly there could be  nothing except stones and sand and mud  but now it is found out that  the bottom of the deepest seas and the utter darkness into which no ray  of light can ever pierce are alive and swarming with millions of  creatures as cunningly and exquisitely formed and in many cases as  brilliantly coloured as those which live in the sunlight along the  shallow shores  now my dear friendssurely beautiful things were made to be seen by  some one else why were they made beautiful  common sense tells us that   but who has seen those countless tribes which have been living down in  utter darkness since the making of the world  common sense i think  can give but one answergod  he and he only to whom the night is as  clear as the day to whom the darkness and the light are both alike  but  moregod has not only made things beautiful he has made things happy  whatever misery there may be in the world there is no denying that   however sorrow may have come into the world there is a great deal more  happiness than misery in it  misery is the exception happiness is the  rule  no rational man ever heard a bird sing without feeling that that  bird was happy and if so his common sense ought to tell him that if  god made that bird he made it to be happy he intended it to be happy  and he takes pleasure in its happiness though no human ear should ever  hear its song no human heart should ever share in its joy  yes the  world was not made for man but man like all the world was made for  god  not for mans pleasure merely not for mans use but for gods  pleasure all things are and for gods pleasure they were created  and now surely common sense will tell us why god made all things  for  his own pleasure  god is pleased to make them and pleased with what he  has made because what he has made is worth being pleased with  he has  seen all things that he has made and behold they are very good and  right and wise and beautiful and happy each after its kind  so that  as the psalmist says the lord shall rejoice in his works  and  scripture tells that it must be so if we only recollect and believe one  word of st johns that god is lovefor it is the very essence of  love that it cannot be content to love itself  it must have something  which is not itself to love that it may go out of itself and forget  itself and spend itself in the good and in the happiness of what it  loves  all true love of husband and wife mother and child sister and  brother friend and friend man to his countrywhat does it mean but  this  forgetting ones selfish happiness in doing good to others and  finding a deeper higher happiness in that  the man who only loves  himself knows not what love means  in truth he does not even love  himself  he is his own worst enemy  his selfishness torments him with  discontent disgust pride fear and all evil passions and lusts and in  him is fulfilled our lords saying that he that will save his life shall  lose it  but the man who is full of love as god is full of love who  forgets himself in making others happy who lives the eternal life of  god which is alone worth living he is the only truly happy man and in  him is fulfilled that other saying of our lord that he who loseth his  life shall save it  and the loving unselfish man too is the only sound theologian for he  who dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him  he alone will  understand the mystery of who god is and why he made all things  the  loving man alone i say will understand the mysteryhow because god is  love he could not live alone in the abyss but must create all things  all worlds and heavens yea and the heaven of heavens that he might  have something beside himself whereon to spend his boundless love  and  why  because love can only love what is somewhat like itself he made  all things according to the idea of his own eternal mind  because he is  unchangeable and a god of order and of law he made all things according  to one order and gave them a law which cannot be broken that they might  continue this day as they were at the beginning serving him and  fulfilling his word  because he is a god of justice he made all things  just depending on each other helping each other and compelled to  sacrifice themselves for each other and minister to each other whether  they will or not  because he is a god of beauty he made all things  beautiful of a variety and a richness unspeakable that he might rejoice  in all his works and find a divine delight in every moss which grows  upon the moor and every gnat which dances in the sun  because he is a  god of love he gave to every creature a power of happiness according to  its kind that he might rejoice in the happiness of his creatures  and  lastly because god is a spirita moral and a rational beingtherefore  he created rational beings to be more like him than any other creatures  and constituted the services of men and angels in a most wonderful order  that they might reverence law as he does and justice as he doesthat  they might love to be loving as he loves and to be useful as he is  usefulthat they might rejoice in the beauty of his works as he rejoices  in them himself and catching from time to time fuller and fuller  glimpses of that divine and wonderful order according to which he has  made all things and all worlds may see more and more clearly as the  years roll on that all things are just and beautiful and good and  join more and more heartily in the hymn which goes up for ever from every  sun and star and world and from the tiniest creature in these worlds   thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honour and power for thou  hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created  now to god the father who out of his boundless love ordains the  making of all things and to god the son who out of his boundless love  performs the making of all things and to god the holy spirit who out  of his boundless love breathes law and kind life and growth into all  things three persons in one everblessed trinity be all glory and  honour and praise for ever and ever  amen    sermon xvi  the glory of the trinity    eversley 1868  st marys chester 1871  trinity sunday  psalm civ 31 33  the glory of the lord shall endure for ever  the  lord shall rejoice in his works  i will sing unto the lord as long as i  live  i will sing praise to my god while i have my being  this is trinity sunday on which we think especially of the name of god   a day which to a wise man may well be one of the most solemn and the  most humiliating days of the whole year  for is it not humiliating to  look stedfastly even for a moment at gods greatness and then at our  own littleness at gods strength and at our own weakness at gods  wisdom and at our own ignorance and most of all at gods  righteousness and at our own sins  i do not say that it should not be so  rather i say it should be so   for what is more wholesome for you and me and any man than to be  humiliatedhumbledand brought to our own levelthat all may see who  what and where we are  what more wholesome than to be made holy and  humble men of heart  what more wholesome for us who are each of us  tempted to behave as if we were the centre of the universe to judge  ourselves the most important personages in the world and to judge of  everything according as it is pleasant or unpleasant to us each in our  own family our own sect our own neighbourhood what more wholesome than  to be brought now and then face to face with god himself and see what  poor little contemptible atoms we are at best compared with him who  made heaven and earthto see how well god and gods world have gone on  for thousands of years without our helphow well they will go on after  we are dead and gone  face to face with god  and how far shall we have to go to find ourselves  face to face with god  not very far according to st paul  god he  says is not far from every one of us for in him we live and move and  have our being  in god in the ever blessed trinityfather son and holy ghostwe and  not we only but every living thingeach flower each insectlives and  moves and has its being  so it isstrange as it may seem and we  cannot make it otherwise  you fancy god far offsomewhere in the skies  beyond suns and stars  know that the heavens and the heaven of heavens  cannot contain him  rather in the very deepest sense he contains them   in god suns and stars and all the host of heaven live and move and  have their being and if god destroyed them all at this very moment and  the whole universe became nothing once more as it was nothing at first  still god would remain neither greater nor less neither stronger nor  weaker neither richer nor poorer than he was before  for he is the  selfexistent i am who needs nought save himself and who needs nought  save to assert himself in his word jesus christ our lord and say i  am in order to create all things and beings save himself  he is the  infinite whom nothing however huge and vast or strong can  comprehendthat is take in and limit  he takes in and limits all  things giving to each thing form according to its own kind and life  and growth according to its own law appointing to all as says st paul  their times and the bounds of their habitation that if they be rational  creatures as we are they may feel after the lord and find him and if  they be irrational creatures like the animals and the plants mountains  and streams clouds and tempests sun and stars they may serve gods  gracious purposes in the economy of his world  therefore everything which you see is as it were a thought of gods  an action of gods a message to you from god  therefore you can look at  nothing in the earth without seeing god himself at work thereon  as our  lord said my father worketh hitherto and i work  you can look  neither at the sun in the sky nor at the grass beneath your feet  without being brought face to face with god the ever blessed trinity   the tiniest gnat which dances in the sun was conceived by god the  father in whose eternal bosom are the ideas and patterns of all things  past present and to come it was created by god the son by whom the  father made all things and without whom nothing is made  and it is kept  alive by god the holy spirit the lord and giver of life of whom it is  written thou sendest forth thy spirit they are created and thou  renewest the face of the earth  oh that we could all remember this  that when we walk across the field  or look out into the garden we could have the wisdom to remember  whither o god can i go from thy presence  for thou art looking down on  the opening of every bud and flower and without thee not a sparrow falls  to the ground  whither can i flee from thy spirit  for thy spirit is  giving life perpetually alike to me and to the insect at my feet  without thy spirit my lungs could not breathe one breath my heart could  not beat one pulse  in thee i and all things live move and have our  being  and shall i forget thee disobey thee neglect to praise and  honour and worship thee and thank thee day and night for thy great  glory  if we could but remember that there would be no fear of our being  ungodly irreligious undevout  we look too often day after day month  after month on the world around us just as the dumb beasts do as a  place out of which we can get something to eat and forget that it is  also a place out of which we can get daily and hourly something to  admire to adore to worship even the thought of gods wisdom gods  power gods goodness gods glory  oh blind and heedless that we are   truly said the wise manan undevout astronomer is mad  and truly said  another wise man an englishmanthe saintly philosopher faraday now  with godhow could he be otherwise than religious when at every step  he found himself brought more closely face to face with the signs of a  mind constructed like his own with an aim and a purpose which he could  understand employing ways and means and tending clearly to an end and  methodically following out a system which he could both perceive and  grasp  such a mans whole life is one act of reverence to that god in  whose inner presence he finds himself illuminated and strengthened and  if there be revelation of divine things on earth it is when the hidden  secrets of nature are disclosed to the sincere and selfdenying seeker  after truth  yes that is true  the more you look into the world around you and  consider every flower and bird and stone the more you will see that a  mind planned them even the mind of god a mind like yours and mine but  how infinitely different how much deeper wiser vaster  before that  thought we shrink into the nothingness from whence he called us out at  first  the difference between our minds and the mind of god isto what  shall i liken it  say to the difference between a flake of soot and a  mountain of pure diamond  that soot and that diamond are actually the  same substance of that there is no doubt whatsoever but as the light  dirty almost useless soot is to the pure and clear hard diamond ay  to a mountain a world a whole universe made of pure diamondif such a  thing were possibleso is the mind of man compared with that mind of the  ever blessed trinity which made the worlds and sustains them in life  and order to this day  my friends it is not in great things only but in the very smallest  that the greatest glory of the ever blessed trinity is seen  ay most  perhaps in the smallest when one considers the utterly inconceivable  wisdom which can make the smallest animalso made as to be almost  invisible under the strongest microscopeas perfect in all its organs as  the hugest elephant  ay more which can not only make these tiny living  things but more wonderful still make them make themselves  for what  is growth but a thing making itself  what is the seed growing into a  plant the plant into a flower the flower to a seed again but that  thing making itself transforming itself by an inward law of life which  gods spirit gives it  i tell you the more earnestly and carefully you  examine into the creation birth growth of any living thing even of the  daisy on the grass outside the more you inquire what it really is how  it came to be like what it is how it got where it is and so forth you  will be led away into questions which may well make you dizzy with  thinking so strange so vast so truly miraculous is the history of  every organised creature upon earth  and when you recollect as you are  bound to do on this day that each of these things is the work of the  ever blessed trinity that upon every flower and every insect generation  after generation of them since the world was made the ever blessed  trinity has been at work god the father thinking and conceiving each  thing in his eternal mind god the son creating it and putting it into  the world each thing according to the law of its life god the holy  ghost inspiring it with life and law that it may grow and thrive after  its kindwhen such thoughts as these crowd upon you and they ought to  crowd upon you this day of all the year at sight of the meanest insect  under your feet then what can a rational man do but bow his head and  worship in awful silence adoring humbly him who sits upon the throne of  the universe and who says to us in all his works even as he said to job  of old where wast thou when i laid the foundations of the earth  when  the morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy   hast thou entered into the springs of the sea or hast thou seen the  doors of the shadow of death  knowest thou the ordinances of heaven   canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds that abundance of waters may  cover thee  canst thou send lightnings that they may go and say unto  thee here we are  wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion or fill the  appetite of the young lions  gavest thou the goodly wings unto the  peacocks or wings and feathers unto the ostrich  hast thou given the  horse strength hast thou clothed his neck with thunder  doth the hawk  fly by thy wisdom doth the eagle mount up at thy command  when god speaks thus to usand he does thus speak to us by every cloud  and shower and by every lightning flash and ray of sunshine and by  every living thing which flies in air or swims in water or creeps upon  the earthwhat can we say save what job saidbehold i am vile what  shall i answer thee  i will lay mine hand upon my mouth  but if god be so awful in the material world of which our five senses  tell us how much more awful is he in that spiritual and moral world of  which our senses tell us nought  that unseen world of justice and  truthfulness of honour and duty of reverence and loyalty of love and  charity of purity and selfsacrifice that spiritual world i say which  can be only seen by the spiritual eye of the soul and felt by the  spiritual heart of the soul  how awful is god in that eternal world of  right and wrong wherein cherubim seraphim angel and archangel cry to  him for ever not merely mighty mighty mighty but holy holy holy   how awful to poor creatures like us  for then comes in the questionnot  merely is god good but am not i bad  is god sinless but am not i a  sinner  is god pure but am not i impure  is god wise then am not i a  fool  and when once that thought has crossed our minds must we not  tremble must we not say with isaiah of old woe is me for i am undone  because i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people  of unclean lips  for mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts  yes awful as is the thought of gods perfection in the material world  about us more awful still is the thought of his perfection in the  spiritual world  so awful that we might well be overwhelmed with dread  and horror at the sight of gods righteousness and our sinfulness were  it not for the gracious message of revelation that tells us that god  the father of heaven is our father likewise who so loved us that he  gave for us his only begotten god the son that for his sake our sins  might be freely forgiven us that god the son is our atonement our  redeemer our king our intercessor our example our saviour in life and  death and god the holy ghost our comforter our guide our inspirer  who will give to our souls the eternal life which will never perish even  as he gives to our bodies the mortal life which must perish  on the mercy and the love of the ever blessed trinity shown forth in  christ upon his cross we can cast ourselves with all our sins we can  cry to him and not in vain for forgiveness and for sanctification for  a clean heart and a right spirit and that we may become holy and humble  men of heart  we can join our feeble praises to that hymn of praise  which goes up for ever to god from suns and stars clouds and showers  beasts and birds and every living thing giving him thanks for ever for  his great glory  o all ye works of the lord bless ye the lord praise  him and magnify him for ever  o ye holy and humble men of heart bless  ye the lord praise him and magnify him for ever    sermon xvii  love of god and man    first sunday after trinity  eversley  chester cathedral 1872  1 john iv 16 21  god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth  in god and god in him     and this commandment have we from him  that he who loveth god love his brother also  this is the first sunday after trinity  on it the church begins to teach  us moralsthat is how to live a good life and therefore she begins by  teaching us the foundation of all moralswhich is lovelove to god  and love to man  but which is to come firstlove to god or love to man  on this point men in different ages have differed and will differ to the  end  one party has said you must love god first and let love to man  come after as it can and others have contradicted that and said you  must love all mankind and let love to god take its chance  but st john  says neither of the two is before or after the other you cannot truly  love god without loving man or love man without loving god  st john  says so being full of the spirit of god  but alas men who are not  full of the spirit of god but only let themselves be taught by him now  and then and here and there have found it very difficult to understand  st john and still more difficult to obey him and therefore there always  have been in gods church these two parties one saying you must love  god first and the other you must love your neighbour firstand each  of course quoting scripture to prove that they are in the right  the great leader of the first partyperhaps the founder of it as far as  i am awarewas the famous st augustine  he first taught christians that  they ought to love god with the same passionate affection with which they  love husband or wife mother or child and to use towards god the same  words of affection which those who love really utter one to each other   i will not say much of that still less will i mention any of the words  which good men and women who are of that way of thinking use towards god   i should be sorry to hold up such language to blame even if i do not  agree with it and still more sorry to hold it up to ridicule from  vulgarminded persons if there be any in this church  all i say is that  all which has been written since about this passionate and rapturous love  toward god by the old monks and nuns and by the protestant pietists  both english and foreign is all in st augustine better said than it ever  has been since  some of the pietist hymns as we know are very  beautiful but there are things in them which one wishes left out which  seem or ought to seem irreverent when used toward god which hurt or  ought to hurt our plain cool honest english commonsense  a true  englishman does not like to say more than he feels and the more he  feels the more he likes to keep it to himself instead of parading it  and talking of it before men  still waters run deep he holds and he is  right for himself only he must not judge others or think that because  he cannot speak to god in such passionate language as st augustine who  was an african a southern man with much stronger feelings than we  englishmen usually have that therefore st augustine or those who copy  him now do not really feel what they say  but nevertheless plain  commonsense people such as most englishmen are are afraid of this  enthusiastical religion  they say we do not pretend to feel this  rapturous love to god how muchsoever we may reverence him and wish to  keep his commandments and we do not desire to feel it  for we see that  people who have talked in this way about god have been almost always  monks and nuns or brainsick disappointed persons who have no natural  and wholesome bent for their affections  and even though this kind of  religion may be very well for them it is not the religion for a plain  honest man who has a wife and family and his bread to earn in the world  and has children to provide for and his duty to do in the state as well  as in the church  and more they say these enthusiastic rapturous  feelings do not seem to make people better and more charitable and more  loving  some really good and charitable people say that they have these  feelings but for all that we can see they would be just as good and  charitable without the feelings while most persons who take up with this  sort of religion are not the better for it  they do not control their  tempers they can be fullas they sayof love and devotion to god one  minute but why are they the next minute peevish proud selfwilled  harsh and cruel to those who differ from them  their religion does not  make them love their neighbours  in old times when persecution was  allowed it made them or at least allowed them to persecute torment  and kill their neighbours and fancy that by such conduct they did god  service and now it tempts them to despise their neighboursto look on  every one who has not these strange intense feelings which they say they  have as unconverted and lost and doomed to everlasting destruction   not says the plain man that we are more satisfied with the mere  philanthropist of modern timesthe man who professes to love the whole  human race without loving god or indeed often believing that there is a  god to love  to us he seems as unloving a person as the mere fanatic   meanwhile plain people say we will have nothing to do with either  fanaticism or philanthropywe will try to do our duty where god has put  us and to behave justly and charitably by our neighbours but beyond  that we cannot go  we will not pretend to what we do not feel  my friends there is as usual truth on both sidesboth are partly  right and both are partly wrong  and both may go on arguing against  each other and quoting texts of scripture against each other till the  last day if they will not listen to st johns message in the text  one  party will say it is written thou shalt love the lord thy god with all  thy heart and soul and strength and mind and if thou doest that and  thy soul is filled with love for the creator thou canst have no love  left for the creature or if thy heart is filled with love for the  creature there is no room left for love to god  and then thou wilt find  that god is a jealous god and will take from thee what thou lovest  because he will not have his honour given to another  and to that the other party will answer has not god said thou shalt  love thy neighbour as thyself  has he not commanded us to love our  wives our children  and even if he had not would not common sense tell  us that he intended us to do so  do you think that god is a tempter and  a deceiver  he has given us feelings and powers  has he not meant us to  use them  he has given us wife and child  did he mean us not to love  them after he has made us love them we know not how or why  you say  that god is a jealous god  yes jealous he may be of our worshipping  false gods and idols saints or anything or person save himself jealous of our doing wrong and ruining ourselves and wandering out of  the path of his commandments in which alone is life but jealous of our  loving our fellow creature as well as himself never  that sort of  jealousy is a base and wicked passion in man and dare we attribute it to  god  what a thing to say of the loving god that he takes away peoples  children husbands and friends because they love them too much  then the first party will say but is it not written love not the  world neither the things that are in the world  if any man love the  world the love of the father is not in him  and to that the second  party will answer and do you say that we are not to love this fair and  wonderful earth which god has made for our use and put us into it  why  did he make it lovely  why did he put us into it if he did not mean us  to enjoy it  that is contrary to common sense and contrary to the whole  teaching of the old testament  but if by the world you mean the world of  man the society in which we livedare you compare a christian and  civilized country like england with that detestable roman world sunk in  all abominable vices against which st john and st paul prophesied  are  not such thoughts unjust and uncharitable to your neighbours to your  country to all mankind  then the first party will say but you do away  with all devoutness and the second party will answer and you do away  with all morality for you tell people that the only way to please god is  to feel about him in a way which not one person in a thousand can feel  and therefore what will come and does come of your binding heavy  burdens and grievous to be borne and laying them on mens shoulders is  thisthat the generality of people will care nothing about being good  or doing right because you teach them that it will not please god and  will leave all religion to a few who have these peculiar fancies and  feelings  and so they may argue on for ever unless they will take honestly the  plain words of st john and see that to love their neighbour is to love  god and to love god is to love their neighbour  so says st john clearly  enough twice over  god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth  in god and god in him  the two things are one and the one cannot be  without the other  does this seem strange to you  oh my friends it need not seem strange  if you will but consider who god is and who man is  thou lovest god   then if thou lovest him thou must needs love all that he has made  and  what has he made  all things except sin and what sin is he has told  thee  he has given thee ten commandments and let no man give thee an  eleventh commandment out of his own conceit and will worship calling  unclean what god hath made clean and cursing what god hath blessed   thou lovest god  then thou lovest all that is good for god is good and  from him all good things come  but what is good  all is good except  sin for it is written god saw every thing that he had made and  behold it was very good  therefore if thou lovest god thou must love  all things for all things are of him and by him and through him and  in him all live and move and have their being  then thou wilt truly love  god  thou wilt be content with god and so thy love will cast out fear   thou wilt trust god thou wilt have the mind of god thou wilt be  satisfied with gods working from the rise and fall of great nations to  the life and death of the smallest gnat which dances in the sun thou  wilt say for ever and concerning all things i know in whom i have  believed  it is the good lord let him do what seemeth him good  again  thou lovest thy neighbour thou lovest wife and child thou  lovest thy friends thou lovest or wishest to love all men and to do  them good  then thou lovest god  for what is it that thou lovest in thy  neighbour  not that which is bad in him  no but that which is good   thou lovest him for his kindliness his honesty his helpfulnessfor  some good quality in him  but from whom does that good come save from  christ and from the spirit of christ from whom alone come all good  gifts  yes if you will receive itwhen we love our neighbours it is  god in them christ in them whom we lovechrist in them the hope of  glory  what some one will ask when a man loves a fair face does he love  christ then  ah my friends that is not true love as all know well  enough if they will let their own hearts tell them truth  true love is  when two people love each other for the goodness which is in them  true  love is the love which endures after beauty has faded and youth and  health and all that seems to make life worth having is gone  have we  not seen ere now two old people worn crippled diseased yet living on  together helping each other nursing each other tottering on hand in  hand to the grave dying perhaps almost togetherbecause neither  cared to live when the other is gone before and loving all the while as  truly and tenderly as in the days of youth  they know not why  no but  god knows why  it is christ in each other whom they lovechrist the  hope of glory  yes we have seen that surely and seen in it one of the  most beautiful the most divine sights upon earthone which should  teach us if we will look at it aright that when we love our neighbour  truly it is the divine part in him the spark of eternal goodness in  himwhat st paul says is christ in himwhich we admire and cling to  and love  but by that rule we cannot love every one for every one is not good  be  not too sure of that  all are not good alas but in all there is some  good  it may be a very littlea hope of glory in them even though  that hope be very faint  it may be dying out it may die altogether and  their souls may become utterly base and evil and be lost for ever   still while there is life there is hope even for the worst and just as  far as our hearts are full of the spirit of god we shall see the spirit  of god striving with the souls even of the worst men and love them for  that  just as far as we have the likeness of christ in us we shall be  quick to catch the least gleam of his likeness in our neighbours and  love them for that  just as far as our hearts are full of love we shall  see something worth loving in every human being we meet and love them  for that  i know it is difficult  it is not gotten in a day that wide  and deep spirit of love to all mankind which st paul had which made him  weep with those who wept and rejoice with those who rejoiced and become  all things to all men if by any means he might save some  before our  eyes are cleansed and purged to see some trace of good in every man our  hearts must be cleansed and purged from all selfishness and bigotry and  pride and fancifulness and anger so that they may be filled with the  loving spirit of god  as long as a taint of selfishness or pride remains  in us we shall be in continual danger of hating those whom god does not  hate despising those whom god does not despise and condemning those  whom god does not condemn  but if self is cast out of us and the spirit  of god and of christ enthroned in our hearts then we shall love our  brother and in loving him love god who made him and so dwelling in  love we shall dwell in god and god in usto which true and only  everlasting life may he of his mercy bring us either in this world or in  the world to come  amen    sermon xviii  courage    chester cathedral 1871  acts iv 13 1820  now when they saw the boldness of peter and john  and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marvelled  and they took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus      and they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in  the name of jesus  but peter and john answered and said unto them  whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than  unto god judge ye  for we cannot but speak the things which we have  seen and heard  last thursday was st peters day  the congregation on that day was as  far as i could perceive no larger than usual and this is not a matter  of surprise  since we gave up at the reformation the superstitious  practice of praying to the saints saints days have sunkand indeed  sunk too muchinto neglect  for most mens religion has a touch of  selfinterest in it and therefore when people discovered that they could  get nothing out of st peter or st john by praying to them they began to  forget the very memory many of them of st peter st john and other  saints and apostles  they forget too often still that though praying  to any saint or angel or other created being is contrary both to  reason and to scripture yet it is according to reason and to scripture  to commemorate them  that is to remember them to study their  characters and to thank god for themboth for the virtues which he  bestowed on them and the example which he has given us in them  for these old saints lived and died for our example  they are next of  course to the lord himself the ideals the patterns of christian life the primeval heroes of our holy faith  they shew to us of what stuff the  early christians were made what sort of stoneto use st pauls own  figurethe lord chose wherewith to build up his church  they are our  spiritual ancestors for they spread the gospel into all lands and they  spread it remember always not only by preaching what they knew but by  being what they were  their characters their personal histories are as  important to us as their writings nay in the case of st peter even  more important  for if these two epistles of his had been lost and  never handed down to us st peter himself would have remained as he is  drawn in the gospels and the acts a grand and colossal human figure  every line and feature of which is full of meaning and full of teaching  to us  now i think that the qualitythe grace of godwhich st peters  character and story specially force on our notice is the true courage  which comes by faith  i say the courage which comes by faith  there is  a courage which does not come by faith  there is brute courage which  comes from hardness of heart from stupidity obstinacy or anger which  does not see danger or does not feel pain  that is the courage of the  brute  one does not blame it or call it wrong  it is good in its  place as all natural things are which god has made  it is good enough  for the brutes but it is not good enough for man  you cannot trust it  in man  and the more a man is what a man should be the less he can  trust it  the more mind and understanding a man has so as to be able to  foresee danger and measure it the more chance there is of his brute  courage giving way  the more feeling a man has the more keenly he feels  pain of body or pain of mind such as shame loneliness the dislike  ridicule and contempt of his fellow men in a word the more of a man he  is and the less of a mere brute the more chance there is of his brute  courage breaking down just when he wants it most to keep him up by  leaving him to play the coward and come to shame  yes  to go through  with a difficult and dangerous undertaking a man wants more than brute  courage  he wants spiritual couragethe courage which comes by faith   he needs to have faith in what he is doing to be certain that he is  doing his duty to be certain that he is in the right  certain that  right will conquer certain that god will make it conquer by him or by  some one else certain that he will either conquer honourably or fail  honourably for god is with him  in a word to have true courage man  needs faith in god  to give one example  look at the class of men who in all england  undergo the most fearful dangers who know not at what hour of any night  they may not be called up to the most serious labour and responsibility  with the chance of a horrible and torturing death  i mean the firemen of  our great cities than whom there are no steadier braver noblerhearted  men  not a week passes without one or more of these firemen in trying  to save life and property doing things which are altogether heroic   what do you fancy keeps them up to their work  high pay  the amusement  and excitement of fires  the vanity of being praised for their courage   my friends those would be but paltry weak motives which would not keep  a mans heart calm and his head clear under such responsibility and  danger as theirs  no  it is the sense of dutythe knowledge that they  are doing a good and a noble work in saving the lives of human beings and  the wealth of the nationthe knowledge that they are in gods hands  and that no real evil can happen to him who is doing rightthat to him  even death at his post is not a loss but a gain  in short faith in  god more or less clear is what gives those men their strong and quiet  courage  god grant that you and i if ever we have dangerous work to do  may get true courage from the same fountain of ghostly strength  now st peters history is i think a special example of this  he was  naturally it seems a daring mana man of great brute courage  so far  so good but he had to be taught by severe lessons that his brute  courage was not enoughthat he wanted spiritual courage the courage  which came by faith and that if that failed him the brute courage would  fail too  he throws himself into the lake to walk upon the water to christ and as  soon as he is afraid he begins to sink  the lord saves him and tells  him why he had sank  because he had doubted his faith had failed him   so he found out the weakness of courage without faith  then again he  tells our lord though all men shall be offended of thee yet will i  never be offended  i am ready to go with thee both into prison and to  death  and shortly after his mere animal courage breaks out again and  does what little it can do and little enough  he draws sword single handed on the soldiers in the garden and cuts down a servant of the  high priests and perhaps would have flung his life away desperately  and uselessly had not our lord restrained him  but when the fit of  excitement is past his animal courage deserts him and his moral courage  too and he denies his lord  so he found out that he was like too many full of bodily courage perhaps but morally weak  he had to undergo a  great change  he had to be converted by the holy spirit of god and  strengthened by that spirit to have a boldness which no worldly courage  can give  then when he was strong himself he was able to strengthen  his brethren  then he was able ignorant and unlearned man as he was to  stand up before the high priests and rulers of his nation and to say  simply and firmly without boasting without defiance whether it be  right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god judge  ye  for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard   yes my friends it is the courage which comes by faith which makes truly  brave menmen like st peter and st john  he who can say i am right  can say likewise god is on my side and i will not fear what man can do  to me  we will not fear said the psalmist though the earth be removed and  though the hills be carried into the midst of the sea  the just man  who holds firm to his purpose says a wise old heathen he will not be  shaken from his solid mind by the rage of the mob bidding him do base  things or the frowns of the tyrant who persecutes him  though the world  were to crumble to pieces round him its ruins would strike him without  making him tremble  whether it be right said peter and john to the  great men and judges of the jews to hearken to god more than to you  judge ye  we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard   we cannot but speak what we know to be true  it was that courage which enabled our forefathersand not the great men  among them not the rich not even the learned save a few valiant  bishops and clergy but for the most part poor unlearned labouring men  and womento throw off the yoke of popery and say reason and  scripture tell us that it is absurd and wrong to worship images and pray  to saintstell us that your doctrines are not true  and we will say so  in spite of the pope and all his powerin spite of torture and a fiery  death  we cannot palter we cannot dissemble we cannot shelter  ourselves under halftruths and make a covenant with lies whether it  be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than to god judge  ye  we cannot but speak the things which we know to be true  so it has been in all ages and so it will be for ever  faith the  certainty that a man is right will give him a courage which will enable  him to resist if need be the rich ones the strong ones the learned  ones of the earth  it has made poor unlearned men heroes and deliverers  of their countrymen from slavery and ignorance  it has made weak women  martyrs and saints  it has enabled men who made great discoveries to  face unbelief ridicule neglect poverty knowing that their worth would  be acknowledged at last their names honoured at last as benefactors by  the very men who laughed at them and reviled them  it has made men shut  up in prison for long weary years for doing what was right and saying  what was true endure manfully for the sake of some good cause and say       stone walls do not a prison make    nor iron bars a cage minds innocent and quiet take    that for an hermitage if i have freedom in my thought    and in my love am free angels alone that soar above    enjoy such liberty   yes settle it in your hearts all of you  there is but one thing which  you have to fear in earth or heavenbeing untrue to your better selves  and therefore untrue to god  if you will not do the thing you know to be  right and say the thing you know to be true then indeed you are weak   you are a coward and sin against god and suffer the penalty of your  cowardice  you desert god and therefore you cannot expect him to stand  by you  but if you will do the thing you know to be right and say the thing you  know to be true then what can harm you  who will harm you asks st  peter himself if you be followers of that which is good  for the eyes  of the lord are over the righteous and his ears are open to their  prayers  but if ye suffer for righteousness sake happy are ye and be  not afraid of those who try to terrify you neither be troubled but  sanctify the lord god in your hearts  remember that he is just and holy  and a rewarder of all who diligently seek him  worship him in your  hearts and all will be well  for says david again lord who shall  dwell in thy tabernacle or who shall rest upon thy holy hill  even he  that leadeth an uncorrupt life and doeth the thing which is right and  speaketh the truth from his heart  whoso doeth these things shall never  fall  yes my friends there is a tabernacle of god in which even in this  life he will hide us from the strife of tongues  there is a hill of god  on which even in the midst of labour and anxiety we may rest both day  and night  even jesus christ the rock of ageshe who is the  righteousness itself the truth itself and whosoever does righteousness  and speaks truth dwells in christ in this life as well as in the life to  come and christ will strengthen him by his holy spirit to stand in the  evil day if it shall come and having done all to stand  my dear  friends if any of you are minded to be good men and women pray for the  holy spirit of god  first for the spirit of love to give you good  desires then the spirit of faith to make you believe deeply in the  living god who rewards every man according to his work and then for the  spirit of strength to enable you to bring these desires to good effect  pray for that spirit i say for we all need help  there are too many  people in the worldtoo many perhaps among us herewho are not what  they ought to be and what they really wish to be because they are weak   they see what is right and admire it but they have not courage or  determination to do it  most sad and pitiable it is to see how much  weakness of heart there is in the worldhow little true moral courage   i suppose that the reason is that there is so little faith that people  do not believe heartily and deeply enough in the absolute necessity of  doing right and being honest  they do not believe heartily and deeply  enough in god to trust him to defend and reward them if they will but be  true to him and to themselves  and therefore they have no moral  courage  they are weak  they are kind perhaps and easy easily led  right but alas just as easily led wrong  their good resolutions are  not carried out their right doctrines not acted up to and they live  pitiful confused useless inconsistent lives talking about religion  and yet denying the power of religion in their daily lives playing with  holy and noble thoughts and feelings without giving themselves up to  them in earnest to be led by the spirit of god to do all the good works  which god has prepared for them to walk in  pray all of you then for  the spirit of faith to believe really in god and for the spirit of  ghostly strength to obey god honestly  no man ever asked earnestly for  that spirit but what he gained it at last  and no man ever gained it but  what he found the truth of st peters own words who will harm you if ye  be followers of that which is good    sermon xix  good days    eversley 1867  westminster sept 27 1872  1 peter iii 812  be ye all of one mind having compassion one of  another love as brethren be pitiful be courteous  not rendering evil  for evil or railing for railing  but contrariwise blessing knowing  that ye are thereunto called that ye should inherit a blessing  for he  that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from  evil and his lips that they speak no guile  let him eschew evil and do  good let him seek peace and ensue it  for the eyes of the lord are  over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers  but the  face of the lord is against them that do evil  this is one of the texts which is apt to puzzle people who do not read  their bibles carefully enough  they cannot see what the latter part of  it has to do with the former  st peter says that we christians are called that we should inherit a  blessing  that means of course they say the blessing of salvation  everlasting life in heaven  but then st peter quotes from the 34th  psalm  for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain  his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile  now that  psalm they say speaks of blessing and happiness in this life  then why  does st peter give it as a reason for expecting blessing and happiness  in the life to come  and then they say to make it fit in it must be  understood spiritually and what they mean by that i do not clearly  know  their notion is that the promises of the old testament are more or less  carnal because they speak of gods rewarding men in this life and that  the promises of the new testament are spiritual because they speak of  gods rewarding men in the next life and what they mean by that again  i do not clearly know  for is not the old testament spiritual as well as the new  i trust so  my friends  is not the old testament inspired and that by the spirit of  god and if it be inspired by the spirit what can it be but spiritual   therefore if we want to find the spiritual meaning of old testament  promises we need not to alter them to suit any fancies of our own like  those monks of the fourth and succeeding centuries who saw no sanctity  in family or national life no sanctity in the natural world and  therefore were forced to travesty the hebrew historians psalmists and  prophets with all their simple healthy objective humanity and  politics and poetry into metaphorical and subjective or as they  miscalled them spiritual meanings to make the old testament mean  anything at all  no if we have any real reverence for the holy  scriptures we must take them word for word in their plain meaning and  find the message of gods spirit in that plain meaning instead of trying  to put it in for ourselves  therefore it is that the vii article bids  us beware of playing with scripture in this way  it says the old  testament is not contrary to the new for both in the old and new  testament everlasting life is offered to mankind by christ  wherefore  they are not to be heard who feign that the old fathers did look only for  transitory promises that is temporary promises promises which would be  fulfilled only in this life and end and pass away when they died  but some one will say how can that be when so many of the old hebrews  seem to have known nothing about the next life  moses for instance  always promises the children of israel that if they do right and obey  god they shall be rewarded in this life with peace and prosperity  fruitfulness and wealth but of their being rewarded in the next life he  never says one wordwhich last statement is undeniably true  is not then the old testament contrary to the new if the old testament  teaches men to look for their reward in this life and the new testament  in the next  no it is not my friends  and i think we shall see that  it is not and why it is not if we will look honestly at this very  important text  if we do that we shall see that what st peter meant what the vii  article means is the only meaning which will make sense of  either one or the other is simply thisthat what causes a man to enjoy  this life is the same that will cause him to enjoy the life to come   that what will bring a blessing on him in this life will bring a  blessing on him in the life to come  that what blessed the old jews  will bless us christians  that if we refrain our tongue from evil and  our lips from speaking deceit it we avoid evil and do good if we seek  peace and follow earnestly after it then shall we enjoy life and see  good days and inherit a blessing whether in this life or in the life to  come  and why  because then we shall be living the one and only everlasting  life of goodness which alone brings blessings alone gives good days  and is the only life worth living whether in earth or heaven  my dear friends lay this seriously to heart in these days especially  when people and preachers alike have taken to part earth and heaven in a  fashion which we never find in holy scripture  lay it to heart i say  and believe that what is right and therefore good for the next life is  right and therefore good for this  that the next life is not contrary  to this life  that the same moral laws hold good in heaven as on earth   mark this well for it must be so if morality that is right and  goodness is of the eternal and immutable essence of god  and therefore  mark this well again there is but one true real and right life for  rational beings one only life worth living and worth living in this  world or in any other life past present or to come  and that is the  eternal life which was before all worlds and will be after all are  passed awayand that is neither more nor less than a good life a life  of good feelings good thoughts good words good deeds the life of  christ and of god  it is needful i say to bear this in mind just now  people are as i  told you too apt to say that the old testament saints got their rewards  in this life while we shall get them in the next  do they find that in  scripture  if they will read their bible they will find that the old  testament saints were men whom god was training and educating as he does  us by experience and by suffering  that david so far from having his  reward at once in this life had his bitter sorrows and trials that  moses isaiah jeremiah job all indeed of the old prophets had to be  made perfect by suffering and as st paul says died in faith not  having received the promises  so that if they had their reward in this  life it must have been a spiritual reward the reward of a good  conscience and of the favour of almighty god  and that is no transitory  or passing reward but enduring as immortality itself  but people do not  usually care for that spiritual reward  their notion of reward and  happiness is that they are to have all sorts of pleasures they know not  what and know not really why  and because they cannot get pleasant  things enough to satisfy them in this life they look forward greedily to  getting them in the next life and meanwhile are discontented with gods  providence and talk of gods good world as if some fiend and not the  lord jesus christ was the maker and ruler thereof  do not misunderstand  me  i am no optimist  i know well that things happen in this world  which must which ought to make us sadso sad that at moments we envy  the dead who are gone home to their rest real tragedies real griefs  divine and christlike griefs which only loving hearts knowthe  suffering of those we love the loss of those we love and last and  worst the sin of those we love  ah if any of those swords have pierced  the heart of any soul here shall i blame that man that woman if they  cry at times father take me home this earth is no place for me   shall i bid them do aught but cling to the feet of christ and cry if it  be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but  as thou wilt  oh not of such do i speak not of such sharers of  christs unselfish suffering here that they may be sharers of his  unselfish joy hereafter  not of them do i speak but of those who only  wish to make up for selfish discomforts and disappointments in this life  by selfish comforts and satisfaction in the next and who therefore take  up let me use the honest english word some maundering form of religion  which to judge from their own conduct they usually only half believe  those who seem on six days of the week as fond of finery and frivolity  as any other gay worldlings and on the seventh join eagerly in hymns in  which in one case at least they inform the almighty god of truth who  will not be mocked that they lie awake at night weeping because they  cannot die and see jerusalem the golden and so forth  or those  again who for six days in the week are absorbed in making money honestly if they can no doubt but still making money and living  luxuriously on their profitsand on the seventh listen with satisfaction  to preachers and hymns which tell them that this world is all a howling  wilderness full of snares and pitfalls and that in this wretched place  the christian can expect nothing but tribulation and persecution till he  crosses jordan and is landed safe on canaans store and so forth  my friends my friends as long as a man talks so blaspheming gods  worldwhich when he made it behold it was all very goodand laying  the blame of their own ignorance and peevishness on god who made them  they must expect nothing but tribulation and sorrow  but the tribulation  and the sorrow will be their own fault and not gods  if religious  professors will not take st peters advice and the psalmists advice if  they will go on coveting and scheming about money and how they may get  money if they will go on being neither pitiful courteous nor  forgiving and hating and maligning whether it be those who differ from  them in doctrine or those who they fancy have injured them or those who  merely are their rivals in the race of life then they are but too likely  to find this world a thorny place because they themselves raise the  thorns and a disorderly place because their own tempers and desires are  disorderly and a wilderness because they themselves have run wild  barbarians at heart however civilised in dress and outward manners  st  james tells them that of old  from whence he says come wars and  quarrels among you  come they not hence even of the lusts which war in  your members  you long and have not  you fight and war yet you have  not because you ask not  you ask and have not  you pray for this and  that and god does not give it you  because you ask amiss selfishly to  consume it on your lusts  and then you say this world is an evil  place full of temptations  what says st james to that  let no man  say when he is tempted i am tempted of god  for god cannot be tempted  with evil neither tempteth he any man  but every man is tempted when  he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed  so it was in the old testament times and so it is in these christian  times  god is good and gods world is good and the evil is not in the  world around us but in our own foolish hearts  if we follow our own  foolish hearts we shall find this world a bad place as the old jews  found itwhenever they went wrong and sinned against godbecause we are  breaking its laws and they will punish us  if we follow the  commandments of god we shall find this world a good place as the old  jews found itwhenever they went right and obeyed godbecause we shall  be obeying its laws and they will reward us  this is gods promise  alike to the old jewish fathers and to us christian men  and this is no  transitory or passing promise but is founded on the eternal and  everlasting law of right by which god has made all worlds and which he  himself cannot alter for it springs out of his own essence and his own  eternal being  hear then the conclusion of the whole matter  god hath  called you that you might inherit a blessing  he hath made you of a blessed race created in his own likeness to whom  he hath put all things in subjection making man a little lower than the  angels that he might crown him with glory and worship  a race so  precious in gods eyeswe know not whythat when mankind had fallen  and seemed ready to perish from their own sin and ignorance god spared  not his only begotten son but freely gave him for us that the world by  him might be saved  and god hath put you in a blessed place even his  wondrous and fruitful world which praises god day and night fulfilling  his word for it continues this day as in the beginning and he has given  it a law which cannot be broken  he has made you citizens of a blessed  kingdom even the kingdom of heaven into which you were baptised and  has given you the holy bible that you might learn the laws of the  kingdom and live for ever blessing and blest  and the head of this blessed race the maker of this blessed world the  king of this blessed kingdom is the most blessed of all beings jesus  christ the onlybegotten son both god and man  he has washed you  freely from your sins in his own blood he has poured out on you freely  his renewing spirit  and he asks you to enter into your inheritance  that you may love your life and see good days by living the blessed  life which is the life of selfsacrifice  but not such selfsacrifices  as too many have fancied who did not believe that mankind was a blessed  race and this earth a blessed place  he does not ask you to give up  wife child property or any of the good things of this life  he only  asks you to give up that selfishness which will prevent you enjoying  wife child or property or anything else in earth or in heaven either   he asks you not to give up anything which is around you for that which  cometh from without defileth not a man but to give up something which is  within you for that which cometh from within that defileth a man  he asks you to give up selfishness and all the evil tempers which that  selfishness breeds  to give up the tongue which speaks evil of your  fellowmen and the lips which utter deceit and the brain which imagines  cunning and the heart which quarrels with your neighbour  to give these  up and to seek peace and pursue it by all means reasonable or  honourable peace with all around you which comes by having first peace  with god next peace with your own conscience  this is the peace which  passeth understanding for if you have it men will not be able to  understand why you have it  they will see you at peace when men admire  you and praise you and at peace also when they insult you and injure  you at peace when you are prosperous and thriving and at peace also  when you are poor and desolate  and that inward peace of yours will pass  their understanding as it will pass your own understanding also  you  will know that god sends you the peace and sends it you the more the  more you pray for it  but how he sends it you will not understand for  it springs out of those inner depths of your being which are beyond the  narrow range of consciousness and is spiritual and a mystery and comes  by the inspiration of the holy spirit of god  but remember that all your prayers will not get that peace if your heart  be tainted with malice and selfishness and covetousness falsehood and  pride and vanity  you must ask god first to root those foul seeds out of  your heart or the seed of his spirit will not spring up and bear fruit  in you to the everlasting life of love and peace and joy in the holy  spirit  but if your heart be purged and cleansed of self then indeed  will the holy spirit enter in and dwell there and you will abide in  peace through all the chances and changes of this mortal life for you  will abide in god who is for ever at peace  and you will inherit a  blessing for you will inherit christ your light and your life who is  blessed for ever  and you will love life for life will be full to you  of hope of work of duty of interest of lessons without number  and  you will see good days for all days will seem good to you even those  which seem to the world bad days of affliction and distress  and so the  peace of god will keep you in jesus christ in this life and in the life  to come  amen    sermon xx  grace    eversley 1856  st john i 16 17  of his fulness have all we received and grace for  grace  for the law was given by moses but grace and truth came by jesus  christ  i wish you to mind particularly this word grace  you meet it very often  in the bible  you hear often said the grace of our lord jesus christ be  with you all  now what does this word grace mean  it is really worth  your while to know for if a man or a woman has not grace they will be  very unhappy people and very disagreeable people also a torment to  themselves and a torment to their neighbours also and if they live  without grace they will live but a poor life if they die without grace  they will come to a very bad end indeed  what then does this word  mean  some of you will answer that grace means gods holy spirit or  that it means what god gives to our souls by his spirit  but what does  that mean  what does gods spirit give us  what is the grace of jesus  christ like and how is it the same as the grace of gods spirit  now to know what grace means we must know what st john and st paul  meant by it and what the word meant in their time and what the  ephesians and corinthians and romans to whom they wrote would have  understood by this word grace  now these heathens to whom the apostles preached before they heard the  gospel knew that word grace very well indeed often used it and saw it  written up in their heathen temples all about them  and they meant by it  just what we mean when we talk of a graceful person or a graceful tree  or flower and what we mean too when we say that any one is gracious  that they do things gracefully and have a great deal of grace in their  way of speaking and behaving  we mean by that that they are handsome  agreeable amiable pleasant to look at and talk to and deal with  and  so these heathens meant before they were christians  the romans used to  talk about some one called a grace  the greeks called her charis which  is exactly the word which st john and st paul use and from it come our  words charity and charitable  but more they used to talk of three  graces  they fancied that they were goddessesspirits of some kind in  the shape of beautiful and amiable and innocent maidens who took  delight in going about the world and making people happy and amiable like  themselves and they used to make images of these graces and pray to  them to make them lovely and happy and agreeable  and painters and  statuaries too used to pray to these graces and ask them to put  beautiful fancies into their minds that they might be able to paint  beautiful pictures and carve beautiful statues  so when st paul or st  john talked to these heathens about grace or charis as the testament  calls it they knew quite well what the apostles meant  did the apostles then believe in these three goddesses  heaven forbid   they came to teach these heathens to turn from those very vanities and  worship the livinggod  and so they told themyou are quite right in  thinking that grace comes from heaven and is gods gift that it is god  who makes people amiable cheerful lovely and honourable that it is  god who gives happiness and all the joys of life  but which god  not  those three maidens they are but a dream and fancy  all that is lovely  and pleasant in men and womenand our life here and our everlasting  life after death in this world and in all worlds to comeall comes from  jesus christ and from him alone  god has gathered together all things in  him whether things in heaven or things on earth and he bestows  blessings and graces on all who will ask him to each as much as is good  for him  he is full of gracemore full of it than all the human beings  in the world put together  all the goodness and sweetness and all the  graciousness which you ever saw in all the men and women whom you ever  met all the goodness and sweetness which you ever fancied for  yourselves all put together is not to be compared to him  for he is the  perfect brightness of gods glory and the express image of gods person  and in him is gathered together all grace all goodness all which makes  men or angels good and lovely and loving  all is in him and he gives  it freely to all said the apostles we know that he speaks truth we  have seen him our eyes saw him our hands touched him and there was a  glory about him such as there never could be about any other person  a  glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth  a  person whom we could not help loving could not help admiring could not  help trusting could not help giving ourselves up toto live for him  and if need be die for him  and said the apostles there was a grace of truth in another of your  heathen fancies  you thought that these goddesses because they were  amiable and innocent themselves liked to make every one amiable  innocent and happy also  your conscience your reason were right there   that is the very nature of grace not to keep itself to itself but to  spend itself on every one round it and try to make every one like  itself  if a man be good he will long to make others good if tender  he will long to make others tender if gentle he will long to make  others gentle if cheerful he will long to make others cheerful if  forgiving he will long to make others forgiving if happy he will long  to make others happy  then said the apostles only believe that the lord  jesus christ just because he is full of grace wishes to fill you with  grace ten thousand times better grace than you ever fancied those false  goddesses could give youof his fulness you may all receive and grace  for grace  all the grace of this world comes from himhealth and  youth and happiness and all the innocent pleasures of life and he  delights in giving you them  but over and above that comes a deeper  and nobler gracespiritual grace the grace of the immortal soul which  will last on and make you loving and loveable pure and true gracious  and generous honourable and worthy of respect when the grace of the  body is gone and the eye is grown dim and the hair is grey and the  limbs feeble a grace which will make you gracious in old age gracious  in death gracious for ever and ever after the body has crumbled again  to its dust  whatsoever things are honourable lovely and of good  report whatsoever tempers of mind make you a comfort to yourselves and  all around you christ has them all and he can give you them all one  after the other till christ be formed in you till you come to be  perfect men and women to the measure of the stature of the fulness of  christ  come then boldly to his throne of grace to find mercy and  grace to help you in the time of need  this was what the apostles taught the heathen and their words were true   you may see them come true round you every day  for my friends just as  far as people pray for christs grace and give themselves up to be led  by gods spirit they become full of grace themselves courteous and  civil loving and amiable true and honourablea pleasure to themselves  and to all round them  while on the other hand all rudeness all ill temper all selfishness all greediness are just so many sins against the  grace of christ which grieve the spirit of god at the same time that  they grieve our neighbours for whom christ died and cut us off as long  as we give way to them from the communion of saints  well would it be for married people if they would but remember this   well for them for their own sake and for their childrens  heirs  together st peter says they are of the grace of life  think of  those words for in them lies the true secret of happiness  not in the  mere grace of youth which pleases the fancy at first that must soon  fade and then comes too often coldness between man and wife neglect  rudeness illtemper because the grace of life is not therethe grace  of the inner life of the immortal soul which alone makes life pleasant  even tolerable to two people who are bound together for better or for  worse  but yet unless st peter be mistaken the fault in such sad case  is on the mans side  yes we must face that truth we men and face it  like men  if we are unhappy in our marriage it is our own fault  it is  the woman who is the weaker says st peter and selfish men are apt to  say then it is the womans fault if we are not happy  st peter says  exactly the opposite  he saysbecause she is the weaker you are the  stronger and therefore it is your fault if she is not what she should  be for you are able to help her and lead her you took her to your  heart for that very purpose you swore to cherish her  because she is  the weaker you can teach her help her improve her character if you  will  you have more knowledge of life and the world than she has  dwell  with her according to knowledge says st peter use your experience to  set her right if she be wrong and use your experience and your strength  too to keep down your own temper and your own selfishness toward her to  bear and forbear to give and forgive live and let live  remember that  you are heirs together of the grace of life and if the grace of life is  not in you you cannot expect it to be in her  and what is the grace of  life  it must be the grace of christ  st john says that christ is the  life  and what is the grace of christ  christs grace christs  gracefulness christs beautiful and noble and loving characterthe  grace of christ is christs likeness  do you ask what will christ give  me  he will give you himself  he will make you like himself partaker  of his grace and what is that  it is thisto be loving gentle  temperate courteous condescending selfsacrificing  giving honour to  those who are weaker than yourself just because they are weaker ready  and willing ay and counting it an honour to take trouble for other  people to be of use to other people to give way to other people and  above all to the woman who has given herself to you body and soul   that is the grace of christ that is the grace of life that is what  makes life worth having  ay makes it a foretaste of heaven upon earth  when man and wife are heirs together of the grace of life of all those  tempers which make life graceful and pleasant giving way to each other  in everything which is not wrong studying each others comfort taking  each others advice shutting their eyes to each others little failings  and correcting each others great failings not by harsh words but  silently and kindly by example  and if the man will do that there is  little fear but that the woman will do it also  and so their prayers  are not hindered  married people cannot pray they have no heart to pray while they are  discontented with each other  they feel themselves wrong and because  they are parted from each other they feel parted from god too and their  selfishness or anger rises as a black wall not merely between them but  between each of them and god  and so the grace of life is indeed gone  away from them and the whole world looks dark and ugly to them because  it is not bright and cheerful in the light of christs grace which makes  all the world full of sunshine and joy  but it need not be so friends   it would not be so if married people would take the advice which the  prayer book gives them and come to holy communion  would to god my  friends that all married people would understand what that holy  communion says to them and come together sunday after sunday to that  throne of grace there to receive of christs fulness and grace upon  grace  for that table says to you  you are heirs together of the grace  of life you are not meant merely to feed together for a few short years  at the same table on the bread which perishes but to feed for ever  together on the bread which comes down from heaven even on christ  himself the life of the world to receive life from his life that you  may live together such a life as he lived and lives still to receive  grace from the fulness of his grace that you may be full of grace as he  is  that table tells you that because you both must live by the same  life of christ you must live the same life as each other and grow more  and more like each other year by year that as you both receive the same  grace of christ you will become more and more gracious to each other  year by year and both grow together nearer and dearer to each other  more worthy of each others respect more worthy of each others trust  more worthy of each others love  and then till death us do part may  mean what it will  let death part what of them he can part the  perishing mortal body he has no power over the soul or over the body  which shall rise to life eternal  let death do his worst  they belong  to christ who conquered death and they live by his everlasting life and  their life is hid with christ in god where death cannot reach it or find  it and therefore their life and their love and the grace of it will  last as long as christs life and christs love and christs grace last and that will be for ever and ever    sermon xxi  father and child    eversley 1861  1 cor i 4 5 7  i thank my god always on your behalf for the grace  of god which is given you by jesus christ  that in every thing ye are  enriched by him in all utterance and in all knowledge     so that ye  come behind in no gift waiting for the coming of our lord jesus christ   who shall also confirm you unto the end that ye may be blameless in the  day of our lord jesus christ  this text is a very important one  it ought to teach me how i should  treat you  it ought to teach you how you should treat your children  it  ought to teach you how god your heavenly father treats you  you see at  the first glance how cheerful and hopeful st paul is about these  corinthians  he is always thanking god he says about them for the  grace of god which was given them by jesus christ that in everything  they were enriched by him in all utterance and in all knowledge  and he  has good hope for them  nay he seems to be certain about them that  they will persevere and conquer and be saved for christ himself will  confirm them that is strengthen them to the end that they may be  blameless in the way of our lord jesus christ  if we knew no more of these corinthians than what these words tell us we  should suppose that they were very great saints leading holy and  irreproachable lives before god and man  but we know that it was not so   that they were going on very ill  that this is the beginning of an  epistle in which st paul is going to rebuke them very severely and to  tell them that unless they mend they will surely become reprobates and  be lost after all  he is going to rebuke them for having heresies among  them that is religious parties and religious quarrelsvery much as we  have now for being puffed up with spiritual selfconceit for despising  and disparaging him for loose lives allowing in one case such a crime  among them as even the heathen did not allow for profaning the lords  supper to such an extent that some seem even to have got drunk at it  for want of charity to each other for indulging in fanatical excitement  for denying some of them the resurrection of the dead on the whole  for being in so unwholesome a state of mind that he has to warn them  solemnly of the fearful example of the old israelites who perished in  the wilderness for their sinsas they will perish he hints unless they  mend  and yet he begins by thanking god for them by speaking of them and to  them in this cheerful and hopeful tone  does that seem strange  why should it seem strange my friends to us  if we are in the habit of training our children and rebuking our  children as we ought  if we have to rebuke our children for doing  wrong do we begin by trying to break their hearts by raking up old  offences by reproaching them with all the wrong they ever did in their  lives and giving them to understand that they are thoroughly bad and  have altogether lost our love so that we will have nothing more to do  with them unless they mend  or do we begin by making them feel that  however grieved we are with them we love them still that however wrong  they have been there is right feeling left in them still and by giving  them credit for whatever good there is in themby appealing to that  calling on them to act up to that to be true to themselves and to their  better nature saying you can do right in one thingthen do right in  anotherand do right in all  if we do not do this we do wrong we  destroy our childrens selfrespect we make them despair of improving  we make them fancy themselves bad children  that is the very surest plan  we can take to make them bad children by making them reckless  but if we be wise parentssuch parents to our children as st paul was to  his spiritual children the corinthianswe shall do by them just what st  paul did by these corinthians  before he says one harsh word to them he  will awaken in them faith and love  he will make them trust him and love  him all the more because he knows that through false teaching they do  not trust and love him as they used to do  but till they do he knows  that there is no use in rebuking them  till they trust him and love him  they will not listen to him  and how does he try to bring them round to  him  by praising themby telling them that he trusts them and loves  them because in spite of all their faults there is something in them  worthy to be loved and trusted  he begins by giving them credit for  whatever good there is in them  they are rich in all utterance and all  knowledge that is they are very brilliant and eloquent talkers about  spiritual things and also very deep and subtle thinkers about spiritual  things  so far so good  these are great giftsgifts of christ too tokens that gods spirit is with them and that all they need is to be  true to his gracious inspirations  then when he has told them that or  rather made them understand that he knows that and is delighted at it  then he can go on safely and boldly to tell them of their sins also in  the plainest and sternest and yet the most tender and fatherly language  this is very important my friends  i cannot tell you fully how  important i think it in more ways than one  i am sure that if we took  st pauls method with our children we should succeed with them far better  than we do  and i think i have thought long that if we could see that  st pauls method with those corinthians was actually the same as gods  method with us we should have far truer notions of god and gods  dealings with us and should reverence and value far more that holy  catholic church into which we have been by gods infinite mercy  baptized and wherein we have been educated  for and now i entreat you to listen to me carefully you who have sound  heads and earnest hearts ready and willing to know the truth about god  and yourselves if st paul looked at the corinthians in this light may  not god have looked at them in the same light  if st paul accepted them  for the sake of the good which was in them in spite of all their faults  may not god have accepted them for the sake of the good which was in  them in spite of all their faults and may not he accept us likewise  i  think it must be so  for was not st paul an inspired apostle and are  not these words of his inspired by the holy spirit of god  but if so  then the spirit of god must have looked at these corinthians in the same  light as st paul and therefore god must do likewise because the holy  spirit is god  must it not be so  can we suppose that god would take  one view of these corinthians and then inspire st paul to take another  view  what does being inspired mean at all save having the mind of  christ and of godbeing taught to see men and things as god sees them  to feel for them and think of them as god does  if inspiration does not  mean that what does it mean  therefore i think we have a right to  believe that st pauls words express the mind of god concerning these  corinthians that god was pleased with their utterance and their  knowledge and accepted them for that and that in the same way god is  pleased with whatsoever he sees good in us and accepts us for that   but remember not for our own works or deservings any more than these  corinthians  they were and we are accepted in christ and for the  merits of christ  and any good points in us or in these corinthians as  st paul says expressly here and elsewhere are not our own but come  from christ by the inspiration of his holy spirit  i know many people do not think thus  they think of god as looking only  at our faults as extreme to mark what is done amiss as never content  with us as always crying to men yes you have done this and that well  and yet not quite well for even in what you have done there are blots  and mistakes but this and that you have not done and therefore you are  still guilty still under infinite displeasure  and they think that they  exalt gods holiness by such thoughts and magnify his hatred of sin  thereby  and they invent arguments to prove themselves right such as  this  that because god is an infinite being every sin committed against  him is infinite and therefore deserves an infinite punishment which is  a juggle of words of which any educated man ought to be ashamed  i do not know where in the bible they find all this  certainly not in  the writings of st paul  they seem to me to find it not in the bible at  all but in their own hearts judging that god must be as hard upon his  children as they are apt to be upon their own  i know that god is never  content with us or with any man  how can he be  but in what sense is  he not content  in the sense in which a hard taskmaster is not content  with his slave when he flogs him cruelly for the slightest fault  or in  the sense in which a loving father is not content with his child  grieving over him counselling him as long as he sees him even in the  slightest matter doing less well than he might do  think of that and  when you have thought of it believe that in this grand text st paul  speaks really by the spirit of god and according to the mind of god and  teaches not these old corinthians merely but you and your children after  you what is the mind of god concerning you what is the light in which  god looks upon you  for if you will but think over your own lives and  over the catechism which you learned in your youth has not gods way of  dealing with you been just the same as st pauls with those corinthians  teaching you to love and trust him almost before he taught you the  difference between right and wrong  i know that some think otherwise   many who do not belong to the church and many alas who profess to  belong to the church will tell you that gods method is first to  terrify men by the threats of the law and the sight of their sins and the  fear of damnation and afterwards to reveal to them the gospel and his  mercy and salvation in christ  now i can only answer that it is not so   not so in fact  these preachers themselves may do it but that is no  proof that god does it  what gods plan is can only be known from facts  from experience from what actually happens first in gods kingdom of  nature and next in gods kingdom of grace which is the church  and in  the kingdom of nature how does god begin with mankind  what are a  childs first impressions of this life  does he hear voices from heaven  telling little children that they are lost sinners  does he see  lightning come from heaven to strike sinners dead or earthquakes rise  and swallow them up  nothing of the kind  a childs first impressions  of this life what are they but pleasure  his mothers breast warmth  light food play flowers and all pleasant thingsby these god  educates the child even of the heathen and the savageand why  if  haply he may feel after god and find him and find that he is a god of  love and mercy a giver of good things who knows mens necessities  before they aska good and loving god and not a being such as i will  not i dare not speak of  i say with the very heathen god deals thus  we have plain scripture for  that  for we have and thanks be to god that we have in such times as  these a missionary sermon preached by st paul to the heathen at lystra   and in that is not one word concerning these terrors of the law  he  says i preach to you god whom you ought to have known of yourselves  because he has not left himself without witness  and what is this  witness of which the apostle speaks  wrath and terror and destruction   not so says st paul  this is his witness that he has sent you rain and  fruitful seasons filling your heart with food and gladness  his  goodness his bountyit is the witness of god and of the character of  god  there is wrath and terror enough says st paul elsewhere awaiting  those who go on in sin  but then what does he say is their sin   despising the goodness of god by which he has been trying to win mankind  to love and trust him before he threatens and before he punishes at all   so much for the terrors of the law coming before the good news of the  gospel in gods kingdom of nature  and still less do the terrors of the law come first in gods kingdom of  grace which is the church  they did not come first to you or to me or  to any one in his church who has been taught as churchmen should be  their catechism  if any have been unhappily for them brought up to  learn catechisms and hymns which do not belong to the church and which  terrify little children with horrible notions of gods wrath and the  torments prepared not merely for wicked men but for unconverted  children and then teach them to say   can such a wretch as i escape this dreadful end   so much the worse for them  we who are church people are bound to  believe that god speaks to us through the church books and that it was  his will that we should have been brought up to believe the catechism   and in that catechism we heard not one word of these terrors of the law  or of gods wrath hanging over us  we were taught that before we even  knew right from wrong god adopted us freely as his children freely  forgave us our original sin for the sake of christs blood freely  renewed us by his holy spirit freely placed us in his churchthat we  might love him because he first loved us trust him because he has done  all that even god could do to win our trust and obey him because we are  boundlessly in debt to him for boundless mercies  this is gods method  with us in his church and what is it but st pauls method with these  corinthians  believe this then you who wish to be churchmen in spirit and in truth   believe that st pauls conduct is to you a type and pattern of what god  does and what you ought to do  that gods method of winning you to do  right is to make you love him and trust him and that your method of  winning your children to do right is to make them love and trust you   let us remember that if our children are not perfect they at least  inherited their imperfections from us and if our father in heaven from  whom we inherit no sin but only good have patience with us shall we  not have patience with our children who owe to us their fallen nature  ah cast thy bread upon the watersthe bread which even the poorest can  give to their children abundantly and without stintthe bread of  charityhuman tenderness forbearance hopefulnesscast that bread  upon the waters and thou shalt find it after many days    sermon xxii  god is our refuge    westminster abbey 1873  psalm xlvi 1  god is our refuge and strength a very present help in  trouble  this is a noble psalm full of hope and comfort and it will be more and  more full of hope and comfort the more faithfully we believe in the  incarnation the passion the resurrection and the ascension of our lord  jesus christ  for if we are to give credit to his express words and to  those of every book of the new testament and to the opinion of that  church into which we are baptised then jesus christ is none other than  the same jehovah lord and god who brought the jews out of egypt who  guided them and governed them through all their historyteaching  judging rewarding punishing them and all the nations of the earth   this psalm therefore is concerning our lord jesus christ to whom all  power is given in heaven and earth and who ascended up on high that he  might be as he had been from the beginning king of kings and lord of  lords the master of this world and all the nations in it  this psalm  therefore is a hymn concerning the kingdom of christ and of god  it  tells us something of the government which christ has been exercising  over the world ever since the beginning of it and which he is exercising  over this world now  it bids us be still and know that he is godthat  he will be exalted among the nations and will be exalted in the earth  whether men like it or not but that they ought to like it and rejoice in  it and find comfort in the thought that christ jesus is their refuge and  their strengtha very present help in troubleas the old jew who wrote  this psalm found comfort  when this psalm was written or what particular events it speaks of i  cannot tell for i do not think we have any means of finding out  it may  have been written in the time of david or of solomon or of hezekiah   it may possibly have been written much later  it seems to mo probably to  referbut i speak with extreme diffidenceto that assyrian invasion  and that preservation of jerusalem of which we heard in the magnificent  first lesson for this morning and this afternoon when at the same time  that the assyrians were crushing one by one every nation in the east  there was as the elder isaiah and micah tell us plainly a great  volcanic outbreak in the holy land  but all this matters very little to  us because events analogous to those of which it speaks have happened  not once only but many times and will happen often again  and this  psalm lays down a rule for judging of such startling and terrible events  whenever they happen and for saying of them god is our refuge and  strength a very present help in trouble  it seems from the beginning  of the psalm that there had been earthquakes or hurricanes in judeamore  probably earthquakes which were and are now frequent there  it seems as  if the land had been shaken and cliffs thrown into the sea which had  rolled back in a mighty wave such as only too often accompanies an  earthquake  but the psalmist knew that that was gods doing and  therefore he would not fear though the earth was moved and though the  hills were earned into the very midst of the sea  it seems moreover  that jerusalem itself had as in hezekiahs time not been shaken or at  least seriously injured by the earthquake  but why  god is in the  midst of her therefore shall she not be removed  it seems also as if  the earthquake or hurricane had been actually a benefit to jerusalem which was often then and has been often since in want of waterthat  either fresh springs had broken out or abundant rain had fallen as  occurs at times in such convulsions of nature  but that too was gods  doing on behalf of his chosen city  the rivers of the flood had made  glad the city of god the holy place of the tabernacle of the most  highest  moreover there seem to have been great disturbances and wars among the  nations round  the heathen had made much ado and the kingdoms had been  moved  but whatever their plans were it was god who had brought them to  naught  god had shewed his voice and the earth melted away and we  know not how discomfiture had fallen upon them and a general peace had  followed  o come hither says the psalmist and behold the works of  the lord what desolations he has made in the earth  not a desolation  of cruelty and tyranny  but a desolation of mercy and justice putting  down the proud the aggressive the ruthless and helping the meek the  simple the industrious and the innocent  it is he says the psalmist  who has made wars to cease in all the world who has broken the bow and  snapped the spear in sunder and burned the chariots in the fire and so  by the voice of fact said to these kings and to their armies if they  would but understand it be still and know that i am godthat i not  you will be exalted among the nationsthat i not you will be exalted  in the earth  such is the 46th psalm one of the noblest utterances of the whole old  testament  and is it not as true for us now ay for all nations and all  mankind now as it was when it was uttered  is not jesus christ the same  yesterday today and for ever  have his words passed away  did he say  in vain all power is given unto me in heaven and earth  did he say in  vain lo i am with you alway even unto the end of the world  i trust  not  i trust and i hope that you or at least some here believe that  christ is ruling and guiding the world the church and every individual  soul who trusts in him toward   one far off divine event to which the whole creation moves   i hope you do have that trust for your own sakes for the sake of your  own happiness your own sound peace of mind for then and then only you  can afford to be hopeful concerning yourselves your families your  country and the whole human race  it must be so  if you believe that  he who hung upon the cross for all mankind is your refuge and strength  and the refuge and strength of all mankind then amid all the changes  and chances of this mortal life you can afford to be still calm in  sudden calamity patient in long afflictions for you know that he is  god he is the lord he is the redeemer he is the king  he knows best   he must be right whosoever else is wrong  let him do what seemeth him  good  now i cannot but feel what wiser and better men than i am feel more  deeply that this oldfashioned faith in the living christ is dying out  among us  that men do not believe as they used to do in the living lord  and in his government in that perpetual divine providence which the  scriptures call the kingdom of god  they have lost faith in christs  immediate and personal government of the world and its nations and  therefore they are tempted more and more either to try to misgovern the  world themselves or to fancy that christ has entrusted his government  as to a substitute and vicar to an aged priest at rome  they have lost  faith likewise in christs immediate government of themselves their  own fortunes their own characters and inmost souls and therefore  they are tempted either to follow no rule or guidance save their own  instincts passions fancies or else in despair at their own inward  anarchy to commit the keeping of their souls to directors and  confessors instead of to christ himself the lord of the spirits of all  flesh  yes the faith which keeps a man ever face to face with god and with  christ in the least as well as in the greatest events of life which  says in prosperity and in adversity in plenty and scarcity in joy and  sorrow in peace and warit is the lords doing it is the lords  sending and therefore we can trust in the lordthat faith is growing i  fear very rare  that faith was more common i think a generation or  two back in oldfashioned church people than in any other  it could not  help being so for the good old prayerbook upon which they were brought  up is more full of that simple and living faith in the lord from  beginning to end than any other book on earth except the bible  it was  more common too and i suppose always will be among the poor than among  the rich for the poor soon find out how little they have to depend upon  except the lord and his good providence while the rich are tempted and  always will be to depend upon their own wealth and their own power to  trust in uncertain riches and say soul take thine ease thou hast  much goods laid up for many years  it was more common too and i  suppose always will be among the old than among the young for the young  are tempted to trust not in the lord but in their own health strength  wit courage and to put their hopes not on gods providence but on the  unknown chapter of accidents in the future most of which will never come  to pass while the old have learned by experience and disappointment the  vanity of human riches the helplessness of human endeavour the  blindness of human foresight and are content to go where god leads them  and say i will go forth in the strength of the lord god and will make  mention of thy righteousness only  thou o god hast taught me from my  youth up until now  therefore will i tell of thy wondrous works   forsake me not o god in mine old age when i am greyheaded until i  have showed thy strength unto this generation and thy power to all them  which are yet for to come  but for some reason or other this generation does not seem to care to  see gods strength and those that are yet for to come seem likely to  believe less and less in gods powerbelieve less and less that they are  in christs kingdom and that christ is ruling over them and all the  world  they have not faith in the living lord  but they must get back  that faith if they wish to keep that wealth and prosperity after which  every one scrambles so greedily nowadays for those who forget god are  treading they and their children after them not as they fancy the  road to richesthey are treading the road to ruin  so it always was so  it always will be  yet the majority of mankind will not see it and the  preacher must not expect to be believed when he says it  nevertheless it  is true  those who forget that they are in christs kingdom christ does  not go out of his way to punish them  they simply punish themselves   they earn their own ruin by the very laws of human nature  they must  find hope in something and strength in something and if they will not  see that god is their hope they will hope to get rich as fast as  possible and make themselves safe so  if they will not see that god is  their strength they will find strength in cunning in intrigue in  flattery of the strong and tyranny over the weak and in making  themselves strong so  they want a present help in trouble and if they  will not believe that god is a present help in trouble they will try to  help themselves out of their trouble by begging lying swindling  forging and all those meannesses which fill our newspapers with shameful  stories day by day and which all arise simply out of want of faith in  god  moreover it is written be still and know that i am god  and if men  will not be still they will not know that he is god  and if they do not  know that the gracious christ is god they will not be still and  therefore they will grow more and more restless discontented envious  violent irreverent full of passions which injure their own souls and  sap the very foundations of order and society and civilised life  and  what can come out of all these selfish passions when they are let loose  but that in which selfishness must always end but that same mistrust and  anarchy ending in that same poverty and wretchedness under which so  many countries of the world now lie as it were weltering in the mire   alas say rather weltering in their own lifebloodand all because they  have forgotten the living god  oh my dear friends take these words solemnly to heartfor yourselves  and for your children after you  if you wish to prosper on the earth  let god be in all your thoughts  remember that the lord is on your right  hand and then and then alone will you not be moved either to terror  or to sin by any of the chances and changes of this mortal life  fret  not thyself says the psalmist else shalt thou be moved to do evil   and the only way not to fret yourselves is to remember that god is your  refuge and strength a very present help in trouble  he that  believeth saith the prophet shall not make hastenot hurry himself  into folly and disappointment and shame  why should you hurry if you  remember that you are in the kingdom of christ and of god  you cannot  hurry gods providence if you would you ought not if you could  god  must know best gods laws must work at the right pace and fulfil his  will in the right way and at the right time  as for what that will is  we can know from the angels song on christmas eve which told us how  gods will was a good will towards men  for who is our lord  who is our king  who is our governor  who is our  lawgiver  who is our guide  christ who died for us on calvary who  rose again for us who ascended into heaven for us who sits at gods  right hand for us who sent down his holy spirit at the first  whitsuntide and sends him down for ever to us that by his gracious  inspiration we may both perceive and know what we ought to do and also  may have grace and power faithfully to fulfil the same  with such a king  over us how can the world but go right  with such a king over us what  refuge or strength or help in trouble do we need but him himselfhis  providence which is love and his laws which are life    sermon xxiii  pride and humility    eversley 1869  chester cathedral 1870  1st peter v 5  god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the  humble  let me this evening say a few words to you on theology that is on the  being and character of god  you need not be afraid that i shall use long  or difficult words  sound theology is simple enough and i hope that my  words about it will be simple enough for the worst scholar here to  understand  god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble  now this  saying is an old one  it had been said in different words centuries  before st peter said it  the old prophets and psalmists say it again and  again  the idea of it runs through the whole of the old testament as  anyone must know who has read his bible with common care  but why should  it be true  what reason is there for it  what is there in the character  of god which makes it reasonable probable likely to be true  that god  would give grace to the humble and reward men for bowing down before his  majesty seems not so difficult to understand  but why should god resist  the proud  how does a mans being proud injure god who is i am that i  am perfectly selfsufficient having neither parts nor passions who  tempteth no man neither is tempted of any  why should god go out of  his way as it were to care for such a paltry folly as the pride of an  ignorant weak shortsighted creature like man  now let us take care that we do not give a wrong answer to this  questionan answer which too many have given in their hearts and minds  though not perhaps in words and so have fallen into abject and cruel  superstitions from which may god keep us and our children after us   they have said to themselves god is proud and has a right to be proud   and therefore he chooses no one to be proud but himself  pride in man  calls out his pride and makes him angry  they have thought of god as  some despotic sultan of the indies who is surrounded not by free men  but by slaves who will have those slaves at his beck and nod  in one  word they have thought of god as a tyrant  they have thought of god  and may god forgive them have talked of god as if he were like  nebuchadnezzar of old who when the three young men refused to obey him  was filled with rage and fury and cast them into a burning fiery  furnace  that is some mens goda god who must be propitiated by  crouching and flattery lest he should destroy thema god who holds all  men as his slaves and therefore hates pride in them  for what has a  slave to do with pride  but that is not the god of the bible my friends nor the god of nature  either the god who made the world and man  for he is not a tyrant but  a father  he wishes men not to be his slaves but his children  and if  he resists the proud it is because children have no right to be proud   if he resists the proud it is in fatherly love because it is bad for  them to be proud  not because the proud are injuring god but because  they are injuring themselves does god resist them and bring them low  and show them what they are and where they are that they may repent  and be converted and turned back into the right way  remember always that god is your father  this question like all  questions between god and man is a question between a father and a  child and if you see it in any other light and judge it by any other  rule you see it and judge it wrongly and learn nothing about it or  worse than nothing  if god were really angry with really hated the  proud man or any other man would he need only to resist him would he  have to wait till the next life to punish him  my dear friends if god  really hated you or me do you not suppose that he would simply destroy  usget rid of usabolish us and annihilate us off the face of the  earth just as we crush a gnat when it bites us  that god can do and morehe does it now and then  he will endure with  much long suffering vessels of wrath fitted to destruction  but a  moment sometimes comes when he will endure them no longer and he  destroys them with the destruction for which they have fitted themselves   in them is fulfilled the parable of the rich man who said to himself  soul thou hast much good laid up for many years take thine ease eat  drink and be merry  but god said unto him thou fool this night thy  soul shall be required of thee  but for the most part thanks to the mercy of our heavenly father we are  not destroyed by our pride and for our pride  we are only chastened as  a father chastens his child  and that we are chastised for pride who  does not know  what proverb more common what proverb more true than  that after pride comes a fall  do we not know if we do not we shall  know sooner or later that the surest way to fail in any undertaking is  to set about it in selfwill and selfconceit that the surest way to do  a foolish thing is to fancy that we are going to do a very wise one  that the surest way to make ourselves ridiculous in the eyes of our  fellowmen is to assume airs and boast shew ourselves off and end by  shewing off only our own folly  why is it so  why has god so ordered the world and human nature that  pride punishes itself  because i presume pride is begotten and born of  a lie and god hates a lie because all lies lead to ruin and this lie  of pride above all  it is as it were the root lie of all lies  the very  lie by which as old tales tell satan fell from heaven and when he  tried to become a god in his own right found himself to his surprise  and disappointment only a devil  for pride and selfconceit contradict  the original constitution of man and the universe which is thisthat of  god are all things and in god are all things and for god are all  things  man depends on god  self tells him that he depends on himself   man has nothing but what he receives from god  self tells him that what  he has is his own and that he has a right to do with it what he likes   man knows nothing but what god teaches him  self tells him that he has  found out everything for himself and can say what he thinks fit without  fear of god or man  therefore the proud selfwilled selfconceited man  must come to harm like malvolio in the famous play merely because he is  in the blackest night of ignorance  he has mistaken who he is what he  is where he is  he is fancying himself as many mad men do the centre  of the universe while god is the centre of the universe  he is just as  certain to come to harm as a man would be on board a ship who should  fancy that he himself and not the ship was keeping him afloat and step  overboard to walk upon the sea  we all know what would happen to that  man  let us thank god our father that he not only knows what would  happen to such men  but desires to save them from the consequences of  their own folly by letting them feel the consequences of their own  folly  oh my friends let us search our hearts and pray to our father in heaven  to take out of them by whatever painful means the poisonous root of  pride selfconceit selfwill  so only shall we be truly strongtruly  wise  so only shall we see what and where we are  do we pride ourselves on being something  shall we pride ourselves on  health and strength  a tile falling off the roof a little powder and  lead in the hands of a careless child can blast us out of this world in  a momentwhither who can tell  what is our clevernessour strength of  mind  a tiny blood vessel bursting on the brain will make us in one  moment paralytic helpless babblers and idiots  what is our knowledge  of the world  that of a man who is forcing his way alone through a  thick and pathless wood where he has never been before to a place which  he has never seen  what is our wisdomwhat does a wise man say of his   so runs my dream but what am i an infant crying in the night an infant crying for the light and with no language but a cry   yes  our true knowledge is to know our own ignorance  our true strength  is to know our own weakness  our true dignity is to confess that we have  no dignity and are nobody and nothing in ourselves and to cast  ourselves down before the dignity of god under the shadow of whose  wings and in the smile of whose countenance alone is any created being  safe  let us cling to our father in heaven as a child walking in the  night clings to his fathers hand  let us take refuge on the lowest  step of the throne of christ our lord and humble ourselves under his  mighty hand and instead of exalting ourselves in undue time leave him  to exalt us again in due time when the chastisement has told on us and  patience had her perfect work casting all our care on him who surely  cares for us still if he cared for us once enough to die for us on the  cross caring for gods opinion and not for the opinion of the world   and then we shall be among the truly humble to whom god gives grace first grace in their own hearts that they may live gracious lives  modest and contented dignified and independent trusting in god and not  in man and then grace in the eyes of their fellowmen for what is more  graceful what is more gracious pleasant to see pleasant to deal with  than the humble man the modest man  i do not mean the cringing man the  flattering man the man who apes humility for his own ends because he  wants to climb high by pretending to be lowly  he is neither graceful  or gracious  he is only contemptible and he punishes himself  he  spoils his own game  he defeats his own purpose  for men despise him  and use him and throw him away when they have done with him as they  throw away a dirty wornout tool  not him do i mean by the humble man the modest man  i mean the man who  like a good soldier knows his place and keeps it knows his duty and  does it who expects to be treated as a man should be with fairness  consideration respect kindnessand god will always treat him so  whether man does or not  but who beyond that does not trouble his mind  with whether he be private or sergeant lieutenant or colonel but with  whether he can do his duty as private his duty as sergeant his duty as  lieutenant his duty as colonel who has learnt the golden lesson which  so few learn in these struggling envious covetous ambitious days  namely to abide in the calling to which he is called and in whatsoever  state he is therewith to be content  to be sure that in gods world  the only safe way to become ruler over many things is to be a good ruler  over a few things that if he is fit for better work than he is doing  now god will find that out sooner and more surely than he or any man  will and will set him about it and that meanwhile god has set him  about work which he can do and that the true wisdom is to do that and do  it well and so approve himself alike to man and god humbling himself  under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt him in good time by  giving him grace and strength to do great things as he has given him  grace and strength to do small things  am i speaking almost to deaf ears  i fear that few here will take my  advice  i fear that many here will have excellent excuses and plain  reasons why they should not take it  be it so  they cannot alter  eternal fact  in one word they cannot alter theology  they cannot  alter the laws of god  they cannot alter the character of god  and  sooner or later in this world or in the next they will find out that  theology is right  and st peter is right  that god does resist the  proud that god does give grace to the humble    sermon xxiv  worship    eversley september 4 1870  revelation xi 16 17  and the four and twenty elders which sat before  god on their seats fell upon their faces and worshipped god saying we  give thee thanks o lord god almighty which art and wast and art to  come because thou hast taken to thee thy great power and hast reigned  my dear friendsi wish to speak a few plain words to you this morning  on a matter which has been on my mind ever since i returned from chester  namelythe duty of the congregation to make the responses in church  now i am not going to scoldeven to blame  to do so would be not only  unjust but ungrateful in me to a congregation which is as attentive and  as reverent as you are  indeed i am the only person to blame for i  ought to have spoken on the subject long ago  as it is coming fresh from chester and accustomed to hear  congregations in that city and in the country round reading the  responses aloud throughout the service with earnestness and reverence i  was painfully struck by the silence in this church  i had before grown  so accustomed to it that i did not perceive it just as one grows  accustomed to a great many things which ought not to be till one forgets  that however usual they may be wrong they are and ought to be amended  now it is always best to begin at the root of a matter  so to begin at  the root of this  why do we come to church at all  some will say to hear the sermon  that is often too true  some folks  do come to church to hear a man get up and preach just as they go to a  concert to hear a man get up and sing to amuse and interest them for  halfanhour  some go to hear sermons doubtless in order that they may  learn from them  but are there not especially in these days of cheap  printing books of devotion tracts sermons printed which contain  better preaching than any which they are likely to hear in church  if  teaching is all that they come to church for they can get that in plenty  at home  moreover nine people out of ten who come to church need no  teaching at all  they know already just as well as the preacher what  is right and what is wrong they know their duty they know how to do it   and if they do not intend to do it all the talking in the world as far  as i have seen will not make them do it  moreover if the teaching in  the sermon be what we come to church for why have we prayerbooks full  of prayers thanksgivings psalms and so forth which are not sermons at  all  what is the use of the service as we call it if the sermon is the  only or even the principal object for which we come  i trust there are  many of you here who agree with me so fully that you would come  regularly to church as i should even if there were no sermon knowing  that god preaches to every man in the depths of his own heart and  conscience far more solemn and startling sermons than any mortal man can  utter  others will answer that they come to church to say their prayers  well   that is a wiser answer than the last  but if that be all why can they  not say their prayers at home  god is everywhere  god is allseeing  allhearing about our path and about our bed and spying out all our  ways  is he not as ready to hear in the field and in the workshop and  in the bedchamber as in the church  when thou prayest says our  lord enter into thy closet and when thou hast shut thy door pray to  thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall  reward thee openly  those are not my words they are the words of our  lord jesus christ himself and none can gainsay them  none dare take  from them or add to them and our coming to church therefore must be  for more reasons than for the mere saying of our prayers  others will answervery many indeed will answerwe come to church  becausebecause we hardly know why but because we ought to come to  church  some may call that a silly answer only fit for children  but i do not  think so  it seems to me a very rational answer  perhaps a very  reverent and godly answer  a man comes to church for reasons which he  cannot explain to himself  just soand many of the deepest and best  feelings of our hearts are just those that we cannot explain to  ourselves though we believe in them would fight for them die for them   the man who frankly confesses that he does not quite know why he comes to  church is most likely to know at last why he does come most likely to  understand the answer which scripture gives to the question why we come  to church  and what answer is that  strange to say one which people  nowadays with their bibles in their hands have almost forgotten  we  come to church according to the bible to worship god  to worship  think awhile what that ancient and deep and noble word  signifies  so ancient is it that man learnt to worship even before he  learnt to till the ground  so deep that even to this day no man  altogether understands what worshipping means  so noble that the  noblest souls on earth delight most in worshipping that the angels and  archangels and the spirits of just men made perfect find no nobler  occupation no higher enjoyment in the heavenly world than worshipping  for ever him whose glory fills all earth and heaven  to worship  that  power of worship that longing to worship that instinct that it is his  duty to worship something isif you will receive itthe true  distinction between men and brutes  philosophers have tried to define  man as this sort of animal and that sort of animal  the only sound  definition is this  man is the one animal who worships and he worships  just because he is not merely an animal but a man with an immortal soul  within him  just in as far as man sinks down again to the level of the  brutewhether in some savage island of the south seas or in some  equally savage alley of our own great citiesgod forgive us that such  human brutes should exist here in christian englandjust so far he feels  no need to worship  he thinks of no unseen god or powers above him  he  cares for nothing but what his five senses tell him of he feels no need  to go to church and worship  just in as far as a man rises to the true  standard of a man just in as far as his heart and his mind are truly  cultivated truly developed just so far does he become more and more  aware of an unseen world about him more and more aware that in god he  lives and moves and has his beingand so much the more he feels the  longing and the duty to worship that unseen god on whom he and the whole  universe depend  i know what seeming exceptions there are to this rule especially in  these days  but i say that they are only seeming exceptions  i never  knew yet and i have known many of them a virtuous and highminded  unbeliever  but what there was in him the instinct of worshippingthe  longing to worshiphe knew not what the spirit of reverence which  confesses its own ignorance and weakness and is ready to set up like  the athenians of old an altarin the heart at leastto the unknown  god  but how to worship him  the word itself if we consider what it means  will tell us that  worship without doubt is the same word as worth ship  it signifies the worth of him whom we worship that he is worthy a worthy god not merely because of what he has done but because of  what he is worth in himself  good excellent and perfect in himself  and therefore to be admired praised reverenced adored worshipped even if he had never done a kindness to you or to any human being   remember this last truth  for true it is and we remember it too little   of course we know that god is good first and mainly by his goodness to  us  because he is good enough to give us life and breath and all things  we conclude that he is a good being  because he is good enough to have  not spared his only begotten son but freely given him for us when we  were still sinners and rebels we conclude him to be the best of all  beings a being of boundless goodness  but it is because god is so  perfectly and gloriously good in himself and not merely because he has  done us kindnesses yea heaped us with undeserved benefits that we are  to worship him  for his kindnesses we owe him gratitude and gratitude  without end  but for his excellent and glorious goodness we owe him  worship and worship without end  there are some hearts surely among you here who know what i mean  some  here who have felt reverence and admiration for some great and good human  being and who have felt too that that reverence and admiration is one  of the most elevating and unselfish of all feelings and quite distinct  from any gratitude however just for favours done who can say in their  hearts of some noble human being  if he never did me a kindness never  spoke to me never knew of my existence i should honour him and love him  just the same for the noble and good personage that he is irrespective  of little me and my paltry wants  then even such ought to be our  feeling toward god our worship of god  even so should we adore him who  alone is worthy of glory and honour and praise and thanksgiving  because he is good and beautiful and wise himself and the cause and  source of all goodness and beauty and wisdom in all created beings  and in the whole universe past present and to come  consider i  beseech you those glimpses of the eternal worship in heaven which st  john gives us in the book of revelationhow he saw the elders fall down  before him who sat upon the throne and worship him that liveth for ever  and cast their crowns before the throne saying  thou art worthy o  lord to receive glory and honour and power for thou hast created all  things and for thy pleasure they are and were created  consider thatthose blessed spirits of just men made perfect confessing  that they are nothing but that christ is all that they have nothing  but that they owe all to christ and declaring him worthynot merely for  any special mercies and kindnesses to themselves not even for that  crowning mercy of his incarnation his death his redemption even that  seems to have vanished from their minds at the sight of him as he is   they glorify him and worship him simply for what he is in himself for  what he would have been even ifwhich god forbidhe had never stooped  from heaven to live and die on earthfor what he is and was and will be  through eternity the creator and the ruler who has made all things and  for whose pleasure they are and were created  consider that one text   the more i consider it the more awful and yet most blessed depths of  teaching do i find therein  and consider this text also another glimpse  of the worship which is in heaven  i heard a great voice of much people in heaven singing alleluia  salvation and glory and honour and power unto the lord our god for  true and righteous are his judgments  what the special judgment was  for which these blessed souls worshipped god i shall not argue here  it  is enough for us that they worshipped god as we should worship him  because his judgments were righteous and true were like himself proved  him to be what he was worthy in himself because he is righteous and  true  and consider then againthe text  before him the righteous and  true being who has created all things for his pleasure and therefore has  made them wisely and well before him who reigns and will reign till he  has put all his enemies under his foot before him i say bow down  yourselves and find true nobleness in confessing your own paltriness  true strength in confessing your own weakness true wisdom in confessing  your own ignorance true holiness in confessing your own sins  and not alone merely each in your own chamber or in your own heart   that is the place for private confessions of sin for private prayers for  help for all the secrets which we dare not and need not tell to any  human being  they indeed are not out of place here in church  those who  composed our prayer book felt that and have filled our services the  litany especially with prayers in which each of us can offer up his own  troubles to god if he but remember that he is offering up to god his  neighbours troubles also and the troubles of all mankind  for this is  the reason why we pray together in church why all men in all ages  heathen as well as christian have had the instinct of assembling  together for public worship  they may have fancied often that their  deity dwelt in one special spot and that they must go thither to find  him  they may have fancied that he or she dwelt in some particular  image and that they must visit and pray to that particular image if  they wished their prayers to be heard  all this however have men done  in their foolishness but beneath that foolishness there have been always  more rational ideas sounder notions  they felt that it was god who had  made them into families and therefore whole families met together to  worship in common him of whom every family in heaven and earth is named   that god had formed them into societies whether into tribes as of old  or into parishes as here now and therefore whole parishes came together  to worship god whose laws they were bound to obey in their parochial  society  they felt that it was god who had made them into nations as  the psalm says which we repeat every sunday morning and not they  themselves and therefore they conceived the grand idea of national  churches in which the whole nation should if possible worship sunday  after sunday at the same time and in the same words that god to whom  they owed their order their freedom their strength their safety their  national unity and life  and not in silence merely  these blessed souls  in heaven are not silent  they in heaven follow out the human instinct  which they had on earth which all men when they recollect themselves  will have when they feel a thing deeply when they believe a thing  strongly to speak itto speak it aloud  they do not fancy in heaven  as the priests of baal did on earth that they must cry aloud or god  could not hear them  they do not fancy as the heathen do that they  must make vain repetitions and say the same words over and over again by  rote because they will be heard for their much speaking neither need  you and i  but yet they spoke aloud because out of the fulness of the  heart the mouth speaketh and so should you and i  and this brings me to the special object of my sermon  i have told you  what as it seems to me worship means why we worship why we worship  together and why we ought to worship aloud  believe me this last is  your duty just as much as mine  the services of the church of england  are so constructed that the whole congregation may take part in them  that they may answer aloud in the responses that they may say amen at  the end of each prayer just as they read or chant aloud the alternate  verses of the psalms  the minister does not say prayers for them but  with them  he is only their leader their guide  and if they are not to  join in with their voices there is really no reason why he should use  his voice why he should not say the prayers in silence and to himself  if the congregation are to say amen in silence and to themselves  each  person in the congregation ought to join aloud first for the sake of his  neighbours and then for his own sake  for the sake of his neighbours  for to hear each others voices stirs up  earnestness stirs up attention keeps off laziness inattention and by  a wholesome infection makes all the congregation of one mind as they  are of one speech in glorifying god  and for his own sake too  for  believe me when a man utters the responses aloud he awakens his own  thoughts and his own feelings too  he speaks to himself and he hears  himself remind himself of god and of his duty to god and acknowledge  himself openly as in confirmation bound to believe and do what he by  his own confession has assented unto  believe me my dear friends this is no mere theory  it is to me a  matter of fact and experience  i cannot i have long found keep my  attention steady during a service if i do not make the responses aloud if i do not join in with my voice i find my thoughts wandering and i  am bound to suppose that the case is the same with you  do not  therefore think me impertinent or interfering if i ask you all to take  your due share in worshipping god in this church with your voices as  well as with your hearts  let these services be more lively more  earnest more useful to us all than they have been by making them more a  worship of the whole congregation and not of the minister alone  i have  read of a great church in the east in days long long ago in which the  responses of the vast congregation were so unanimous so loud that they  sounded says the old writer like a clap of thunder  that is too much  to expect in our little country church  but at least i beg you take  such an open part in the responses that you shall all feel that you are  really worshipping together the same god and christ with the same heart  and mind and that if a stranger shall come in he may say in his heart   here are people who are in earnest who know what they are about and are  not ashamed of trying to do it people who evidently mean what they say  and therefore say what they mean    sermon xxv  the peace of god    baltimore us 1874  westminster abbey  november 8 1874  colossians iii 15  let the peace of god rule in your hearts  the peace of god  that is what the priest will invoke for you all when  you leave this abbey  do you know what it is  whether you do or not  let me tell you in a few words what i seem to myself to have learned  concerning that peace  what it is how we can obtain it and why so many  do not obtain it and are therefore not at peace  it is worth while to do so  for these are not peaceful times  the peace  of god is rare among us  some say that it is rarer than it was  i know  not how that may be but i see all manner of causes at work around us  which should make it rare  we live faster than our forefathers  we  hurry we bustle we travel we are eager for daily almost for hourly  news from every quarter as if the world could not get on without us or  we without knowing a hundred facts which merely satisfy the curiosity of  the moment and as if the great god could not take excellent care of us  all meanwhile  we are eager too to get money and get more money  stillpiercing ourselves through too often as the apostle warned us with many sorrows and falling into foolish and hurtful lusts which  drown men in destruction and perdition  we are luxuriousmore and more  fond of show more apt to live up to our incomes and probably a little  beyond more and more craving for this or that gewgaw especially in  dress and ornament which if our neighbour has we must have too or we  shall be mortified envious  nay so strong is this temper of rivalry  of allowing no superiors grown in us that we have made nowadays a god  of what used to be considered the basest of all vicesthe vice of envy and dignify it with the names of equality and independence  men in this  temper of mind cannot be at peace  they are not content they cannot be  content  but with what are they not content  that is a question worth asking   for there is a discontent as i have told you ere now which is noble  manful heroic and divine  just as there is a discontent which is base  mean unmanly earthlysometimes devilish  there is a discontent which  is certain sooner or later to bring with it the peace of god  there is  a discontent which drives the peace of god away for ever and a day  and  the noble and peacebringing discontent is to be discontented with  ourselves as very few are  and the mean peacedestroying discontent is  to be discontented with things around us as too many are  now my  friends i cannot see into your hearts and i ought not to see  for if i  saw i should be tempted to judge and if i judged i should most  certainly judge rashly shallowly and altogether wrong  therefore  examine yourselves and judge yourselves in this matter  ask yourselves  each am i at peace  and if not then apply to yourselves the rule of  old epictetus the heroic slave who heathen though he was sought god  and the peace of god and found them doubt it not long long ago  ask  yourselves with epictetus am i discontented with things which are in my  own power or with things which are not in my own powerthat is  discontented with myself or with things which are not myself  am i  discontented with myself or with things about me and outside of me   consider this last question well if you wish to be true christians true  philosophers and indeed true men and women  but what is it that troubles you  what is it you want altered  on what  have you set your heart and affections  is it something outside you something which is not you yourself  if so there is no use in  tormenting your soul about it for it is not in your own power and you  will never alter it to your liking and more you need not alter it for  you are not responsible for it  god sends it as it is for better for  worse and you must make up your mind to what god sends  do i mean that  we are to submit slavishly to circumstances like dumb animals  heaven  forbid  we are not like epictetus slaves but free men  and we are  made in gods image and have each our spark however dim of that  creative genius that power of creating or of altering circumstances by  which god made all worlds and to use that is of our very birthright or  what would all education progress civilisation be save rebellion  against god  but when we have done our utmost how little shall we have  done  canst thouasks our lord looking with loving sadness on the  hurry and the struggle of the human anthillcanst thou by taking thought  add one cubit to thy stature  why is there a wise man or woman in this  abbey past fifty years of age who does not know that in spite of all  their toil and struggle they have gone not whither they willed but  whither god willed  have they not found out that for one circumstance of  their lives which they could alter there have been twenty which they  could not some born with them some forced on them by an overruling  providence irresistible indeedbut as i hold most loving and most  fatherly though often severeeven to agonybut irresistible still till what they have really gained by fighting circumstance however  valiantly has been the moral gain the gain in characterthe power to  live the heroic life which      is not as idle ore but heated hot with burning fears and bathed in baths of hissing tears and batterd with the shocks of doom to shape and use   ah if a man be learning that lesson which is the primer of eternal  life then i hardly pity him though i see him from youth to age tearing  with weak hands at the gates of brass and beating his souls wings to  pieces against the bars of the iron cage  but alas the majority of  mankind tear at the gates of brass and beat against the iron cage with  no such good purpose and therefore with no such good result  they fight  with circumstances not that they may become better themselves not that  they may right the wrongs or elevate the souls of their fellowmen not  even that they may fulfil the sacred duty of maintaining and educating  and providing for the children whom they have brought into the world and  for whom they are responsible alike to god and to man but simply because  circumstances are disagreeable to them because the things around them do  not satisfy their covetousness their luxury their ambition their  vanity  and therefore the majority of mankind want to be and to do and  to have a hundred things which are not in their own power and of which  they have no proof that god intends to give them no proof either that if  they had them they would make right use of them and certainly no proof  at all that if they had them they would find peace  they war and fight  and have not because they ask not  they ask and have not because they  ask amiss to consume it on their lusts and so they spend their lives  without peace longing struggling for things outside them the greater  part of which they do not get because the getting them is not in their  own power and which if they got they could not keep for they can carry  nothing away with them when they die neither can their pomp follow them   and therefore does man walk in a vain shadow and disquiet himself in  vain looking for peace where it is not to be foundin everything and  anything save in his own heart in duty and in god  but happy are they who are discontented with the divine discontent  discontented with themselves  happy are they who hunger and thirst after  righteousness that they may become righteous and good men  happy are  they who have set their hearts on the one thing which is in their own  powerbeing better than they are and doing better than they do  happy  are they who long and labour after the true riches which neither mobs  nor tyrants man nor devil prosperity nor adversity or any chance or  change of mortal life can take from themthe true and eternal wealth  which is the spirit of god  the man i say who has set his heart on  being good has set his heart on the one thing which is in his own power  the one thing which depends wholly and solely on his own will the one  thing which he can have if he chooses for it is written if ye then  being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more  shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him   moreover he has set his heart on the one thing which cannot be taken  from him  god will not take it from him and man and fortune and  misfortune cannot take it from him  poverty misery disease death  itself cannot make him a worse man cannot make him less just less  true less pure less charitable less highminded less like christ and  less like god  therefore he is at peace for he is as it were intrenched in an  impregnable fortress against all men and all evil influences  and that  castle is his own soul  and the keeper of that castle is none other than  almighty god jesus christ our lord to whose keeping he has committed  his soul as unto a faithful and merciful saviour able to keep to the  uttermost that which is committed to him in faith and holiness  therefore that man is at peace with himself for his conscience tells him  that he is if not doing his best yet trying to do his best better and  better day by day  he is at peace with all the world for most men are  longing and quarrelling for pleasant things outside them for which he  does not greatly care while he is longing and striving for good things  inside him in his own heart and soul and so the world goes one way and  he another and their desires do not interfere with each other  but more that man is at peace with god  he is at peace with god the  father for he is behaving as the father wishes his children to behave   he is at peace with god the son for he is trying to do that which god  the son did when he came not to do his own will but his fathers not to  grasp at anything for himself but simply to sacrifice himself for duty  for the good of man  and he is at peace with god the holy spirit for he  is obeying the gracious inspirations of that spirit and growing a better  man day by day  and so the peace of god keeps that mans heart free from  vain desires and angry passions and his mind from those false and  foolish judgments which make the world think things important which are  quite unimportant and again fancy things unimportant which are more  important to them than the riches of the whole world  my dear friends take my words home with you and if you wish for the  only true and sound peace which is the peace of god do your duty  try  to be as good as you can each in his station in life  so help you god  take an example from the soldier on the march and if you do that you  will all understand what i mean  the bad soldier has no peace just  because he troubles himself about things outside himself and not in his  own power  will the officers lead us right that is not in his power   let him go where the officers lead him and do his own duty  will he  get food enough water enough care enough if he is wounded  i hope  and trust in god he will but that is not in his own power  let him take  that too as it comes and do his duty  will he be praised rewarded  mentioned in the newspapers if he fights well  that too is not in  his own power  let him take that too as it comes and do his duty and  so of everything else  if the soldier on the march torments himself with  these matters which are not in his own power he is the man who will be  troublesome and mutinous in time of peace and in time of war will be the  first to run away  he will tell you a man must have justice done him  a man must see fair play for himself a man must think of himself  poor  fool  he is not thinking of himself all the while but of a number of  things which are outside him circumstances which stand round him and  outside him and are not himself at all  because he thinks of themthe  things outside himhe is a coward or a mutineer while he fancies he is  taking care of himselfas it is written whosoever shall seek to save  his life shall lose it  but if the man will really think of himself of that which is inside him  of his own character his own honour his own dutythen he will say  well fed or ill fed well led or ill led praised and covered with  medals or neglected and forgotten and dying in a ditch i by myself i  am the same man and i have the same work to do  i have to bemyself  and i have to domy duty  so help me god  and therefore so help me  god i will be discontented with no person or thing save only with  myself and i will be discontented with myself not when i have left  undone something extraordinary which i know i could not have done but  only when i have left undone something ordinary some plain duty which i  know i could have done had i asked god to help me to do it  then in  that soldier would be fulfilledhas been fulfilled thank god a  thousand times by men who lie in this abbey and by men too of whom we  never heard whose graves are scattered far and wide by mount by  stream by seain him would be fulfilled i

word of the lord came unto me again saying  what mean ye that ye use this proverb concerning the land of israel  saying the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the childrens teeth are  set on edge  as i live saith the lord god ye shall not have occasion  any more to use this proverb in israel  behold all souls are mine as  the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine  the soul  that sinneth it shall die  this is a precious chapter and a comfortable chapter likewise for it  helps us to clear up a puzzle which has tormented the minds of men in all  ages whenever they have thought of god and of whether god meant them  well or meant them ill  for all men have been tempted  we are tempted at times to saythe  fathers have eaten sour grapes and the childrens teeth are set on edge   that is we are punished not for what we have done wrong but for what  our fathers did wrong  one man saysmy forefathers squandered their  money and i am punished by being poor  or my forefathers ruined their  constitutions and therefore i am weakly and sickly  my forefathers  were ignorant and reckless and therefore i was brought up ignorant  and in all sorts of temptation  and so men complain of their illluck  and bad chance as they call it till they complain of god and say as  the jews said in ezekiels time gods ways are unequalpartialunfair   he is a respecter of persons  he has not the same rule for all men  he  starts men unequally in the race of lifesome heavily weighted with  their fathers sins and misfortunes some helped in every way by their  fathers virtue and good fortuneand then he expects them all to run  alike  god is not just and equal  and then some go onmen who think  themselves philosophers but are noneto say things concerning god of  which i shall say nothing here lest i put into your minds foolish  thoughts which had best be kept out of them  but some of you may say is it not so after all  is it not true  is  not god harder on some than on others  does not god punish men every day  for their fathers sins  does he not say in the second commandment that  he will do so and visit the sins of the fathers upon the children to the  third and fourth generation and how can you make that agree with what  ezekiel saysthe son shall not bear the iniquity of the father  my  dear friends i know that this is a puzzle and always has been one   like the old puzzle of gods foreknowledge and our free will which seem  to contradict each other  like the puzzle that we must help ourselves  and yet that god must help us which seem to contradict each other  so  with this  i believe of it as of the two others i just mentioned that  there is no real contradiction between the two cases and that somewhen  somehow somewhere in the world to come we shall see them clearly  reconciled and justify god in all his dealings and glorify him in all  his ways  but surely already here now we may see our way somewhat  into the depths of this mystery  for christ has come to give us light  and in his light we may see light even into this dark matter  for see  god visits the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the  third and fourth generationbut of whomof them that hate him  now  by those who hate god is meant those who break his commandments and are  bad men  if so then i say that god is not only just but merciful in  visiting the sins of the fathers on the children  for consider two cases  suppose these bad men from father to son and  from son to grandson go on in the same evil ways and are incorrigible   then is not god merciful to the world in punishing them even in  destroying them out of the world where they only do harm  the world  does not want fools it wants wise men  the world does not want bad men  it wants good men and we ought to thank god if by his eternal laws he  gets rid of bad men for us and as the saying is civilizes them off the  face of the earth in the third or fourth generation  and god does so   if a family or a class or a whole nation becomes incorrigibly  profligate foolish base in three or four generations they will either  die out or vanish  they will sink to the bottom of society and become  miserably poor weak and of no influence and so unable to do harm to  any but themselves  whole families will sink thus i have seen it you  may have seen it  whole nations will sink thus as the jews sank in  ezekiels time and again in our lords time and be conquered trampled  on counted for nothing because they were worth nothing  but now suppose again that the children when their fathers sins are  visited on them are not incorrigible  suppose they are like the wise  son of whom ezekiel speaks in the 14th verse who seeth all his fathers  sins and considereth and doeth not such likethen has not god been  merciful and kind to him in visiting his fathers sins on him  he has   god is justified therein  his eternal laws of natural retribution  severe as they are have worked in love and in mercy if they have taught  the young man the ruinousness the deadliness of sin  have the fathers  sins made the son poor  then he learns not to make his children poor by  his sin  have his fathers sins made him unhealthy  then he learns not  to injure his childrens health  have his fathers sins kept him  ignorant or in anywise hindered his rise in life  then he learns the  value of a good education and perhaps stints himself to give his  children advantages which he had not himselfand as sure as he does so  the family begins to rise again after its fall  this is no fancy it is  fact  you may see it  i have seen it thank god  how some of the  purest and noblest women some of the ablest and most rightminded men  will spring from families will be reared in households where everything  was against themwhere there was everything to make them profligate  false reckless in a wordbadexcept the grace of god which was  trying to make them good and succeeded in making them good and how  though they have felt the punishment of their parents sins upon them in  many ways during their whole life yet that has been to them not a mere  punishment but a chastisement a purifying medicine a cross to be  borne which only stirred them up to greater watchfulness against sin to  greater earnestness in educating their children to greater activity and  energy in doing right and giving their children the advantages which  they had not themselves  and so were fulfilled in them two laws of god   the one which ezekiel lays downthat the bad mans son who executes  gods judgments and walks in gods statutes shall not die for the  iniquity of his father but surely live and the other law which moses  lays downthat god shews mercy unto thousands of generations as i  believe it meansthat is to son after father and son after father  again without endas long as they love him and keep his commandments  i do not therefore see that there is any real contradiction between  what moses says in the second commandment and what ezekiel says in this  chapter  they are but two different sides of the same truth and moses  is shewing the jews one side because they needed most to be taught that  in his time and ezekiel showing them the other because that was the  teaching which they needed most then  for they were fancying themselves  in their calamities the victims of some blind and cruel fate and had  forgotten that when god said that he visited the sins of the fathers on  the children he qualified it by saying of them that hate me  therefore be hopeful about yourselves and hopeful about your children  after you  if any one here feelsi am fallen very low in the world here all has been so much against memy parents were the ruin of melet  him remember this one word of ezekiel  have i any pleasure at all that  the wicked should die saith the lord god  and not that he should return  from his ways and live  let him turn from his fathers evil ways and  do that which is lawful and right and then he can say with the prophet  in answer to all the strokes of fortune and the miseries of circumstance  rejoice not against me o mine enemy  when i fall i shall arise   provided he will remember that god requires of all men something which  is to be as good as they can be then he may remember also that our lord  himself says unto whomsoever much is given of him shall much be  required implying that to whom little is given of him will little be  required  gods ways are not unequal  he has one equal fair and just  rule for every human being and that is perfect understanding perfect  sympathy perfect good will and therefore perfect justice and perfect  love  and if any one of you answers in his heartthese are good words and all  very well  but they come too late  i am too far gone  i ate the sour  grapes in my youth and my teeth must be on edge for ever and ever  i  have been a bad man or i have been a foolish woman too many years to  mend now  i am down and down i must be  i have made my bed and i must  lie on it and die on it too  oh my dear brother or sister in christ  whoever you are who says that unsay it again for it is not true   ezekiel tells you that it is not true and one greater than ezekiel  jesus christ your saviour your lord your god tells you it is not  true  for what happens by gods eternal and unchangeable laws of retribution  to a whole nation or a whole family may happen to youto each  individual man  they fall by sin they rise again by repentance and  amendment  they may rise punished by their sins and punished for a long  time heavily weighted by the consequences of their own folly and  heavily weighted for a long time  but they risethey enter into their  new life weak and wounded from their own fault  but they enter in  and  from that day things begin to mendthe weather begins to clear the soil  begins to yield againpunishment gradually ceases when it has done its  work the weight lightens the wounds heal the weakness strengthens and  by gods grace within them and by gods providence outside them they  are made men of again and saved  so you will surely find it in the  experience of life  no doubt in general in most cases   the child is father of the man   for good and evil  a pious and virtuous youth helps by sure laws of  god towards a pious and virtuous old age  and on the other hand an  ungodly and profligate youth leads by the same laws toward an ungodly  and profligate old age  that is the law  but there is another law which  may stop that lawjust as the stone falls to the ground by the natural  law of weight and yet you may stop that law by using the law of bodily  strength and holding it up in your hand  and what is the gracious law  which will save you from the terrible law which will make you go on from  worse to worse  it is thiswhen the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that  he hath committed and doeth that which is lawful and right he shall  save his soul alive  it is not said that his soul shall come in a  moment to perfect health and strength  no  there are old bad habits to  be got rid of old ties to be broken old debts often worse debts than  any money debts to be paid  but he shall save his soul alive  his soul  shall not die of its disease  it shall be saved  it shall come to life  and gradually mend and be cured and grow from strength to strength as a  sick man mends day by day after a deadly illness slowly it may be but  surelyfor how can you fail of being cured if your physician is none  other than jesus christ your lord and your god  oh recollect that last word  if you will but recollect that you will  never despair  how dare any man saybad i am and bad i must remain while the god who made heaven and earth offers to make you good  who  dare sayi cannot amendwhen god himself offers to amend you  who  dare sayi have no strength to amendwhen god offers to give you  strength strength of his strength and life of his life even his holy  spirit  who dare saygod has given me up he has a grudge against me  which he will not lay by an anger against me which cannot be appeased a  score against me which will never be wiped out of his book  oh foolish  and fainthearted soul  look look at christ hanging on his cross and  see there what gods grudge gods anger gods score of your sins is  like  like love unspeakable and nothing else  to wash out your sins  he spared not his only begotten son but freely gave him for you to shew  you that god so far from hating you has loved you that so far from  being your enemy he was your father that so far from willing the death  of a sinner he willed that you and every sinner should turn from his  wickedness and live  for that jesus the only begotten son of god came  down and preached and sorrowed and suffered and died upon the cross   he died that you may live he suffered that you may be saved he paid the  debt because you could never pay it he bore your sins upon the cross  that you might not have to bear them for ever and for ever in eternal  death  now even if you suffer somewhat in this life for your sins that  suffering is not punishment but wholesome chastisement as when a father  chastens the son in whom he delighteth  all he asks of you is to long  and try to give up your sins for he will help you to give them up  all  he asks of you is to long and try to lead a new life for he will give  you power to lead a new life  oh say noti cannotwhen christ who  died for you says you can  say noti dare notwhen christ bids you  dare come boldly to his throne of grace  say noti must be as i am when christ died that you should not be as you are  say notthere is no  hopewhen christ died and rose again and reigns for ever to give hope  to you and all mankind that when the wicked man turns away from his  wickedness that he has committed and doeth that which is lawful and  right he shall save his soul alive and all his transgressions shall not  be mentioned unto him but in his righteousness that he hath done shall  he live    sermon xxvii  agree with thine adversary    eversley 1861  windsor castle 1867  st matthew v 25 26  agree with thine adversary quickly whiles thou  art in the way with him lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to  the judge and the judge deliver thee to the officer and thou be cast  into prison  verily i say unto thee thou shalt by no means come out  thence till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing  this parable our lord seems to have spoken at least twice as he did  several others  for we find it also in the 12th chapter of st luke   but it is there part of quite a different discourse  i think that by  seeing what it means there we shall see more clearly what it means here  our lord there is speaking of the sins of the whole jewish nation  here  he is speaking rather of each mans private sins  but he applies the  same parable to both  he gives the same warning to both  not to go too  far on the wrong road lest they come to a point where they cannot turn  back but must go on to just punishment if not to utter destruction  that is what he warned the jews all through the latter part of the 12th  chapter of luke  he will come again he says at an hour they do not  think of and then if their elders the scribes and pharisees are going  on as they are now beating the manservants and maidservants and  eating and drinking with the drunken oppressing the people and living  in luxury and profligacy he will cut them asunder and appoint them  their portion with the unbelievers  in this and in many other parables he had been warning them that their  ruin was near and at last turning to the whole crowd he appeals to  them to their common sense  when ye see a cloud rise out of the west  straightway ye say there cometh a shower and so it is  and when ye see  the south wind blow ye say there will be heat and it cometh to pass   ye hypocrites ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth but  how is it that ye do not discern this time  if god can give you common  sense about one thing why not about another  why can you not open your  eyes and of yourselves judge what is right  agree with thine adversary  quickly whiles thou art in the way with him lest at any time the  adversary deliver thee to the judge and the judge deliver thee to the  officer and thou be cast into prison  verily i say unto thee thou  shalt by no means come out thence till thou hast paid the uttermost  farthing  so he spoke and they did not fully understand what he meant  they  thought that by their adversary he meant the roman governor  for they  immediately began to talk to him about some galileans whose blood pilate  the roman governor had mingled with their sacrifices i suppose in some  of those wars which were continually breaking out in judea  i think he  meant more than that  suppose ye that these galilaeans were sinners  above all the galilaeans  except ye repent ye shall all likewise  perish  as much as to say though ye did not rebel against the romans  like these galilaeans you have your sins which will ruin you  as long  as you are hypocrites with your mouths full of the cant of religion and  your hearts full of all mean and spiteful passions as long as you cannot  of yourselves discern what is right and have lost conscience and the  everlasting distinction between right and wrong so long are you walking  blindfold to ruin  there is an adversary against you who will surely  deliver you to the judge some day and then it will be too late to cry  for mercy  and who was that adversary  who but the everlasting law of  god which says thou shalt do justlyand you jews are utterly unjust  false covetous and unrighteous  thou shalt love all men and you are  cruel and spiteful hating each other and making all mankind hate you   thou shalt walk humbly with thy god and you jews are walking proudly  with god fancying that god belongs only to you that because you are his  chosen people he will let you commit every sin you choose as long as  you keep his name on your lips and keep up an empty worship of him in  the temple  that is your adversary the everlasting moral law of god   and who is the judge but god himself who is set on his throne judging  right while you are doing wrong  and who is the officer to whom that  judge will deliver you  there indeed the jews were right  it was the  romans whom god appointed to punish them for their sins  all which our  lord had foretold as all the world knows came true forty years after in  that horrible siege of jerusalem which the jews brought on themselves  entirely by their own folly and pride and wicked lawlessness  in that  siege by famine and pestilence by the romans swords by crucifixion  and by each others hands for the different factions were murdering each  other wholesale up to the very day jerusalem was taken thousands of  jews perished horribly and the rest were sold as slaves over the face of  the whole earth and led away into a captivity from which they could not  escape till they had paid the uttermost farthing  now let us look at this same parable in the 5th chapter of st matthew   remember first that it is part of the sermon on the mount which is all  about not doctrine but morality the law of right and wrong the law of  justice and mercy  you will see then that our lord is preaching against  the same sins as in the 12th chapter of st luke  against a hypocritical  religion joined with a cruel and unjust heart  those of old time the  scribes and pharisees said merely thou shalt not kill  and as long as  thou dost not kill thy brother thou mayest hate him in thy heart and  speak evil of him with thy lips  but our lord says not so  whosoever  is angry with his brother without a cause is in danger of the judgment   whosoever shall say to him raca or worthless fellow shall speak  insolently brutally cruelly scornfully to him is in danger of the  council  but whosoever shall say unto him thou fool is in danger of  hell fire  for using that word to the jews so says the talmudic  tradition moses and aaron were shut out of the land of promise for it  means an infidel an atheist a godless man or rebel against god as it  is written the fool hath said in his heart there is no god  whosoever  shall curse his brother who is trying to be a good christian man to the  best of his light and power because he does not happen to agree with him  in all things and call him a heretic and an infidel and an atheist  and an enemy of godhe is in danger of hell fire  let him agree with  his adversary quickly whiles he is in the way with him lest he be  delivered to god the judge and to the just punishment of him who has not  done justly not loved mercy not walked humbly with his god  but who is the adversary of that man and who is the judge and who is  the officer  our adversary in every case whenever we do wrong  knowingly or unknowingly is the law of god the everlasting laws by  which god has ordered every thing in heaven and earth and as often as we  break one of these laws let us agree with it again as quickly as we can  lest it hale us before god the judge of all and he deliver us over to  his officerto those powers of nature and powers of spirit which he has  appointed as ministers of his vengeance and they cast us into some  prison of necessary and unavoidable misery from which we shall never  escape till we have paid the uttermost farthing  do you not understand me  then i will give you an example  suppose the  case of a man hurting his health by selfindulgence of any kind  then  his adversaries are the laws of health  let him agree with them quickly  while he has the power of conquering his bad habits by recovering his  health lest the time come when his own sins deliver him up to god his  judge and god to his terrible officers of punishment the laws of  disease and they cast him into a prison of shame and misery from which  there is no escapeshame and misery most common perhaps among the lower  classes  but not altogether confined to themthe weakened body the  bleared eye the stupified brain the premature death the children  unhealthy from their parents sins despising their parents and perhaps  copying their vices at the same time  many a man have i seen in that  prison fast bound with misery though not with iron and how he was to  pay his debt and escape out of it i know not though i hope that god does  know  are any of you again in the habit of cheating your neighbours or  dealing unfairly by them  your adversary is the everlasting law of  justice which says do as you would be done by for with what measure  you mete to others it shall be measured to you again  this may show you how a bodily sin like selfindulgence punishes itself  by bringing a man into bondage of bodily misery from which he cannot  escape and in the same way a spiritual sin like want of charity will  bring a man into spiritual bondage from which he cannot escape  and  this as in bodily sins it will do by virtue of that mysterious and  terrible officer of god which we call habit  habit by which we cannot  tell how our having done a thing once becomes a reason for our doing it  again and again after that till if the habit be once formed we cannot  help doing that thing and become enslaved to it and fast bound by it  in a prison from which there is no escape  look for instance at the case  of the untruthful man  let him beware in time  who is his adversary   facts are his adversary  he says one thing and fact says another and a  very stubborn and terrible adversary fact is  the day will come most  probably in this life when facts will bring that untruthful man before  god and before men likewiseand cryjudge between us which of us is  right and there will come to that false man exposure and shame and a  worse punishment still perhaps if he have let the habit grow too strong  on him and have not agreed with his adversary in time  for have you not seen alas you have too surely seen men who had  contracted such a habit of falsehood that they could not shake it off who had played with their sense of truth so long that they had almost  forgotten what truth meant men who could not speak without mystery  concealment prevarication halfstatements who were afraid of the plain  truth not because there was any present prospect of its hurting them  but simply because it was the plain truthchildren of darkness who  from long habit hated the lightand who though they had been found out  and exposed could not amendcould not become simple honest and  truthfulcould not escape from the prison of their own bad habits and  the net of lies which they had spread round their own path till they had  paid the uttermost penalty for their deceit  look again at the case of the uncharitable man in the habit of forming  harsh and cruel judgments of his neighbours  then his adversary is the  everlasting law of love which will surely at last punish him by the  most terrible of all punishmentsloss of love to man and therefore to  god  are we not i am i know may god forgive me for it apt to be  angry with our brethren without a cause out of mere peevishness  let us  beware in time  are we not apt to say to them racato speak cruelly  contemptuously fiercely of them if they thwart us  let us beware in  time still more  are we not worst of all tempted as i too often am to  say to them thou fool to call better men more useful men more pure  men more pious men than ourselves hard and cruel names names from  which they would shrink with horror because they cannot see christian  truth in just exactly the same light that we do  oh let us beware then   beware lest the everlasting laws of justice and fairness between man and  man of love and charity between man and man which we have broken  should some day deliver us up as they delivered those bigoted jews of  old to god our judge and he deliver our souls to his most terrible  officers who are called envy hatred malice and all uncharitableness  and they thrust us into that blackest of all prisons on the gate of  which is written hardness of heart and contempt of gods word and  commandments and within which is the outer darkness into which if a man  falls he cannot see the difference between right and wrong  but calls  evil good and good evil like his companions in the outer darkness namely the devil and his angels  oh let us who are coming to lay our  gift upon gods altar at this approaching christmas tide consider  whether our brother hath aught against us in any of these matters and  if so let us leave our gift upon the altar and be first reconciled to  our brother in heart at least and with inward shame and confession  and contrition and resolution to amend  but we can only do that by  recollecting what gift we are to leave on christs altarthat it is the  gift of self the sacrifice of ourselves with all our selfishness  pride conceit spite cruelty  ourselves with all our sins we are to  lay upon christs altar that our sins may be nailed to his cross and  washed clean in his blood everlastingly consumed in the fire of his  spirit the pure spirit of love which is the charity of god that so  self being purged out of us we may become holy and lively sacrifices to  god parts and parcels of that perfect sacrifice which christ offered up  for the sins of the whole worldeven the sacrifice of himself    sermon xxviii  st john the baptist    chester cathedral 1872  st luke iii 2 3 7 914  the word of god came unto john the son of  zacharias in the wilderness  and he came into all the country about  jordan preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins     then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him  o generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to  come  bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance     and now  also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees  every tree therefore  that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire   and the people asked him saying what shall we do then  he answereth and  saith unto them he that hath two coats let him impart to him that hath  none and he that hath meat let him do likewise  then came also  publicans to be baptized unto them and said unto him master what shall  we do  and he said exact no more than that which is appointed you  and  the soldiers likewise demanded of him saying and what shall we do  and  he said unto them do violence to no man neither accuse any falsely and  be content with your wages  this is st john baptists day  let me say a very few wordswhere many  might be saidabout one of the noblest personages who ever has appeared  on this earth  our blessed lord said among them that are born of women there hath not  risen a greater than john the baptist notwithstanding he that is least  in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he  these are serious words  for which of us dare to say that we are greater than john the baptist  but let us at least think a while what john the baptist was like  so we  shall gain at least the sight of an ideal man  it is not the highest  ideal  our lord tells us that plainly and we as christians should  know that it is not  the ideal man is our lord christ himself and none  other  still he that has not mounted the lower step of the heavenly  stair has certainly not mounted the higher and therefore if we have  not attained to the likeness of john the baptist still more we have not  attained to the likeness of christ  what then was john the baptist  like  what picture of him and his character can we form to ourselves in  our own imaginations for that is all we have to picture him byhelped always remember thatby the holy spirit of god who helps the  imagination the poetic and dramatic faculty of men just as much as he  helps the logical and argumentative faculty to see things and men as they  really are by the spirit of love which also is the spirit of true  understanding  how then shall we picture john the baptist to ourselves  great  painters greater than the world seems likely to see again have  exercised their fancy upon his face his figure his actions  we must  put out of our minds i fear at once many of the loveliest of them all   those in which raffaelle and others have depicted the child john in his  camels hair raiment with a childs cross in his hand worshipping the  infant christ  there is also one exquisite picture by annibale caracci  if i recollect rightly in which the blessed babe is lying asleep and  the blessed virgin signs to st john pressing forward to adore him not  to awaken his sleeping lord and god  but such imaginations beautiful as  they are and true in a heavenly and spiritual sense which therefore is  true eternally for you and me and all mankind are not historic fact   for st john the baptist said himself and i knew him not  he may have been we must almost say he must have been brought up with  or near our lord  he may have seen in him such a child we must believe  that as he never saw before  he knew him at least to be a princely  child of davids royal line  but he was not conscious of who and what  he was till the mysterious inner voice of whom he gives only the  darkest hints said to him upon whom thou shalt see the spirit  descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the  holy ghost  and i saw and bare record that this is the son of god  but  what manner of man was st john the baptist in the meantime  painters  have tried their hands at drawing him and we thank them  pictures says  st augustine are the books of the unlearned  and my friends when  great painters paint they are the books of the toolearned likewise   they bring us back bring us home by one glance at a human face a human  figure a human scene of action out of our philosophies and criticisms  and doctrines which narrow our hearts without widening our heads to  the deeper facts of humanity and therefore to the deeper facts of  theology likewise  but what picture of st john the baptist shall we  choose whereby to represent him to ourselves as the forerunner of the  incarnate god  the best which i can recollect is the great picture by guidoah that he  had painted always as wisely and as wellof the magnificent lad sitting  on the rock half clad in his camels hair robe his stalwart hand lifted  up to denounce he hardly knows what save that things are going all  wrong utterly wrong to him his beautiful mouth open to preach he  hardly knows what save that he has a message from god of which he is  halfconscious as yetthat he is a forerunner a prophet a foreteller  of something and some one which is to come and which yet is very near at  hand  the wild rocks are round him the clear sky is over him and  nothing more  he the gentleman born the clergyman bornfor you must  recollect who and what st john the baptist was and that he was neither  democrat nor vulgar demagogue nor flatterer of ignorant mobs but a man  of an ancestry as ancient and illustrious as it was civilised and bound  by long ties of duty of patriotism of religion and of the temple  worship of godhe the noble and the priest has thrown offnot in  discontent and desperation but in hope and aweall his family  privileges all that seems to make life worth having and there aloft and  in the mountains alone with nature and with god feeding on locusts and  wild honey and whatsoever god shall send and clothed in skins he like  elijah of old renews not merely the habits but the spirit and power of  elijah and preaches to a generation sunk in covetousness and  superstition party spirit and the rest of the seven devils which  brought on the fall of his native land and which will bring on the fall  of every land on earth preaches to them i saywhat  the most common let me say boldly the most vulgarin the good old  sense of the wordthe most vulgar morality  he tells them that an awful  ruin was coming unless they repented and mended  how fearfully true his  words were the next fifty years proved  the axe he said was laid to  the root of the tree and the axe was the heathen roman even then master  of the land  but god not the roman caesar merely was laying the axe   and he was a good god who only wanted goodness which he would preserve  not badness which he would destroy  therefore men must not merely  repent and do penance they must bring forth fruits meet for penance do  right instead of doing wrong lest they be found barren trees and be cut  down and cast into that everlasting fire of god which thanks be to his  holy name burns for everunquenchable by all mens politics and  systems and political or other economies to destroy out of gods  kingdom all that offendeth and whatsoever loveth and maketh a lie oppressors quacks cheats hypocrites and the rest  the peoplethe farming classcame to him with what shall we do  the  young priest and nobleman in his garment of camels hair has nothing  but plain morality for them  he that hath two coats let him impart to  him that hath none and he that hath meat let him do likewise  the  publicans the renegades who were farming the taxes of the roman  conquerors and making their base profit out of their countrymens  slavery came to himmaster what shall we do  he does not tell them  not to be publicans  he does not tell his countrymen to rebel though he  must have been sorely tempted to do it  all he says is make the bad and  base arrangement as good as you can exact no more than that which is  appointed you  the soldiers poor fellows come to him  whether they  were herods mercenaries or real gallant roman soldiers we are not  told  either had unlimited power under a military despotism in an  anarchic and halfenslaved country but whichever they were he has the  same answer to them of common morality  you are what you are you are  where you are  do it as well as you can  do no violence to any man  neither accuse any man falsely and be content with your wages  ah wise politician ah clear and rational spirit who knows and tells  others to do the duty which lies nearest them who sees as old greek  hesiod says how much bigger the half is than the whole who in the  hour of his countrys deepest degradation had divine courage to say our  deliverance lies not in rebellion but in doing right  but he has  sterner words  pharisees the separatists the religious men who think  themselves holier than any one else and sadducees materialist men of  the world who sneer at the unseen the unknown the heroic come to him   and for pharisee and sadduceefor the man who prides himself on  believing more than his neighbours and for the man who prides himself on  believing lesshe has the same answer  both are exclusives inhuman  while they are pretending to be more than human  he knew them well for  he was born and bred among them and he forestalls our lords words to  them o generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath  to come  at last his preaching of common morality is put to the highest test  the  kingthe tyrant as we should call himthe herod of the day an usurper  neither a son of david nor a king chosen by the people tries to  patronize him  the old spirit of his forefather aaron of his forefather  phineas the spirit of levi which rightly understood is the spirit of  god flashes up in the young priestly prophet in the old form of common  morality  it is not lawful for thee to have thy brothers wife  we  know the rest how at the request of herodias daughter herod sent and  beheaded john in prison and how she took his head in a charger and  brought it to her mother  great painters have shown us again and again  the last actoutwardly hideous but really beautifulof st johns  heroic drama in a picture of the lovely dancing girl with the prophets  head in a chargera dreadful picture and yet one which needed to be  painted for it was a terrible fact and is still and will be till this  wicked worlds end a matter for pity and tears rather than for  indignation  the most perfect representations certainly the most  tragical i know of it are those which are remarkable not for their  expression but for their want of expressionthe young girl in brocade  and jewels with the gory head in her hands thinking of nothing out of  those wide vacant foolish eyes save the triumph of selfsatisfied  vanity for the spite and revenge is not in her but in her wicked  mother  she is just the very creature who if she had been better  trained and taught what john the baptist really was might have  reverenced him worshipped him and ministered unto him  alas alas how  do the follies of poor humanity repeat themselves in every age  the  butterfly has killed the lion without after all meaning much harm  ah  that such human butterflies would take warning by the fate of herodias  daughter and see how mere vanity will lead if indulged too long and too  freely to awful crime  one knows the old storieshow herod and herodias and the vain foolish  girl fell into disgrace with the emperor and were banished into  provence and died in want and misery  one knows too the old legends  how herodias daughter reappears in south europeeven in old german  legendsas the witchgoddess fair and ruinous sweeping for ever  through wood and wold at night with her troop of fiends tempting the  traveller to dance with them till he dies a name for ever accursed  through its own vanity rather than its own deliberate sin from which may  god preserve us all men as well as women  so two women one wicked and  one vain did all they could to destroy one of the noblest human beings  who ever walked this earth  and what did they do  they did not prevent  his being the forerunner and prophet of the incarnate son of god  they  did not prevent his being the master and teacher of the blessed apostle  st john who was his spiritual son and heir  they did not prevent his  teaching all men and women to whom god gives grace to understand him  that the true repentance the true conversion the true deliverance from  the wrath to come the true entrance into the kingdom of heaven the true  way to christ and to god is common morality  and now let us bless gods holy name for all his servants departed in his  faith and fear and especially for his servant st john the baptist  beseeching him to give us grace so to follow his doctrine and holy life  that we may truly repent after his preaching and after his example  may  the lord forgive our exceeding cowardice and help us constantly to speak  the truth boldly rebuke vice and patiently suffer for the truths sake  through jesus christ our lord  amen    sermon xxix  the present recompense    chester cathedral nave service evening  may 1872  proverbs xi 31  behold the righteous shall be recompensed in the  earth  much more the wicked and the sinner  this is the keynote of the book of proverbsthat men are punished or  rewarded according to their deeds in this life nay it is the keynote  of the whole old testament  the eyes of the lord are over the  righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers the countenance of  the lord is against them that do evil to root out the remembrance of  them from the earth  but here at the beginning of my sermon i can fancy some one ready to  crystay you have spoken too strongly  that is not the keynote of the  whole old testament  there are words in it of quite a different note words which complain to god that the good are not rewarded and the  wicked are not punished  as for instance when the psalmist says how the  ungodly men of this evil world are filled with gods hid treasure and  how they have children at their desire and leave the rest of their  substance for their babes  and again i was envious at the foolish  when i saw the prosperity of the wicked  for there are no bands in their  death but their strength is firm  they are not in trouble as other men  neither are they plagued like other men     they set their mouth  against the heavens and their tongue walketh through the earth   therefore his people return hither and waters of a full cup are wrung  out to them  and they say how doth god know and is there knowledge in  the most high  and though the psalmist says that such persons will come  to a sudden and fearful end yet he confesses that so long as they live  they have prospered while he had been punished all day long and  chastened every morning  and do we not know that so it is  is it not  obvious now and has it not been notorious in every country and in all  times that so it is  do not good men often lead lives of poverty and  affliction  do not men make large fortunes or rise to fame and power  by base and wicked means and do not those same men often enough die in  their beds and leave children behind them and found families who  prosper for generations after they are dead  how were they recompensed  in the earth  now this is one of the puzzles of life which tries a  mans faith in god as it tried the psalmists and prophets in old time   but that the text speaks truth i do not doubt  i believe that the  prosperous bad man is recompensed in the earthis punished in this life often with the most terrible of all punishmentsimpunity the not being  punished at all which is the worst thing in this life which can happen  to a sinner  but i am not going to speak of that but rather of the  first part of the text the righteous shall be recompensed in the  earth  now is not the answer to the puzzle this  that god is impartial that he  is no respecter of persons but causing his sun to shine on the evil and  on the good and his rain to fall on the just and on the unjust and so  rewarding every man according to his work paying him for all work done  of whatever kind it may be  some work for this world which we do see  and god gives them what they earn in this life some work for the world  above which we cannot see and god gives them what they earn in this  life for ever and ever likewise  if a man wishes for treasure on earth  he can have it if he will and enjoy it as long as it lasts  if a man  wishes for treasure in heaven he can have it if he will and enjoy it as  long as it lasts  god deals fairly with both and pays both what they  have earned  some set their hearts on this world some want money some want power  some want fame and admiration from their fellowmen some want merely to  amuse themselves  then they will have what they want if they will take  the right way to get it  if a man wishes to make a large fortune and  die rich he will very probably succeed if he will only follow  diligently the laws and rules by which god has appointed that money  should be made  if a man longs for power and glory and must needs be  admired and obeyed by his fellowmen he can have his wish if he will go  the right way to get what he longs for especially in a free country like  this he will get most probably just as much of them as he deservesthat  is as much as he has talent and knowledge enough to earn  so did the  pharisees in our lords time  they wanted power fame and money as  religious leaders and they knew how to get them as well as any men who  ever lived and they got them  our lord did not deny that  they had  their reward he said  they succeededthose old phariseesin being  looked up to as the masters of the jewish mob and in crucifying our lord  himself  they had their reward and so may you and i  if we want any  earthly thing and have knowledge of the way to get it and have ability  and perseverance enough then we shall very probably get it and much  good it will do us when we have got it after all  we shall have had our  treasure upon earth and our hearts likewise and when we come to die we  shall leave both our treasure and our hearts behind us and the lord have  mercy on our souls  but again there are those thank god who have or are at least trying  to get treasure in heaven which they may carry away with them when they  die and keep for ever  and who are they  those who are longing and  trying to be true and to be good who have seen how beautiful it is to be  true and to be good to know god and the will of god to love god and the  will of god and therefore to copy his likeness and to do his will   those who long for sanctification and who desire to be holy even as  their father in heaven is holy and perfect even as their father in  heaven is perfect and who therefore think as st paul bade them of  whatsoever things are just true pure lovely and of good report if  there be any true manhood and if there be any just praisein three  wordswho seek after whatsoever is true beautiful and good  these are  they that have treasure in heaven  for what is really true really  beautiful really good is also really heavenly  god alone is perfect  good beautiful and true and heaven is heaven because it is filled with  the glory of his goodness his beauty and his truth  but wherever there  is a soul on earth led by the spirit of god and filled by the spirit of  god with good and beautiful and true graces and inspirations there is a  soul which as st paul says is sitting in heavenly places with christ  jesusa soul which is already in heaven though still on earth  we  confess it by our own words  we speak of a heavenly character we speak  even of a heavenly countenance and we speak right  we see that that  character though it be still imperfect and marred by human weaknesses  is already good with the goodness which comes down from heaven and that  that countenance though it may be mean and plain is already beautiful  with the beauty which comes down from heaven  but how are such souls recompensed in the earth  oh my friends is not  a man recompensed in the earth whenever he can lift up his heart above  the earthwhenever he can lift up his heart unto the lord and behold  his glory above all the earth  does not this earth look brighter to him  then  the world of man looks brighter to him in spite of all its sins  and sorrows for he sees the lord ruling it the lord forgiving it the  lord saving it  he sees by the eye of faith the lord fulfilling his  own promisewhere two or three are gathered together in my name there  am i in the midst of them and he takes heart and hope for the poor  earth and says the earth is not deserted mankind is not without a  father a saviour a teacher a king  bad men and bad spirits are not  the masters of the world and men are not as creeping things as the  fishes of the sea which have no ruler over them  for christ has not  left his church  he reigns and will reign till he has put all enemies  under his feet and cast out of his kingdom all that offend and  whatsoever loveth and maketh a lie and then the heavenly treasure will  be the only treasure for whatsoever things are just whatsoever things  are true pure lovely and of good report if there be any valour and  if there be any praise those things and they alone will be left in the  kingdom of christ and of god  is not that man recompensed in the earth   must he not rise each morning to go about his daily work with a more  cheerful heart saying with jeremiah in like case upon this i awaked  and beheld and my sleep was sweet to me  yes i see in experience that the righteous man is recompensed in the  earth every day and all day long  in proportion as a mans mind is  heavenly just so much will he enjoy this beautiful earth and all that  is therein  i believe that if a man walks with god then he can walk  nowhither without seeing and hearing what the ungodly and bad man will  never see and hear because his eyes are blinded and his heart hardened  from thinking of himself his own selfish wants his own selfish sins   which for instance was the happier manwhich the man who was the more  recompensed in the earth this very daythe poor man who went for his  sunday walk into the country thinking of little but the sins and the  follies of the week past and probably of the sins and the follies of the  week to come or the man who went with a clear conscience and had the  heart to thank god for the green grass and the shining river and the  misty mountains sleeping far away and notice the song of the birds and  the scent of the flowers as a little child might do and know that his  father in heaven had made all these  yes my friends christ is very near us though our eyes are holden by  our own sins and therefore we see him not  but just in proportion as a  man walks with god just in proportion as the eyes of his soul are opened  by the spirit of god he recovers i believe the privilege which adam  lost when he fell  he hears the word of the lord walking among the trees  of the garden in the cool of the day and instead of trying like guilty  adam to hide himself from his maker answers with reverence and yet  with joy speak lord for thy servant heareth  nay i would go further still and say is not the righteous man  recompensed on the earth every time he hears a strain of noble music  to  him who has his treasure in heaven music speaks about that treasure  things far too deep for words  music speaks to him of whatsoever is  just true pure lovely and of good report of whatsoever is manful and  ennobling of whatsoever is worthy of praise and honour  music to that  man speaks of a divine order and a divine proportion of a divine  harmony through all the discords and confusions of men of a divine  melody through all the cries and groans of sin and sorrow  what says a  wiser and a better man than i shall ever be and that not of noble music  but of such as we may hear any day in any street  even that vulgar  music he says which makes one man merry another mad strikes in me a  deep fit of devotion and a profound contemplation of god the first  composer  there is something more of divinity in it than the ear  discovers  it is an hieroglyphical and shadowed lesson of the whole  world and of the creatures of god  such a melody to the ear as the  whole world well understood would afford to the understanding  that  man i insist was indeed recompensed on the earth when music which is  to the ungodly and unrighteous the most earthly of all arts which to the  heathens and the savages to frivolous and profligate persons only  tempts to silly excitement or to brutal passion was to him as the speech  of angels a remembrancer to him of that eternal and everpresent heaven  from which all beauty truth and goodness are shed forth over the  universe from the glory of the everblessed trinityfather son and  holy spirit  does any one saythese things are too high for me i cannot understand  them  my dear friends are they not too high for me likewise  do you  fancy that i understand them though my reason as well as holy  scripture tells me that they are true  i understand them no more than i  understand how i draw a single breath or think a single thought  but it  is good for you and for me and for every man now and then to hear  things which we do not understand that so we may learn our own  ignorance and be lifted up above ourselves and renounce our fancied  worldly wisdom and think within ourselveswould it not be wiser to  confess ourselves fools and take our lords advice and be converted  and become as little children  for otherwise our lord says we shall in  nowise enter into this very kingdom of heaven of which i have been  telling you  for this is one of the things which god hides from the wise  and prudent and yet revealeth unto babes  yes that is the way to  understand all things however deepto become as little children  a  little child proves that all i say is true and that it knows that all i  say is true  though it cannot put its feelings into words it acts on  them by a mere instinct which is the gift of god  why does a little  child pick flowers  why does a little child dance when it hears a strain  of music  and deeper still why does a little child know when it has  done wrong  why does it love to hear of things beautiful and noble and  shrink from things foul and mean if what i say is not true  the child  does so because it is nearer heaven not further off than we grown  folk  ah that we would all lay to heart what one said of old who walked with  god   dear soul couldst thou become a child once more on earth meek undefiled then paradise were round thee here and god himself for ever near    sermon xxx  the kingdom of heaven    chapel royal st james 1873  st matt xxii 27  the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king  which made a marriage for his son and sent forth his servants to call  them that were bidden to the wedding  and they would not come  again  he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden behold  i have prepared my dinner  my oxen and fatlings are killed and all  things are ready  come unto the marriage  but they made light of it  and went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandise  and  the remnant took his servants and entreated them spitefully and slew  them  but when the king heard thereof he was wroth  and he sent forth  his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city  this parable if we understand it aright will help to teach us theology that is the knowledge of god and of the character of god  for it is a  parable concerning the kingdom of heaven and the laws and customs of the  kingdom of heaventhat is the spiritual and eternal laws by which god  governs men  now what any kingdom or government is like must needs depend on what the  king or governor of it is like at least if that king is allpowerful  and can do what he likes  his laws will be like his character  if he be  good he will make good laws  if he be bad he will make bad laws  if  he be harsh and cruelif he be careless and indulgentso will his laws  be  if he be loving and generous delighting in seeing his subjects  happy then his laws will be so shaped that his subjects will be happy  if they obey those laws  but alsoand this is a very serious matter  and one to which foolish people in all ages have tried to shut their  eyes and false preachers in all ages have tried to blind mens eyes also i say if his laws be good and bountiful and sure to make men  happy then the good king will have those laws obeyed  he will not be an  indulgent king for in his case to be indulgent will be cruelty and  nothing less  the good king will not sayi have given you laws by  which you may live happy but i do not care whether you obey them or not   i have as it were set you up in life and given you advantages by  which you may prosper if you use them but i do not care whether you use  them or not  for to say that would be as much as to say that i do not  care if you make yourselves miserable and make others miserable  likewise  the good king will sayyou shall obey my laws for they are  for your good  you shall use my gifts for they are for your good  and  if you do not i will punish you  you shall respect my authority  and  if you do notif you go too far if you become wanton and cruel and  destroy your fellowsubjects unjustly off the face of the earth then i  will destroy you off the face of he earth and burn up your city  i will  destroy any government or system of society which you set up in  opposition to my good and just laws  and if you merely despise the  gifts and refuse to use themthen i will cast you out of my kingdom  inside which is freedom and happiness and light and knowledge into the  darkness outside bound hand and foot into the ignorance and brutal  slavery which you have chosen where you may reconsider yourself weeping  and gnashing your teeth as you discover what a fool you have been  our lords parable has fulfilled itself again and again in history and  will fulfil itself as long as foolish and rebellious persons exist on  earth  this is one of the laws of the kingdom of heaven  it must be so  for it arises by necessity out of the character of christ the king of  heaveninfinite bounty and generosity but if that bounty be despised  and insulted or still more if it be outraged by wanton tyranny or  cruelty thenfor the benefit of the rest of mankindawful severity   so it is and so it must be simply because god is good  at least this is the kind of king which the parable shows to us  the  king in it begins not by asking his subjects to pay him taxes or even  to do him service but to come to a great feasta high court ceremonial the marriage of his son  whatsoever else that may mean it certainly  means thisthat the king intended to treat these men not as his slaves  but as his guests and friends  they will not come  they are too busy  one over his farm another over his merchandise  they owe remember  safe possession of their farm and safe transit for their merchandise to  the king who governs and guards the land  but they forget that and  refuse his invitation  some of them seemingly out of mere insolence  and the spirit of rebellion against authority just because it is  authority go a step too far  to show that they are their own masters  and intend to do what they like they take the kings messengers and  treat them spitefully and kill them  then there arises in that king a noble indignation  we do not read that  the king sentimentalised over these rebels and saidafter all their  evil like all evil is only a lower form of good  they had a fine  instinct of freedom and independence latent in them only it was in this  case somewhat perverted  they are really only to be pitied for knowing  no better but i trust by careful education to bring them to a clearer  sense of their own interests  i shall therefore send them to a  reformatory where in consideration of the depressing circumstances of  their imprisonment they will be better looked after and have lighter  work than the average of my honest and peaceable subjects  if the king  had spoken thus he would have won high applause in these days at least  till the farms and the merchandise the property and the profits of the  rest of his subjects were endangered by these favoured objects of his  philanthropy who having found that rebellion and even murder was  pardonable in one case would naturally try whether it was not pardonable  in other cases likewise  but what we read of the kingand we must  really remember in fear and trembling who spoke this parable even our  lord himselfis thishe sent forth his armies soldiers men  disciplined to do their duty at all risks and sworn to carry out the  law and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city  yes the king was very angry as he had a right to be  yes let us lay  that to heart and tremble from the very worst of us all to the very  best of us all  there is an anger in god  there is indignation in god   our highest reason ought to tell us that there must be anger in god as  long as sin and wrong exist in any corner of the universe  for all that  is good in man is of the likeness of god  and is it not a good feeling  a noble feeling in man to be indignant or to cry for vengeance on the  offender whenever we hear of cruelty injustice or violence  is that  not noble  i say it is  i say that the man whose heart does not burn  within him at the sight of tyranny and cruelty of baseness and deceit  who is not ready to say take him and do to him as he has done to  others that mans heart is not right with god or with man either  his  moral sense is stunted  he is on the way to become first if he can a  tyrant and then a slave  and shall there be no noble indignation in god when he beholds all the  wrong which is done on earth  shall the just and holy god look on  carelessly and satisfied at injustice and unholiness which vexes even  poor sinful man  god forbid  to think that would to my mind be to  fancy god less just less merciful than man  and if any one says anger  is a passion a suffering from something outside oneself and god can  have no passions god cannot be moved by the sins and follies of such  paltry atoms as we human beings are  the answer is mans angereven  just angeris too often a passion weakminded persons illeducated  persons especially when they get together in mobs and excite each  other are carried away when they hear even a false report of cruelty or  injustice by their really wholesome indignation and say and do foolish  and cruel and unjust things the victims of their own passion  but even  among men the wiser a man is the purer the strongerminded so much  the more can he control his indignation and not let it rise into  passion but punish the offender calmly though sternly according to  law  even so our reason bids us believe does god who does all things  by law  his eternal laws punish of themselves just as they reward of  themselves  the same law of god may be the messenger of his anger to the  bad while it is the messenger of his love to the good  for god has not  only no passions but no parts and therefore his anger and his love are  not different but the same  and his love is his anger and his anger is  his love  an awful thought and yet a blessed thought  think of it my friends think of it day and night  under gods anger or under gods love we  must be whether we will or not  we cannot flee from his presence  we  cannot go from his spirit  if we are loving and so rise up to heaven  god is therein love  if we are cruel and wrathful and so go down to  hell god is there alsoin wrath  with the clean he will be clean with  the froward man he will be froward  in god we live and move and have  our being  on us and on us alone it depends what sort of a life we  shall live and whether our being shall be happy or miserable  on us  and on us alone it depends whether we shall live under gods anger or  live under gods love  on us and on us alone it depends whether the  eternal and unchangeable god shall be to us a consuming fire or light  and life and bliss for evermore  we never had more need to think of this than now for there has spread  over the greater part of the civilised world a strong spirit of disbelief  in the living god  men do not believe that god punishes sin and wrong doing either in this world or in the world to come  and it is not  confined to those who are called infidels who disbelieve in the  incarnation and kingdom of our lord jesus christ  would to god it were  so  everywhere we find christians of all creeds and denominations alike  holding the very same ruinous notion and saying to themselves god does  not govern this present world  god does not punish or reward in this  present life  this world is all wrong and the devils world and  therefore i cannot prosper in the world unless i am a little wrong  likewise and do a little of the devils work  so one lies another  cheats another oppresses another neglects his plainest social duties  another defiles himself with base political or religious intrigues  another breaks the seventh commandment or indeed any and every one of  the commandments which he finds troublesome  and when one asks in  astonishmentyou call yourselves christians  you believe in god and  the bible and christianity  do you not think that god will punish you  for all this  do you not hear from the psalmists and prophets and  apostles of a god who judges and punishes such generations as this  of  a wrath of god which is revealed from heaven against all unrighteousness  of men who like you hold down the truth in unrighteousness knowing  what is right and yet doing what is wrong  then they answer at least in  their hearts oh dear no  god does not govern men now or judge men now   he only did so our preachers tell us under the old jewish dispensation  and such words as you quote from our lord or st paul have only to do  with the day of judgment and the next life and we have made it all  right for the next life  i says one regularly perform my religious  duties and i says another build churches and chapels and give large  sums in charity and i says another am converted and a member of a  church and i says another am elect and predestined to everlasting  lifeand so forth and so forth  each man turning the grace of god into  a cloak for licentiousness and deluding himself into the notion that he  may break the eternal laws of god and yet go to heaven as he calls it  when he dies  not knowing poor foolish man that as the noble  commination service well says the dreadful judgments of god are not  waiting for certain people at the last day thousands of years hence but  hanging over all our heads already and always ready to fall on us  not  knowing that it is as true now as it was two thousand years ago that  god is a righteous judge strong and patient  if a man will not turn  he will whet his sword he hath bent his bow and made it ready against  those who travail with mischief who conceive sorrow and bring forth  ungodliness  they dig up pits for their neighbours and fall themselves  into the destruction which they have made for others not knowing that it  is as true now as it was two thousand years ago that god is for ever  saying to the ungodly why dost thou preach my laws and takest my  covenant in thy mouth whereas thou hatest to be reformed and hast cast  my words behind thee  thou hast let thy mouth speak wickedness and with  thy tongue thou hast set forth deceit  these things hast thou done and  i held my tongue and thou thoughtest wickedly that i am even such a  one as thyself  but i will reprove thee and set before thee the things  which thou hast done  o consider this ye that forget god  lest i pluck  you away and there be none to deliver you  let us lay this to heart and say there can be no doubti at least have  nonethat there is growing up among us a serious divorce between faith  and practice a serious disbelief that the kingdom of heaven is about us  and that christ is ruling us as he told us plainly enough in his  parables by the laws of the kingdom of heaven and that he does and  will punish and reward each man according to those laws and according to  nothing else  we pride ourselves on our superior light and our improved civilisation  and look down on the old roman catholic missionaries who converted our  forefathers from heathendom in the middle ages  now i am a protestant  if ever there was one and i know well that these men had their  superstitions and false doctrines  they made mistakes and often worse  than mistakes for they were but men  but this i tell you that if they  had not had a deep and sound belief that they were in the kingdom of god  the kingdom of heaven and that they and all men must obey the laws of  the kingdom of heaven and that the first law of it was that wrongdoing  would be punished and rightdoing rewarded in this life every day and  all day long as sure as christ the living lord reigned in righteousness  over all the earth if they had not believed that i say and acted on  it we should probably have been heathen at this day  as it is unless  we protestants get back the old belief that god is a living god and  that his judgments are abroad in the earth and that only in keeping his  commandments can we get life and not perish we shall be seriously in  danger of sinking at last into that hopeless state of popular feeling  into which more than one nation in our own time has fallenthat as the  prophet of old says a wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the  land the prophetsthat is the preachers and teachersprophesy  falsely and the prieststhe ministers of religionbear rule by their  means and my people love to have it solove to have their consciences  drugged by the news that they may live bad lives and yet die good  deaths  and what will ye do in the end thereof asks jeremiah  what indeed   what the jews did in the end thereof you may read in the book of the  prophet jeremiah  they did nothing and could do nothingwith their  morality their manhood was gone  sin had borne its certain fruit of  anarchy and decrepitude  the wrath of god revealed itself as usual by  no miracle but through inscrutable social laws  they had to submit  cowardly and brokenhearted to an invasion a siege and an utter ruin   i do not say god forbid that we shall ever sink so low and have to  endure so terrible a chastisement  but this i say that the only way in  which any nation of which i ever read in history can escape sooner or  later from such a fate is to remember every day and all day long that  the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all illdoing of men  who hold the truth in unrighteousness knowing what is true and what is  right yet telling lies and doing wrong  let us lay this to heart with seriousness and godly fear  for so we  shall look up with reverence and yet with hope to christ the ascended  king to whom all power is given in heaven and earth for ever asking him  for his holy spirit to put into our minds good desires and to enable us  to bring these desires to good effect  and so we shall live for ever  under our great taskmasters eye and find out that that eye is not  merely the eye of a just judge not merely the eye of a bountiful king  but more the eye of a loving and merciful saviour in whose presence is  life even here on earth and at whose right hand even in this sinful  world are pleasures for evermore    sermon xxxi  the unchangeable christ    eversley 1845  hebrews xiii 8  jesus christ the same yesterday and today and for  ever  let me first briefly remind you as the truth upon which my whole  explanation of this text is built that man is not meant either for  solitude or independence  he is meant to live with his fellowmen to  live by them and to live for them  he is healthy and godly only when  he knows all men for his brothers and himself in some way or other as  the servant of all and bound in ties of love and duty to every one  around him  it is not however my intention to dwell upon this truth deep and  necessary as it is but to turn your attention to one of its  consequences i mean to the disappointment and regret of which so many  complain who try more or less healthily to keep that truth before  them and shew it forth in their daily life  it has been and is now a common complaint with many who interest  themselves about their fellowcreatures and the welfare of the human  race that nothing in this world is surenothing is permanent a  continual ebb and flow seems to be the only law of human life  men  change they say their friendships are fickle their minds like their  bodies alter from day to day  the heart whom you trust today to morrow may deceive the friend for whom you have sacrificed so much will  not in his turn endure the trial of his friendship  the child on whom  you may have reposed your whole affection for years grows up and goes  forth into the world and forms new ties and you are left alone  why  then love man  why care for any born of woman if the happiness which  depends on them is exposed to a thousand chancesa thousand changes   again we hear the complaint that not only men but circumstances change   why knit myself people will ask to one who tomorrow may be whirled  away from me by some eddy of circumstances and so go on his way while i  see him no more  why relieve distress which fresh accidents may bring  back again tomorrow with all its miseries  why attach ourselves to a  home which we may leave tomorrowto pursuits which fortune may force  us to relinquishto bright hopes which the rolling clouds may shut out  from usto opinions which the next generation may find to have been  utterly mistakento a circle of acquaintances who must in a few years  be lying silent and solitary each in his grave  why in short set our  affections on anything in this earth or struggle to improve or settle  aught in a world where all seems so temporary changeful and uncertain  that nought doth endure but mutability  such is and has been the complaint mixed up of truth and falsehood  poured out for ages by thousands who have loved as the world would say  too wellwho have tried to build up for themselves homes in this  world forgetting that they were strangers and pilgrims in it and so  when the floods came and swept away that small fools paradise of  theirs repined and were astonished as though some strange thing had  happened to them  the time would fail me did i try fully to lay before you how this dread  and terror of change and this unsatisfied craving after an eternal home  and an unchanging friendship embittered the minds of all the more  thoughtful heathens before the coming of christ who as the apostle  says all their lives were in bondage to the fear of death  how all  their schemes and conceptions of the course of this world resolved  themselves into one dark picture of the terrible river of time restless  pitiless devouring all life and beauty as fast as it arose ready to  overwhelm the speakers themselves also with the coming wave as it had  done all they loved before them and then roll onward for ever none knew  whither  the time would fail me too did i try to explain how after he  had appeared who is the same yesterday today and for ever men have  still found the same disappointment in all the paths of life  many not  seeing that the manifestation of an incarnate god was the answer to all  such doubts the healer of all such wounds have sickened at this same  change and uncertainty and attempted selfdeliverance by all kinds of  uncouth and most useless methods  some have shielded themselves or  tried to shield themselves in an armour of stoical indifferenceof  utter selfishness being sure that at all events there was one friendship  in the world which could neither change nor fadeselflove  others again have withdrawn themselves in disgust not indeed from  their god and saviour but from their fellowmen and buried themselves  in deserts hoping thereby to escape what they despaired of conquering  the chances and changes of this mortal life  thus they alas threw away  the gold of human affections among the dross of this worlds comfort and  honour  wiser they were indeed than those last mentioned but yet shew  i you a more excellent way  it is strange and mournful too that this complaint of unsatisfied  hopes and longings should still be often heard from christian lips   strange indeed when the object and founder of our religion the king  and head of all our race the god whom we are bound to worship the  eldest brother whom we are bound to love the saviour who died upon the  cross for us is the same yesterday and today and for ever   strange indeed when we remember that god was manifest in the flesh  that he might save humanity and its hopes from perpetual change and final  destruction and satisfy all those cravings after an immutable object of  mans loyalty and mans love  yes he has given us in himself a king who can never misgovern a  teacher who can never mislead a priest whose sacrifice can never be  unaccepted a protector who can never grow weary a friend who can never  betray  and all that this earth has in it really worth lovingthe ties  of family of country of universal brotherhoodthe beauties and wonders  of gods mysterious universeall true love all useful labour all  innocent enjoymentthe marriage bed and the fireside circlethe  bounties of harvest and the smiles of spring and all that makes life  bright and this earth dearall these things he has restored to man  spiritual and holy deep with new meaning bright with purer enjoyment  rich with usefulness not merely for time but for eternity after they  had become through the accumulated sin and folly of ages foul dead  and well nigh forgotten  he has united these common duties and pleasures  of mans life to himself by taking them on himself on earth by giving  us his spirit to understand and fulfil those duties by making it a duty  to him to cultivate them to the uttermost  he has sanctified them for  ever by shewing us that they are types and patterns of still higher  relations to himself and to his father and our father from whom they  came  christ our lord and saviour is a witness to us of the enduring the  everlasting nature of all that human life contains of beauty and  holiness and real value  he is a witness to us that wisdom is eternal  that that allembracing sight that allguiding counsel which the lord  possessed in the beginning of his way before his works of old he who  was set up from everlasting who was with him when he made the world  still exists and ever shall exist unchanged  the word of the lord  standeth sure  that word which was in the beginning and was with  god and was god  glorious truth that amid all the inventions which  man has sought out while every new philosopher has been starting some  new method of happiness some new theory of human life and its destinies  god has still been working onward unchecked unaltered the same  yesterday and today and for ever  o sons of men perplexed by all  the apparent contradictions and cross purposes and opposing powers and  principles of this strange dark noisy time remember to your comfort  that your king a man like you yet very god now sits above seeing  through all which you cannot see through unravelling surely all this  tangled web of time while under his guiding eye all things are moving  silently onward like the stars in their courses above you toward their  appointed end when he shall have put down all rule and all authority  and power for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his  feet  and then at last this cloudy sky shall be all clear and bright  for he the lamb shall be the light thereof  christ is the witness to us also of the eternity of loveof gods love the love of the father who wills of himself who has purchased of the  holy ghost who works in us our salvation and of the eternity of all  love that true love is not of the flesh but of the spirit and  therefore hath its root in the spiritual world above all change and  accidents of time or circumstance  think think my friends  for what  is life that we should make such ado about it and hug it so closely and  look to it to fill our hearts  what is all earthly life with all its bad  and good luck its riches and its poverty but a vapour that passes  awaynoise and smoke overclouding the enduring light of heaven  a man  may be very happy and blest in this life yet he may feel that however  pleasant it is at root it is no reality but only a shadow of realities  which are eternal and infinite in the bosom of god a piecemeal pattern  of the light kingdomthe city not made with handseternal in the  heavens  for all this timeworld as a wise man says is but like an  image beautifully and fearfully emblematic but still only an emblem  like an air image which plays and flickers in the grand still mirror of  eternity  out of nothing into time and space we all came into noisy  day and out of time and space into the silent night shall we all return  into the spirit worldthe everlasting twofold mysteryinto the light world of gods love or the fireworld of his angerevery like unto its  like and every man to his own place

lessons    eversley 1861  2 kings xxiii 3 4 25 26  and the king stood by a pillar and made a  covenant before the lord to walk after the lord and to keep his  commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart  and all their soul to perform the words of this covenant that were  written in this book  and all the people stood to the covenant  and the  king commanded hilkiah the high priest and the priests of the second  order and the keepers of the door to bring forth out of the temple of  the lord all the vessels that were made for baal and for the grove and  for all the host of heaven  and he burned them without jerusalem in the  fields of kidron and carried the ashes of them unto bethel     and  like unto him was there no king before him that turned to the lord with  all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might according  to all the law of moses neither after him arose there any like him   notwithstanding the lord turned not from the fierceness of his great  wrath wherewith his anger was kindled against judah because of all the  provocations that manasseh had provoked him withal  you heard this chapter read as the first lesson for this afternoons  service and a lesson it is indeeda lesson for you and for me as it  was a lesson for our forefathers  if you had been worshipping in this  church three hundred years ago you would have understood without my  telling you why the good and wise men who shaped our prayerbook chose  this chapter to be read in church  you would have applied the words of  it to the times in which you were living  you would have felt that the  chapter spoke to you at once of joy and hope and of sorrow and fear  there is no doubt at all what our forefathers would have thought of and  did think of when they read this chapter  the glorious reformation  which young king josiah made was to them the pattern of the equally  glorious reformation which was made in england somewhat more than three  hundred years ago  young king josiah swearing to govern according to  the law of the lord was to them the pattern of young king edward vi  determining to govern according to the laws of the bible  the finding of  the law of the lord in josiahs time after it had been long lost was to  them the pattern of the sudden spread among them of the bible which had  been practically hidden from them for hundreds of years and was then  translated into english and printed and put freely into the hands of  every man rich and poor who was able to read it  king josiahs  destruction of the idols and the temples of the false gods and driving  out the wizards and workers with familiar spirits were to them a pattern  of the destruction of the monasteries and miraculous images and popish  superstitions of every kind the turning the monks out of their convents  and forcing them to set to honest workwhich had just taken place  throughout england  and the hearts of all true englishmen were stirred  up in those days to copy josiah and the people of jerusalem and turn to  the lord with all their heart and with all their soul and with all  their might according to gods law and gospel in the two testaments  both old and new  one would have thought that at such a time the hearts of our forefathers  would be full of nothing but hope and joy content and thankfulness  and  yet it was not so  one cannot help seeing that in the prayerbook which  was put together in those days there is a great deal of fear and  sadness  you see it especially in the litany which was to be said not  only on sundays but on wednesdays and fridays also  some people think  the litany painfully sadtoo sad  it was not too sad for the time in  which it was written  our forefathers three hundred years ago meant  what they said when they cried to god to have mercy upon them miserable  sinners and not to remember their offences nor the offences of their  forefathers c  they meant and had good reason to mean what they  said when they cried to god that those evils which the craft and  subtilty of the devil and men were working against them might be brought  to nought and by the providence of his goodness be dispersedto arise  and help and deliver them for his names sake and for his honour and to  turn from them for the glory of his name all those evils which they  righteously had deserved  they were in danger and in terror our  forefathers three hundred years ago  and when they heard this lesson  read in church it was not likely to make their terror less  for what says the 26th verse of this chapter  notwithstanding in  spite of all this reformation and putting away of idols and determining  to walk according to the law of the lord the lord turned not from the  fierceness of his great wrath wherewith his anger was kindled against  judah  and what followed  josiah was killed in battleby his own  fault tooby pharaoh nechoh king of egypt  and then followed nothing  but disaster and misery  the jews were conquered first by the king of  egypt and taxed to pay to him an enormous tribute and then in the wars  between egypt and babylon conquered a second time by the king of  babylon the famous nebuchadnezzar in that dreadful siege in which it is  said mothers ate their own children through extremity of famine  and  then after seventy years after every one of that idolatrous and corrupt  generation had died in captivity the poor jews were allowed to go back  to their native land chastened and purged in the fire of affliction and  having learnt a lesson which to do them justice they never forgot  again and have not forgotten to this day that to worship a graven  image as well as to work unrighteousness is abomination to the lord that god and god alone is to be worshipped and worshipped in holiness  and purity in mercy and in justice  and it was some such fate as this some terrible ruin like that of the  jews of old that our forefathers feared three hundred years ago  their  hearts were not yet altogether right with god  they had not shaken off  the bad habits of mind or the bad morals either which they had learnt  in the old romish timestoo many of them were using their liberty as a  cloak of licentiousness and under pretence of religion plundering not  only gods church but gods poor  and many other evils were rife in  england then as there are sure to be great evils side by side with great  good in any country in times of change and revolution  and so our  forefathers needed chastisement and they had it  king edward upon whom  the protestants had set their hopes died young and then came times  which tried them literally as by fire  first came the terrible  persecutions in queen marys time when hundreds of good men and women  were burnt alive for their religion  and even after her death for  thirty years came times such as hezekiah speaks oftimes of trouble  and rebuke and blasphemy plots rebellions civil war at home and  abroad dangers that grew ever more and more terrible till it seemed at  last certain that england would be conquered in the popes name by the  king of spain  and if that had come to pass and it all but came to pass  in the famous year 1588 the king of spain would have become king of  england the best blood of england would have been shed upon the  scaffold the best estates parted among spaniards and traitors england  enslaved to the most cruel nation of those times and the inquisition set  up to persecute torture and burn all who believed in what they called  and what is the gospel of jesus christ  that was to have happened and  it was only as our forefathers confessed by the infinite mercy of god  that it did not happen  they were delivered strangely and suddenly as  the jews were  for forty years they had been chastised and purged and  humbled for their sins and then and not till then came times of safety  and prosperity honour and glory which have lasted thanks be to god  ever since   and now my dear friends what has this to do with us  if this chapter  was a lesson to our forefathers how is it to be a lesson to us likewise  i have always told you as those who have really understood their bibles  in all ages have told men that the bible sets forth the eternal laws of  gods kingdomthe laws by which god that is our lord jesus christ  governs nations and kingdomsand not only nations and kingdoms but you  and me and every individual christian man all these things says st  paul are written for our admonition  the history of the jews is or  may be your history or mine for good or for evil as god dealt with  them so is he dealing with you and me  by their experience we must  learn  by their chastisements we must be warned  so says st paul  so  have all preachers said who have understood st pauland so say i to you   and the lesson that we may learn from this chapter is that we may repent  and yet be punished  i know people do not like to believe that i know that it is much more  convenient to fancy that when a man repents and as he says turns over  a new leaf he need trouble himself no more about his past sins  but it  is a mistake not only is the letter and spirit of scripture against him  but facts are against him  he may not choose to trouble himself about  his past sins but he will find that his past sins trouble him whether  he chooses or notand that often in a very terrible way as they  troubled those poor jews in their day and our forefathers after the  reformation  what some will say is it not expressly written in scripture that  when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath  committed and doeth that which is lawful and right he shall save his  soul alive and all his transgressions that he hath committed they  shall not be mentioned unto him but that in his righteousness which he  hath done he shall live  no doubt it is so written my friends  and no doubt it is perfectly and  literally true  but answer me this when does the wicked man do that  which is lawful and right  the minute after he has repented or the day  after or even seven years afterthe minute after he is forgiven and  received freely back again as gods child as he will be for the sake of  that precious blood which christ poured out upon the cross  would to god  it were so my friends  would to god it were so easy to do right after  having been accustomed to do wrong  would to god it were so easy to get  a clean heart and a right spirit  would to god it were so easy to break  through all the old bad habitsperhaps the habits of a whole lifetime   but it is in vain to expect this sudden change of character  as well may  we expect a man who has been laid low with fever to get up and go about  to his work the moment his disease takes a favourable turn  no  after the forgiveness of sin must come the cure of sin  and that  cure like most cures is a long and a painful process  the sin may have  been some animal sin like drunkenness and we all know how difficult it  is to cure that  or it may have been a spiritual sinpride vanity  covetousness  can any man put off these bad habits in a moment as he  puts off his coat  those who so fancy can know very little of human  nature and have observed their own hearts and their fellow creatures  very carelessly  if you will look at facts what you will find is this that all sins and bad habits fill the soul with evil humours just as a  fever or any other severe disease fills the body and that as in the  case of a fever those evil humours remain after the acute disease is  past and are but too apt to break out again to cause relapses to  torment the poor patient perhaps to leave his character crippled and  disfigured all his lifecertainly to require long and often severe  treatment by the heavenly physician christ the purifier as well as the  redeemer of our sinsick souls  heavy therefore and bitter and  shameful is the burden which many a man has to bear after he has turned  from self to god from sin to holiness  he is haunted as it were by  the ghosts of his old follies  he finds out the bitter truth of st  pauls words that there is another law in his body warring against the  law of his mind of his conscience and his reason so that when he would  do good evil is present with him  the good that he would do he does not  do and the evil that he would not do he does  till he cries with st  paul o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of  this death and feels that none can deliver him save jesus christ our  lord  yes  but there is our comfort there is our hopechrist the great  healer the great physician can deliver us and will deliver us from the  remains of our old sins the consequences of our own follies  not  indeed at once or by miracle but by slow education in new and nobler  motives in purer and more unselfish habits  and better for us perhaps  that he should not cure us at once lest we should fancy that sin was a  light thing which we could throw off whenever we chose and not what it  is an inward disease corroding and corrupting the wages whereof are  death  therefore it is that because christ loves us he hates our sins  and cannot abide or endure them will punish them and is merciful and  loving in punishing them as long as a tincture or remnant of sin is left  in us  let us then if our consciences condemn us of living evil lives turn and  repent before it be too late before our consciences are hardened before  the purer and nobler feelings which we learnt at our mothers knees are  stifled by the ways of the world before we are hardened into bad habits  and grown frivolous sensual selfish and worldly  let us repent  let  us put ourselves into the hands of christ the great physician and ask  him to heal our wounded souls and purge our corrupted souls and leave  to him the choice of how he will do it  let us be content to be punished  and chastised  if we deserve punishment let us bear it and bear it  like men as we should bear the surgeons knife knowing that it is for  our good and that the hand which inflicts pain is the hand of one who so  loves us that he stooped to die for us on the cross  let him deal with  us if he see fit as he dealt with david of old when he forgave his  sin and yet punished it by the death of his child  let him do what he  will by us provided he doeswhat he will domake us good men  that is what we need to bejust merciful pure faithful loyal  useful honourable with true honour in the sight of god and man  that  is what we need to be  that is what we shall be at last if we put  ourselves into christs hand and ask him for the clean heart and the  right spirit which is his own spirit the spirit of all goodness  and  provided we attain at last to thatprovided we attain at last to the  truly heroic and divine life which is the life of virtue it will matter  little to us by what wild and weary ways or through what painful and  humiliating processes we have arrived thither  if god has loved us if  god will receive us then let us submit loyally and humbly to his law  whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he  receiveth    sermon xxxiii  human soot    preached for the kirkdale ragged schools liverpool 1870  st matt xviii 14  it is not the will of your father which is in  heaven that one of these little ones should perish  i am here to plead for the kirkdale industrial ragged school and free  schoolroom church  the great majority of children who attend this  school belong to the class of street arabs as they are now called and  either already belong to or are likely to sink into the dangerous  classesprofessional lawbreakers profligates and barbarians  how  these children have been fed civilized christianized taught trades and  domestic employments and saved from ruin of body and soul i leave to  you to read in the report  let us take hold of these little ones at  once  they are now soft plastic mouldable a tone will stir their  young souls to the very depths a look will affect them for ever  but a  hardening process has commenced within them and if they are not seized  at once they will become harder than adamant and then scalding tears  and the most earnest trials will be all but useless  this report contains full and pleasant proof of the success of the  schools but it contains also full proof of a fact which is anything but  pleasantof the existence in liverpool of a need for such an  institution  how is it that when a ragged school like this is opened it  is filled at once  that it is enlarged year after year and yet is  filled and filled again  whence comes this large population of children  who are needy if not destitute and who are or are in a fair way to  become dangerous  and whence comes the population of parents whom these  children represent  how is it that in liverpool if i am rightly  informed more than four hundred and fifty children were committed by the  magistrates last year for various offences almost every one of whom of  course represents several more brothers sisters companions corrupted  by him or corrupting him  you have your reformatories your training  ships like your akbar which i visited with deep satisfaction yesterday institutions which are an honour to the town of liverpool at least to  many of its citizens  but how is it that they are ever needed  how is  itand this if correct or only half correct is a fact altogether  horriblethat there are now between ten and twelve thousand children in  liverpool who attend no schooltwelve thousand children in ignorance of  their duty to god and man in training for that dangerous class which  you have it seems contrived to create in this once small and quiet port  during a century of wonderful prosperity  and consider this i beseech  youhow is it that the experiment of giving these children a fair  chance when it is tried as it has been in these schools has succeeded   i do not wonder of course that it has succeeded for i know who made  these children and who redeemed them and who cares for them more than  you or i or their best friends can care for them  but do you not see  that the very fact of their having improved when they had a fair chance  is proof positive that they had not had a fair chance before  how is  that my friends  and this leads me to ask you plainlywhat do you consider to be your  duty toward those children what is your duty toward those dangerous and  degraded classes from which too many of them spring  you all know the  parable of the good samaritan  you all know how he found the poor  wounded jew by the wayside and for the mere sake of their common  humanity simply because he was a man though he would have scornfully  disclaimed the name of brother bound up his wounds set him on his own  beast led him to an inn and took care of him  is yours the duty which the good samaritan feltthe duty of mere  humanity  how is it your duty to deal then with these poor children   that and i think a little more  let me say boldly i think these  children have a deeper and a nearer claim on you and that you must not  pride yourselves here in liverpool on acting the good samaritan when  you help a ragged school  we do not read that the good samaritan was a  merchant on his march at the head of his own caravan  we do not read  that the wounded man was one of his own servants or a child of one of  his servants who had been left behind unable from weakness or weariness  to keep pace with the rest and had dropped by the wayside till the  vultures and the jackals should pick his bones  neither do we read that  he was a general at the head of an advancing army and that the poor  sufferer was one of his own rank and file crippled by wounds or by  disease watching as many a poor soldier does his comrades march past  to victory while he is left alone to die  still less do we hear that  the sufferer was the child of some poor soldiers wife or even of some  drunken campfollower who had lost her place on the baggagewaggon and  trudged on with the child at her back through dust and mire till in  despair she dropped her little one and left it to the mercies of the  god who gave it her  in either case that good samaritan would have known what his duty was   i trust that you will know in like case what your duty is  for is not  this and none other your relation to these children in your streets  ragged dirty profligate sinking and perishing of whom our lord has  saidit is not the will of your father which is in heaven that one of  these little ones should perish  it is not his will  i am sure that it  is not your will either  i believe that with all my heart  i do not  blame you or the people of liverpool nor the people of any city on  earth in our present imperfect state of civilisation for the existence  among them of brutal ignorant degraded helpless people  it is no  ones fault just because it is every ones faultthe fault of the  system  but it is not the will of god and therefore the existence of  such an evil is proof patent and sufficient that we have not yet  discovered the whole will of god about this matter that we have not yet  mastered the laws of true political economy which like all other  natural laws are that will of god revealed in facts  our processes are  hasty imperfect barbaricand their result is vast and rapid  production  but also waste refuse in the shape of a dangerous class   we know well how in some manufactures a certain amount of waste is  profitablethat it pays better to let certain substances run to refuse  than to use every product of the manufacture as in a steam mill where  it pays better not to consume the whole fuel to let the soot escape  though every atom of soot is so much wasted fuel  so it is in our  present social system  it pays better capital is accumulated more  rapidly by wasting a certain amount of human life human health human  intellect human morals by producing and throwing away a regular  percentage of human sootof that thinking acting dirt which lies  about and alas breeds and perpetuates itself in foul alleys and low  public houses and all dens and dark places of the earth  but as in the case of the manufactures the nemesis comes swift and  sure  as the foul vapours of the mine and the manufactory destroy  vegetation and injure health so does the nemesis fall on the world of  man so does that human soot these human poison gases infect the whole  society which has allowed them to fester under its feet  sad but not hopeless  dark but not without a gleam of light on the  horizon  for i can conceive a time when by improved chemical science  every foul vapour which now escapes from the chimney of a manufactory  polluting the air destroying the vegetation shall be seized utilised  converted into some profitable substance till the black country shall be  black no longer the streams once more crystal clear the trees once more  luxuriant and the desert which man has created in his haste and greed  shall in literal fact once more blossom as the rose  and just so can i  conceive a time when by a higher civilisation formed on a political  economy more truly scientific because more truly according to the will  of god our human refuse shall be utilised like our material refuse  when man as man even down to the weakest and most ignorant shall be  found to be as he really is so valuable that it will be worth while to  preserve his health to develop his capabilities to save him alive  body intellect and character at any cost because men will see that a  man is after all the most precious and useful thing on the earth and  that no cost spent on the development of human beings can possibly be  thrown away  i appeal then to you the commercial men of liverpool if there are any  such in this congregation  if not i appeal to their wives and  daughters who are kept in wealth luxury refinement by the honourable  labours of their

campaign somewhat  precipitate and illdirected their ambulance train and their medical  arrangements somewhat defective  we are all ready enough to complain of  waste of human bodies brought about by such defects in the british army   shall we pass over the waste the hereditary waste of human souls  brought about by similar defects in every great city in the world  waste of human souls human intellects human characterswaste saddest  of all of the image of god in little children  that cannot be  necessary  there must be a fault somewhere  it cannot be the will of  god that one little one should perish by commerce or by manufacture any  more than by slavery or by war  as surely as i believe that there is a god so surely do i believe that  commerce is the ordinance of god that the great army of producers and  distributors is gods army  but for that very reason i must believe that  the production of human refuse the waste of human character is not part  of gods plan not according to his ideal of what our social state should  be and therefore what our social state can be  for god asks no  impossibilities of any human being  but as things are one has only to go into the streets of

corner  grown  barbariansit may be now all but past savingbut bringing into the  world young barbarians whom we may yet save for god wishes us to save  them  it is not the will of their father which is in heaven that one of  them should perish  and for that very reason he has given them  capabilities powers instincts by virtue of which they need not perish   do not deceive yourselves about the little dirty offensive children in  the street  if they be offensive to you they are not to him who made  them  take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for i say  unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my  father which is in heaven  is there not in every one of them as in  you the light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world  and  know you not who that light is and what he said of little children   then take heed i say lest you despise one of these little ones   listen not to the pharisee when he says except the little child be  converted and become as i am he shall in nowise enter into the kingdom  of heaven  but listen to the voice of him who knew what was in man when  he said except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall  not enter into the kingdom of heaven  their souls are like their  bodies not perfect but beautiful enough and fresh enough to shame any  one who shall dare to look down on them  their souls are like their  bodies hidden by the rags foul with the dirt of what we miscall  civilisation  but take them to the pure stream strip off the ugly  shapeless rags wash the young limbs again and you shall find them body  and soul fresh and lithe graceful and capablecapable of how much god  alone who made them knows  well said of such the great christian poet  of your northern hills

of these little ones should perish  is it your will my friends or is  it not  if it be not the means of saving them or at least the great  majority of them is easier than you think  circumstances drag

he bowed the heart of all the men of judah even as the  heart of one man  no circumstances can be more different thank god than those under which  the heart of the men of judah was bowed when their king commander  appealed to them and those which have in the last few days bowed the  heart of this nation as the heart of one man  but the feeling called out  in each case was the sameloyalty spontaneous contagious some would  say unreasoning  but it may be all the deeper and nobler because for  once it did not wait to reason but was content to be human and to feel  if those men who have been so heartily loyal of laterespectable  businesslike manful persons of a race in nowise given to sentimental  excitementhad been asked the cause of the intense feeling which they  have shown during the last few days they would probably most of them  find some difficulty in giving it  many would talk frankly of their  dread lest business should be interfered with and no shame to them if  they live by business  others would speak of possible political  complications and certainly no blame to them for dreading such  but  they would most of them speak as frankly of a deeper and less selfish  emotion  they would speak not eloquently it may be but earnestly of  sympathy with a mother and a wife of sympathy with youth and health  fighting untimely with disease and deaththey would plead their common  humanity and not be ashamed to have yielded to that touch of nature  which makes the whole world kin  and that would be altogether to their  honour  honourably and gracefully has that sympathy showed itself in  these realms of late  it has proved that in spite of all our  covetousness all our luxury all our frivolity we are not cynics yet  nor likely thanks be to almighty god to become cynics that however  encrusted and cankered with the cares and riches of this world and  bringing alas very little fruit to perfection the old british oak is  sound at the rootstill human still humane  but there is i believe another and an almost deeper reason for the  strong emotion which has possessed these men one most intimately bound  up with our national life national unity national history one which  they can hardly express to themselves one which some of them are half  ashamed to express because they cannot render a reason for it but which  is still there deeply rooted in their souls one of those old hereditary  instincts by which the histories of whole nations whole races are  guided often halfunconsciously and almost in spite of themselves and  that is loyalty pure and simple loyaltythe attachment to some royal  race whom they conceived to be set over them by god  an attachment  mark it well founded not on their own will but on grounds very complex  and quite independent of them an attachment which they did not make but  found an attachment which their forefathers had transmitted to them and  which they must transmit to their children as a national inheritanceat  once a symbol of and a support to the national unity of the whole people  running back to the time when in dim and mythic ages it emerged into  the light of history as a wandering tribe  this instinct as a historic  fact has been strong in all the progressive european nations especially  strong in the teutonic in none more than in the english and the scotch   it has helped to put them in the forefront of the nations  it has been a  rallying point for all their highest national instincts  their sovereign  was to them the divinely appointed symbol of the unity of their country   in defending him they defended it  it did not interfere that instinct  of loyalty with their mature manhood freedom independence  they knew  that if royalty were indeed gods ordinance it had its duties as well as  its rights  and when their kings broke the law they changed their  kings  but a king they must have for their own sakes not merely for  the sake of the nations security and peace but for the sake of their  own selfrespect  they felt those old forefathers of ours that loyalty  was not a degrading but an ennobling influence that a free man can give  up his independence without losing it thatas the example of that  mighty german army has just shown an astounded worldindependence is  never more called out than by subordination and that a free man never  feels himself so free as when obeying those whom the laws of his country  have set over him an able man never feels himself so able as when he is  following the lead of an abler man than himself  and what if as needs  must happen at whiles the sovereign were not a man but a woman or a  child  then was added to loyalty in the hearts of our forefathers and  of many another nation in europe an instinct even deeper and tenderer  and more unselfishthe instinct of chivalry and the widowed queen or  the prince became to them a precious jewel committed to their charge by  the will of their forefathers and the providence of god an heirloom for  which they were responsible to god and to their forefathers and to  their children after them lest their names should be stained to all  future generations by the crime of baseness toward the weak  this was the instinct of the old teutonic races  they were often  unfaithful to itas all men are to their higher instincts and fulfilled  it very imperfectlyas all men fulfil their duties  but it was there in their heart of hearts  it helped to make them and therefore it  helped to make us  it ennobled them it called out in them the sense of  unity order discipline and a lofty and unselfish affection  and i  thank god as an englishman for any event however exquisitely painful  which may call out those true graces in us their descendants  and  therefore my good friends if any cynic shall sneer as he may after  the present danger is past at this sudden outburst of loyalty and speak  of it as unreasoning and childish answer not him  give not that which  is holy unto the dogs neither cast ye your pearls before swine lest  they trample them under their feet and turn again and rend you  but  answer yourselves and answer too your children when they ask you what  has moved you thusanswer i say not childishly but childlike  we  have gone back for a moment at least to englands childhoodto the  mood of england when she was still young  and we are showing thereby  that we are not yet decayed into old age  that if we be men and not  still children yet the child is father to the man and the childs heart  still beats underneath all the sins and all the cares and all the greeds  of our manhood  more than one foreign nation is looking on in wonder and in envy at that  sight  god grant that they may understand all that it means  god grant  that they may understand of how wide and deep an application is the great  law except ye be converted changed and turned round utterly and  become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of  heaven  god grant that they may recover the childlike heart and  replace with it that childish heart which pulls to pieces at its own  irreverent fancy the most ancient and sacred institutions to build up  ever fresh babyhouses out of the fragments as a child does with its  broken toys  therefore my friends be not ashamed to have felt acutely  be not  ashamed to feel acutely still till all danger is past or even long  after all danger is past when you look back on what might have been and  what it might have brought ay must have brought if not to you still  to your children after you  for so you will show yourselves worthy  descendants of your forefathers  so you will show yourselves worthy  citizens of this british empire  so you will show yourselves as i  believe worthy christian men and women  for christ the king of kings  and subjects sends all sorrow to make us feel acutely  we do not the  great majority of us feel enough  our hearts are dull and hard and  light god forgive us and we forget continually what an earnest awful  world we live ina whole eternity waiting for us to be born and a whole  eternity waiting to see what we shall do now we are born  yes our  hearts are dull and hard and light and therefore christ sends  suffering on us to teach us what we always gladly forget in comfort and  prosperitywhat an awful capacity of suffering we have and more what  an awful capacity of suffering our fellowcreatures have likewise  we  sit at ease too often in a fools paradise till god awakens us and  tortures us into pity for the torture of others  and so if we will not  acknowledge our brotherhood by any other teaching he knits us together  by the brotherhood of common suffering  but if god thus sends sorrow to ennoble us to call out in us pity  sympathy unselfishness most surely does he send for that end such a  sorrow as this which touches in all alike every source of pity of  sympathy of unselfishness at once  surely he meant to bow our hearts as  the heart of one man and he has i trust and hope done that which he  meant to do  god grant that the effect may be permanent  god grant that  it may call out in us all an abiding loyalty  god grant that it may fill  us with some of that charity which bears all things hopes all things  believes all things which rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices in the  truth and make us thrust aside henceforth in dignified disgust the  cynic and the slanderer the ribald and the rebel  but more  god grant that the very sight of the calamity with which we  have stood face to face may call out in us some valiant practical  resolve which may benefit this whole nation and bow all hearts as the  heart of one man to do some one right thing  and what right thing   what but the thing which is pointed to by plain and terrible fact as the  lesson which god must mean us to learn if he means us to learn any from  what has so nearly befallen  let our hearts be bowed as the heart of one  man to saythat so far as we have power so help us god no man woman  or child in britain be he prince or be he beggar shall die henceforth  of preventable disease  let us repent of and amend that scandalous  neglect of the now wellknown laws of health and cleanliness which  destroys thousands of lives yearly in this kingdom without need and  reason in defiance alike of science of humanity and of our christian  profession  two hundred thousand persons i am told have died of  preventable fever since the prince consorts death ten years ago  is  that not a sin to bow our hearts as the heart of one man  ah if this  foul and needless disease by striking once at the very highest shall  bring home to us the often told seldom heeded fact that it is striking  perpetually at hundreds among the very lowest whom we leave to sicken  and die in dens unfit for menunfit for dogs if this tragedy shall  awaken all loyal citizens to demand and to enforce as a duty to their  sovereign their country and their god a sanatory reform in town and  country immediate wholesale imperative if it shall awaken the  ministers of religion to preach about that and hardly aught but that till there is not a fever ally or a malarious ditch left in any british  citythen indeed this fair and precious life will not have been  imperilled in vain and generations yet unborn will bless the memory of a  prince who sickened as poor men sicken and all but died as poor men  die that his exampleand it may be hereafter his exertionsmight  deliver the poor from dirt disease and death  for him himself i have no fear  we have committed him to god  it may be  that he has committed himself to god  it may be that he has already  learned lessons which god alone can teach  it may be that those lessons  will bring forth hereafter royal fruit right worthy of a royal root  at  least we can trust him in gods hands and believe that if this great woe  was meant to ennoble us it was meant to ennoble him that if it was meant  to educate us it was meant to educate him that god is teaching him and  that in gods schoolhouse he is safe  for think my friends if we who  know him partly love him much then god who knows him wholly loves him  more  and so god be with him and with you and with your prayers for  him  amen    sermon xxxv  grace and glory    chapel royal whitehall 1865  for the consumptive hospital  st john ii 11  this beginning of miracles did jesus in cana of  galilee and manifested forth his glory  this word glory whether in its greek or its roman shape had a very  definite meaning in the days of the apostles  it meant the admiration of  men  the greek word as every scholar knows is derived from a root  signifying to seem and expresses that which a man seems and appears to  his fellow men  the latin word glory is expressly defined by cicero to  mean the love trust and admiration of the multitude and a consequent  opinion that the man is worthy of honour  glory in fact is a relative  word and can be only used of any being in relation to other rational  beings and their opinion of him  the glory of god therefore in scripture must needs mean that  admiration which men feel or ought to feel for god  there is a deeper  an altogether abysmal meaning for that word  and now o father glorify  thou me with thy own self with the glory which i had with thee before  the world was  but on that text speaking of the majesty of the ever blessed trinity i dare not attempt to comment though could i explain  it i should  when st john says that christ manifested forth his glory  and his disciples believed on him it is plain that he means by his glory  that which produced admiration and satisfaction not alone in the mind of  god the father but in the minds of men  now what the romans thought glorious in their days is notorious enough   no one can look upon the picture of a roman triumph without seeing that  their idea of glory was force power brute force selfwilled dominion  selfish aggrandizement  but this was not the glory which st john saw in  christ for his glory was full of grace which is incompatible with self will and selfishness  the greeks meaning of glory is equally notorious  he called it wisdom   we call it craftthe glory of the sophist who could prove or disprove  anything for gain or display the glory of the successful adventurer  whose shrewdness made its market out of the stupidity and vice of the  barbarian  but this is not the glory of christ for st john saw that it  was full of truth  therefore neither strength nor craft are the glory of christ and  therefore they are not the glory of god  for the glory of christ is the  glory of god and none other because he is very god of very god  begotten  in christ man sees the unseen and absolute and eternal god  as he is was and ever will be  no man hath seen god at any time the  only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared  himand that perfectly and utterly for in him dwells all the fulness  of the godhead bodily so that he himself could say he that hath seen  me hath seen the father  this is the catholic faith  god grant that i  may believe it with my whole heart  god grant that you may believe it  with your whole hearts likewise and not merely with your intellects and  brains  but it may be said though god be not glorious and admirable for selfish  force which it were blasphemous to attribute to him he is still  admirable for his power  though he be not glorious for craft he is  still glorious for his wisdom  i deny both  i deny that power is any  object of admiration unless it be used well for good ends  to admire  power for its own sake is one of those errors which has been well called  titanolatry the worship of giants  neither is wisdom an object of  admiration unless it be used for good ends  to worship it for its own  sake is a common error enoughthe idolatry of intellect  but it is none  the less an error and a grievous one  gods power and wisdom are  glorious only in as far as they are used as they are utterly for good  ends only in plain words as far as god is as he is perfectly good   and the true glory of god is that god is good  so says the scripture  and so i bid you all remember for it is a truth which you and i and all  mankind are perpetually ready to forget  let me but ask you one question as a test whether or not i am right  if  the supreme being used his power as the roman caesar used his if he  used his wisdom as the greek sophist used his would he be glorious then  and worthy of admiration  the old heathen aeschylus answered that  question for mankind long ago on the athenian stage  i should be ashamed  to answer it again in a christian pulpit  and when i say good i mean  good even as man can be and ought to be and is more or less good   the theory that because gods morality is absolute it may therefore be  different from mans morality in kind as well as in degree is equally  contrary to the letter and to the spirit of scripture  man according to  scripture is made in gods moral image and likeness and however fallen  and degraded that image may be still the ultimate standard of right and  wrong is the same in god and in man  how else dare abraham ask of god  shall not the judge of all the earth do right  how else has gods  command to the old jews any meaning be ye holy for i am holy  how  else have all the passages in the psalms prophets evangelists  apostles which speak of gods justice mercy faithfulness any honest  or practical meaning to human beings  how else can they be aught but a  mockery a delusion and a snare to the tens of thousands who have found  in them hope and trust that god would deliver them and the world from  evil  what means the command to be perfect as our father in heaven is  perfect  what mean the words that we partake of a divine nature  how  else is the command to love god anything but an arbitrary and impossible  demanddemanding love which every writer of fiction tells you and  tells you truly cannot be compelledcan only go forth toward a being  who shows himself worthy of our love by possessing those qualities which  we admire in our fellow men  no  against such a theory i must quote as  embodying all that i would say and corroborating on entirely  independent ground the scriptural account of human moralityagainst  such a theory i say i must quote the words of our greatest living  logician  language has no meaning for the words just merciful  benevolent he might have added truthful likewise save that in which  we predicate them of our fellow creatures and unless that is what we  intend to express by them we have no business to employ the words  if  in affirming them of god we do not mean to affirm these very qualities  differing only as greater in degree we are neither philosophically nor  morally entitled to affirm them at all     what belongs to gods  goodness as infinite or more properly absolute i do not pretend to  know but i know that infinite goodness must be goodness and that what  is not consistent with goodness is not consistent with infinite goodness     besides he saysand to this sound reductio ad absurdum i call  the attention of all who believe their biblesunless i believe god to  possess the same moral attributes which i find in however inferior a  degree in a good man what ground of assurance have i of gods veracity   all trust in a revelation presupposes a conviction that gods attributes  are the same in all but degree with the best human attributes  if  instead of the glad tidings that there exists a being in whom all the  excellences which the highest human mind can conceive exist in a degree  inconceivable to us i am informed that the world is ruled by a being  whose attributes are infinite but what they are we cannot learn nor  what are the principles of his government except that the highest human  morality which we are capable of conceiving does not sanction them  convince me of it and i will bear my fate as i may  but when i am told  that i must believe this and at the same time call this being by the  names which express and affirm the highest human morality i say in plain  terms that i will not  whatever power such a being may have over me  there is one thing which he shall not do  he shall not compel me to  worship him  i will call no being good who is not what i mean when i  apply that epithet to my fellow creatures  that st john would have assented to these bold and honest words that  such is st johns conception of human and divine morality the story in  the text shows to my mind especially  it is so to speak a crucial  experiment by which the truth of the scripture theory is verified  the  difficulty in all ages about a standard of morality has beenhow can we  fix it  even if we agree that mans goodness ought to be the counterpart  of gods goodness we know that in practice it is not as mankind has  differed in all ages and countries about what is right and wrong  the  hindoo thinks it right to burn widows wrong to eat animal food and  between such extremes there are numberless minor differences  hardly any  act is conceivable which has not been thought by some man somewhere  somehow morally right or morally wrong  if all that we can do is to  choose out those instances of morality which seem to us most right and  impute them to god shall we not have an evershifting probably a merely  conventional standard of right and wrong  and worseshall we not be  always in danger of deifying our own superstitionsperhaps our own  vices  of making a god in our own image because we cannot know that god  in whose image we are made  most true unless we believe rightly the  incarnation of our lord jesus christ perfect god and perfect man  in  him says the bible the perfect human morality is manifested and shown  by his life and conduct to be identical with the divine  he bids us be  perfect even as our father in heaven is perfect and he only has a right in the sense of a sound and fair reasonfor so doing because he can  say and has said he that hath seen me hath seen the father  at least such is the doctrine of st john  he tells us that the word  who was god was made flesh and dwelt in his land and neighbourhood and  that he and his fellows beheld his glory and saw that it was the glory  of the onlybegotten of the father full of grace and truth  and then  in the next chapter he goes on to tell us how that glory was first  manifested forthby turning water into wine at a marriage feast  on the  truth of the story i say simply in passing that i believe it fully and  literally as i do also st johns assertions about our lords divinity   but i only wish to point out to you why i called this miracle the crucial  experiment which proved gods goodness to be identical with that which  we call and rightly goodness in man  it is by the seeming  insignificance thereof by the seeming nonnecessity by the seeming  humbleness of its circumstances by the seeming smallness of its results  issuing merely as far as scripture tells us and therefore as far as we  need know or have a right to imagine in the giving of a transitory and  unnecessary physical pleasure  in short by the very absence of that  dignus deo vindice nodus that knot which only a god could untie which  heathens demanded ere a god was allowed to interfere in the plot of a  tragedy which too many who call themselves christians demand before the  living god is allowed to interfere in that world in which without him not  a sparrow falls to the ground  in a moral case of this kind if you will  consider that which seems least is often the greatest  that which seems  the lowest because the simplest and meanest manifestation of a moral  law may beprobably isthe deepest the highest the most universal  life is made up of little things say the practically wise and they say  true for our lord says so likewise  he that is faithful in that which  is least is faithful also in much  if you look on morality virtue  goodness holiness sanctificationcall it what you willas merely the  obligation of an external law you will be tempted to say let me be  faithful to it in its greater and more important cases and that is  enough  the pettier ones must take care of themselves i have not time  enough to attend to them and god will not it may be require them of  me  but if the morality goodness holiness be in you what it was in  christ without measurea spirit even the spirit of goda spirit  within you possessing you and working on you and in youthen that  which seems most petty and unimportant will often be most important the  test of the soundness of your heart of the reality of your feelings  we all knowevery writer of fiction at least should knowhow true  this is in the case of love between man and woman between parent and  child  how the little kindnesses the halfunconscious gestures the  petty labours of love of which their object will never be aware the  scrupulousness which is able to greatly find quarrel in a straw when  honour is at stakehow these are the very things which show that the  affection is neither the offspring of dry and legal duty nor of selfish  enjoyment but lies far down in the unconscious abysses of the heart and  being itselfas christto compare for he himself permits nay  commands us to do so in his parables our littleness with his immensity as christ i say showed when he chose first to manifest his glorythe  glory of his grace and truthby increasing for a short hour the  pleasures of a village feast  i might say much more on the point how he showed these by his truth how  he proved that he and therefore his father and your father was not that  deus quidam deceptor whom some suppose him mocking the intellect of his  creatures by the facts of nature which he has created tempting the souls  of his creatures by the very faculties and desires which he himself has  given them  but i wish now to draw your minds rather to that one word gracegrace  what it means and how it is a manifestation of glory  few scriptural  expressions have suffered more that this word grace from the storms of  theological controversy  springing flesh in the minds of apostles as  did many other noble words in that heavenenriched soil the only  adequate expressions of an idea which till then had never fully possessed  the mind of man it meant more than we can now imagine perhaps more that  we shall ever imagine again  we alas only know the word with its  fragrance battered out its hues rubbed off its very life anatomized out  of it by the battles of rival divines till its mere skeleton is left  and all that grace means to most of us is simply and dryly a certain  spiritual gift of god  doubtless it means that but if it meant nothing  more at first why was not the plain word gift enough for the apostles   why did they use grace  why did they use too in the sense of giving  and gifts nouns and verbs derived from that rootword charis grace  which plainly signified so much to them  a word the rootmeaning of  which was neither more nor less than a certain heathen goddess or  goddessesthe inspirer of beauty in art the impersonation of all that  is pure charming winning bountifulin one word of all that is  graceful and gracious in the human character  the fact is strange but  the fact is there and being there we must face it and explain it  of  course the apostles use the word grace in a far deeper and loftier  meaning raise it mathematically speaking to a far higher power  there  is no need to remind you of that  but why did they choose and use the  word at alla word whose old meaning every heathen knewunless for some  innate fitness in it to express something in the character of god  to  tell men that there was in god a graciousness as of the most gracious of  all human beings which gave to his character a moral beauty a charm a  winningness which as even the old jewish prophet before the  incarnation could perceive and boldly declare drew them with the cords  of a man and with the bands of love attracting them by the very human  character of its graciousness  the glory as of the onlybegotten of the father full of grace   meditate on those words  full of graceof that spirit which we like  the old heathens consider rather a feminine than a masculine excellence  the spirit which as st james says of god the father gives simply and  upbraideth not gives gracefully as we ourselves sayin the right and  happy use of the adverb does not spoil its gifts by throwing them in the  teeth of the giver but gives for mere givings sake pleases where it  can be done without sin or harm for mere pleasings sake most human  and humane when it is most divine the spirit by which christ turned the  water into wine at the marriage feast and so manifested forth his  absolute and eternal glory  and how  how  thus if you will receive it if you will believe a truth which is too  often hidden from the wise and prudent and yet revealed unto babes  which will never be understood by the proud pharisee the sour fanatic  the ascetic who dreads and distrusts his father in heaven but which is  clear and simple enough to many a clear and simple heart honest and  singleeyed sunny itself and bringing sunshine wherever it comes  because it is inspired by the gracious spirit of god and delights to  show kindness for kindness sake and to make happy for happiness sake  taking no merit to itself for doing that which is as instinctive as its  very breath  thisthat the graciousness which christ showed at that marriage feast  is neither more nor less than the boundless love of god who could not  live alone in the abyss but must needs out of his own divine charity  create the universe that he might have somewhat beside himself whereon  to pour out the ocean of his love which finds its own happiness in  giving happiness to all created things from the loftiest of rational  beings down to the gnat which dances in the sun and for aught we know  to the very lichen which nestles in the alpine rock  this is the character of god unless scripture be a dream of mans  imagination  thus far you may know god thus far you may see god as he  is and know and see that he is just with the justice of a man only more  just merciful with the mercy of a man only more merciful truthful with  the truthfulness of a man only more truthful gracious with the  graciousness of a man only more gracious and loving  that we dare not  say  for if we say so much the scripture commands us to say more  the  scripture tells us that the whole absolute morality of god is summed up as our own human morality ought to bein his love  that love is the  fulfilment of the moral law in him as in us that it is the root and  cause and spirit of his justice mercy truth and graciousness that it  belongs not to his attributes as they may be said to be but to his  essence and his spirit that we must not if we be careful of our words  say god is loving because we are bidden to say god is love  thus the commands thou shalt love the lord thy godand thy neighbour  as thyself are shown to be not arbitrary and impossible demands  miscalled moral obligations while they are merely legal and external  ones but true moral obligations in the moral sense to which heart and  spirit can answer i rejoice to do thy will o god thy law is within my  heart  you ought to love god because he is supremely loveable and  worthy of your love  you can love god because you can appreciate and  know god for you are his child made in his moral likeness and capable  of seeing him as he is morally and of seeing in him the full perfection  of all that attracts your moral sense when it is manifested in any human  being  and you can love your neighbour as yourselves because and in as  far as you have in you the spirit of god the spirit of universal love  which proceedeth out for ever both from the father and the son to all  beings and things which they have made  and of one thing i am sure that in proportion as you are led and  inspired by that spirit of god which showed in our lord in the very  deepest and truest sense as the spirit of humanity just so you will  feel a genial and hearty pleasure in lessening all human suffering  however slight in increasing all harmless human pleasure however  transitory and in copying him who at the marriage feast gracefully and  graciously turned the water into wine  i do not of course mean that  you are to do no more than that to prefer sentiment to duty to amuse  and glorify yourselves by paying tithe of mint anise and cummin and  neglect the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith   but i do mean that you are not to distrust your own sentiments not to  crush your own instinctive sympathies  the very lowest of themthat  which makes you shrink at the sight of pain and rejoice in the sight of  pleasure is not natural and common to you with the animals it is  supernatural and divine  it is a schoolmaster to bring you to christ to  that higher inspiration of his which tells your heart to alleviate the  unseen woes which will never come into painful contact with your  sensibilities to bestow pleasures in which you yourself have no  immediate share  it will tell your hearts especially in the case of this  very hospital for consumption not to be slack in giving because so much  of what you will giveit is painful to recollect how muchwill be  spent not in prevention not even in cure but in mere alleviation mere  increased bodily ease mere savoury food even mere passing amusements  for wearied minds  be it so  if which god forbid we could do nothing  save alleviate if which god forbid permanent cure even lengthening of  life were impossible i should say just as much give  give money to  alleviate give even though what you give were in the strictly economic  sense wasted  we are ready enough most of us to waste upon ourselves   it is well for us to taste once in a way the luxury of wasting on others  though i have yet to learn that anything can be called wasted which  lessens even for a moment the amount of human suffering  a plan for  instance is on foot for sending twenty of the patients to madeira for  the winter  the british consul to his honour guarantees their  maintenance if the hospital will pay their passage out and home  some  may sayan unnecessary expensea problematical benefit  be it so  i  believe that it will not be such that it may save many livesthey may  revive  but were it not so i would still say give  let them go even  if every soul in that ship were doomed  let them go  let them drink the  fresh sea breeze before they die let them see the green tropic world  let them forget their sorrow for a while let them feel springing up  afresh in them the celestial fount of hope  we let the guilty criminal  eat and drink well the morn ere he is led forth to dieshall we not do  as much by those who are innocent  but especially would i say try to lessen such suffering as that for  which i plead today because it is undeserved in the true sense of that  wordnot earned by any act of their own  these poor souls suffer for no  sins of their own they have done nothing to bring on themselves a  disease which attacks too often the fairest the seemingly strongest and  healthiest the most temperate and most pure  they suffer some it may  be for the sins of their forefathers some from causes of disease which  science cannot as yet control cannot even discover  they are objects of  unmixed pity and sympathy  they should be so to us for they are so to  him who made them  on this disease god does bestow a special  alleviationa special mark of his pity of his tenderness in a word of  his grace  that unclouded intellect that unruffled temper that  cheerful resignation that brave and yet calm facing of the inevitable  future that everfresh hope which is no delusion but a token that god  himself has taken away the sting of death and the victory of the grave  till the very thought of death has vanished or is looked on merely as  the gate to a life of health and strength and peace and joyall  these symptoms so common so normal all but universalthis euthanasia  which god has provided for those who humanly speaking are innocent yet  must for the general good of humanity leave this world for another what are they but the voice of god to us telling that he loves that he  pities that he alleviates and bidding us go and do likewise  god has  alleviated where we cannot  he has bidden us thereby if his likeness  and spirit be indeed in us to alleviate where we can and believe that  by every additional comfort however petty which we provide we are  copying the ideal man who because he was very god of very god could  condescend at the marriage feast to turn the water into wine    sermon xxxvi  useless sacrifice    preached at southsea for the mission of the good shepherd  october 1871  isaiah i 1117  to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices  unto me saith the lord      when ye come to appear before me who  hath required this at your hand to tread my courts  bring no more vain  oblations incense is an abomination to me the new moons and sabbaths  the calling of assemblies i cannot away with it is iniquity even the  solemn meeting  your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth   they are a trouble to me i am weary to bear them  and when ye spread  forth your hands i will hide mine eyes from you  yea when ye make many  prayers i will not hear  your hands are full of blood  wash you make  you clean put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes cease  to do evil learn to do well seek judgement relieve the oppressed  judge the fatherless plead for the widow  i have been asked to plead today for the mission of the good shepherd in  portsea  i am informed that portsea contains some thirteen thousand souls divided  between two parishes  that they as i feared include some of the most  ignorant and vicious of both sexes which can be found in the kingdom  that there are few or no rich people in the place that the rich who have  an interest in the labour of these masses live away from the place and  from the dwellings of those whom they employa social evil new to  england but growing alas fearfully common in it and that vice and  unthrift uncertain wages and unhealthy dwellings produce there as  elsewhere misery and savagery most deplorable  i am told too that  this mission has been working nobly and selfdenyingly among these  unhappy people for some years past  that it can and ought to largely  extend its operations that it is in want of fresh funds that it is  proposed to build a new church which it is hoped will be a centre of  civilization and organization as well as of religion and morality for  the district and i am bidden to invite you as close neighbours of  portsea to help in the good work  i of course know too little of  local facts or of the temper of the people of southsea  but i am bound  to believe it to be the same as i have found it elsewhere  and i  therefore shall confine myself to general questions and shall treat this  case of portsea as what it is alas one among a hundred similar ones  and say to you simply what i have said for twentyfive years wherever  and whenever i can get a hearing  and therefore if i seem here and there  to speak sharply and sternly recollect that i pay you a compliment in so  doingfirst that i speak not to you but to all english men and women  and next that i speak as to those who have noble instincts if they will  be only true to themas to english people who are not afraid of being  told the truth to english people who do wrong rather from forgetfulness  and luxury than from meanness and cruelty aforethought who as far as i  have seen need for the most part only to be reminded that they are  doing wrong to reawaken them to their better selves and set them trying  honestly and bravely to do right  let me then begin this sermon with a parable  alas that the parable  should represent a common and notorious fact  suppose yourselves in some  stately palace amid marbles and bronzes statues and pictures and all  that cunning brain and cunning hand when wedded to the high instinct of  beauty can produce  the furniture is of the very richest and kept with  the most fastidious cleanliness  the floors of precious wood are  polished like mirrors  the rooms have every appliance for the ease of  the luxurious inmates  everywhere you see not mere brute wealth but  taste purity and comfort  there is no lack of intellect eitherwise  and learned books fill the library shelves maps and scientific  instruments crowd the tables  nor of religion eitherfor the house  contains a private chapel fitted up in the richest style of mediaeval  ecclesiastical art  and as you walk along from polished floor to  polished floor you seem to pass in review every object which the body  or the mind or the spirit of the most civilized human being can need  for its satisfaction  but next to the chapel itself a scent of carrion makes you start  you  look against the will of your smart and ostentatious guide through a  halfopen door and see another sighta room dark and foul mildewed  and ruinous and swept carelessly into a corner a heap of dirt rags  bones waifs and strays of every kind decaying all together  you ask with astonishment and disgust how comes that there and are  told to your fresh astonishment and disgust that that is only where the  servants sweep the litter  but crouching behind the litter in the  darkest corner something moves  you go up to it in spite of the  entreaties of your guide and find an aged idiot gibbering in her rags  who is she  oh an old servantor a child or possibly a grandchild  of some old servantyour guide does not remember which  she is better  out of the way there in the corner  at all events she can find plenty to  eat among the dirtheap and as for her soul if she has one the  clergyman is said to come and see her now and then so probably it will  be saved  would you not turn away from that palace with the contemptuous thought civilized  refined  these peoples civilization is but skindeep   their refinement is but an outside show  look into the first back room  and you find that they are foul barbarians still  and yet such literally such and no better is the refinement of modern  england such and no better is the civilization of our great towns   such i fear from what i am told is the civilization of southsea beside  the barbarism to be found in portsea close at hand  dirt and squalor  brutality and ignorance close beside such luxury as the world has not  seen it may be since the bad days of heathen rome  but more if you turned away you would say to yourselves if you were  thoughtful personsnot only what barbarism but what folly  the owner  and his household are in daily danger  the idiot in discontent or even  in mere folly may seize a lighted candle burn petroleum as she did in  paris of late and set the whole palace on fire  and more the very dirt  is in itself inflammable and capable as it festers of spontaneous  combustion  how many a stately house has been burnt down ere now simply  by the heating of greasy rags thrust away in some neglected closet  let  the owner of the house beware  he is living voluntarily over a volcano  of his own making  but morewhat if you were told that the fault lay not so much in the  negligence of servants as in that of the owner himself that the master  of that palace had over him a king to whom all that was foul  neglectful cruel was inexpressibly hateful so hateful that he once had  actually stepped off the throne of the universe to die for such creatures  as that poor idiot and her forgotten parents  would you not question  whether the prayers offered up in that chapel would have any answer from  him save that awful answer he once gave  when ye spread forth your  hands i will hide mine eyes  yea when ye make many prayers i will not  hear your hands are full of blood  oh my friends you who understand my parable has the awful thought  never struck you that such may be gods answer to the prayers of a nation  which leaves in its midst such barbarism such heathenism as exists in  every great town of this realm  and what if you were told next that the  laws of his kingdom were eternal and inexorable and that one of his  cardinal laws isthat as a man sows so shall he reap that every sin  punishes itself even though the sinner does not know that he has sinned  that he who knew not his masters will and did it not shall be beaten  with few stripes that the innocent babe does not escape unburnt because  it knew not that fire burns that the good man who lives in a malarious  alley does not escape fever and cholera because he does not know that  dirt breeds pestilence that in a word he who knew not his masters  will and did it not shall be beaten with few stripes but that he who  knew his masters will and did it not shall be beaten with many  stripes  then of how many and how heavy stripes think you will the  inhabitant of that palace be counted worthy who has been taught by  christianity for the last fifteen hundred years and by physical science  and political economy for the last fifty years and yet persists in  defiance of his own knowledge in leaving his usedup servants and their  children and grandchildren after them to rot body mind and soul in  the very precincts of the palace having no other excuse to offer for  this than that it is too much trouble to treat them better and that on  the whole he can make money more rapidly by thus throwing away that  human dirt and leaving it to decay where it can regardless what it  pollutes and poisons just as the manufacturer can make money more  rapidly by not consuming his own smoke but letting it stream out of the  chimney to poison with blackness and desolation the green fields where  god meant little children to gather flowers  ladies to you i appeal not merely as women but as ladies if as i am  assured by those who know you ladies you are in the grand old meaning  of that grand old word  if soyou know then what it is to be a lady and what not  you know  that it is not to go like the daughters of zion in isaiahs time with  mincing gait and borrowed headgear and tasteless finery the head  wellnigh empty the heart full of little save vanity and vexation of  spirit busy all the week over cheap novels and expensive dresses and on  sunday over a little dilettante devotion  you know i take for granted  that whatever the world may think or say that to be that is not to be a  lady  for you know i take for granted what that word lady meant at first   that it meant she who gave out the loaves the housewife who provided  food and clothes the stewardess of her household and dependants the  spinner among her maidens the almsgiver to the poor the worshipper in  the chapel praying for wild men away in battle  the being from whom  flowed forth all gracious influences of thought and order of bounty and  compassion of purity and piety civilizing and christianizing a whole  family a whole domain  this it was to be a lady in the old days when  too many men had little care save to make war  and this it is to be a  lady still in the new days in which too many men have little care save  to make money  show then that you can be ladies still  that the spirit  is the spirit of your ancestresses though the form in which it must show  itself is changed with the change of society  to you i appeal to as many in this church as are ladies not in name  only but in spirit and in truth  say to your fathers husbands  brothers sons and say too and that boldly to the tradesmen with whom  you dealdo you hear this  do you hear that there are savages and  heathens generations of them within a rifleshot of the house  and you  cannot exterminate them cannot drive them out much less kill them  you  must convert them improve them make them civilized and christian if  not for their own sakes at least for our sakes and for our children  and if they should answer  my dears it is too true  but we did not  make them or put them there and they are not in our parish  they are no  concern of ours and besides they will not hurt us  answer them  not made by our fault  true our hands are more or less  clean  but what of that  there they are  if you had a tribe of red  indians on the frontier of your settlement would you take the less guard  against them because you did not put them there  not in our parish and  what of that  they are in our county they are in england  has man the  right has man the power in the sight of god to draw any imaginary line  of demarcation between englishman and englishman especially when that  line is drawn between rich and poor  england knows no line of  demarcation save the shore of the great sea and even that her  generosity is overleaping at this moment at the call of mere humanity in  bounty to sufferers by the west indian hurricane and by the chicago  fire  will you send your help across the atlantic and deny it to the  sufferers at your own doors  at least if the rich be confined by an  imaginary line across the poor on the other side will notthey will  cross it freely enough and what they will bring with them will be  concern enough of ours  would it not be our concern if there was small pox scarlet fever cholera among them  should we not fear lest that  might hurt us  would you not bestir yourselves then  and do you not  know that it is among such people as these that pestilence is always  bred  and if not is not the pestilence of the soul more subtle and more  contagious than any pestilence of the body  what is the spreading power  of fever to the spreading power of vice which springs from tongue to  tongue from eye to eye from heart to heart  what matter whether they  be one mile off or five  will not they corrupt our servants and those  servants again our children  and say to them if you be prudent and thrifty housewives do not tell us  that their condition costs you nothing  even in pocket you are suffering  nowas all england is sufferingfrom the existence of heathens and  savages reckless profligate pauperized  for if you pay no poorrates  for their support the shopkeepers with whom you deal pay poorrates  and must and do repay themselves out of your pockets in the form of  increased prices for their goods  and when you have said all this ladies and morefor more will suggest  itself to your womans witsay to them with st pauland yet show we  unto you a more excellent waya nobler argumentand that is charity  not almsgiving  i had almost said anything but that making bad worse  the improvident more improvident the liar more ready to lie the idler  more ready to idle  but the charity which is humanity which is the  spirit of pure pity the spirit of christ and of god  say then even if these poor creatures did us no harm as they must and  will docivilize and christianize them for their own sakes simply  because they must be so very miserablemiserable too often with acute  and conscious misery too often with a worse misery dull and  unconscious which knows not stupified by ignorance and vice that it is  miserable and ought to be more miserable still  for who is so worthy of  our pity as he who knows not that he is pitiablewho takes ignorance  dirt vice passion and the wretchedness which vice and passion bring  as all in the days work as he takes the rain and hail the frost and  snowas unavoidable necessities of mortal life for which the only  temporary alleviation isdrink  if the refined and pureminded lady does not pity such beings as that i  know not of what her refinement is made  if the religious lady will not  bestir herself and make sacrifices to teach such people that that is not  what god meant them to beto stir up in them a noble selfdiscontent a  noble selfabhorrence which may be the beginning of repentance and  amendment of lifei know not of what her religion is made  one word morei know that such thoughts as i have put before you today  are painful  i know that we alli as much as anyone in this churchare  tempted to put them by and say i will think of things beautiful not of  things ugly of art poetry scienceall that is orderly graceful  ennobling and not of dirt ignorance vice misery all that is  disorderly degrading  nay even the most pious at times are tempted to  say i will think of heaven and not of earth  i will lift up my heart  and try to behold the glory and the goodness of god and not the disgrace  and sin of man  but only for a time may they thus think and speak  happy if they can at  moments lift up their hearts unto the lord and catch one glimpse of him  enthroned in perfect serenity and perfect order governing the worlds  with that allembracing justice which is at the same time allembracing  love and so giving him thanks for his great glory gain heart and hope  towhat  to descend again even were it from the beatific vision  itself to this disordered earth to work a littleand alas how little at lessening the sum of human ignorance human vice human miseryeven  as their lord and saviour stooped from the throne of the universe and  from the bosom of the father to toil and die for such as curse about the  streets outside    sermon xxxvii  the surprise of the righteous    preached at southsea for the mission of the good shepherd  october 1871  st matt xxv 3437  then shall the king say unto them on his right  hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you  from the foundation of the world  for i was an hungred and ye gave me  meat  i was thirsty and ye gave me drink  i was a stranger and ye  took me in  naked and ye clothed me  i was sick and ye visited me  i  was in prison and ye came unto me  then shall the righteous answer him  saying lord when saw we thee an hungred and fed thee or thirsty and  gave thee drink  let us consider awhile this magnificent parable and consider it  carefully lest we mistake its meaning  and let us specially consider  one point about it which is at first sight puzzling and which has  caused ere now many to miss as i believe with some of the best  commentators  the meaning of the wholewhich is this  that the  righteous in the parable did not know that when they did good to their  fellowcreatures they did it to christ the lord  now there are two kinds of people who do know that because they have  been taught it by holy scripture who would make two very different  answers to the lord when he spoke in such words to them  at least so we  may suppose for they are ready to make such answers here on earth and  therefore we may suppose that if they dared they would answer so at the  day of judgment  one party wouldor at least might say yes lord i  knew that whatever i did to the poor i did to thee and therefore i did  all i could for the poor  i started charitable institutions i spoke at  missionary meetings i put my name down for large sums in every  subscription list i built churches and chapels schools and hospitals i  gained the reputation among men of being a leading philanthropist  foremost in every good work  what answer the man who said that would receive from the lord i know  not for who am i that i should put words into the mouth of my creator  and my god  but i think that the awful majesty of the lords very  countenance might strike such a man dumb ere he had time to say those  vain proud words and strike his conscience through with the thought  yes i have been charitable  but have i been humane  i have been a  philanthropist  but have i really loved my fellowmen  have i not made  my interest in the heathen whom i have not seen an excuse for despising  and hating my countrymen whom i have seen if they dared to differ from  me in religion or in politics  i have given large sums in charity  but  have i ever sacrificed anything for my fellowmen  i have given christ  back a pound in every hundredperhaps even out of every ten which he has  given me  but what did i do with the other nine pounds save spend them  on myself  is there a luxury in which a respectable man could safely  indulge which i have denied myself  what have i been after all with  all my philanthropy and charity but a selfish luxurious pompous  personage an actor doing my alms to be seen of men  i did my good works  as unto christno i did them as unto myselfto get honour from men  while i lived and to save my selfish soul when i died  god be merciful  to me a sinner  that such thoughts ought to pass through too many  persons hearts in this generation i fear is too certain  god grant  that they may do so before it is too late  but it is plain at least  that these are not the sheep of whom christ speaks  again there are another and a very different kind of persons who we  have a right to fancy would answer the lord somewhat thus  oh lord  speak not of it  it may be i have tried to do a little good to a poor  suffering creature here and there to feed a few hungry clothe a few  naked visit a few sick and prisoners  but lord how could i do less  after all that thou hast done and suffered for me and after thy own  gracious saying that inasmuch as i did anything to the least of thy  brethren i did it to thee  what less could i do lordand after all  what a pitifully small amount i have done  thou didst hunger for me for whom have i ever hungered  thou didst suffer for mefor whom have  i ever suffered  thou didst die for mefor whom have i ever died  and  i did noti fear in the depth of my heartdo what i did really for  thee but for the very pleasure of doing it  i began to do good from a  sense of duty to thee but after a while i did good i fear only because  it was so pleasantso pleasant to see human faces looking up into mine  with gratitude so pleasant to have little children even though they  were none of my own clinging to me in trust so pleasant when i went  home at night to feel that i had made one human being a little happier a  little better even only a little more comfortable so pleasant to give  up my own pleasure in order to give pleasure to others that i fear i  forgot thee in my own enjoyment  if i sinned in that lord forgive  but  at least i have had my reward  my work among thy poor was its own  reward a reward of inward happiness beyond all that earth can giveand  now thou speakest of rewarding me over and above with i know not what of  undeserved bliss  thou art too good o lord as is thy wont from all  eternity  let me go and hide myselfa more than unprofitable servant  who has not done the hundredth part of that which it was my duty to do  what answer the lord would make to the modest misgivings of that sweet  soul i cannot say for again who am i that i should put words into the  mouth of my creator and my god  but this i know that i had rather be what i am not and never shall besuch a soul as that in the last day  than own all the kingdoms of the world and the glory thereof  still it  is plain that such persons however holy however loving are not those  of whom our lord speaks in this parable  for they too know and must  know that inasmuch as they showed mercy unto one of the least of the  lords brethren they showed it unto him  but the special peculiarity of  the persons of whom our lord speaks is that they did not know that they  had no suspicion that in showing kindness to men they were showing  kindness to christ  lord they answer when saw we thee  it is a revelation to them in the strictest and deepest sense of the  word  a revelation that is an unveiling a drawing away of a veil which  was before their eyes and hiding from them a divine and most blessed  fact of which they had been unaware  but who are they  i think we must  agree with some of the best commentators among others with that  excellent divine and excellent man now lost to the church on earth the  late dean of canterbury that they are persons who till the day of  judgment have never heard of christ but who then for the first time  as dean alford says are overwhelmed with the sight of the grace which  has been working in and for them and the glory which is now their  blessed portion  such persons perhaps as those two poor negressesto  remind you of a story which was famous in our fathers timethose two  poor negresses i say who found the african traveller mungo park dying  of fever and starvation and saved his life simply from human loveas  they sung to themselves by his bedside   let us pity the poor white man he has no mother to make his bed no wife to grind his corn   perhaps it is such as those who have succoured human beings they knew  not why simply from a divine instinct from the voice of christ within  their hearts which they felt they must obey though they knew not whose  voice it was  perhaps i say it is such as those that christ will  astonish at the last day by the words come ye blessed of my father  inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world  if this be the true meaning of our lords words what comfort and hope  they may give us when we think as we are bound to think if we have a  true humanity in us of the hundreds of millions of heathen now alive  and of the thousands of millions of heathen who have lived and died   sinful they are as a whole  sinning it may be without law but  perishing without law  for the wages of sin are death and can be  nothing else  but may not christ have his elect among them  may not his  spirit be working in some of them  may he not have his sheep among them  who hear his voice though they know not that it is his voice  they hear  a voice within their hearts whispering to them be loving be merciful  be humane in one word be just and do to others as you would they should  do to you  and whose voice can that be but the voice of christ and the  spirit of god  those loving instincts come not from the fleshly fallen  nature or natural man  that says to us be selfish do not be loving   do to others not what you would they should do to you but do to others  whatever is pleasant and profitable to yourselves  and alas the  heathen and too many who call themselves christians listen to that  carnal voice and live the life of selfishness and pleasure of anger and  revenge of tyranny and crueltythe end of which is death  but if any among those heathenhearing within their hearts the other  voice the gracious voice which says do unto others as you would they  should do unto youfeel that that voice is a good voice and a right  command which must be obeyed and which it is beautiful and delightful  to obey and so obey it may we not hope then that christ who has  called them will perfect his own work and in his own good way and his  own good time deliver them from their sin and ignorance and vouchsafe  to them at last that knowledge of the true and holy god father son and  holy spirit whom truly to know is everlasting life  they are christs  lost sheep  but they are still his sheep who hear his voice  may he not  fulfil his own words to them and go forth and seek such souls and lay  them on his shoulder and bring them home saying to his church on earth  and to his church in heaven rejoice with me  for i have found my sheep  which was lost  now if we can thus have hope for some among the heathen abroad shall we  not have hope too for some among the heathen at home for some among  that mass of human corruption which welters around the walls of so many  of our cities  i am not going to make vain excuses for them and say  they are but the victims of circumstance  the great majority of them are  the victims of their own low instincts  they have chosen the broad and  easy road of animalism which leads to destruction  they have sown to  the flesh and they will of the flesh reap corruption  for the laws of  god are inexorable and the curse of the law is sure namely the wages  of sin are death  neither dare i encourage too vast hopes and say if  we had money enough if we had machinery enough if we had zeal enough  we might convert them all and save them all  i dare not believe it   the many i fear will always go the broad road the few the narrow one   and all we dare say is if we have faith enough we can convert some  we  can at least fulfil our ordination vow  we can seek out christs sheep  scattered abroad about this naughty world and tell them of his fold and  try to bring them home  but how shall we know christs sheep when we see them  how but by the  very test which christ has laid down it seems to me in this very  parable  is there in one of them the high instinctseven the desire to  do a merciful act  let us watch for that  and when in the most brutal  man andalas that i should have to use the wordsin the most brutal  woman we see any touch of nobleness justice benevolence pity  tendernessin one word any touch however momentary of unselfishness let us spring at that knowing that there is the soul we seek there is  a lost sheep of christ there is christ himself working unknown upon a  human soul there is a soul ready for the gospel and not far from the  kingdom of god  but what shall we say to that lost sheep  shall we  terrify it by threats of hell  shall we even allure it by promises of  heaven  not sonot so at least at firstfor that would be to appeal to  bodily fear and bodily pleasure to the very selfishness from which  christ is trying to deliver it and to neglect the very prevenient grace  the very hold on the soul which christ himself offers us  let us  determine with st paul to know nothing among our fellowmen but christ  crucified  let us appeal just to that in the soul which is unselfish  not to the instincts of loss and gain but to those nobler instincts of  justice and mercy just because they are not the mans or the womans  instincts but christs within them the light of christ and the spirit  of christ the spirit of love and justice saying do unto others as you  would they should do unto you  do you doubt that  i trust not  for to  doubt that is to doubt whether god be truly the giver of all good things   to doubt that is to begin to disbelieve st pauls great saying in me  that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing  to doubt that is to lay  our hearts and minds open to the insidious poison of that pelagian heresy  which received under new shapes and names is becoming the cardinal  heresy of modern disbelief  no we will have faith in christ faith in  our creeds faith in catholic doctrine and will say to that man or that  woman even as they wallow still in the darkness and the mire behold  your god  that cup of cold water which you gave you knew not why christ told you to give it and to him you gave  that night watch beside  the bed of a woman as fallen as yourselfchrist bade you watch and you  watched by him  for that drunken ruffian whom you a drunken ruffian  yourself leaped into the sea to save christ bade you leap and like st  christopher of old you bore though you knew it not your saviour and  your god to land  and if they shall make answer and who is he that i  did not know him who is he that i should know him now  let us point  themand whither else should we point them in heaven or earthto  christ upon the cross and say behold your god  this he did this he  condescended this he dared this he suffered for you and such as you   this is what he the maker of the universe is like  this is what he has  been trying to make you like in your small degree every time a noble a  generous a pitiful a merciful emotion crossed your heart every time  you forgot yourself even for a moment and thought of the welfare of a  fellowman  if that tale if that sight if that revelation and unveiling of christ  to the poor sinful soul does not work in it an abhorrence of past sin a  craving after future holiness an admiration and a reverence for christ  himself which is ipso facto saving faith if that soul does not reply it may not be in words but in feelings too deep for wordsyes this  is indeed noble indeed godlike worthy of a god and worthy therefore to  be at once imitated and adored then indeed the cross of christ must  have lost that miraculous power which it has possessed for more than  eighteen hundred years as the highest moral ideal which ever was seen  or ever can be seen by the reason and the heart of man    sermon xxxviii  the lords prayer    windsor castle 1867  chester cathedral 1870  matthew vi 9 10  after this manner therefore pray ye our father  which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be  done on earth as it is in heaven  let us think for a while on these great words  let us remember that some  day or other they will certainly be fulfilled  let us remember that  christ would not have bidden us use them unless he intended that they  should be fulfilled  and let us remember likewise that we must help to  fulfil them  we need to be reminded of this from time to time for we  are all inclined to forget it  we are inclined to forget that mankind  has a father in heaven who is ruling and guiding and educating us his  human children to      one far off divine event toward which the whole creation moves   we are apt to fancy that the world will always go on very much as it goes  on now that it will be guided not by the will of god but by the will  of man by mans craft by mans ambition by mans selfinterest by  mans cravings after the luxuries and even after the mere necessities of  this life  in a word we are apt to fancy that man not god is the  master of this earth on which we live and that men have no king over  them in heaven  the lords prayer tells us that men have a king over them in heaven and  that that king is a father likewisea father whose name will one day be  hallowed above all names  that the world will not always go on as it  goes on now but that the fathers kingdom will come  that above the  will of man there is a will of god which must be done and therefore  will be done some day  in a word the lords prayer tells us that this  world is under a divine government that the lord even jesus christ our  saviour is king be the people never so impatient  that he sitteth  between the cherubim master of all the powers of nature be the earth  never so unquiet  that his power loves justice  that he has prepared  equity  that he has executed and therefore will execute to the end  judgment and righteousness in the earth  that christ reigns in justice  and in love  that he has for those who disobey his laws the most  terrible penalties for those who obey them blessings such as eye hath  not seen nor ear heard nor hath it entered into the heart of man to  conceive  that he must reign till he has put all enemies under his feet  and delivered up the kingdom to god even the father  that on that great  day he will prove his royalty and his fathers royalty in the sight of  all heaven and earth and make every soul of man aware in a fashion  which none shall mistake that he is lord and king  this is the message  which the lords prayer bringsa message of mingled fear and joy  but a message of more joy than fear  else why does our lord bid us pray  for it that it may come to passpray daily before we even pray for our  daily bread or the forgiveness of our sinsthat his fathers name may  be hallowed his fathers kingdom come his fathers will be done  he bids us pray for that because it will bring blessings  blessings to  every soul of man who desires to be good and true  because it will  satisfy every aspiration which has ever risen up from the heart of man  after what is noble what is generous what is just what is useful what  is pure  surely it is so  consider but these short words of my text  and think what the world would be like if they were fulfilled what the  next world will actually be like when they are fulfilled  hallowed be thy name  but what name  the name of father  if that  name were hallowed by men there would be an end of all superstitions   the root of all superstitions fanaticisms and false religions is this that they do not hallow the name of father  they do not see that it is a  holy name a beautiful and tender as well as an awful and venerable name   they think of fathers like too many among themselves proud and  arbitrary selfish and cruel  they say in their hearts even such  fathers as we are such is god  therefore they shrink from god and  turn from him to idols to the virgin mary or saints or any other  beings who can deliver them as they fancy out of the hands of their  father in heaven  if men once learnt to hallow the name of father to  think of a father as one who not only possessed power but felt love who  not only had rights which he would enforce and issued commands which  must be obeyed but who felt yearning sympathy for his childrens  weakness an active interest in their education and was ready to labour  for to sacrifice himself for his familythat would be truly to hallow  the name of father and look on it as a holy thing whether in heaven  above or in earth beneath  to hallow the fathers name would abolish all the superstition of the  world  and so the coming of the fathers kingdom would abolish all the  misrule and anarchy of the world  for the kingdom of god the father is a  kingdom of perfect order perfect justice perfect usefulness  surely  the first consequences of that kingdoms coming would be that every one  would be exactly in his right place and that every one would get his  exact deserts  that would indeed be the kingdom of god on earth  the  prospect of such a kingdom would be painful enough to those who were in  their wrong place to those who were undeserving  all who were useless  taking wages either from man or from god without doing any work in  return all these would have but too good reason to dread the coming of  the kingdom of god  but those who were trying earnestly to do their work though amid many  mistakes and failures why should they dread the coming of the kingdom of  god  why should they shrink from remembering that though gods kingdom  is not come in perfection and fulness it is here already and they are  in it  why should they shrink from that thought  they will find it full  of comfort of strength and hope if they will but hallow their fathers  name and remember the fact of all factsthat they have a father in  heaven  there are thousands on earth from the highest to the lowest  who can say honestlyto take the commonest instanceevery parent can  say iti have a heavy work to do a heavy responsibility to fulfil   god knows i did not seek it thrust myself into it it was thrust upon  me  it came to me in the course of nature or of society and  circumstances over which i had no control  in one word it was my duty   but now that i have my duty to do behold i cannot do it  i try my best  but i fail  i come short daily of my own low standard of duty  how much  more of gods perfect standard of it  and the burden of responsibility  the regret for failure is more than i can bear  to such we may answer hallow your fathers name and be of good cheer   your father has given you your work  because he is a father he is  surely educating you for your work  because he is a father he will  surely set you no task which you are unable to fulfil  because he is a  father he will help you to fulfil your task  your station and calling  is his will and because it is a fathers will it is a good will  and the judge of your workhe is no stern taskmaster no unfeeling  tyrant but jesus christ your lord who died for you on the cross  he  knows what is in man  he remembereth that we are but dust  else the  spirit would fail before him and the souls which he has made  he can be  touched with the feeling of our infirmities seeing that he was tempted  in all things like as we are yet without sin  he can sympathise  utterly he can make all just allowances he will judge not by outward  results but by the inward will and desire  he will judge not by the  hearing of the ear nor the seeing of the eye as the shallow cruel world  judges but he will judge righteous judgment  trust your cause to him  and trust yourself to him  believe that if he can sympathise he can  also help for from him as well as from his father proceeds the holy  spirit the lord and giver of life the spirit of wisdom and  understanding the spirit of power and might the spirit of knowledge and  the fear of the lord and he will inspire you to see your duty and do  your duty and rejoice in your duty in spite of weariness and failure  and all the burdens of the flesh and of the spirit  thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven  if that were done it  would abolish all the vice of the world and therefore the misery which  springs from vice  ah that gods will were but done on earth as it is  in the material heaven overhead in perfect order and obedience as the  stars roll in their courses without rest yet without haste as all  created things even the most awful fire and hail snow and vapour wind  and storm fulfil gods word who hath made them sure for ever and ever  and given them a law which shall not be broken  but above them above  the divine and wonderful order of the material universe and the winds  which are gods angels and the flames of fire which are his messengers  above all the prophets and apostles have caught sight of another divine  and wonderful order of rational beings of races loftier and purer than  manangels and archangels thrones and dominions principalities and  powers fulfilling gods will in heaven as it is not alas fulfilled on  earth  and beside them beside the innumerable company of angels are there not  the spirits of just men made perfect freed from the fetters of the gross  animal body and now somewhere in that boundless universe in which this  earth is but a tiny speck doing gods will as they longed to do it on  earth with clearer light fuller faith deeper love mightier powers of  usefulness  ah that we were like to them  ah that we could perform  the least part of our days work on earth as it is performed by saints  and angels for ever in heaven  when we think of what this poor confused  world is and then what it might be were gods will done therein as it  is done in heaven what it might be if even the little of gods will  which we already know the little of gods laws which are proved already  to be certain were carried out with any earnestness by the majority of  mankind or even of one civilized nationwhen we thinkto take the very  lowest groundof the health and wealth the peace and happiness which  would cover this earth did men only do the will of god then if we have  human hearts within usif we care at all for the welfare of our fellow menought not this to be the prayer of all our prayers and ought we not  to welcome any event however awful which would bring mankind to reason  and to virtue and to god and abolish the sin and misery of this unhappy  world  to abolish the superstition the misrule the vice the misery of this  world  that is what christ will do in the day when he has put all  enemies under his feet  that is what christ has been doing step by  step ever since that day when first he came to do his fathers will on  earth in great humility  therefore that is what we must do each in our  place and station if we be indeed his subjects fellowworkers with him  in the improvement of the human race fellowsoldiers with him in the  battle against evil  but what we wish to do for our fellowcreatures we must do first for  ourselves  we can give them nothing save what god has already given us   we must become good before we can make them good and wise before we can  make them wise  let us pray then the lords prayer in spirit and in  truth  let us pray that we may hallow the name of god our father  let  us pray that his kingdom may come in our own hearts  let us pray that we  may do his will on earth as those whom we love and honour do it in  heaven  let us keep that before us day and night as the aim and  purpose of our lives  let us pray for forgiveness of our failures in  that for help to do that better as our years run on  so we shall be  ready for the day in which christ shall have accomplished the number of  his elect and hastened his kingdom  so we shall be found in that dread  day not on the side of evil but of god not on the side of darkness  anarchy and vice but on the side of light of justice and of virtue  which is the side of christ and of god  and so we with all those that  are departed in the faith of his holy name shall have our perfect  consummation and bliss in his eternal and everlasting glory to which may  he of his great mercy bring us all  amen    sermon xxxix  the distracted mind    eversley 1871  matthew vi 34  take no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall  take thought for the things of itself  sufficient unto the day is the  evil thereof  scholars will tell you that the words take no thought do not exactly  express our lords meaning in this text  that they should rather stand  be not anxious about tomorrow  and doubtless they are right on the  whole  but the truth is that we have no word in english which exactly  expresses the greek word which st matthew uses in his gospel and which  we are bound to believe exactly expresses our lords meaning in whatever  language he spoke  the nearest english word i believe isdistracted   be ye not distracted about tomorrow  i do not mean the vulgar sense of  the wordwhich is losing ones senses  but the old and true sense  which is still used by those who speak good english  to distract means literally to pull a thing two different wayseven to  pull it asunder  we speak of distracting a mans attention when we call  him off from looking at one thing to make him look at something else and  we call anything which interrupts us in our business or puts a thought  suddenly out of our heads a distraction  now the greek word which st  matthew uses means very nearly thisbe not divided in your thoughtsdo  not think of two things at oncedo not distract your attention from to days work by fearing and hoping about tomorrow  sufficient for the  day is the evil thereof and you will have quite trouble enough to get  through today honestly and well without troubling yourself with to morrowwhich may turn out very unlike anything which you can dream   this i think is the true meaning of the text and with it i think  agrees another word of our lords which st luke givesand be ye not of  doubtful mind  literally do not be up in the airblown helpless hither  and thither by every gust of wind instead of keeping on the firm  ground and walking straight on about your business stoutly and  patiently step after step  have no vain fears or vain hopes about the  future but do your duty here and now  that is our lords command and  in it lies the secret of success in life  for do we not find do we not find my friends in practice that our  lords words are true  who are the people who get through most work in  their lives with the least wear and tear not merely to their bodily  health but to their tempers and their characters  are they the anxious  people  those who imagine to themselves possible misfortunes and ask  continuallywhat if this happenedor that  what would become of me  then  how should i be able to pull through such a trouble  where shall  i find friends  how shall i make myself safe against the chances and  changes of life  do we not know that those people are the very ones who  do little work and often less than none by thus distracting their  attention and their strength from their daily duty daily business  that  while they are looking anxiously for future opportunities they are  neglecting the opportunities which they have already  while they are  making interest with others to help them they forget to help themselves   that in proportion as they lose faith in god and his goodness they lose  courage and lose cheerfulness and have too often to find a false courage  and a false cheerfulness by drowning their cares in drink or in mean  cunning and plotting and planning which usually ends in failure and in  shame  are those who do most work either the plotting or intriguing people  i  do not mean base false people  of them i do not speak here  but really  good and kind people honest at heart who yet are full of distractions  of another sort who are of double mindlook two ways at once and are  afraid to be quite open quite straightforwardwho like to compass their  ends as the old saying is that is to go round about towards what they  want instead of going boldly up to it who like to try two or more ways  of getting the same thing done and as the proverb has it have many  irons in the fire who love little schemes and plots and mysteries  even when there is no need for them  do such people get most work done   far far from it  they take more trouble about getting a little matter  done than simpler and braver men take about getting great matters done   they fret themselves they weary themselves they waste their brains and  heartsand sometimes their honesty besidesand if they fail as in the  chances and changes of this mortal life they must too often fail have  nothing for all their schemings save vanity and vexation of spirit  but the man who will get most work done and done with the least trouble  whether for himself for his family or in the calling and duty to which  god has called him will be the man who takes our lords advice  who  takes no thought for the morrow and leaves the morrow to take thought  for itself  that man will believe that this world is a wellordered  world as it needs must be seeing that god made it god redeemed it god  governs it and that god is merciful in thisthat he rewardeth every man  according to his works  that man will take thought for today earnestly  and diligently even at times anxiously and in fear and trembling but he  will not distract and divide and weaken his mind by taking thought for  tomorrow also  each day he will set about the duty which lies nearest  him with a whole heart and with a single eye giving himself to it for  the time as if there was nothing else to be done in the world  as for  what he is to do next he will think little of that  little even will  he think of whether his work will succeed or not  that must be as god  shall will  all that he is bound to do is to do his best and his best  he can only do by throwing his whole soul into his work  as his day he  trusts his strength will be and he must not waste the strength which god  has given him for today on vain fears or vain dreams about tomorrow   today is quite full enough of anxiety of care of toil of ignorance   sufficient for the day is the evil thereof  yes and sufficient for the  day is the good thereof likewise  today and tomorrow too may end  very differently from what he hoped  yes but they may end too very  differently from what he feared  let him throw his whole soul into the  thing which he is about and leave the rest to god  for so only will he come to the days end in that wholesome and manful  temper contented if not cheerful satisfied with the work he has had to  do if not satisfied with the way in which he has done it which will  leave his mind free to remember all his comforts all his blessings even  to those commonest of all blessings which we are all too apt to forget  just because they are as necessary as the air we breathe which will show  him how much light there is even on the darkest day  he has not got this or that fine thing it may be for which he longed   but he has at least his life at least his reason at least his  conscience at least his god  are not they enough to possess  are not  they enough wherewith to lie down at night in peace and rise tomorrow  to take what comes tomorrow even as he took what came today  and will  he not be most fit to take what comes tomorrow like a christian man  whether it be good or evil with his spirit braced and yet chastened by  honest and patient labour instead of being weakened and irritated by  idling over today while he dreamed and fretted about tomorrow  ah  i fancy that i hear some one sayperhaps a womanso easy to  preach but so difficult to practise  so difficult to think of one thing  at a time  so difficult not to plot not to fret with a whole family of  children dependent on you  what does the preacher know of a womans  troubles  how many things she has to think of day by day not one of  which she dares forgetand yet can seldom or never for all her  recollecting contrive to get them all done  how can she help being  distracted by the thought of tomorrow  can he feel for frail me  does  he know what i go through  yes  i do know and i wonder and admire   to me the sight of any poor woman managing her family respectably and  thriftily is one of the most surprising sights on earth as it is one of  the most beautiful sights on earth  how she finds time for it wit for  it patience for it courage for it i cannot conceive  i have wondered  often why many a woman does not lie down and die for sheer weariness of  body and soul  i have fancied often that god must give some special  grace to all good mothers to enable them to do all that they do and  bear all they bear  but still the women who do most who bring up their  families best are surely those who obey their lords command who give  their whole souls to each days work and think as little as they can of  tomorrow  with them surely the true wisdom is not to fret not to  plot to do the duty which lies nearest them and leave the rest to god  to get each weeks bill paid trusting to god to send money for the week  to come to get their children every day to school to correct in them  each fault as it shews itself without looking forward too much to how  the child will turn out at last  for them and for parents of all ranks  the wisest plan i believe is to make no farfetched plans for their  childrens future certainly no ambitious intrigues for their marriage   but simply to educate themthat is to bring out in them day by day  all that is purest and best wisest and ablest and leave the rest to  god sure that if they are worth anything their father in heaven will  find them work to do and a place at his table in this life and in the  life to come  yes my dear friends this is the true philosophy the philosophy which  christ preaches to us allto old and young rich and poor ploughman and  scholar maid wife and widow all alike  fret not  plot not  look not too far ahead  fret notlest you lose temper and be moved to do evil  plot notlest  you lose faith in god and be moved to be dishonest  look not too far  aheadso far only as to keep yourselves out of open and certain danger lest you see what is coming before you are ready for the sight  if we  foresaw the troubles which may be coming perhaps it would break our  hearts and if we foresaw the happiness which is coming perhaps it would  turn our heads  let us not meddle with the future and matters which are  too high for us but refrain our souls and keep them low like little  children content with the days food and the days schooling and the  days playhours sure that the divine master knows that all is right  and how to train us and whither to lead us though we know not and need  not know save thisthat

was heard in that he feared though he  were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered  this is the lesson of life  this is gods way of educating us of making  us men and women worthy of the name of men and women worthy of the name  of children of god  as christ learnt so must we  if it was necessary  for him who know no sin how much more for us who have sins enough and to  spare  though he was the eternal son of god yet he learnt obedience by  the things which he suffered  though we are gods adopted children we  must learn obedience by what we suffer  he had to offer up prayer with  strong crying  so shall we have to do again and again before we die  he  was heard in that he feared god and said father not my will but thine  be done  and so shall we  he was perfected by sufferings  god grant  that we may be so likewise  he had to do like us  god grant that we may  do like him  god grant it  that is all i can say  i cannot be sure of it for myself  or for any of you  i can only hope and trust in god  life is hard  workany life at least which is worth being called life which is not  the life of a swine who thinks of nothing but feeding himself or of a  butterfly which thinks of nothing but enjoying itself  those are easy  lives enough  but the end thereof is death  the swine goes to the  slaughter  the butterfly dies of the frostand there is an end of them   but the manly life the life of good deeds and noble thoughts and  usefulness and purity the life which is discontented with itself and  which the better it is longs the more to be better still the life which  will endure through this world into the world to come and on and upward  for ever and for everthat life is not an easy life to live it is very  often not a pleasant life very often a sad lifeso sad that that is  true of it which the great poet says   who neer his bread in sorrow ate who never in the midnight hours sat weeping on his lonely bed he knows you not you heavenly powers   you may say this is bad news  i do not believe it is  i believe it is  good news and the very best of news  but if it is bad news i cannot  help it  i did not make it so  god made it so  and god must know best   god is love  and we are his children and he loves us  and therefore  his ways with us must be good and loving ways and any news about them  must be good news and a gospel though

all of us only too ready to forget it and  shut our eyes to it  lent and passion week i say are meant to put us  in mind  and the preacher is bound to put you in mind of it now and  then  he is bound not too often perhaps lest he should discourage  young hearts but now and then to put you in mind of the old greek  proverb the very words of which st paul uses in the text that ta  paæata æaæatasorrows are lessons and that the most truly pitiable  people often are those who have no sorrows and ask for no mans pity  for so it is  the very worst calamity i should say which could befall  any human being would be thisto have his own way from his cradle to his  grave to have everything he liked for the asking or even for the  buying never to be forced to say i should like that  but i cannot  afford it  i should like this  but i must not do itnever to deny  himself never to exert himself never to work and never to want  that  mans soul would be in as great danger as if he were committing great  crimes  indeed he would very probably before he died commit great  crimeslike certain negroes whom i have seen abroad who live a life of  such lazy comfort and safety and superabundance of food that they are  beginning more and more to live the life of animals rather than men   they are like those of whom the psalmist says their eyes swell out with  fatness and they do even what they lust  so do they and indulge in  gross vices which if not checked in some way will end in destroying  them off the face of the earth in a few generations more  i had rather  for the sake of my character my manhood my immortal soul i had rather  i say a hundred times over be an english labourer struggling on on  twelve shillings a week and learning obedience selfdenial self respect and trust in god by the things suffered in that hard life here  at home than be a negro in tropic islands fattening himself in sloth  under that perpetual sunshine and thinking nought of god because poor  fool he can get all he wants without gods help  no my dear young friends this is good for a man  it is necessary for a  man if he is to be a man and a child of god and not a mere animal to  have to work hard whether he likes or not  it is good for a man to bear  the yoke in his youth as jeremiah told the jews when because they  would not bear gods light yoke in their youth but ran riot into luxury  and wantonness and superstition and idolatry which come thereof they  had to bear the heavy yoke of the babylonish captivity in their old age   it is good for a man to be checked crossed disappointed made to feel  his own ignorance weakness folly made to feel his need of god to feel  that in spite of all his cunning and selfconfidence he is no better  off in this world than a lost child in a dark forest unless he has a  father in heaven who loves him with an eternal love and a holy spirit  in heaven who will give him a right judgment in all things who will put  into his mind good desires and enable him to bring those desires to good  effect and a saviour in heaven who can be touched with the feeling of  his infirmities because he too was made perfect by sufferings he too  was tempted in all points like as we are yet without sin  and therefore my dear friends those words which we read in the  visitation of the sick about this matter are not mere kind words meant  to give comfort for the moment  they are truth and fact and sound  philosophy  they are as true for the young lad in health and spirits as  for the old folk crawling towards their graves  it is true and you will  find it true that sickness and all sorts of troubles are sent to  correct and amend in us whatever doth offend the eyes of our heavenly  father  it is true and you will find it true that whom the lord loveth  he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth  it is true  and you will find it true though god knows it is a difficult lesson  enough to learn that there should be no greater comfort to christian  persons than to be made like christ by suffering patiently not only the  hard work of everyday life but adversities troubles and sicknesses  and our heavenly fathers correction whensoever by any manner of  adversity it shall please his gracious goodness to visit them  for  christ himself went not up to joy but first he suffered pain he entered  not into his glory before he was crucified  so truly our way to eternal joy is to labour and to suffer here with  christ  it is true and you will find it true when years hence you look  back as i trust you all will calmly and intelligently on the events of  your own livesyou will find i say that the very events in your lives  which seemed at the time most trying most vexing most disastrous have  been those which wore most necessary for you to call out what was good  in you and to purge out what was bad that by those very troubles your  lord who knows the value of suffering because he has suffered himself  was making true men true women of you hardening your heads while he  softened your hearts teaching you to obey him while he taught you not  to obey your own fancies and your own passions refining and tempering  your characters in the furnace of trial as the smith refines soft iron  into trusty steel teaching you as the great poet says      that life is not as idle ore but heated hot with burning fears and bathed in baths of hissing tears    and battered with the strokes of doom    to shape and use   yes you will learn that and more than that and say in peacebefore i  was troubled i went wrong

cathedral 1872  matthew xxii 21  render therefore unto caesar the things which are  caesars and unto god the things that are gods  many a sermon has been preached and many a pamphlet written on this  text and as too often has happened to holy scripture it has been made  to mean the most opposite doctrines and twisted in every direction to  suit mens opinions and superstitions  some have found in it a command  to obey tyrants invaders any and every government just or unjust   others have found in it rules for drawing a line between the authority of  the state and of the church ie between what the government have a  right to command and what the clergy have a right to demand and many  more matters have they fancied that they discovered in the text which i  do not believe are in it at all  for to understand the original questionis it lawful to pay tribute to  caesar or no we must imagine to ourselves a state of things in judea  utterly different thank god from anything which has been in these  realms for now eight hundred years  the caesar or emperor of rome had  obtained by conquest an authority over the jews very like that which we  have over the hindoos in india  and what was working in the mind of the  jews was very like that which was working in the minds of the hindoos in  the sepoy rebellionwhether it was not a sacred and religious duty to  rise against their conquerors and drive them out  we know from the new  testament that both our lord and his apostles again and again warned them  not to rebel warned them that they would not succeed  but ruin  themselves thereby for that those who took the sword would perish by the  sword  and we know too that the jews would not take our lords advice  nor the apostles but did rise again and again both in judea and  elsewhere gallantly and desperately enough poor creatures in mad  useless rebellion till the romans all but destroyed them off the face of  the earth  but what has that to do with us free selfgoverned  englishmen in this peaceful and prosperous land  in the early middle  age when the clergy represented and defended roman pure christianity and  civilization against the halfheathen and halfbarbaric teutons who had  conquered the roman empire then doubtless the text became once more full  of meaning and the clergy had again and again to defend the things which  belonged to god against the rapacity or the wilfulness of many a barbaric  caesar  but what has that again to do with us  those who apply the  text to any questions which can at present arise between the church and  the state mistake alike it seems to me the nature and functions of an  established church and the nature and functions of a free government  do i mean then that the text has nothing to do with us  god forbid  i  believe that every word of our lords has to do with us and with every  human being for their meaning is infinite eternal and inexhaustible   and what the latter half of the text has to do with us i will try to  show you while i tell you openly that the first half of it about  rendering to caesar the things which are caesars has nothing to do with  us and never need save through our own cowardice and effeminacy or  folly  we have no caesar over us in free england and shall not have while  queen victoria and her children after her reign but if ever one or  many which god forbid should arise and try to set themselves up as  despots over us i trust we shall know how to render them their due be  they native or foreigner in the same coin in which our forefathers have  always paid tyrants and invaders  no  the only caesar which we have to  fearand he is a tyrant who seems ready nowadays to oppose and exalt  himself above all that is called god or is worshippedpatronizing of  course religion as a harmless sanction for order and respectability  but dictating morality while telling us all day long with a thousand  voices and a thousand pensright is not the eternal law of god   whatever profits me whatever i like whatever i votethat and that  alone is right and you must do it at your peril  do you know who that  caesar is my friends  he is called public opinionthe huge anonymous  idol which we ourselves help to make and then tremble before the  creation of our own cowardice whereas if we will but face him in the  fear of god and the faith of christ determined to say the thing which is  true and do the thing which is right we shall find the modern caesar  but a phantom of our own imagination a tyrant indeed as long as he is  feared but a coward as soon as he is defied  to that caesar let us never bow the knee  render to him all that he  deservesthe homage of common courtesy common respectability common  charitynot in reverence for his wisdom and strength but in pity for  his ignorance and weakness  but render always to god the things which  are gods  that duty my good friends lies on us as on all mankind  still from our cradle to our grave and after that through all eternity   let us go back or rather let us go home to the eternal laws of god  which were ages before we were born and will be ages after we are  deadto the everlasting rock on which we all stand which is the will  and mind of our lord jesus christ the son of god to whom all power is  given as he said himself in heaven and on earth  and we have need to  do so for in such times of change as these are there will always be too  many who fancy that changes in society and government change their duty  about religion and are some of them sorely puzzled as to their duty to  god  and others ready to take advantage of the change to throw off their  duty to god and run into licence and schism and fanaticism  now let all people clearly understand and settle it in their hearts  that no change in church or in state can change in the least their duty  to god and to man  if the world were turned upside down god would still  be where he is and we where we arein his presence  right would still  be right my friends and wrong wrong though all the loud voices in the  world shouted that wrong is right and right wrong  no change of time  place society government circumstance of any kind can alter our duty  to god and our power of doing that duty  whatever the caesar of the  hour may require us to render to him what we are bound to render to god  remains the same  the two things are different in kind so different  that they never need interfere with each other  even if which god forbid the connection between church and state were  dissolved even if which god forbid the church of england were  destroyed for a whileif all churches were destroyedyea if not a  place of worship were left for a while in this or any other land yet  even then i say we could still render to god the things which are  gods and offer to him spiritual sacrifices more pleasing to him than  the most gorgeous ceremonies which the devotion and art and wealth of  man ever devisedsacrifices by virtue of which the church would arise  out of her ruins like the jewish church after the captivity more pure  more glorious and more triumphant than ever  what do i mean  i mean thisthat there are three sacrifices which every  man woman and child can offer and should offer however lowly however  uneducated in what the world calls education nowadays  those they can  offer to god and with them they can worship god and render to god the  things which are gods wherever they are whatever they are doing  whatever be the laws of their country or the state of society round  them  for of these sacrifices our lord himself said the true  worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth  for the  father seeketh such to worship him  now what are these spiritual sacrifices  first and foremost surely the sacrifice of repentance of which it is  written the sacrifice of god is a broken spirit  a broken and a  contrite heart oh god thou wilt not despise  surely when weeven the  best of uslook back on our past lives when we recollect if not great  and positive sins and crimes yet the opportunities which we have  neglected the time and often the money which we have wasted the  meannesses the tempers the spite the vanity the selfishness which we  have too often indulgedwhen we think of what we have been and what we  might have been what we are and what we might be when we measure  ourselves not by the paltry low and often impure standard of the world  around us but by the pure lofty truly heroical standard of our lord  jesus christwhat can we say but that we are miserablethat is  pitiful and pitiable sinners who have left undone what we ought to have  done and done that which we ought not to have done till there is no  health in us  and if you ask me how is it a sacrifice to god to confess to him that we  are sinners the answer is simple  it is a sacrifice to god and a  sacrifice wellpleasing to him simply because it is the truth  god  wants nothing from us we can give him nothing  the wild beasts of the  forest are his and so are the cattle on a thousand hills  if he be  hungry he will not tell us for the whole world is his and all that is  therein  but what he asks is that for our own sakes we should see the  truth about ourselves see what we really are and sacrifice that self conceit which prevents our seeing ourselves as god our father sees us   and why does that please god  simply because it puts us in our right  state and in our right place where we can begin to become better men  let us be as bad as we may  if a man be a fool the best possible thing  for him is that he should find out that he is a fool and confess that he  is a fool as the first and the absolutely necessary first step to  becoming wise  therefore repentance contrition humility is the very  foundationstone of all goodness virtue holiness usefulness and god  desires to see us contrite simply because he desires to see us good men  and good women  next the sacrifice of thankfulness of which it is written i will  offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call upon the name  of the lord  and againby christ let us offer the sacrifice of praise  continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks unto his name   ah my friends if we offered that sacrifice oftener we should have more  seldom need to offer the first sacrifice of repentance  i am astonished  when i look at my own heart by which alone i can judge the hearts of  others to see how unthankful one is  how one takes as a matter of  course without one aspiration of gratitude to our father in heavenhow  one takes as a matter of course i say life health reason freedom  education comfort safety and all the blessings of humanity and of  this favoured land  how we never really feel that these are all gods  undeserved and unearned mercies and then how if we set our hearts on  anything which we have not got forget all that we have already and  begin entreating god to give us something which if we had we know not  whether it would be good for us like children crying peevishly for  sweets after their parents have given them all the wholesome food they  need  ah that we would offer to god more frankly the sacrifice of  thanksgiving  so we should do god justice by confessing all we owe to  him and so we must believe we should please god for if god be indeed  our father in heaven as surely as a parent is pleased with the affection  and gratitude of his child so will our father in heaven be pleased when  he sees us love him who first loved us  nextthe sacrifice of righteousness of which it is written present  your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable to god which is your  reasonable service  to be good and to do good even to long to be good  and to long to do good to hunger and thirst after righteousness is the  best and highest sacrifice which any human being can offer to his father  in heaven  for so he honours his father most truly for he longs and  strives to be like that father to be good as god is good holy as god is  holy beneficent and useful even as god is infinitely beneficent and  useful being in one word perfect as his father in heaven is perfect   this is the best and highest act of worship the truest devotion  for  pure worship says st james and undefiled before god and the father is  this to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep  ourselves unspotted from the world  yesevery time we perform an act of kindness to any human being aye  even to a dumb animal every time we conquer our own worldliness love of  pleasure ease praise ambition money for the sake of doing what our  conscience tells us to be our duty we are indeed worshipping god the  father in spirit and in truth and offering him a sacrifice which he will  surely accept for the sake of his beloved son by whose spirit all good  deeds and thoughts are inspired  think of these things my friends always but above all think of them  as often as you comeas would to god all would cometo the altar of the  lord and the holy communion of his body and blood  for there indeed  you render to god that which is godsnamely yourselves there you  offer to god the true sacrifice which is the sacrifice of yourselves the sacrifice of repentance the sacrifice of thanksgiving the sacrifice  of righteousness or at least of hunger and thirst after righteousness  and there you receive in return your share of gods sacrifice the  sacrifice which you did not make for him but which he made for you when  he spared not his onlybegotten son but freely gave him for us  that is the sacrifice of all sacrifices the wonder of all wonders the  mystery of all mysteries and it is also the righteousness of all  righteousness the generosity of all generosity the nobleness of all  nobleness the beauty of all beauty the love of all love  thinking of  that beholding in that bread and wine the tokens of the boundless love  of god then surely surely our repentance for past follies our  thankfulness for present blessings our longing to be good pure useful  humane generous highmindedin one word to be holyought to rise up  in us into a passion as it were of noble shame at our own selfishness  and admiration of gods unselfishness a longing to follow his divine  example and to live not for ourselves but for our fellowmen  if we  could but once understand the full meaning of those awful yet glorious  words he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all  how shall he not with him also freely give us all things then indeed  we should understand that the one overpowering reason for being unselfish  and doing good is thisthat we are gods children and that god our  father is utterly unselfish and utterly does good even at the sacrifice  of himself and that therefore when we are unselfish and do good even  at the sacrifice of ourselves we do indeed in spirit and in truth  render unto god the things that are gods    sermon xlii  the unjust steward    eversley 1866  ninth sunday after trinity  luke xvi 8  and the lord commended the unjust steward because he had  done wisely  none of our lords parables has been as difficult to explain as this one   learned and pious men have confessed freely in all ages that there is  much in the parable which they cannot understand and i am bound to  confess the same  the puzzle is plainly why our lord should seem to  bid us to copy the conduct of a bad man and a cheat  for this is the  usual interpretation  the steward has been cheating his master already   when he is found out and about to be dismissed he cheats his master  still further by telling his debtors to cheat and so wins favour with  them  but does our lord bid us copy a cheat  i cannot believe that and the  text i should have said ought to give us a very different notion  we  read that the lordthat is the stewards mastercommended the unjust  steward  what  commended him for cheating him a second time and  teaching his debtors to cheat him  he must have been a man of a strange  charactervery unlike any man whom we know or at all events any man  whom we should wish to knowto have done that  but it is saidhe  commended him for having acted wisely  now that word wisely may merely  mean prudently sensibly and with common sense  but if the master  thought that to cheat or to teach others to cheat was acting either  wisely or prudently then he was a very foolish and shortsighted man  and altogether mistaken  for be sure and certain and settle it in your  minds that neither falsehood or dishonesty is ever either wise or  prudent but shortsighted foolish certain to punish itself  such  teaching is totally contrary to our lords own teaching  agree with  thine adversary quickly he says while thou art in the way with him  lest he deliver thee to the judge  if thou hast done wrong right it  again as soon as possible for your sin will surely find you out and  avenge itself  give the devil his due says the good old proverb  pay  him at once and be done with him  but never think to escape out of his  clutches as too many wretched and foolish sinners do by running up a  fresh score with him and trying to hide old sins by new ones  be sure  that if the steward cheated his master a second time the master was  foolish and mistaken and as it were a partner in the stewards sin by  commending him  but if so why does our lord mention it  what had our  lord to do what have we to do with the opinion of so foolish a man  it seems to me that the only reason for our lords using the words of the  text must be that the master was right not wrong in commending the  steward  but it seems to me also that the master could be right only  if the steward was right alsoif the steward had done the right and just  thing at last and instead of cheating his master a second time had  done his best to make restitution for his own sins  but how could that be  we know nothing of what these debtors were  all  we know is that one believed that he owed the lord a hundred measures of  oil and another believed that he owed him a hundred measures of wheat  and that the steward told one to put down in his bill eighty and the  other fifty  now suppose that the steward had been cheating and  oppressing these men as was common enough in those days with stewards  and has been common enough since suppose that he had been charging them  more than they really owed and it may be putting the surplus into his  own pocket and so wasting his masters goodsthat the one really owed  only eighty measures of oil and the other really owed only fifty of  wheat what could be more simple or more truly wise either when he was  found out than to do thisto go round to the debtors and confess  i  have been overcharging you you do not owe what i have demanded of you  take your bill and write fourscore for that is what you really owe  this is but a guess on my part  but all other explanations are only  guesses likewise because we do not know how business was transacted in  those days and in that country  we do not know whether these debtors  were tenants paying rent in kind or traders to whom goods had been  advanced or what they were  we do not know whether the steward was  agent of the estate or house steward or what he was  but this we do  knowthat to mend one act of villainy by committing a fresh one is not  wisdom but foolishness and we may be sure that our lord would never  have held up the unjust steward as an example to us or quoted his  masters opinion of him if all he did was to commit fraud on fraud and  make bad worse thereby risking his own more utter ruin  and this view  of the parable surely agrees with our lords own lesson which he draws  from it  and i say unto you make to yourselves friends of the mammon  of righteousness  but what does that mean  wise men have been puzzled  by that text as much as by the parable but surely our lord himself  explains it in the verses which follow  he that is faithful in that  which is least is faithful also in much and he that is unjust in that  which is least is unjust also in much  he that is faithful  the  unjust steward was commended for acting wisely  now it seems the way to  act wisely is to act faithfullythat is honestly  our lord bids us copy  the unjust steward and make ourselves friends of the mammon of  unrighteousness  now it seems he tells us that the way to make friends  of men by money transactions is to deal faithfully and honestly by them   this then was perhaps why the lord commended the unjust steward because  he had been converted in time and seen his true interest and for once  at least in his life become just  he had found out that after all  honesty is the best policy as god grant all of us may find out if any of  us have not found it out already  honesty is the best policy   faithfulness as our lord calls it is the true wisdom  and in that as  our lord says the children of this world are wiser in their generation  than the children of light  the children of this world the plain  worldly men of business find that to conduct their business they must be  faithful diligent punctual accurate cautious businesslike  they  must have practical common sense which is itself a kind of honesty   they must be men of their word just and true in their dealings or  sooner or later they will fail  their schemes their money their  credit their character will fail them and they will be overwhelmed by  ruin  and that is just what too often the children of light forget  the  children of light have a higher light a deeper teaching from god than  the children of the world  they have a great insight into what ought to  be they see that mankind might be far wiser happier better holier  than they are they have noble and lofty hopes for the future they  desire the welfare and the holiness of mankind  but they are too apt to  want practical common sense  and so they are laughed at and deservedly  as dreamers as fanatics as foolish unpractical people who are wasting  their talents on impossible fancies  often while their minds are full of  really useful and noble schemes they neglect their business their  families their common duties till they cause misery to those around  them and shame to themselves  often too they are tempted to be  actually dishonest to fancy that the means sanctify the end that it is  lawful to do evil that good may come and so in order to carry out some  fine scheme of theirs to say false things or do mean or cruel things  not for their own interest but as they fancy for the cause of god  as  if god and gods cause could ever be helped by the devil and his works   and so they cast a scandal on religion and give the enemies of the lord  reason to blaspheme  so it was it seems in our lords timeso it has  been too often since  the children of lightthose who ought to be of  most use to their own generationare sometimes of least use to it  through their own weaknesses and follies  they will not remember that he  that is not faithful in that which is least in the everyday concerns of  life is not likely to be faithful in that which is greatest that if  they will not be faithful in the unrighteous mammonthat is if they  cannot resist the temptations to meanness and unfairness which come with  all money transactions god will not commit to them the true richesthe  power of making their fellow creatures wiser happier better  if they  will not be faithful in that which is another mansin plain english if  they will not pay their debts honestly who will give them that which is  their ownthe inspiration of gods indwelling spirit  would to god all  high religious professors would recollect that and be just and honest  before they pretend to higher graces and counsels of perfection  this lesson then i think our lord means to teach us  i do not say it  is the only lesson in the parable god forbid  but i think that our  lords own words show us that this is one lesson  that however pious we  are however enlightened we are however useful we wish to be in one  word however much we are or fancy ourselves to be children of light  our first duty as christian men is the duty which lies nearest usthat  of which it is written  if a man know not how to rule his own house  how shall he take care of the church of god  and again if any provide  not for his own and specially for those of his own house he hath denied  the faith and is worse than an infidel  our first duty i say as  christian men is to be just and honest in money matters and everyday  business and over and above that to be generous and liberal therein   not merely to paywhich the very publicans in our lords time didbut  to give generously liberally lending if we can afford it as our lord  bids us hoping for nothing again and remembering that he who giveth to  the poor lendeth to the lord and whatsoever he layeth out it shall be  repaid him again  yes my friends we must all needs take our lords advicemake to  yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness that when ye fail  they may receive you into everlasting habitations  when ye fail literally when you are eclipsed as the sun is eclipsed  that must  happen to all of us to the best the wisest the most famous  each must  be eclipsed and passed in the race of life and forgotten for some  younger man  each in turn must fail  one may fail in moneythe mammon  for which he toiled may take to itself wings and fly away or he may fail  in his plans noble plans and useful though they seemed and he may  find as he grows old that the world has not gone his way but quite  another one or he may fail in health and be cut down and crippled and  laid by in the midst of his work  and even if he escapes all these  disasters he must needs fail at last by mere old age when the days  come when thou shalt say i have no pleasure in them when the sun and  the light are darkened and the clouds return after the rain when the  strong men bow themselves and those who look out of the windows are  dark and he shall rise up at the voice of a bird and fears shall be in  the way and the grasshopper shall be a burden and desire shall fail   because man goeth to his long home and the mourners go about the  streets  think for yourselves  what would you wish your end to be lonely unhappy without the love the respect the care of your fellow men or surrounded by friends who comfort your failing body and soul on  earth and receive you at last into everlasting habitations  make friends make friends against that day whether or not you make them  out of the mammon of unrighteousness  if you have been unrighteous  bring friends back to you as the steward did by being just and fair by  confessing your faults freely by doing your best to atone for them  and  if you have no share in the mammon of unrighteousness still make  friends  make them by truth and justice make them by generosity and  usefulness  to ease every burden and let the oppressed go free to feed  the hungry clothe the naked and what the very poorest can docomfort  the mourner to nurse the sick to visit the fatherless and widows in  their affliction and so keep ourselves unspotted from the selfishness of  the worldthis is that true religion acceptable in the sight of god the  fatherand happy he who has so served god  happy for him when he  begins to fail to see round him attached hearts and grateful faces  hands ready to tend him as he has tended others  and happier still to  remember that on the other side of the dark river of death are other  grateful faces other loving hearts ready to welcome him into  everlasting habitationsand among them and above them all one whose  form is as the son of man full of all humanity himself and loving and  rewarding all humanity in his creatures saying inasmuch as ye did it  to one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me    sermon xliii  the rich and the poor    chapel royal whitehall 1871  proverbs xxii 2  the rich and poor meet together  the lord is the  maker of them all  i have been asked to preach here this afternoon on behalf of the  parochial mission womens fund  i may best describe the object for which  i plead as an attempt to civilise and christianise the women of the  lower classes in the poorer districts of london and other great towns by  means of women of their own classwomen who have gone through the same  struggles as they have and who will be trusted by them to understand and  to sympathize with their needs and difficulties  these mission women are  in communication with ladysuperintendents in each ecclesiastical  district  these are i understand usually the wives of small tradesmen  or of clerks  they again are in communication with ladies at the west  end of london who are willing to give personal help and money for  certain objects but not indiscriminate alms  and thus a series of links  is established between the most prosperous and the least prosperous  classes by means of which the rich and the poor may meet together and  learnto the infinite benefit of boththat the lord is the maker of  them all  considering this excellent scheme i could not help seeing as  a background to it a very different and a far darker scene  i could not  help remembering that during these very days the poorer classes of  another great city had taken up an attitude full of awful lessons to us  and to every civilized country upon earth  we have been reading of a  hundred thousand armed men encamped in the suburbs of belleville and  montmartre with cannon and mitrailleuses uttering through their organs  threats which leave no doubt that the meaning of this movement isas  some of them boldly phrase ita war of the poor against the rich   there is no mistaking what that means  this madness has been stopped for  the time we are told principally as was to be expected by the  superior common sense of their wives  but only i fear for a time   such men will go far if not this time then some other time  for they  believe what they say and know what they want  they have done with  phrases done with illusions  they are no longer deceived and hampered  by party cries against this and that grievance real or imaginary the  abolition of which the working classes demand so eagerly from time to  time in the vain belief that if it were only got rid of the millennium  would be at hand  they have done long ago with remedial halfmeasures   landed aristocracy established church military classes privileged  classes restricted suffrage and all the rest have been abolished in  their country for two generations and more  but behold the poor man  finds himself or fancies himself which is just as dangerous no richer  safer happier after all and begins to see a far simpler remedy for all  his ills  he has too little of this worlds goods while others have too  much  what more fair more simple than that he should take some of the  rich mans goods and if he resists kill him crying thou sayest let  me eat and drink for tomorrow i die  then i too will eat and drink  for tomorrow i die  and so will the rich and poor meet together with  a vengeance simply because neither of them has learnt that the lord is  the maker of them all  this is a hideous conclusion  but it is one towards which the poor will  tend in every country in which the rich are merely rich spending their  wealth in selfenjoyment atoned for by a modicum of alms  i said a modicum of alms  i ought to have said any amount of alms any  amount of charity  throughout the great cities of europein london as  much as anywherehundreds of thousands are saying we want no alms  we  intend to reconstitute society even at the expense of blood so that no  man woman or child shall need the rich mans alms  we do not choose  for it is not just that he should take credit to himself for giving us a  shilling when he owes us a pound ten a hundred poundsowes us in  fact all by which he and his class are richer than us and our class   and we will make him pay his debt  i do not say that such words are wise  i believe them to be foolish suicidal  i believe that it is those who patiently wait on the lord and  not the discontented who fret themselves till they do evil who will  inherit the land and be refreshed in peace  i believe that all those  who take the sword will perish by the sword that those who appeal to  brute force will always find itjust because it is brute forcealways  strongest on the side of the rich who can hire it for evil as for good  i only say that so hundreds of thousands think so they speak and will  speak more and more loudly as long as the present tone of society  enduresgoodnatured and well meaning but luxurious covetous  ignoble frivolous ignorant believingall classes alike not only that  money makes the man but worse farthat money makes the woman also and  all the while halfashamed of itself halfdistrustful of itself and  trying to buy off man by alms and god by superstition  so long as the great mass of the poor of any city know nothing of the  great mass of the rich of that city save as folk who roll past them in  their carriages seemingly easy while they are struggling seemingly  happy while they are wretched so long will the rich of that city be  supposed however falsely to be what the french workmen used to call  mangeurs dhommesexploiteurs dhommesto get their wealth by means of  the poverty their comfort by means of the misery of their fellowmen  and so long will they be exposed to that mere envy and hatred which  pursues always the more prosperous till in some national crisis when  the rich and poor meet together both parties will be but too apt to  behave through mutual fear and hate as if not god but the devil was  the maker of them all  these words are strong  how can they be too strong in face of what is  now passing in a neighbouring land  not too strong either in view of  the actual state of vast masses of the poor in london itself and indeed  of any one of our great cities  that matter has been reported on preached on spoken on till all other  civilized countries reproach britain with the unique contrast between the  exceeding wealth of some classes and the exceeding poverty of others  till we instead of being startled by the reproach take the present  state of things as a matter of course a physical necessity a law of  nature and society that there should be in the back streets of every  great city hordes of must i say savages neither decently civilized  nor decently christianized uncertain most of them of regular  livelihood and therefore shiftless and reckless extravagant in  prosperity and in adversity falling at once into want and pauperism   you may ask any clergyman any minister of religion of any denomination  whether the thing is not so  or if you want to read the latest news  about the degradation of your fellowsubjects read a little book called  east and west and judge for yourselves whether such a population  numbered by hundreds of thousands are in a state pleasing to god or  safe for those classes of whom they only know that they pay them wages  and that these wages are as small as they can be forced to take  read  that book and then ask yourselves is it wonderful that in one  district before the mission of the society for which i plead was  established the poor used seriously to believe that it was the wish and  endeavour of the rich to grind them down and keep them poor  we of  course know that the poor folk were mistaken but do we not know too some of usthat there are political economists in the world who though  they would not willingly make the poor poorer than they are are still of  opinion that it is good for the nation on the whole that the present  state of things should continue that there should be always a reserve of  labour in plain english a vast multitude who have not quite work enough  to live on ready to be called on in any emergency of business and used  to beat down by their competition the wages of their fellowworkmen   is this theory altogether novel and unheard of  or this theory also  that for this very reason emigration which looks the very simplest  remedy for most of this wantwhile ninetenths of the bounteous earth  is waiting to be subdued and replenished by the poor wretches who cannot  get at itthat emigration i say is an unnecessary movementthat the  people are all wanted at hometo be such as the parson and the mission  women find them  and it may be that the poor folk have heardfor a bird of the air may  carry the matter in these days of a free pressthat some rich folk at  least hold this opinion and translate it freely out of the delicate  language of political economy into the more vigorous dialect used in the  fever alleys and smallpox courts in which the poor are left to wait for  work  but if there be any rich persons in this congregation who hold  these peculiar economic doctrines let me recommend to them more than to  any other persons present that they would support a society which  alleviates the hard pressure of their system which helps to make it  tolerable and prudent by teaching the poor to save by teaching them in  london alonehow to save œ54000 in the last eleven years  let them  help this society heartily  the children of this world arein their generationwiser than the  children of light  but how long their generation will last depends  mainly we are told on how far they make themselves friends out of the  mammon of unrighteousness  but if again there be rich people in this congregation as i trust  there are many and many who start indignant at such an imputation and  utterly deny its truththenif it be false why in the name of god  and of humanity and of common prudence why do they not go to these  people and tell them so  why do they not prove that it is not so by  showing a little more human sympathy not merely for them behind their  backs but sympathy with them face to face  if they wish to know how  much can be done by only a little active kindness they have only to read  the pages of that painful and yet pleasant bookeast and west which i have just quoted and to read also an appendix to ita paper  originally read at the church congress manchester by the present lord  chancellora document which it would be an impertinence in me to  recommend or praise  bring yourselves then boldly into contact with these classes and  especially into contact with the womenwith the wives and mothers  for  it is through the women through them mainly if not altogether that  civilization and religion can be introduced among any degraded class  it  was so in the middle age  the legends which tell us how woman was then  the civilizer the softener the purifier the perpetual witness to  fierce and coarse men that there were nobler aims in life than pleasure  and power and the gratification of revenge that not selfassertion but  selfsacrifice was the divine ideal toward which all must aspire  these  old legends are immortal for they speak of facts and laws which will  endure as long as there are women upon earth  through the woman the  civilizer and the christianizer must reach the man  through the wife he  must reach the husband  through the mother he must reach the children   i say he must  it is easy to complain that the clergy in every age and  country have tried to obtain influence over women  they have been forced  to do so because otherwise they could obtain no influence at all  and  if a priesthood should arise hereafter whose calling was to teach not  religion but irreligion not the good news that there is a good god and  that we can know him but the bad news that there is no god or if there  is we cannot know him then would that priesthood find it necessary to  appeal like all other priesthoods to the women and to teach them how to  teach their children  but more  it is not religion only which must be taught through the wives  and mothers but sound science also and sound economy  if you intend  as i trust some here intend to teach the labouring classes those laws  of health and life on which depend the comfort the wholesomeness often  the decency and the morality of the poor mans home then you must teach  those laws first to the housemother who brings the children into the  world and brings them up who puts them to bed at night and prepares  their food by day  if you wish to teach habits of thrift and sound  notions of economy to the labouring classes you must teach them first to  the housewife who has to make the weekly earnings cover if possible  the weeks expenses  if you wish to soften and to purify the man you  must first soften and purify the woman or at least encourage her not to  lose what womanliness she has left amid sights and sounds and habits  which tend continually to destroy her womanhood  you must encourage her  i say to remember always that she is a woman still and let her teach as none can teach like hertrue manfulness to her husband and her sons  and how can you best do that  not by giving her shillings not by  preaching at her not by scolding her  but by behaving to her as what  she isa woman and a sisterand cheering her heavy heart by simple  human kindliness  what she wants amid all her poverty and toil her  childbearing and childrearing what she wants i say to keep her brave  and strong is to know by actual sight and speech that she is still not  an outcast not alone that she is still a member of the human family  that her fellowwoman has not forgotten her and that therefore it may  be he that was born of woman has not forgotten her either  that she  has after all a god in heaven who can be touched with the feeling of  her infirmities and can help her and those she loves to struggle  through all their temptations seeing that he too was tempted in all  things like them yet without sin  it is only personal intercourse with themonly the meeting of the rich  and poor together in the belief that god is the maker of them all that  will do that  but it will do it  only personal intercourse will reconcile these people to their condition  in as far as they ought to be reconciled to it  but personal intercourse  will reconcile them to it as far as it ought but no further  and i  think that the system of personal intercourse attempted by this society  is on the whole the best yet devised  it is imperfect as all attempts  to make that straight which is crooked and to number that which is  wantingto patch in a word a radically vicious system of society must be imperfect but it is the best plan which i have yet seen  i find  no fault with other plans god forbid  wisdom is justified of all her  children and the amount of evil is so great and as i believe so  dangerous that i must bid godspeed to any persons who will do  anything always saving and excepting indiscriminate almsgiving  but it seems to me that the soothing and civilizing and in due time  christianising effect of personal intercourse cannot begin better than  through a woman herself of the working class who has struggled as these  poor souls have struggled and conquered more or less where they are  failing  that through her they should be brought in contact with women  of the more comfortable and cultivated class who are their immediate  employers if not their immediate neighbours and through them again  brought in contact with women of that class of whom i shall only say  that if they were not meant for some such noble work as thisand not for  mere pleasure and mere display then for what purpose in heaven or  earth were they made and why has providence taken the trouble as it  were to elaborate by long ages of civilization that most exquisite of  all products of nature and of arta lady  ah what the ladies of england might do and that without interfering in  the least with their duties as wives and mothers if they would work  together as a class  if they would work as well and humanly while they  are in towns as most of them do work while they are in the country as  some of them do to their honour in the towns already  but how many  what proportion do those who do good bear to those who do nothing  what  a small amount of humanizing and civilizing intercourse with some women  of the labouring class is there in the case of the wives of rich men who  come up to town merely for the season and forget that it is their  temporary and uncertain stay in london which causes much of the temporary  and uncertain employment of the london poor and their consequent  temptation to unthrift and recklessness  how little humanizing and  civilizing intercourse with the poor is carried on by the wives of those  employers of labour who surely surely owe something more to their  husbands work people than to be aware by hearsay that they are duly  paid every saturday night  but i shall be told  we need not fearwe can justify ourselves before  god and man  i shall be reminded of all that has been done and done  well too for the poor during the last generation and bidden not to  calumniate my countrymen  true much has been done and done well  and  true also it is that no effort to make the rich and poor meet together  to bring the different classes of society into contact with each other  but has succeededhas sown good seedwhich i trust may bring forth good  fruit in the day when every tree shall be judged by its fruit  the  events of 1830 startling and warning and those of 1848 more pregnant  if possible with warning than the former awakened a spirit of humanity  in england which was also a spirit of prudence and of common sense  but i cannot conceal from myself or you that the earnestness which was  awakened in those days is dying out in these  the richer classes of  every country are tempted from time to time to fits of lazinessfits of  frivolity and luxury surfeits in which men say with a shrug and a  yawnwhy be very much in earnest  why take so much trouble  somebody  must always be rich why should not i  somebody must enjoy the money  why should not i  at all events things will last my time  and that  such a surfeit has fallen upon the rich of this land is a fact for that  this is the tone of today and that the tone increases none can deny  who knows that which calls itself the world and calls itself so only too  truly the world of which it is written that all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but of the world  and the world passeth away and  the lust thereof  but he who doeth the will of god he alone abideth for  ever  god grant that we who have just seen the most cunningly organized and  daintily bedizened specimen of a world which ever flaunted on the earth  since men began to build their towers of babel collapse and crumble at a  single blow may take gods hint that the fashion of this world passeth  away  let the idle the frivolous the sensual and those who like  figaros marquis have earned all earthly happiness by only taking the  trouble to be bornlet them look back on this last awful christmastide  and hear speaking in fact unmistakeable the voice of the lord  think  ye that they whose blood pilate mingled with their sacrifices were  sinners above all the galilaeans because they suffered such things  i  tell you nay  but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish  there are those who will hear such words with a smile even with a sneer  and say such wholesale judgments of god even granting that there are  such things are after all very rare  it is very seldom that a whole  class a whole system of society is punished in massand why then need  we trouble ourselves about so remote a probability  then know thisthat as surely as god sometimes punishes wholesale so  surely is he always punishing in detail  by that infinite concatenation  of moral causes and effects which makes the whole world one mass of  special providences every sin of ours will punish itself and probably  punish itself in kind  are we selfish  we shall call out selfishness in  others  do we neglect our duty  then others will neglect their duty to  us  do we indulge our passions  then others who depend on us will  indulge theirs to our detriment and misery  do we squander our money   then our children and our servants will squander our money for us  do webut what use to go on reminding men of truths which no one  believes because they are too painful and searching to be believed in  comfort  what use to tell men what they never will confess to be true that by every crime folly even neglect of theirs they drive a thorn  into their own flesh which will trouble them for years to come it may  be to their dying day  and yet so it is   though the mills of god grind slowly yet they grind exceeding small though with patience he stands waiting with exactness grinds he all   as those who neglect their fellowcreatures will discover by the most  patent undeniable proofs in that last great day when the rich and poor  shall meet together and then at least discover that the lord is the  maker of them all    footnotes  1  these sermons by the rev charles kingsley ma late rector of  eversley and canon
