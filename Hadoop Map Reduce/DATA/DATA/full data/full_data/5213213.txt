in the green forest  he had just seen mr and mrs quack start toward the big river for a brief visit before leaving on their long difficult journey to the faraway southland  farewells are always rather sad and this particular farewell had left peter with a lump in his throata queer choky feeling  if i were sure that they would return next spring it wouldnt be so bad he muttered  its those terrible guns  i know what it is to have to watch out for them  farmer browns boy used to hunt me with one of them but he doesnt any more  but even when he did hunt me it wasnt anything like what the ducks have to go through  if i kept my eyes and ears open i could tell when a hunter was coming and could hide in a hole if i wanted to  i never had to worry about my meals  but with the ducks it is a thousand times worse  theyve got to eat while making that long journey and they can eat only where there is the right kind of food  hunters with terrible guns know where those places are and hide there until the ducks come and the ducks have no way of knowing whether the hunters are waiting for them or not  that isnt hunting  itsits  well what is it what are you talking to yourself about peter rabbit  peter looked up with a start to find the soft beautiful eyes of lightfoot the deer gazing down at him over the top of a little hemlock tree  its awful declared peter its worse than unfair it doesnt give them any chance at all  i suppose it must be so if you say so replied lightfoot but you might tell me what all this awfulness is about  peter grinned  then he began at the beginning and told lightfoot all about mr and mrs quack and the many dangers they must face on their long journey to the faraway southland and back again in the spring all because of the heartless hunters with terrible guns  lightfoot listened and his great soft eyes were filled with pity for the quack family  i hope they will get through all right said he and i hope they will get back in the spring  it is bad enough to be hunted by men at one time of the year as no one knows better than i do but to be hunted in the spring as well as in the fall is more than twice as bad  men are strange creatures  i do not understand them at all  none of the people of the green forest would think of doing such terrible things  i suppose it is quite right to hunt others in order to get enough to eat though i am thankful to say that i never have had to do that but to hunt others just for the fun of hunting is something i cannot understand at all  and yet that is what men seem to do it for i guess the trouble is they never have been hunted themselves and dont know how it feels  sometimes i think ill hunt one some day just to teach him a lesson  what are you laughing at peter  at the idea of you hunting a man replied peter  your heart is all right lightfoot but you are too timid and gentle to frighten any one  big as you are i wouldnt fear you  with a single swift bound lightfoot sprang out in front of peter  he stamped his sharp hoofs lowered his handsome head until the sharp points of his antlers which people call horns pointed straight at peter lifted the hair along the back of his neck and made a motion as if to plunge at him  his eyes which peter had always thought so soft and gentle seemed to flash fire  oh cried peter in a faint frightenedsounding voice and leaped to one side before it entered his foolish little head that lightfoot was just pretending  lightfoot chuckled  did you say i couldnt frighten any one he demanded  ii didnt know you could look so terribly fierce stammered peter  those antlers look really dangerous when you point them that way  whywhywhat is that hanging to them  it looks like bits of old fur  have you been tearing somebodys coat lightfoot  peters eyes were wide with wonder and suspicion     chapter ii lightfoots new antlers   peter rabbit was puzzled  he stared at lightfoot the deer a wee bit suspiciously  have you been tearing somebodys coat he asked again  he didnt like to think it of lightfoot whom he always had believed quite as gentle harmless and timid as himself  but what else could he think  lightfoot slowly shook his head  no said he i havent torn anybodys coat  then what are those rags hanging on your antlers  demanded peter  lightfoot chuckled  they are what is left of the coverings of my new antlers he explained  whats that  what do you mean by new antlers  peter was sitting up very straight with his eyes fixed on lightfoots antlers as though he never had seen them before  just what i said retorted lightfoot  what do you think of them  i think they are the finest antlers ive ever had  when i get the rest of those rags off they will be as handsome a set as ever was grown in the green forest  lightfoot rubbed his antlers against the trunk of a tree till some of the rags hanging to them dropped off  peter blinked very hard  he was trying to understand and he couldnt  finally he said so  what kind of a story are you trying to fill me up with he demanded indignantly  do you mean to tell me that those are not the antlers that you have had as long as ive known you  how can anything hard like those antlers grow  and if those are new ones where are the old ones  show me the old ones and perhaps ill believe that these are new ones  the idea of trying to make me believe that antlers grow just like plants  ive seen bossy the cow all summer and i know she has got the same horns she had last summer  new antlers indeed  you are quite right peter quite right about bossy the cow she never has new horns but that isnt any reason why i shouldnt have new antlers is it replied lightfoot patiently  her horns are quite different from my antlers  i have a new pair every year  you havent seen me all summer have you peter  no i dont remember that i have replied peter trying very hard to remember when he had last seen lightfoot  i know you havent retorted lightfoot i know it because i have been hiding in a place you never visit  what have you been hiding for demanded peter  for my new antlers to grow replied lightfoot  when my new antlers are growing i want to be away by myself  i dont like to be seen without them or with halfgrown ones  besides i am very uncomfortable while the new antlers are growing and i want to be alone  lightfoot spoke as if he really meant every word he said but still peter couldnt he just couldnt believe that those wonderful great antlers had grown out of lightfoots head in a single summer  where did you leave your old ones and when did they come off  he asked and there was doubt in the very tone of his voice  they dropped off last spring but i dont remember just where replied lightfoot  i was too glad to be rid of them to notice where they dropped  you see they were loose and uncomfortable and i hadnt any more use for them because i knew that my new ones would be bigger and better  ive got one more point on each than i had last year  lightfoot began once more to rub his antlers against the tree to get off the queer rags hanging to them and to polish the points  peter watched in silence for a few minutes  then all his suspicions returning he said  but you havent told me anything about those rags hanging to your antlers  and you havent believed what i have already told you retorted lightfoot  i dont like telling things to people who wont believe me     chapter iii lightfoot tells how his antlers grew   it is hard to believe what seems impossible  and yet what seems impossible to you may be a very commonplace matter to some one else  so it does not do to say that a thing cannot be possible just because you cannot understand how it can be  peter rabbit wanted to believe what lightfoot the deer had just told him but somehow he couldnt  if he had seen those antlers growing it would have been another matter  but he hadnt seen lightfoot since the very last of winter and then lightfoot had worn just such handsome antlers as he now had  so peter really couldnt be blamed for not being able to believe that those old ones had been lost and in their place new ones had grown in just the few months of spring and summer  but peter didnt blame lightfoot in the least because he had told peter that he didnt like to tell things to people who wouldnt believe what he told them when peter had asked him about the rags hanging to his antlers im trying to believe it he said quite humbly  its all true broke in another voice  peter jumped and turned to find his big cousin jumper the hare  unseen and unheard he had stolen up and had overheard what peter and lightfoot had said  how do you know it is true snapped peter a little crossly for jumper had startled him  because i saw lightfoots old antlers after they had fallen off and i often saw lightfoot while his new ones were growing retorted jumper  all right  ill believe anything that lightfoot tells me if you say it is true declared peter who greatly admires his cousin jumper  now tell me about those rags lightfoot  please do  lightfoot couldnt resist that please  those rags are what is left of a kind of covering which protected the antlers while they were growing as i told you before said he  very soon after my old ones dropped off the new ones began to grow  they were not hard not at all like they are now  they were soft and very tender and the blood ran through them just as it does through our bodies  they were covered with a sort of skin with hairs on it like thin fur  the ends were not sharply pointed they now are but were big and rounded like knobs  they were not like antlers at all and they made my head hot and were very uncomfortable  that is why i hid away  they grew very fast so fast that every day i could see by looking at my reflection in water that they were a little longer  it seemed to me sometimes as if all my strength went into those new antlers and i had to be very careful not to hit them against anything  in the first place it would have hurt and in the second place it might have spoiled the shape of them  when they had grown to the length you now see they began to shrink and grow hard  the knobs on the ends shrank until they became pointed  as soon as they stopped growing the blood stopped flowing up in them and as they became hard they were no longer tender  the skin which had covered them grew dry and split and i rubbed it off on trees and bushes  the little rags you see are what is left but i will soon be rid of those  then i shall be ready to fight if need be and will fear no one save man and will fear him only when he has a terrible gun with him  lightfoot tossed his head proudly and rattled his wonderful antlers against the nearest tree  isnt he handsome whispered peter to jumper the hare and did you ever hear of anything so wonderful as the growing of those new antlers in such a short time  it is hard to believe but i suppose it must be true  it is replied jumper and i tell you peter i would hate to have lightfoot try those antlers on me even though i were big as a man  youve always thought of lightfoot as timid and afraid but you should see him when he is angry  few people care to face him then     chapter iv the spirit of fear     when the days grow cold and the nights are clear    there stalks abroad the spirit of fear        lightfoot the deer   it is sad but true  autumn is often called the sad time of the year and it is the sad time  but it shouldnt be  old mother nature never intended that it should be  she meant it to be the glad time  it is the time when all the little people of the green forest and the green meadows have got over the cares and worries of bringing up families and teaching their children how to look out for themselves  it is the season when food is plentiful and every one is fat and is or ought to be care free  it is the season when old mother nature intended all her little people to be happy to have nothing to worry them for the little time before the coming of cold weather and the hard times which cold weather always brings  but instead of this a grim dark figure goes stalking over the green meadows and through the green forest and it is called the spirit of fear  it peers into every hidingplace and wherever it finds one of the little people it sends little cold chills over him little chills which jolly round bright mr sun cannot chase away though he shine his brightest  all night as well as all day the spirit of fear searches out the little people of the green meadows and the green forest  it will not let them sleep it will not let them eat in peace  it drives them to seek new hidingplaces and then drives them out of those  it keeps them ever ready to fly or run at the slightest sound  peter rabbit was thinking of this as he sat at the edge of the dear old briarpatch looking over to the green forest  the green forest was no longer just green it was of many colors for old mother nature had set jack frost to painting the leaves of the mapletrees and the beechtrees and the birchtrees and the poplartrees and the chestnuttrees and he had done his work well very very lovely were the reds and yellows and browns against the dark green of the pines and the spruces and the hemlocks the purple hills were more softly purple than at any other season of the year  it was all very very beautiful  but peter had no thought for the beauty of it all for the spirit of fear had visited even the dear old briarpatch and peter was afraid  it wasnt fear of reddy fox or redtail the hawk or hooty the owl or old man coyote  they were forever trying to catch him but they did not strike terror to his heart because he felt quite smart enough to keep out of their clutches  to be sure they gave him sudden frights sometimes when they happened to surprise him but these frights lasted only until he reached the nearest brambletangle or hollow log where they could not get at him  but the fear that chilled his heart now never left him even for a moment  and peter knew that this same fear was clutching at the hearts of bob white hiding in the brown stubble of mrs grouse squatting in the thickest brambletangle in the green forest of uncle billy possum and bobby coon in their hollow trees of jerry muskrat in the smiling pool of happy jack squirrel hiding in the tree tops of lightfoot the deer lying in the closest thicket he could find  it was even clutching at the hearts of granny and reddy fox and of great big buster bear  it seemed to peter that no one was so big or so small that this terrible spirit of fear had not searched him out  far in the distance sounded a sudden bang  peter jumped and shivered  he knew that every one else who had heard that bang had jumped and shivered just as he had  it was the season of hunters with terrible guns  it was man who had sent this terrible spirit of fear to chill the hearts of the little meadow and forest people at this very time when old mother nature had made all things so beautiful and had intended that they should be happiest and most free from care and worry  it was man who had made the autumn a sad time instead of a glad time the very saddest time of all the year when old mother nature had done her best to make it the most beautiful  i dont understand these men creatures said peter to little mrs peter as they stared fearfully out from the dear old briarpatch  they seem to find pleasure actually find pleasure in trying to kill us  i dont understand them at all  they havent any hearts  that must be the reason they havent any hearts     chapter v sammy jay brings lightfoot word   sammy jay is one of those who believe in the wisdom of the old saying early to bed and early to rise  sammy needs no alarm clock to get up early in the morning  he is awake as soon as it is light enough to see and wastes no time wishing he could sleep a little longer  his stomach wouldnt let him if he wanted to  sammy always wakes up hungry  in this he is no different from all his feathered neighbors  so the minute sammy gets his eyes open he makes his toilet for sammy is very neat and starts out to hunt for his breakfast long ago sammy discovered that there is no safer time of day to visit the dooryards of those twolegged creatures called men than very early in the morning  on this particular morning he had planned to fly over to farmer browns dooryard but at the last minute he changed his mind  instead he flew over to the dooryard of another farm  it was so very early in the morning that sammy didnt expect to find anybody stirring so you can guess how surprised he was when just as he came in sight of that dooryard he saw the door of the house open and a man step out  sammy stopped on the top of the nearest tree  now what is that man doing up as early as this muttered sammy  then he caught sight of something under the mans arm  he didnt have to look twice to know what it was  it was a gun  yes sir it was a gun a terrible gun  ha exclaimed sammy and quite forgot that his stomach was empty  now who can that fellow be after so early in the morning i wonder if he is going to the dear old briarpatch to look for peter rabbit or if he is going to the old pasture in search of reddy fox or if it is mr and mrs grouse he hopes to kill i think ill sit right here and watch  so sammy sat in the top of the tree and watched the hunter with the terrible gun  he saw him head straight for the green forest its mr and mrs grouse after all i guess thought sammy if i knew just where they were id go over and warn them but sammy didnt know just where they were and he knew that it might take him a long time to find them so he once more began to think of breakfast and then right then another thought popped into his head  he thought of lightfoot the deer  sammy watched the hunter enter the green forest then he silently followed him  from the way the hunter moved sammy decided that he wasnt thinking of mr and mrs grouse  its lightfoot the deer sure as i live muttered sammy  he ought to be warned he certainly ought to be warned  i know right where he is i believe ill warn him myself  sammy found lightfoot right where he had expected to  hes coming  cried sammy a hunter with a terrible gun is coming     chapter vi a game of hide and seek   there was a game of hide and seek that danny meadow mouse once played with buster bear  it was a very dreadful game for danny but hard as it was for danny it didnt begin to be as hard as the game lightfoot the deer was playing with the hunter in the green forest  in the case of buster bear and danny the latter had simply to keep out of reach of buster  as long as buster didnt get his great paws on danny the latter was safe  then too danny is a very small person  he is so small that he can hide under two or three leaves  wherever he is he is pretty sure to find a hidingplace of some sort  his small size gives him advantages in a game of hide and seek  it certainly does  but lightfoot the deer is big  he is one of the largest of the people who live in the green forest  being so big it is not easy to hide  moreover a hunter with a terrible gun does not have to get close in order to kill  lightfoot knew all this as he waited for the coming of the hunter of whom sammy jay had warned him  he had learned many lessons in the hunting season of the year before and he remembered every one of them  he knew that to forget even one of them might cost him his life  so standing motionless behind a tangle of fallen trees lightfoot listened and watched  presently over in the distance he heard sammy jay screaming thief thief thief  a little sigh of relief escaped lightfoot  he knew that that screaming of sammy jays was a warning to tell him where the hunter was  knowing just where the hunter was made it easier for lightfoot to know what to do  a merry little breeze came stealing through the green forest it came from behind lightfoot and danced on towards the hunter with the terrible gun  instantly lightfoot began to steal softly away through the green forest  he took the greatest care to make no sound  he went in a halfcircle stopping every few steps to listen and test the air with his wonderful nose  can you guess what lightfoot was trying to do  he was trying to get behind the hunter so that the merry little breezes would bring to him the dreaded manscent  so long as lightfoot could get that scent he would know where the hunter was though he could neither see nor hear him  if he had remained where sammy jay had found him the hunter might have come within shooting distance before lightfoot could have located him  so the hunter with the terrible gun walked noiselessly through the green forest stepping with the greatest care to avoid snapping a stick underfoot searching with keen eye every thicket and likely hidingplace for a glimpse of lightfoot and studying the ground for traces to show that lightfoot had been there     chapter vii the merry little breezes help lightfoot   could you have seen the hunter with the terrible gun and lightfoot the deer that morning on which the hunting season opened you might have thought that lightfoot was hunting the hunter instead of the hunter hunting lightfoot  you see lightfoot was behind the hunter instead of in front of him he was following the hunter so as to keep track of him as long as he knew just where the hunter was he felt reasonably safe  the merry little breezes are lightfoots best friends  they always bring to him all the different scents they find as they wander through the green forest  and lightfoots delicate nose is so wonderful that he can take these scents even though they be very faint and tell just who or what has made them  so though he makes the best possible use of his big ears and his beautiful eyes he trusts more to his nose to warn him of danger for this reason during the hunting season when he moves about he moves in the direction from which the merry little breezes may be blowing  he knows that they will bring to him warning of any danger which may lie in that direction  now the hunter with the terrible gun who was looking for lightfoot knew all this for he was wise in the ways of lightfoot and of the other little people of the green forest  when he had entered the green forest that morning he had first of all made sure of the direction from which the merry little breezes were coming  then he had begun to hunt in that direction knowing that thus his scent would be carried behind him  it is more than likely that he would have reached the hidingplace of lightfoot the deer before the latter would have known that he was in the green forest had it not been for sammy jays warning  when he reached the tangle of fallen trees behind which lightfoot had been hiding he worked around it slowly and with the greatest care holding his terrible gun ready to use instantly should lightfoot leap out  presently he found lightfoots footprints in the soft ground and studying them he knew that lightfoot had known of his coming  it was that confounded jay muttered the hunter  lightfoot heard him and knew what it meant  i know what he has done he has circled round so as to get behind me and get my scent  it is a clever trick a very clever trick but two can play at that game  ill just try that little trick myself  so the hunter in his turn made a wide circle back and presently there was none of the dreaded mansmell among the scents which the merry little breezes brought to lightfoot  lightfoot had lost track of the hunter     chapter viii wit against wit   it was a dreadful game the hunter with the terrible gun and lightfoot the deer were playing in the green forest  it was a matching of wit against wit the hunter seeking to take lightfoots life and lightfoot seeking to save it the experience of other years had taught lightfoot much of the ways of hunters and not one of the things he had learned about them was forgotten  but the hunter in his turn knew much of the ways of deer  so it was that each was trying his best to outguess the other  when the hunter found the hidingplace lightfoot had left at the warning of sammy jay he followed lightfoots tracks for a short distance  it was slow work and only one whose eyes had been trained to notice little things could have done it  you see there was no snow and only now and then when he had stepped on a bit of soft ground had lightfoot left a footprint  but there were other signs which the hunter knew how to reada freshly upturned leaf here and here a bit of moss lightly crushed these things told the hunter which way lightfoot had gone  slowly patiently watchfully the hunter followed  after a while he stopped with a satisfied grin  i thought as much he muttered  he heard that pesky jay and circled around so as to get my scent  ill just cut across to my old trail and unless i am greatly mistaken ill find his tracks there  so swiftly but silently the hunter cut across to his old trail and in a few moments he found just what he expectedone of lightfoots footprints  once more he grinned  well old fellow ive outguessed you this time said he to himself  i am behind you and the wind is from you to me so that you cannot get my scent  i wouldnt be a bit surprised if youre back right where you started from behind that old windfall he at once began to move forward silently and cautiously with eyes and ears alert and his terrible gun ready for instant use  now when lightfoot following behind the hunter had lost the scent of the latter he guessed right away that the latter had found his tracks and had started to follow them  lightfoot stood still and listened with all his might for some little sound to tell him where the hunter was  but there was no sound and after a little lightfoot began to move on  he didnt dare remain still lest the hunter should creep up within shooting distance  there was only one direction in which it was safe for lightfoot to move and that was the direction from which the merry little breezes were blowing so long as they brought him none of the dreaded mansmell he knew that he was safe  the hunter might be behind himprobably he wasbut ahead of him so long as the merry little breezes were blowing in his face and brought no mansmell was safety     chapter ix lightfoot becomes uncertain   lightfoot the deer traveled on through the green forest straight ahead in the direction from which the merry little breezes were blowing  every few steps he would raise his delicate nose and test all the scents that the merry little breezes were bringing so long as he kept the merry little breezes blowing in his face he could be sure whether or not there was danger ahead of him  lightfoot uses his nose very much as you and i use our eyes  it tells him the things he wants to know  he knew that reddy fox had been along ahead of him although he didnt get so much as a glimpse of reddys red coat  once he caught just the faintest of scents which caused him to stop abruptly and test the air more carefully than ever  it was the scent of buster bear  but it was so very faint that lightfoot knew buster was not near so he went ahead again but even more carefully than before  after a little he couldnt smell buster at all so he knew then that buster had merely passed that way when he was going to some other part of the green forest  lightfoot knew that he had nothing to fear in that direction so long as the merry little breezes brought him none of the dreaded manscent and he knew that he could trust the merry little breezes to bring him that scent if there should be a man anywhere in front of him  you know the merry little breezes are lightfoots best friends  but lightfoot didnt want to keep going in that direction all day  it would take him far away from that part of the green forest with which he was familiar and which he called home  it might in time take him out of the green forest and that wouldnt do at all  so after a while lightfoot became uncertain  he didnt know just what to do  you see he couldnt tell whether or not that hunter with the terrible gun was still following him  every once in a while he would stop in a thicket of young trees or behind a tangle of fallen trees uprooted by the wind  there he would stand facing the direction from which he had come and watch and listen for some sign that the hunter was still following  but after a few minutes of this he would grow uneasy and then bound away in the direction from which the merry little breezes were blowing so as to be sure of not running into danger  if only i could know if that hunter is still following i would know better what to do thought lightfoot  ive got to find out     chapter x lightfoots clever trick   lightfoot the deer is smart  yes sir lightfoot the deer is smart  he has to be especially in the hunting season to save his life  if he were not smart he would have been killed long ago  he never makes the foolish mistake of thinking that other people are not smart  he knew that the hunter who had started out to follow him early that morning was not one to be easily discouraged or to be fooled by simple tricks  he had a very great respect for the smartness of that hunter  he knew that he couldnt afford to be careless for one little minute  the certainty of danger is sometimes easier to bear than the uncertainty of not knowing whether or not there really is any danger  lightfoot felt that if he could know just where the hunter was he himself would know better what to do  the hunter might have become discouraged and given up following him in that case he could rest and stop worrying  it would be better to know that he was being followed than not to know  but how was he to find out  lightfoot kept turning this over and over in his mind as he traveled through the green forest  then an idea came to him  i know what ill do  i know just what ill do said lightfoot to himself  ill find out whether or not that hunter is still following me and ill get a little rest  goodness knows i need a rest  lightfoot bounded away swiftly and ran for some distance then he turned and quickly but very very quietly returned in the direction from which he had just come but a little to one side of his old trail  after a while he saw what he was looking for a pile of branches which woodchoppers had left when they had trimmed the trees they had cut down  this was near the top of a little hill  lightfoot went up the hill and stopped behind the pile of brush  for a few moments he stood there perfectly still looking and listening  then with a little sigh of relief he lay down where without being in any danger of being seen himself he could watch his old trail through the hollow at the bottom of the hill  if the hunter were still following him he would pass through that hollow in plain sight  for a long tune lightfoot rested comfortably behind the pile of brush  there was not a suspicious movement or a suspicious sound to show that danger was abroad in the green forest  he saw mr and mrs grouse fly down across the hollow and disappear among the trees on the other side  he saw unc billy possum looking over a hollow tree and guessed that unc billy was getting ready to go into winter quarters  he saw jumper the hare squat down under a lowhanging branch of a hemlocktree and prepare to take a nap  he heard drummer the woodpecker at work drilling after worms in a tree not far away  little by little lightfoot grew easy in his mind  it must be that that hunter had become discouraged and was no longer following him     chapter xi the hunted watches the hunter   it was so quiet and peaceful and altogether lovely there in the green forest where lightfoot the deer lay resting behind a pile of brush near the top of a little hill that it didnt seem possible such a thing as sudden death could be anywhere near it didnt seem possible that there could be any need for watchfulness  but lightfoot long ago had learned that often danger is nearest when it seems least to be expected  so though he would have liked very much to have taken a nap lightfoot was too wise to do anything so foolish  he kept his beautiful great soft eyes fixed in the direction from which the hunter with the terrible gun would come if he were still following that trail  he kept his great ears gently moving to catch every little sound  lightfoot had about decided that the hunter had given up hunting for that day but he didnt let this keep him from being any the less watchful  it was better to be overwatchful than the least bit careless  by and by lightfoots keen ears caught the sound of the snapping of a little stick in the distance  it was so faint a sound that you or i would have missed it altogether but lightfoot heard it and instantly he was doubly alert watching in the direction from which that faint sound had come after what seemed a long long time he saw something moving and a moment later a man came into view  it was the hunter and across one arm he carried the terrible gun  lightfoot knew now that this hunter had patience and perseverance and had not yet given up hope of getting near enough to shoot lightfoot  he moved forward slowly setting each foot down with the greatest care so as not to snap a stick or rustle the leaves  he was watching sharply ahead ready to shoot should he catch a glimpse of lightfoot within range  right along through the hollow at the foot of the little hill below lightfoot the hunter passed  he was no longer studying the ground for lightfoots tracks because the ground was so hard and dry down there that lightfoot had left no tracks  he was simply hunting in the direction from which the merry little breezes were blowing because he knew that lightfoot had gone in that direction and he also knew that if lightfoot were still ahead of him his scent could not be carried to lightfoot  he was doing what is called hunting upwind  lightfoot kept perfectly still and watched the hunter disappear among the trees  then he silently got to his feet shook himself lightly and noiselessly stole away over the hilltop towards another part of the green forest  he felt sure that that hunter would not find him again that day     chapter xii lightfoot visits paddy the beaver   deep in the green forest is the pond where lives paddy the beaver  it is paddys own pond for he made it himself  he made it by building a dam across the laughing brook  when lightfoot bounded away through the green forest after watching the hunter pass through the hollow below him he remembered paddys pond thats where ill go thought lightfoot  it is such a lonesome part of the green forest that i do not believe that hunter will come there  ill just run over and make paddy a friendly call  so lightfoot bounded along deeper and deeper into the green forest  presently through the trees he caught the gleam of water it was paddys pond  lightfoot approached it cautiously he felt sure he was rid of the hunter who had followed him so far that day but he knew that there might be other hunters in the green forest  he knew that he couldnt afford to be careless for even one little minute  lightfoot had lived long enough to know that most of the sad things and dreadful things that happen in the green forest and on the green meadows are due to carelessness no one who is hunted be he big or little can afford ever to be careless  now lightfoot had known of hunters hiding near water hoping to shoot him when he came to drink  that always seemed to lightfoot a dreadful thing an unfair thing  but hunters had done it before and they might do it again  so lightfoot was careful to approach paddys pond upwind  that is he approached the side of the pond from which the merry little breezes were blowing toward him and all the time he kept his nose working  he knew that if any hunters were hidden there the merry little breezes would bring him their scent and thus warn him  he had almost reached the edge of paddys pond when from the farther shore there came a sudden crash  it startled lightfoot terribly for just an instant  then he guessed what it meant that crash was the falling of a tree there wasnt enough wind to blow over even the most shaky dead tree  there had been no sound of axes so he knew it could not have been chopped down by men it must be that paddy the beaver had cut it and if paddy had been working in daylight it was certain that no one had been around that pond for a long time  so lightfoot hurried forward eagerly cautiously when he reached the bank he looked across towards where the sound of that falling tree had come from a branch of a tree was moving along in the water and half hidden by it was a brown head it was paddy the beaver taking the branch to his food pile     chapter xiii lightfoot and paddy become partners   the instant lightfoot saw paddy the beaver he knew that for the time being at least there was no danger  he knew that paddy is one of the shyest of all the little people of the green forest and that when he is found working in the daytime it means that he has been undisturbed for a long time otherwise he would work only at night  paddy saw lightfoot almost as soon as he stepped out on the bank  he kept right on swimming with the branch of a poplartree until he reached his food pile which you know is in the water  there he forced the branch down until it was held by other branches already sunken in the pond  this done he swam over to where lightfoot was watching  hello lightfoot he exclaimed you are looking handsomer than ever how are you feeling these fine autumn days  anxious replied lightfoot  i am feeling terribly anxious do you know what day this is  no replied paddy i dont know what day it is and i dont particularly care  it is enough for me that it is one of the finest days weve had for a long time  i wish i could feel that way said lightfoot wistfully  i wish i could feel that way paddy but i cant  no sir i cant you see this is the first of the most dreadful days in all the year for me  the hunters started looking for me before mr sun was really out of bed  at least one hunter did and i dont doubt there are others  i fooled that one but from now to the end of the hunting season there will not be a single moment of daylight when i will feel absolutely safe  paddy crept out on the bank and chewed a little twig of poplar thoughtfully  paddy says he can always think better if he is chewing something  thats bad news lightfoot  im sorry to hear it  i certainly am sorry to hear it said paddy  why anybody wants to hunt such a handsome fellow as you are i cannot understand  my but thats a beautiful set of antlers you have  they are the best ive ever had but do you know paddy i suspect that they may be one of the reasons i am hunted so replied lightfoot a little sadly  good looks are not always to be desired  have you seen any hunters around here lately  paddy shook his lead  not a single hunter he replied  i tell you what it is lightfoot lets be partners for a while you stay right around my pond  if i see or hear or smell anything suspicious ill warn you  you do the same for me  two sets of eyes ears and noses are better than one  what do you say lightfoot  ill do it replied lightfoot     chapter xiv how paddy warned lightfoot   it was a queer partnership that partnership between lightfoot and paddy but it was a good partnership  they had been the best of friends for a long time  paddy had always been glad to have lightfoot visit his pond  to tell the truth he was rather fond of handsome lightfoot  you know paddy is himself not at all handsome  on land he is a rather clumsylooking fellow and really homely  so he admired lightfoot greatly  that is one reason why he proposed that they be partners  lightfoot himself thought the idea a splendid one  he spent that night browsing not far from paddys pond  with the coming of daylight he lay down in a thicket of young hemlocktrees near the upper end of the pond  it was a quiet peaceful day  it was so quiet and peaceful and beautiful it was hard to believe that hunters with terrible guns were searching the green forest for beautiful lightfoot  but they were and lightfoot knew that sooner or later one of them would be sure to visit paddys pond so though he rested and took short naps all through that beautiful day he was anxious  he couldnt help but be  the next morning found lightfoot back in the same place  but this morning he took no naps  he rested but all the time he was watchful and alert  a feeling of uneasiness possessed him he felt in his bones that danger in the shape of a hunter with a terrible gun was not far distant  but the hours slipped away and little by little he grew less uneasy he began to hope that that day would prove as peaceful as the previous day had been  then suddenly there was a sharp report from the farther end of paddys pond  it was almost like a pistol shot however it wasnt a pistol shot  it wasnt a shot at all it was the slap of paddys broad tail on the surface of the water instantly lightfoot was on his feet  he knew just what that meant he knew that paddy had seen or heard or smelled a hunter  it was even so  paddy had heard a dry stick snap  it was a very tiny snap but it was enough to warn paddy  with only his head above water he had watched in the direction from which that sound had come  presently stealing quietly along towards the pond a hunter had come in view  instantly paddy had brought his broad tail down on the water with all his force  he knew that lightfoot would know that that meant danger  then paddy had dived and swimming under water had sought the safety of his house he had done his part and there was nothing more he could do     chapter xv the three watchers   when paddy the beaver slapped the water with his broad tail making a noise like a pistol shot lightfoot understood that this was meant as a warning of danger  he was on his feet instantly with eyes ears and nose seeking the cause of paddys warning after a moment or two he stole softly up to the top of a little ridge some distance back from paddys pond but from the top of which he could see the whole of the pond  there he hid among some closegrowing young hemlocktrees  it wasnt long before he saw a hunter with a terrible gun come down to the shore of the pond  now the hunter had heard paddy slap the water with his broad tail  of course  there would have been something very wrong with his ears had he failed to hear it  confound that beaver muttered the hunter crossly  if there was a deer anywhere around this pond he probably is on his way now ill have a look around and see if there are any signs  so the hunter went on to the edge of paddys pond and then began to walk around it studying the ground as he walked  presently he found the footprints of lightfoot in the mud where lightfoot had gone down to the pond to drink  i thought as much muttered the hunter  those tracks were made last night  that deer probably was lying down somewhere near here and i might have had a shot but for that pesky beaver ill just look the land over and then i think ill wait here awhile  if that deer isnt too badly scared he may come back  so the hunter went quite around the pond looking into all likely hidingplaces  he found where lightfoot had been lying and he knew that in all probability lightfoot had been there when paddy gave the danger signal  its of no use for me to try to follow him thought the hunter  it is too dry for me to track him he may not be so badly scared after all  ill just find a good place and wait  so the hunter found an old log behind some small trees and there sat down  he could see all around paddys pond  he sat perfectly still  he was a clever hunter and he knew that so long as he did not move he was not likely to be noticed by any sharp eyes that might come that way  what he didnt know was that lightfoot had been watching him all the time and was even then standing where he could see him  and another thing he didnt know was that paddy the beaver had come out of his house and swimming under water had reached a hidingplace on the opposite shore from which he too had seen the hunter sit down on the log so the hunter watched for lightfoot and lightfoot and paddy watched the hunter     chapter xvi visitors to paddys pond   that hunter was a man of patience  also he was a man who understood the little people of the green forest and the green meadows  he knew that if he would not be seen he must not move so he didnt move  he kept as motionless as if he were a part of the very log on which he was sitting  for some time there was no sign of any living thing  then from over the tree tops in the direction of the big river came the whistle of swift wings and mr and mrs quack alighted with a splash in the pond  for a few moments they sat on the water a picture of watchful suspicion  they were looking and listening to make sure that no danger was near  satisfied at last they began to clean their feathers  it was plain that they felt safe paddy the beaver was tempted to warn them that they were not as safe as they thought but as long as the hunter did not move paddy decided to wait  now the hunter was sorely tempted to shoot these ducks but he knew that if he did he would have no chance that day to get lightfoot the deer and it was lightfoot he wanted  so mr and mrs quack swam about within easy range of that terrible gun without once suspecting that danger was anywhere near  by and by the hunters keen eyes caught a movement at one end of paddys dam  an instant later bobby coon appeared  it was clear that bobby was quite unsuspicious  he carried something but just what the hunter could not make out  he took it down to the edge of the water and there carefully washed it  then he climbed up on paddys dam and began to eat  you know bobby coon is very particular about his food  whenever there is water near bobby washes his food before eating  once more the hunter was tempted but did not yield to the temptation which was a very good thing for bobby coon  all this lightfoot saw as he stood among the little hemlocktrees at the top of the ridge behind the hunter  he saw and he understood  it is because he wants to kill me that he doesnt shoot at mr and mrs quack or bobby coon thought lightfoot a little bitterly  what have i ever done that he should be so anxious to kill me  still the hunter sat without moving  mr and mrs quack contentedly hunted for food in the mud at the bottom of paddys pond  bobby coon finished his meal crossed the dam and disappeared in the green forest  he had gone off to take a nap somewhere  time slipped away  the hunter continued to watch patiently for lightfoot and lightfoot and paddy the beaver watched the hunter  finally another visitor appeared at the upper end of the ponda visitor in a wonderful coat of red it was reddy fox     chapter xvii sammy jay arrives   when reddy fox arrived at the pond of paddy the beaver the hunter who was hiding there saw him instantly  so did lightfoot but no one else did  he approached in that cautious careful way that he always uses when he is hunting  the instant he reached a place where he could see all over paddys pond he stopped as suddenly as if he had been turned to stone  he stopped with one foot lifted in the act of taking a step  he had seen mr and mrs quack  now you know there is nothing reddy fox likes better for a dinner than a duck  the instant he saw mr and mrs quack a gleam of longing crept into his eyes and his mouth began to water he stood motionless until both mr and mrs quack had their heads under water as they searched for food in the mud in the bottom of the pond  then like a red flash he bounded out of sight behind the dam of paddy the beaver  presently the hunter saw reddys black nose at the end of the dam as reddy peeped around it to watch mr and mrs quack  the latter were slowly moving along in that direction as they fed  reddy was quick to see this  if he remained right where he was and mr and mrs quack kept on feeding in that direction the chances were that he would have a dinner of fat duck  all he need do was to be patient and wait  so with his eyes fixed fast on mr and mrs quack reddy fox crouched behind paddys dam and waited  watching reddy and the ducks the hunter almost forgot lightfoot the deer  mr and mrs quack were getting very near to where reddy was waiting for them  the hunter was tempted to get up and frighten those ducks  he didnt want reddy fox to have them because he hoped some day to get them himself  i suppose thought he i was foolish not to shoot them when i had the chance  they are too far away now and it looks very much as if that red rascal will get one of them  i believe ill spoil that red scamps plans by frightening them away  i dont believe that deer will be back here today anyway so i may as well save those ducks  but the hunter did nothing of the kind  you see just as he was getting ready to step out from his hidingplace sammy jay arrived  he perched in a tree close to the end of paddys dam and at once he spied reddy fox  it didnt take him a second to discover what reddy was hiding there for  thief thief thief screamed sammy and then looked down at reddy with a mischievous look in his sharp eyes  there is nothing sammy jay delights in more than in upsetting the plans of reddy fox  at the sound of sammys voice mr and mrs quack swam hurriedly towards the middle of the pond  they knew exactly what that warning meant  reddy fox looked up at sammy jay and snarled angrily then knowing it was useless to hide longer he bounded away through the green forest to hunt elsewhere     chapter xviii the hunter loses his temper   the hunter hidden near the pond of paddy the beaver chuckled silently  that is to say he laughed without making any sound  the hunter thought the warning of mr and mrs quack by sammy jay was a great joke on reddy  to tell the truth he was very much pleased  as you know he wanted those ducks himself he suspected that they would stay in that little pond for some days and he planned to return there and shoot them after he had got lightfoot the deer  he wanted to get lightfoot first and he knew that to shoot at anything else might spoil his chance of getting a shot at lightfoot  sammy jay did me a good turn thought the hunter although he doesnt know it  reddy fox certainly would have caught one of those ducks had sammy not come along just when he did  it would have been a shame to have had one of them caught by that fox i mean to get one and i hope both of them myself  now when you come to think of it it would have been a far greater shame for the hunter to have killed mr and mrs quack than for reddy fox to have done so  reddy was hunting them because he was hungry  the hunter would have shot them for sport  he didnt need them  he had plenty of other food reddy fox doesnt kill just for the pleasure of killing  so the hunter continued to sit in his hidingplace with very friendly feelings for sammy jay  sammy watched reddy fox disappear and then flew over to that side of the pond where the hunter was  mr and mrs quack called their thanks to sammy to which he replied that he had done no more for them than he would do for anybody or than they would have done for him  for some time sammy sat quietly in the top of the tree but all the time his sharp eyes were very busy  by and by he spied the hunter sitting on the log  at first he couldnt make out just what it was he was looking at  it didnt move but nevertheless sammy was suspicious  presently he flew over to a tree where he could see better  right away he spied the terrible gun and he knew just what that was  once more he began to yell thief thief thief at the top of his lungs  it was then that the hunter lost his temper  he knew that now he had been discovered by sammy jay and it was useless to remain there longer  he was angry clear through     chapter xix sammy jay is modest   as soon as the angry hunter with the terrible gun had disappeared among the trees of the green forest and lightfoot was sure that he had gone for good lightfoot came out from his hidingplace on top of the ridge and walked down to the pond of paddy the beaver for a drink  he knew that it was quite safe to do so for sammy jay had followed the hunter all the time screaming thief thief thief  every one within hearing could tell just where that hunter was by sammys voice  it kept growing fainter and fainter and by that lightfoot knew that the hunter was getting farther and farther away  paddy the beaver swam out from his hidingplace and climbed out on the bank near lightfoot  there was a twinkle in his eyes  that bluecoated mischiefmaker isnt such a bad fellow at heart after all is he said he  lightfoot lifted his beautiful head and set his ears forward to catch the sound of sammys voice in the distance  sammy jay may be a mischiefmaker as some people say said he but you can always count on him to prove a true friend in time of danger  he brought me warning of the coming of the hunter the other morning  you saw him save mr and mrs quack a little while ago and then he actually drove that hunter away  i suppose sammy jay has saved more lives than any one i know of  i wish he would come back here and let me thank him  some time later sammy jay did come back  well said he as he smoothed his feathers i chased that fellow clear to the edge of the green forest so i guess there will be nothing more to fear from him today  im glad to see he hasnt got you yet lightfoot  ive been a bit worried about you  sammy said lightfoot you are one of the best friends i have  i dont know how i can ever thank you for what you have done for me  dont try replied sammy shortly  i havent done anything but what anybody else would have done old mother nature gave me a pair of good eyes and a strong voice  i simply make the best use of them i can  just to see a hunter with a terrible gun makes me angry clear through   id rather spoil his hunting than eat  you want to watch out sammy one of these days a hunter will lose his temper and shoot you just to get even with you warned paddy the beaver  dont worry about me replied sammy  i know just how far those terrible guns can shoot and i dont take any chances by the way lightfoot the green forest is full of hunters looking for you  i ve seen a lot of them and i know they are looking for you because they do not shoot at anybody else even when they have a chance     chapter xx lightfoot hears a dreadful sound   day after day lightfoot the deer played hide and seek for his life with the hunters who were seeking to kill him  he saw them many times though not one of them saw him  more than once a hunter passed close to lightfoots hidingplace without once suspecting it  but poor lightfoot was feeling the strain  he was growing thin and he was so nervous that the falling of a dead leaf from a tree would startle him  there is nothing quite so terrible as being continually hunted  it was getting so that lightfoot half expected a hunter to step out from behind every tree  only when the black shadows wrapped the green forest in darkness did he know a moment of peace  and those hours of safety were filled with dread of what the next day might bring  early one morning a terrible sound rang through the green forest and brought lightfoot to his feet with a startled jump  it was the baying of hounds following a trail  at first it did not sound so terrible  lightfoot had often heard it before  many times he had listened to the baying of bowser the hound as he followed reddy fox  it had not sounded so terrible then because it meant no danger to lightfoot  at first as he listened early that morning he took it for granted that those hounds were after reddy and so though startled he was not worried  but suddenly a dreadful suspicion came to him and he grew more and more anxious as he listened in a few minutes there was no longer any doubt in his mind those hounds were following his trail  it was then that the sound of that baying became terrible  he must run for his life those hounds would give him no rest  and he knew that in running from them he would no longer be able to watch so closely for the hunters with terrible guns  he would no longer be able to hide in thickets  at any time he might be driven right past one of those hunters  lightfoot bounded away with such leaps as only lightfoot can make in a little while the voices of the hounds grew fainter lightfoot stopped to get his breath and stood trembling as he listened  the baying of the hounds again grew louder and louder  those wonderful noses of theirs were following his trail without the least difficulty  in a panic of fear lightfoot bounded away again  as he crossed an old road the green forest rang with the roar of a terrible gun  something tore a strip of bark from the trunk of a tree just above lightfoots back  it was a bullet and it had just missed lightfoot  it added to his terror and this in turn added to his speed  so lightfoot ran and ran and behind him the voices of the hounds continued to ring through the green forest     chapter xxi how lightfoot got rid of the hounds   poor lightfoot it seemed to him that there were no such things as justice and fair play  had it been just one hunter at a time against whom he had to match his wits it would not have been so bad  but there were many hunters with terrible guns looking for him and in dodging one he was likely at any time to meet another  this in itself seemed terribly unfair and unjust but now added to this was the greater unfairness of being trailed by hounds  do you wonder that lightfoot thought of men as utterly heartless you see he could not know that those hounds had not been put on his trail but had left home to hunt for their own pleasure he could not know that it was against the law to hunt him with dogs but though none of those hunters looking for him were guilty of having put the hounds on his trail each one of them was willing and eager to take advantage of the fact that the hounds were on his trail already he had been shot at once and he knew that he would be shot at again if he should be driven where a hunter was hidden  the ground was damp and scent always lies best on damp ground this made it easy for the hounds to follow him with their wonderful noses lightfoot tried every trick he could think of to make those hounds lose the scent  if only i could make them lose it long enough for me to get a little rest it would help panted lightfoot as he paused for just an instant to listen to the baying of the hounds  but he couldnt  they allowed him no rest he was becoming very very tired  he could no longer bound lightly over fallen logs or brush as he had done at first  his lungs ached as he panted for breath  he realized that even though he should escape the hunters he would meet an even more terrible death unless he could get rid of those hounds  there would come a time when he would have to stop then those hounds would catch up with him and tear him to pieces  it was then that he remembered the big river  he turned towards it it was his only chance and he knew it  straight through the green forest out across the green meadows to the bank of the big river lightfoot ran  for just a second he paused to look behind the hounds were almost at his heels lightfoot hesitated no longer but plunged into the big river and began to swim on the banks the hounds stopped and bayed their disappointment for they did not dare follow lightfoot out into the big river     chapter xxii lightfoots long swim   the big river was very wide  it would have been a long swim for lightfoot had he been fresh and at his best  strange as it may seem lightfoot is a splendid swimmer despite his small delicate feet  he enjoys swimming  but now lightfoot was terribly tired from his long run ahead of the hounds  for a time he swam rapidly but those weary muscles grew still more weary and by the time he reached the middle of the big river it seemed to him that he was not getting ahead at all at first he had tried to swim towards a clump of trees he could see on the opposite bank above the point where he had entered the water but to do this he had to swim against the current and he soon found that he hadnt the strength to do this then he turned and headed for a point down the big river this made the swimming easier for the current helped him instead of hindering him  even then he could feel his strength leaving him  had he escaped those hounds and the terrible hunters only to be drowned in the big river  this new fear gave him more strength for a little while but it did not last long  he was three fourths of the way across the big river but still that other shore seemed a long distance away  little by little hope died in the heart of lightfoot the deer  he would keep on just as long as he could and thenwell it was better to drown than to be torn to pieces by dogs  just as lightfoot felt that he could not take another stroke and that the end was at hand one foot touched something  then all four feet touched  a second later he had found solid footing and was standing with the water only up to his knees  he had found a little sand bar out in the big river  with a little gasp of returning hope lightfoot waded along until the water began to grow deeper again  he had hoped that he would be able to wade ashore but he saw now that he would have to swim again  so for a long time he remained right where he was  he was so tired that he trembled all over and he was as frightened as he was tired  he knew that standing out there in the water he could be seen for a long distance and that made him nervous and fearful  supposing a hunter on the shore he was trying to reach should see him  then he would have no chance at all for the hunter would simply wait for him and shoot him as he came out of the water  but rest he must and so he stood for a long time on the little sand bar in the big river  and little by little he felt his strength returning     chapter xxiii lightfoot finds a friend   as lightfoot rested trying to recover his breath out there on the little sand bar in the big river his great soft beautiful eyes watched first one bank and then the other  on the bank he had left he could see two blackandwhite specks moving about and across the water came the barking of dogs  those two specks were the hounds who had driven him into the big river  they were barking now instead of baying  presently a brown form joined the blackandwhite specks  it was a hunter drawn there by the barking of the dogs  he was too far away to be dangerous but the mere sight of him filled lightfoot with terror again  he watched the hunter walk along the bank and disappear in the bushes  presently out of the bushes came a boat and in it was the hunter  he headed straight towards lightfoot and then lightfoot knew that his brief rest was at an end  he must once more swim or be shot by the hunter in the boat  so lightfoot again struck out for the shore  his rest had given him new strength but still he was very very tired and swimming was hard work  slowly oh so slowly he drew nearer to the bank  what new dangers might be waiting there he did not know  he had never been on that side of the big river  he knew nothing of the country on that side  but the uncertainty was better than the certainty behind him  he could hear the sound of the oars as the hunter in the boat did his best to get to him before he should reach the shore  on lightfoot struggled at last he felt bottom beneath his feet  he staggered up through some bushes along the bank and then for an instant it seemed to him his heart stopped beating  right in front of him stood a man  he had come out into the back yard of the home of that man  it is doubtful which was the more surprised lightfoot or the man  right then and there lightfoot gave up in despair  he couldnt run  it was all he could do to walk  the long chase by the hounds on the other side of the big river and the long swim across the big river had taken all his strength  not a spark of hope remained to lightfoot  he simply stood still and trembled partly with fear and partly with weariness  then a surprising thing happened  the man spoke softly  he advanced not threateningly but slowly and in a friendly way  he walked around back of lightfoot and then straight towards him  lightfoot walked on a few steps and the man followed still talking softly little by little he urged lightfoot on driving him towards an open shed in which was a pile of hay without understanding just how lightfoot knew that he had found a friend  so he entered the open shed and with a long sigh lay down in the soft hay     chapter xxiv the hunter is disappointed   how he knew he was safe lightfoot the deer couldnt have told you he just knew it that was all  he couldnt understand a word said by the man in whose yard he found himself when he climbed the bank after his long swim across the big river  but he didnt have to understand words to know that he had found a friend so he allowed the man to drive him gently over to an open shed where there was a pile of soft hay and there he lay down so tired that it seemed to him he couldnt move another step  it was only a few minutes later that the hunter who had followed lightfoot across the river reached the bank and scrambled out of his boat  lightfoots friend was waiting just at the top of the bank  of course the hunter saw him at once  hello friend cried the hunter  did you see a deer pass this way a few minutes ago  he swam across the river and if i know anything about it hes too tired to travel far now  ive been hunting that fellow for several days and if i have any luck at all i ought to get him this time  im afraid you wont have any luck at all said lightfoots friend  you see i dont allow any hunting on my land  the hunter looked surprised and then his surprise gave way to anger  you mean said he that you intend to get that deer yourself  lightfoots friend shook his head  no said he i dont mean anything of the kind  i mean that that deer is not to be killed if i can prevent it and while it is on my land i think i can the best thing for you to do my friend is to get into your boat and row back where you came from  are those your hounds barking over there  no replied the hunter promptly  i know the law just as well as you do and it is against the law to hunt deer with dogs i dont even know who owns those two hounds over there  that may be true replied lightfoots friend  i dont doubt it is true  but you are willing to take advantage of the fact that the dogs of some one else have broken the law  you knew that those dogs had driven that deer into the big river and you promptly took advantage of the fact to try to reach that deer before he could get across  you are not hunting for the pleasure of hunting but just to kill  you dont know the meaning of justice or fairness  now get off my land  get back into your boat and off my land as quick as you can  that deer is not very far from here and so tired that he cannot move  just as long as he will stay here he will be safe and i hope he will stay until this miserable hunting season is ended now go  muttering angrily the hunter got back into his boat and pushed off but he didnt row back across the river     chapter xxv the hunter lies in wait   if ever there was an angry hunter it was the one who had followed lightfoot the deer across the big river  when he was ordered to get off the land where lightfoot had climbed out he got back into his boat but he didnt row back to the other side instead he rowed down the river finally landing on the same side but on land which lightfoots friend did not own  when that deer has become rested hell become uneasy thought the hunter  he wont stay on that mans land hell start for the nearest woods  ill go up there and wait for him  ill get that deer if only to spite that fellow back there who drove me off had it not been for him id have that deer right now he was too tired to have gone far  hes got the handsomest pair of antlers ive seen for years  i can sell that head of his for a good price  so the hunter tied his boat to a tree and once more climbed out  he climbed up the bank and studied the land  across a wide meadow he could see a brushy old pasture and back of that some thick woods  he grinned  thats where that deer will head for he decided  there isnt any other place for him to go  all ive got to do is be patient and wait  so the hunter took his terrible gun and tramped across the meadow to the brushgrown pasture  there he hid among the bushes where he could peep out and watch the land of lightfoots friend he was still angry because he had been prevented from shooting lightfoot at the same time he chuckled because he thought himself very smart  lightfoot couldnt possibly reach the shelter of the woods without giving him a shot and he hadnt the least doubt that lightfoot would start for the woods just as soon as he felt able to travel  so he made himself comfortable and prepared to wait the rest of the day if necessary  now lightfoots friend who had driven the hunter off had seen him row down the river and he had guessed just what was in that hunters mind  well fool him said he chuckling to himself as he walked back towards the shed where poor lightfoot was resting  he did not go too near lightfoot for he did not want to alarm him he just kept within sight of lightfoot paying no attention to him but going about his work  you see this man loved and understood the little people of the green forest and the green meadows and he knew that there was no surer way of winning lightfoots confidence and trust than by appearing to take no notice of him  lightfoot watching him understood he knew that this man was a friend and would do him no harm  little by little the wonderful blessed feeling of safety crept over lightfoot no hunter could harm him here     chapter xxvi lightfoot does the wise thing   all the rest of that day the hunter with the terrible gun lay hidden in the bushes of the pasture where he could watch for lightfoot the deer to leave the place of safety he had found it required a lot of patience on the part of the hunter but the hunter had plenty of patience  it sometimes seems as if hunters have more patience than any other people  but this hunter waited in vain  jolly round red mr sun sank down in the west to his bed behind the purple hills  the black shadows crept out and grew blacker  one by one the stars began to twinkle  still the hunter waited and still there was no sign of lightfoot  at last it became so dark that it was useless for the hunter to remain longer  disappointed and once more becoming angry he tramped back to the big river climbed into his boat and rowed across to the other side  then he tramped home and his thoughts were very bitter  he knew that he could have shot lightfoot had it not been for the man who had protected the deer  he even began to suspect that this man had himself killed lightfoot for he had been sure that as soon as he had become rested lightfoot would start for the woods and lightfoot had done nothing of the kind  in fact the hunter had not had so much as another glimpse of lightfoot  the reason that the hunter had been so disappointed was that lightfoot was smart  he was smart enough to understand that the man who was saving him from the hunter had done it because he was a true friend  all the afternoon lightfoot had rested on a bed of soft hay in an open shed and had watched this man going about his work and taking the utmost care to do nothing to frighten lightfoot  he not only will let no one else harm me but he himself will not harm me thought lightfoot  as long as he is near i am safe ill stay right around here until the hunting season is over then ill swim back across the big river to my home in the dear green forest  so all afternoon lightfoot rested and did not so much as put his nose outside that open shed  that is why the hunter got no glimpse of him  when it became dark so dark that he knew there was no longer danger lightfoot got up and stepped out under the stars he was feeling quite himself again his splendid strength had returned he bounded lightly across the meadow and up into the brushy pasture where the hunter had been hidden  there and in the woods back of the pasture he browsed but at the first hint of the coming of another day lightfoot turned back and when his friend the farmer came out early in the morning to milk the cows there was lightfoot back in the open shed the farmer smiled you are as wise as you are handsome old fellow said he     chapter xxvii sammy jay worries   it isnt often sammy jay worries about anybody but himself truth to tell he doesnt worry about himself very often  you see sammy is smart and he knows he is smart  under that pointed cap of his are some of the cleverest wits in all the green forest sammy seldom worries about himself because he feels quite able to take care of himself  but sammy jay was worrying now  he was worrying about lightfoot the deer  yes sir sammy jay was worrying about lightfoot the deer  for two days he had been unable to find lightfoot or any trace of lightfoot  but he did find plenty of hunters with terrible guns  it seemed to him that they were everywhere in the green forest  sammy began to suspect that one of them must have succeeded in killing lightfoot the deer  sammy knew all of lightfoots hidingplaces  he visited every one of them  lightfoot wasnt to be found and no one whom sammy met had seen lightfoot for two days  sammy felt badly  you see he was very fond of lightfoot you remember it was sammy who warned lightfoot of the coming of the hunter on the morning when the dreadful hunting season began ever since the hunting season had opened sammy had done his best to make trouble for the hunters  whenever he had found one of them he had screamed at the top of his voice to warn every one within hearing just where that hunter was  once a hunter had lost his temper and shot at sammy but sammy had suspected that something of the kind might happen and he had taken care to keep just out of reach  sammy had known all about the chasing of lightfoot by the hounds  everybody in the green forest had known about it  you see everybody had heard the voices of those hounds  once lightfoot had passed right under the tree in which sammy was sitting and a few moments later the two hounds had passed with their noses to the ground as they followed lightfoots trail that was the last sammy had seen of lightfoot he had been able to save lightfoot from the hunters but he couldnt save him from the hounds  the more sammy thought things over the more he worried  i am afraid those hounds drove him out where a hunter could get a shot and kill him or else that they tired him out and killed him themselves thought sammy  if he were alive somebody certainly would have seen him and nobody has since the day those hounds chased him  i declare i have quite lost my appetite worrying about him  if lightfoot is dead and i am almost sure he is the green forest will never seem the same     chapter xxviii the hunting season ends   the very worst things come to an end at last  no matter how bad a thing is it cannot last forever  so it was with the hunting season for lightfoot the deer  there came a day when the law protected all deera day when the hunters could no longer go searching for lightfoot  usually there was great rejoicing among the little people of the green forest and the green meadows when the hunting season ended and they knew that lightfoot would be in no more danger until the next hunting season  but this year there was no rejoicing  you see no one could find lightfoot  the last seen of him was when he was running for his life with two hounds baying on his trail and the green forest filled with hunters watching for a chance to shoot him  sammy jay had hunted everywhere through the green forest  blacky the crow whose eyes are quite as sharp as those of sammy jay had joined in the search  they had found no trace of lightfoot paddy the beaver said that for three days lightfoot had not visited his pond for a drink  billy mink who travels up and down the laughing brook had looked for lightfoots footprints in the soft earth along the banks and had found only old ones  jumper the hare had visited lightfoots favorite eating places at night but lightfoot had not been in any of them  i tell you what it is said sammy jay to bobby coon something has happened to lightfoot  either those hounds caught him and killed him or he was shot by one of those hunters  the green forest will never be the same without him  i dont think i shall want to come over here very much  there isnt one of all the other people who live in the green forest who would be missed as lightfoot will be  bobby coon nodded  thats true sammy said he  without lightfoot the green forest will never be the same  he never harmed anybody  why those hunters should have been so anxious to kill one so beautiful is something i cant understand  for that matter i dont understand why they want to kill any of us if they really needed us for food it would be a different matter but they dont  have you been up in the old pasture and asked old man coyote if he has seen anything of lightfoot  sammy nodded  ive been up there twice said he  old man coyote has been lying very low during the days but nights he has done a lot of traveling  you know old man coyote has a mighty good nose but not once since the day those hounds chased lightfoot has he found so much as a tiny whiff of lightfoots scent  i thought he might have found the place where lightfoot was killed but he hasnt although he has looked for it  well the hunting season for lightfoot is over but i am afraid it has ended too late     chapter xxix mr and mrs quack are startled   it was the evening of the day after the closing of the hunting season for lightfoot the deer  jolly round red mr sun had gone to bed behind the purple hills and the black shadows had crept out across the big river  mr and mrs quack were getting their evening meal among the brown stalks of the wild rice along the edge of the big river  they took turns in searching for the rice grains in the mud  while mrs quack tipped up and seemed to stand on her head as she searched in the mud for rice mr quack kept watch for possible danger  then mrs quack took her turn at keeping watch while mr quack stood on his head and hunted for rice  it was wonderfully quiet and peaceful  there was not even a ripple on the big river  it was so quiet that they could hear the barking of a dog at a farmhouse a mile away  they were far enough out from the bank to have nothing to fear from reddy fox or old man coyote  so they had nothing to fear from any one save hooty the owl  it was for hooty that they took turns in watching it was just the hour when hooty likes best to hunt  by and by they heard bootys hunting call  it was far away in the green forest then mr and mrs quack felt easier and they talked in low contented voices  they felt that for a while at least there was nothing to fear  suddenly a little splash out in the big river caught mr quacks quick ear  as mrs quack brought her head up out of the water mr quack warned her to keep quiet  noiselessly they swam among the brown stalks until they could see out across the big river there was another little splash out there in the middle  it wasnt the splash made by a fish it was a splash made by something much bigger than any fish  presently they made out a silver line moving towards them from the black shadows  they knew exactly what it meant  it meant that some one was out there in the big river moving towards them  could it be a boat containing a hunter  with their necks stretched high mr and mrs quack watched they were ready to take to their strong wings the instant they discovered danger  but they did not want to fly until they were sure that it was danger approaching  they were startled very much startled  presently they made out what looked like the branch of a tree moving over the water towards them  that was queer very queer  mr quack said so  mrs quack said so  both were growing more and more suspicious  they couldnt understand it at all and it is always best to be suspicious of things you cannot understand  mr and mrs quack half lifted their wings to fly     chapter xxx the mystery is solved   it was very mysterious  yes sir it was very mysterious mr quack thought so  mrs quack thought so  there out in the big river in the midst of the black shadows was something which looked like the branch of a tree  but instead of moving down the river as the branch of a tree would if it were floating this was coming straight across the river as if it were swimming  but how could the branch of a tree swim  that was too much for mr quack  it was too much for mrs quack  so they sat perfectly still among the brown stalks of the wild rice along the edge of the big river and not for a second did they take their eyes from that strange thing moving towards them  they were ready to spring into the air and trust to their swift wings the instant they should detect danger  but they did not want to fly unless they had to  besides they were curious  they were very curious indeed  they wanted to find out what that mysterious thing moving through the water towards them was  so mr and mrs quack watched that thing that looked like a swimming branch draw nearer and nearer and the nearer it drew the more they were puzzled and the more curious they felt  if it had been the pond of paddy the beaver instead of the big river they would have thought it was paddy swimming with a branch for his winter food pile  but paddy the beaver was way back in his own pond deep in the green forest and they knew it  so this thing became more and more of a mystery  the nearer it came the more nervous and anxious they grew and at the same time the greater became their curiosity  at last mr quack felt that not even to gratify his curiosity would it be safe to wait longer  he prepared to spring into the air knowing that mrs quack would follow him  it was just then that a funny little sound reached him  it was half snort half cough as if some one had sniffed some water up his nose  there was something familiar about that sound  mr quack decided to wait a few minutes longer  ill wait thought mr quack until that thing whatever it is comes out of those black shadows into the moonlight somehow i have a feeling that we are in no danger  so mr and mrs quack waited and watched  in a few minutes the thing that looked like the branch of a tree came out of the black shadows into the moonlight and then the mystery was solved it was a mystery no longer  they saw that they had mistaken the antlers of lightfoot the deer for the branch of a tree  lightfoot was swimming across the big river on his way back to his home in the green forest  at once mr and mrs quack swam out to meet him and to tell him how glad they were that he was alive and safe     chapter xxxi a surprising discovery   probably there was no happier thanksgiving in all the great world than the thanksgiving of lightfoot the deer when the dreadful hunting season ended and he was once more back in his beloved green forest with nothing to fear  all his neighbors called on him to tell him how glad they were that he had escaped and how the green forest would not have been the same if he had not returned  so lightfoot roamed about without fear and was happy  it seemed to him that he could not be happier  there was plenty to eat and that blessed feeling of nothing to fear what more could any one ask  he began to grow sleek and fat and handsomer than ever  the days were growing colder and the frosty air made him feel good  just at dusk one evening he went down to his favorite drinking place at the laughing brook  as he put down his head to drink he saw something which so surprised him that he quite forgot he was thirsty  what do you think it was he saw  it was a footprint in the soft mud  yes sir it was a footprint  for a long time lightfoot stood staring at that footprint  in his great soft eyes was a look of wonder and surprise  you see that footprint was exactly like one of his own only smaller to lightfoot it was a very wonderful footprint he was quite sure that never had he seen such a dainty footprint  he forgot to drink instead he began to search for other footprints and presently he found them  each was as dainty as that first one  who could have made them  that is what lightfoot wanted to know and what he meant to find out  it was clear to him that there was a stranger in the green forest and somehow he didnt resent it in the least  in fact he was glad  he couldnt have told why but it was true  lightfoot put his nose to the footprints and sniffed of them even had he not known by looking at those prints that they had been made by a stranger his nose would have told him this a great longing to find the maker of those footprints took possession of him  he lifted his handsome head and listened for some slight sound which might show that the stranger was near with his delicate nostrils he tested the wandering little night breezes for a stray whiff of scent to tell him which way to go but there was no sound and the wandering little night breezes told him nothing  lightfoot followed the dainty footprints up the bank there they disappeared for the ground was hard  lightfoot paused undecided which way to go     chapter xxxii lightfoot sees the stranger   lightfoot the deer was unhappy  it was a strange unhappiness an unhappiness such as he had never known before  you see he had discovered that there was a stranger in the green forest a stranger of his own kind another deer  he knew it by dainty footprints in the mud along the laughing brook and on the edge of the pond of paddy the beaver  he knew it by other signs which he ran across every now and then  but search as he would he was unable to find that newcomer  he had searched everywhere but always he was just too late  the stranger had been and gone  now there was no anger in lightfoots desire to find that stranger  instead there was a great longing  for the first time in his life lightfoot felt lonely  so he hunted and hunted and was unhappy  he lost his appetite  he slept little  he roamed about uneasily looking listening testing every merry little breeze but all in vain  then one nevertobeforgotten night as he drank at the laughing brook a strange feeling swept over him  it was the feeling of being watched  lightfoot lifted his beautiful head and a slight movement caught his quick eye and drew it to a thicket not far away  the silvery light of gentle mistress moon fell full on that thicket and thrust out from it was the most beautiful head in all the great world  at least that is the way it seemed to lightfoot though to tell the truth it was not as beautiful as his own for it was uncrowned by antlers  for a long minute lightfoot stood gazing  a pair of wonderful great soft eyes gazed back at him  then that beautiful head disappeared  with a mighty bound lightfoot cleared the laughing brook and rushed over to the thicket in which that beautiful head had disappeared  he plunged in but there was no one there frantically he searched but that thicket was empty then he stood still and listened  not a sound reached him  it was as still as if there were no other living things in all the green forest  the beautiful stranger had slipped away as silently as a shadow  all the rest of that night lightfoot searched through the green forest but his search was in vain  the longing to find that beautiful stranger had become so great that he fairly ached with it it seemed to him that until he found her he could know no happiness     chapter xxxiii a different game of hide and seek   once more lightfoot the deer was playing hide and seek in the green forest  but it was a very different game from the one he had played just a short time before  you remember that then it had been for his life that he had played and he was the one who had done all the hiding  now he was it and some one else was doing the hiding  instead of the dreadful fear which had filled him in that other game he was now filled with longinglonging to find and make friends with the beautiful stranger of whom he had just once caught a glimpse but of whom every day he found tracks  at times lightfoot would lose his temper  yes sir lightfoot would lose his temper  that was a foolish thing to do but it seemed to him that he just couldnt help it  he would stamp his feet angrily and thrash the bushes with his great spreading antlers as if they were an enemy with whom he was fighting more than once when he did this a pair of great soft gentle eyes were watching him though he didnt know it  if he could have seen them and the look of admiration in them he would have been more eager than ever to find that beautiful stranger  at other times lightfoot would steal about through the green forest as noiselessly as a shadow  he would peer into thickets and behind tangles of fallen trees and brush piles hoping to surprise the one he sought  he would be very very patient perhaps he would come to the thicket which he knew from the signs the stranger had left only a few moments before then his patience would vanish in impatience and he would dash ahead eager to catch up with the shy stranger  but always it was in vain he had thought himself very clever but this stranger was proving herself more clever  of course it wasnt long before all the little people in the green forest knew what was going on  they knew all about that game of hide and seek just as they had known all about that other game of hide and seek with the hunters  but now instead of trying to help lightfoot as they did then they gave him no help at all  the fact is they were enjoying that game  mischievous sammy jay even went so far as to warn the stranger several times when lightfoot was approaching  of course lightfoot knew when sammy did this and each time he lost his temper  for the time being he quite forgot all that sammy had done for him when he was the one that was being hunted  once lightfoot almost ran smack into buster bear and was so provoked by his own carelessness that instead of bounding away he actually threatened to fight buster  but when buster grinned goodnaturedly at him lightfoot thought better of it and bounded away to continue his search  then there were times when lightfoot would sulk and would declare over and over to himself i dont care anything about that stranger  i wont spend another minute looking for her  and then within five minutes he would be watching listening and seeking some sign that she was still in the green forest     chapter xxxiv a startling new footprint   the game of hide and seek between lightfoot the deer and the beautiful stranger whose dainty footprints had first started lightfoot to seeking her had been going on for several days and nights when lightfoot found something which gave him a shock he had stolen very softly clown to the laughing brook hoping to surprise the beautiful stranger drinking there  she wasnt to be seen  lightfoot wondered if she had been there so looked in the mud at the edge of the laughing brook to see if there were any fresh prints of those dainty feet  almost at once he discovered fresh footprints  they were not the prints he was looking for no sir they were not the dainty prints he had learned to know so well  they were prints very near the size of his own big ones and they had been made only a short time before  the finding of those prints was a dreadful shock to lightfoot he understood instantly what they meant  they meant that a second stranger had come into the green forest one who had antlers like his own  jealousy took possession of lightfoot the deer jealousy that filled his heart with rage  he has come here to seek that beautiful stranger i have been hunting for thought lightfoot he has come here to try to steal her away from me  he has no right here in my green forest  he belongs back up on the great mountain from which he must have come for there is no other place he could have come from  that is where that beautiful stranger must have come from too  i want her to stay but i must drive this fellow out ill make him fight thats what ill do ill make him fight im not afraid of him but ill make him fear me  lightfoot stamped his feet and with his great antlers thrashed the bushes as if he felt that they were the enemy he sought  could you have looked into his great eyes then you would have found nothing soft and beautiful about them they became almost red with anger lightfoot quivered all over with rage the hair on the back of his neck stood up lightfoot the deer looked anything but gentle  after he had vented his spite for a few minutes on the harmless helpless bushes he threw his head high in the air and whistled angrily  then he leaped over the laughing brook and once more began to search through the green forest  but this time it was not for the beautiful stranger with the dainty feet  he had no time to think of her now  he must first find this newcomer and he meant to waste no time in doing it     chapter xxxv lightfoot is reckless   in his search for the new stranger who had come to the green forest lightfoot the deer was wholly reckless  he no longer stole like a gray shadow from thicket to thicket as he had done when searching for the beautiful stranger with the dainty feet  he bounded along careless of how much noise he made from time to time he would stop to whistle a challenge and to clash his horns against the trees and stamp the ground with his feet  after such exhibitions of anger he would pause to listen hoping to hear some sound which would tell him where the stranger was now and then he found the strangers tracks and from them he knew that this stranger was doing just what he had been doing seeking to find the beautiful newcomer with the dainty feet  each time he found these signs lightfoots rage increased  of course it didnt take sammy jay long to discover what was going on  there is little that escapes those sharp eyes of sammy jay  as you know he had early discovered the game of hide and seek lightfoot had been playing with the beautiful young visitor who had come down to the green forest from the great mountain  then by chance sammy had visited the laughing brook just as the big stranger had come down there to drink  for once sammy had kept his tongue still  there is going to be excitement here when lightfoot discovers this fellow thought sammy if they ever meet and i have a feeling that they will there is going to be a fight worth seeing i must pass the word around  so sammy jay hunted up his cousin blacky the crow and told him what he had discovered  then he hunted up bobby coon and told him he saw unc billy possum sitting in the doorway of his hollow tree and told him  he discovered jumper the hare sitting under a little hemlocktree and told him  then he flew over to the dear old briarpatch to tell peter rabbit  of course he told drummer the woodpecker tommy tit the chickadee and yank yank the nuthatch who were over in the old orchard and they at once hurried to the green forest for they couldnt think of missing anything so exciting as would be the meeting between lightfoot and the big stranger from the great mountain  sammy didnt forget to tell paddy the beaver but it was no news to paddy  paddy had seen the big stranger on the edge of his pond early the night before  of course lightfoot knew nothing about all this  his one thought was to find that big stranger and drive him from the green forest and so he continued his search tirelessly     chapter xxxvi sammy jay takes a hand   sammy jay was bubbling over with excitement as he flew about through the green forest following lightfoot the deer  he was so excited he wanted to scream  but he didnt he kept his tongue still you see he didnt want lightfoot to know that he was being followed under that pointed cap of sammy jays are quick wits  it didnt take him long to discover that the big stranger whom lightfoot was seeking was doing his best to keep out of lightfoots way and that he was having no difficulty in doing so because of the reckless way in which lightfoot was searching for him  lightfoot made so much noise that it was quite easy to know just where he was and so keep out of his sight  that stranger is nearly as big as lightfoot but it is very plain that he doesnt want to fight thought sammy  he must be a coward  now the truth is the stranger was not a coward  he was ready and willing to fight if he had to but if he could avoid fighting he meant to  you see big as he was he wasnt quite so big as lightfoot and he knew it  he had seen lightfoots big footprints and from their size he knew that lightfoot must be bigger and heavier than he  then too he knew that he really had no right to be there in the green forest  that was lightfoots home and so he was an intruder  he knew that lightfoot would feel this way about it and that this would make him fight all the harder  so the big stranger wanted to avoid a fight if possible  but he wanted still more to find that beautiful young visitor with the dainty feet for whom lightfoot had been looking  he wanted to find her just as lightfoot wanted to find her and he hoped that if he did find her he could take her away with him back to the great mountain  if he had to he would fight for her but until he had to he would keep out of the fight  so he dodged lightfoot and at the same time looked for the beautiful stranger  all this sammy jay guessed and after a while he grew tired of following lightfoot for nothing  ill have to take a hand in this thing myself muttered sammy  at this rate lightfoot never will find that big stranger  so sammy stopped following lightfoot and began to search through the green forest for the big stranger  it didnt take very long to find him  he was over near the pond of paddy the beaver as soon as he saw him sammy began to scream at the top of his lungs  at once he heard the sound of snapping twigs at the top of a little ridge back of paddys pond and knew that lightfoot had heard and understood     chapter xxxvii the great fight   down from the top of the ridge back of the pond of paddy the beaver plunged lightfoot the deer his eyes blazing with rage he had understood the screaming of sammy jay he knew that somewhere down there was the big stranger he had been looking for  the big stranger had understood sammys screaming quite as well as lightfoot  he knew that to run away now would be to prove himself a coward and forever disgrace himself in the eyes of miss daintyfoot for that was the name of the beautiful stranger he had been seeking  he must fight there was no way out of it he must fight the hair on the back of his neck stood up with anger just as did the hair on the neck of lightfoot his eyes also blazed  he bounded out into a little open place by the pond of paddy the beaver and there he waited  meanwhile sammy jay was flying about in the greatest excitement screaming at the top of his lungs a fight a fight a fight blacky the crow over in another part of the green forest heard him and took up the cry and at once hurried over to paddys pond everybody who was near enough hurried there bobby coon and unc billy possum climbed trees from which they could see and at the same time be safe  billy mink hurried to a safe place on the dam of paddy the beaver  paddy himself climbed up on the roof of his house out in the pond  peter rabbit and jumper the hare who happened to be not far away hurried over where they could peep out from under some young hemlocktrees  buster bear shuffled down the hill and watched from the other side of the pond reddy and granny fox were both there  for what seemed like the longest time but which was for only a minute lightfoot and the big stranger stood still glaring at each other  then snorting with rage they lowered their heads and plunged together  their antlers clashed with a noise that rang through the green forest and both fell to their knees there they pushed and struggled  then they separated and backed away to repeat the movement over again  it was a terrible fight everybody said so  if they had not known before everybody knew now what those great antlers were for  once the big stranger managed to reach lightfoots right shoulder with one of the sharp points of his antlers and made a long tear in lightfoots gray coat  it only made lightfoot fight harder  sometimes they would rear up and strike with their sharp hoofs  back and forth they plunged and the ground was torn up by their feet  both were getting out of breath and from time to time they had to stop for a moments rest  then they would come together again more fiercely than ever  never had such a fight been seen in the green forest     chapter xxxviii an unseen watcher   as lightfoot the deer and the big stranger from the great mountain fought in the little opening near the pond of paddy the beaver neither knew or cared who saw them  each was filled fully with rage and determined to drive the other from the green forest each was fighting for the right to win the love of miss daintyfoot  neither of them knew that miss daintyfoot herself was watching them  but she was  she had heard the clash of their great antlers as they had come together the first time and she had known exactly what it meant  timidly she had stolen forward to a thicket where safely hidden she could watch that terrible fight  she knew that they were fighting for her  of course she knew it just as she had known how both had been hunting for her what she didnt know for some time was which one she wanted to win that fight  both lightfoot and the big stranger were handsome  yes indeed they were very handsome  lightfoot was just a little bit the bigger and it seemed to her just a little bit the handsomer she almost wanted him to win  then when she saw how bravely the big stranger was fighting and how well he was holding his own even though he was a little smaller than lightfoot she almost hoped he would win  that great fight lasted a long time  to pretty miss daintyfoot it seemed that it never would end  but after a while lightfoots greater size and strength began to tell  little by little the big stranger was forced back towards the edge of the open place now he would be thrown to his knees when lightfoot wasnt as lightfoot saw this he seemed to gain new strength  at last he caught the stranger in such a way that he threw him over while the stranger struggled to get to his feet again lightfoots sharp antlers made long tears in his gray coat  the stranger was beaten and he knew it  the instant he succeeded in getting to his feet he turned tail and plunged for the shelter of the green forest  with a snort of triumph lightfoot plunged after him  but now that he was beaten fear took possession of the stranger  all desire to fight left him his one thought was to get away and fear gave him speed  straight back towards the great mountain from which he had come the stranger headed lightfoot followed only a short distance  he knew that that stranger was going for good and would not come back then lightfoot turned back to the open place where they had fought  there he threw up his beautiful head crowned by its great antlers and whistled a challenge to all the green forest as she looked at him miss daintyfoot knew that she had wanted him to win  she knew that there simply couldnt be anybody else so handsome and strong and brave in all the great world     chapter xxxix lightfoot discovers love   wonderfully handsome was lightfoot the deer as he stood in the little opening by the pond of paddy the beaver his head thrown back proudly as he received the congratulations of his neighbors of the green forest who had seen him win the great fight with the big stranger who had come down from the great mountain to beautiful miss daintyfoot peeping out from the thicket where she had hidden to watch the great fight lightfoot was the most wonderful person in all the great world  she adored him which means that she loved him just as much as it was possible for her to love  but lightfoot didnt know this  in fact he didnt know that miss daintyfoot was there  his one thought had been to drive out of the green forest the big stranger who had come down from the great mountain  he had been jealous of that big stranger though he hadnt known that he was jealous  the real cause of his anger and desire to fight had been the fear that the big stranger would find miss daintyfoot and take her away of course this was nothing but jealousy  now that the great fight was over and he knew that the big stranger was hurrying back to the great mountain all lightfoots anger melted away  in its place was a great longing to find miss daintyfoot  his great eyes became once more soft and beautiful in them was a look of wistfulness  lightfoot walked down to the edge of the water and drank for he was very very thirsty  then he turned intending to take up once more his search for beautiful miss daintyfoot  when he turned he faced the thicket in which miss daintyfoot was hiding  his keen eyes caught a little movement of the branches a beautiful head was slowly thrust out and lightfoot gazed again into a pair of soft eyes which he was sure were the most beautiful eyes in all the great world  he wondered if she would disappear and run away as she had the last time he saw her  he took a step or two forward  the beautiful head was withdrawn  lightfoots heart sank  then he bounded forward into that thicket  he more than half expected to find no one there but when he entered that thicket he received the most wonderful surprise in all his life  there stood miss daintyfoot timid bashful but with a look in her eyes which lightfoot could not mistake  in that instant lightfoot understood the meaning of that longing which had kept him hunting for her and of the rage which had filled him when he had discovered the presence of the big stranger from the great mountain  it was love  lightfoot knew that he loved miss daintyfoot and looking into her soft gentle eyes he knew that miss daintyfoot loved him     chapter xl happy days in the green forest   these were happy days in the green forest  at least they were happy for lightfoot the deer  they were the happiest days he had ever known  you see he had won beautiful slender young miss daintyfoot and now she was no longer miss daintyfoot but mrs lightfoot  lightfoot was sure that there was no one anywhere so beautiful as she and mrs lightfoot knew that there was no one so handsome and brave as he  wherever lightfoot went mrs lightfoot went  he showed her all his favorite hidingplaces  he led her to his favorite eatingplaces  she did not tell him that she was already acquainted with every one of them that she knew the green forest quite as well as he did  if he had stopped to think how day after day she had managed to keep out of his sight while he hunted for her he would have realized that there was little he could show her which she did not already know  but he didnt stop to think and proudly led her from place to place  and mrs lightfoot wisely expressed delight with all she saw quite as if it were all new  of course all the little people of the green forest hurried to pay their respects to mrs lightfoot and to tell lightfoot how glad they felt for him  and they really did feel glad  you see they all loved lightfoot and they knew that now he would be happier than ever and that there would be no danger of his leaving the green forest because of loneliness  the green forest would not be the same at all without lightfoot the deer  lightfoot told mrs lightfoot all about the terrible days of the hunting season and how glad he was that she had not been in the green forest then  he told her how the hunters with terrible guns had given him no rest and how he had had to swim the big river to get away from the hounds  i know replied mrs lightfoot softly  i know all about it you see there were hunters on the great mountain  in fact that is how i happened to come down to the green forest  they hunted me so up there that i did not dare stay and i came down here thinking that there might be fewer hunters  i wouldnt have believed that i could ever be thankful to hunters for anything but i am truly i am  there was a puzzled look on lightfoots face  what for he demanded  i cant imagine anybody being thankful to hunters for anything  oh you stupid cried mrs lightfoot  dont you see that if i hadnt been driven down from the great mountain i never would have found you  you mean i never would have found you retorted lightfoot i guess i owe these hunters more than you do  i owe them the greatest happiness i have ever known but i never would have thought of it myself  isnt it queer how things which seem the very worst possible sometimes turn out to be the very best possible  blacky the crow is one of lightfoots friends but sometimes even friends are envious  it is so with blacky  he insists that he is quite as important in the green forest as is lightfoot and that his doings are quite as interesting  therefore just to please him the next book is to be blacky the crow
