last in 1904 and in ten very full months henry james secured that renewed saturation in american experience which he desired before it should be too late for his advantage he saw far more of his country in these months than he had ever seen in old days he went with the definite purpose of writing a book of impressions and these were to be principally the impressions of a restored absentee reviving the sunken and overlaid memories of his youth but his memories were practically of new york newport and boston only to the country beyond he came for the most part as a complete stranger and his voyage of new discovery proved of an interest as great as that which he found in revisiting ancient haunts the american scene rather than the letters he was able to write in the midst of such a stir of movement gives his account of the adventure on the spot the daily assault of sensation besetting him wherever he turned was too insistent for deliberate report he quickly saw that his book would have to be postponed for calmer hours at home and his letters are those of a man almost overwhelmed by the amount that is being thrown upon his power of absorption but the book he eventually wrote shews how fully that power was equal to it alllosing or wasting none of it meeting and reacting to every moment ten months of america poured into his imagination as he intended they should a vast mass of strange materialthe familiar part of it now after so many years the strangest of all perhaps and his imagination worked upon it in one unbroken rage of interest he was now more than sixty years old but for such adventures of perception and discrimination his strength was greater than ever  he sailed from england at the end of august 1904 and spent most of the autumn with william james and his family first at chocorua their countryhome in the mountains of new hampshire and then at cambridge the rule he had made in advance against the paying of other visits was abandoned at once he was in the centre of too many friendships and too many opportunities for extending and enlarging them with cambridge still as his headquarters he widely improved his knowledge of new england which had never reached far into the countryside at christmas he was in new yorkthe place that was much more his home as he still felt than boston had ever become yet of all his american past the most unrecognisable relic in the portentous changes of twenty years he struck south through philadelphia and washington in the hope of meeting the early virginian spring but it happened to be a year of unusually late snows and his impressions of the southern country most of which was quite unknown to him were unfortunately marred he found the right subtropical benignity in florida but a particular series of engagements brought him back after a brief stay it had been natural that he should be invited to celebrate his return to america by lecturing in public but that he should do so and even with enjoyment was more surprising and particularly so to himself he began by delivering a discourse on the lesson of balzaca closely wrought critical study very attractive in form and toneat bryn mawr college pennsylvania and was immediately solicited to repeat it elsewhere he did this in the course of the winter at various other places so providing himself at once with the means and the occasion for much more travel and observation than he had expected by chicago st louis and indianapolis he reached california in april 1905 the lesson of balzac was given several times until for a second visit to bryn mawr he wrote another paper the question of our speechan amusing and forcible appeal for care in the treatment of spoken english the two lectures were afterwards published in america but have not appeared in england  the beauty and amenity of california was an unexpected revelation to him and it is clear that his experience of the west though it only lasted for a few weeks was fully as fruitful as all that had gone before unluckily he did not write the continuation of the american scene which was to have carried the record on from florida to the pacific coast so that this part of his journey is only to be followed in a few hurried letters of the time he was soon back in the east at new york and cambridge again beginning by now to feel that the cup of his sensations was all but as full as it would hold the longing to discharge it into prose before it had lost its freshness grew daily stronger a years absence from his work had almost tired him out but he paid several last visits before sailing for home and it was definitely in this american summer that he acquired a taste which was to bring him an immensity of pleasure on repeated occasions for the rest of his life the use of the motorcar for wide and leisurely sweeps through summer scenery was from now onward an interest and a delight to which many friends were glad to help himin new england at this time later on at home in france and in italy it renewed the romance of travel for him revealing fresh aspects in the scenes of old wanderings and he enjoyed the opportunity of sinking into the deep background of country life which only came to him with emancipation from the railway  he reached lamb house again in august 1905 and immediately set to work on his american book it grew at such a rate that he presently found he had filled a large volume without nearly exhausting his material but by that time the whole experience seemed remote and faint and he felt it impossible to go further with it the wreckage of san francisco moreover by the great earthquake and fire of 1906 drove his own californian recollections still further from his mind he left the american scene a fragment therefore and turned to another occupation which engaged him very closely for the next two years this was the preparation of the revised and collected edition of his works or at least of so much of his fiction as he could find room for in a limited number of volumes to read his own books was an entirely new amusement to him they had always been rigidly thrust out of sight from the moment they were finished and done with and he came back now to his early novels with a perfectly detached critical curiosity he took each of them in hand and plunged into the enormous toil not indeed of modifying its substance in any waywhere he was dissatisfied with the substance he rejected it altogetherbut of bringing its surface every syllable of its diction to the level of his exigent taste at the same time in the prefaces to the various volumes he wrote what became in the end a complete exposition of his theory of the art of fiction intertwined with the memories of past labour that he found everywhere in the muchforgotten pages it all represented a great expenditure of time and trouble besides the postponement of new work and there is no doubt that he was deeply disappointed by the halfhearted welcome that the edition met with after all schooled as he was in such discouragements  while he was on this work he scarcely stirred from lamb house except for occasional interludes of a few weeks in london and it was not until the spring of 1907 that he allowed himself a real holiday he then went abroad for three months beginning with a visit to mr and mrs wharton in paris and a motortour with them over a large part of western and southern france with all his french experience paris of the faubourg st germain and france of the remote countryroads were alike almost new to him and the whole episode was matter of the finest sort for his imagination from the american to the ambassadors he had written scores of pages about paris but none more romantic than a paragraph or two of the velvet glove in which he recorded an impression of this timea sight of the quays and the seine on a blue and silver april night from paris he passed on to his last visit as it proved to his beloved italy it was the tenth he had made since his settlement in england in 1876 like every one else perhaps who has ever known rome in youth he found rome violated and vulgarised in his age but here too the friendly chariot of fire helped him to a new range of discoveries at subiaco monte cassino and in the capuan plain he spent a few days at a friends house on the mountainslope below vallombrosa and a few more the best of all in venice at the everglorious palazzo barbaro that was the end of italy but he was again in paris for a short while in the following spring 1908 motoring thither from amiens with his hostess of the year before  meanwhile his return to continuous work on fiction still ardently desired by him had been further postponed by a recrudescence of his old theatrical ambitions stimulated no doubt by the comparative failure of the laborious edition of his works he had taken no active step himself but certain advances had been made to him from the world of the theatre and with a mixture of motives he responded so far as to revise and recast a couple of his earlier plays and to write a new one the oneact covering end which had appeared in the two magics disguised as a short story became the high bid in three acts it was produced by mr and mrs forbes robertson at edinburgh in march 1908 and repeated by them in london in the following february for a few afternoon performances at his majestys theatre the other house a play dating from a dozen years back which also had seen the light only as a narrative was taken in hand again with a view to its production by another company and the outcry was written for a third the two latter schemes were not carried out in the end chiefly on account of the troubled time of illness which fell on henry james with the beginning of 1910 and which made it necessary for him to lay aside all work for many months but this new intrusion of the theatre into his life was happily a much less agitating incident than his earlier experience of the same sort his expectations were now fewer and his composure was more securely based the misfortune was that again a considerable space of time was lost to the noveland in particular to the novel of american life that he had designed to be one of the results of his year of repatriation the blissful hours of dictation in the gardenhouse at rye were interrupted while he was at work on the plays he found he could compass the concision of the playform only by writing with his own hand foregoing the temptation to expand and develop which came while he created aloud but his keenest wish was to get back to the novel once more and he was clearing the way to it at the end of 1909 when all his plans were overturned by a long and distressing illness he never reached the american novel until four years later and he did not live to finish it     to w d howells   dictated   lamb house rye  jan 8th 1904    my dear howells   i am infinitely beholden to you for two good letters the second of which has come in today following close on the heels of the first and greeting me most benevolently as i rise from the couch of solitary pain which means nothing worse than that i have been in bed with odious and inconvenient gout and have but just tumbled out to deal by this helpful machinery with dreadful arrears of christmas and new years correspondence not yet at my ease for writing i thus inflict on you without apology this unwonted grace of legibility  it warms my heart verily to hear from you in so encouraging and sustaining a sensein fact makes me cast to the winds all timorous doubt of the energy of my intention i know now more than ever how much i want to goand also a good deal of why surely it will be a blessing to commune with you face to face since it is such a comfort and a cheer to do so even across the wild winter sea will you kindly say to harvey for me that i shall have much pleasure in talking with him here of the question of something serialistic in the north american and will broach the matter of an american novel in no other way until i see him it comes home to me much in truth that after my immensely long absence i am not quite in a position to answer in advance for the quantity and quality the exact form and colour of my reaction in presence of the native phenomena i only feel tolerably confident that a reaction of some sort there will be what affects me as indispensableor rather what i am conscious of as a great personal desireis some such energy of direct action as will enable me to cross the country and see california and also have a look at the south i am hungry for material whatever i may be moved to do with it and honestly i think there will not be an inch or an ounce of it unlikely to prove grist to my intellectual and artistic mill you speak of ones possible hates and lovesthat is aversions and tendernessesin the dire confrontation but i seem to feel about myself that i proceed but scantly in these chill years by those particular categories and rebounds in short that somehow such fine primitive passions lose themselves for me in the act of contemplation or at any rate in the act of reproduction however you are much more passionate than i and i will wait upon your words and try and learn from you a little to be shocked and charmed in the right places what mainly appals me is the idea of going a good many months without a quiet corner to do my daily stint so much so in fact that this is quite unthinkable and that i shall only have courage to advance by nursing the dream of a skyparlour of some sort in some cranny or crevice of the continent in which my mornings shall remain my own my little trickle of prose eventuate and my distracted reason thereby maintain its seat if some gifted creature only wanted to exchange with me for six or eight months and swap its customary bower over there for dear little lamb house here a really delicious residence the trick would be easily played however i see i must wait for all tricks this is all or almost all todayall except to reassure you of the pleasure you give me by your remarks about the ambassadors and cognate topics the international is very presumably indeed and in fact quite inevitably what i am chronically booked for so that truly even i feel it rather a pity in view of your so benevolent colloquy with harvey that a longish thing i am just finishing should not be disponible for the nar niche the niche that i like very much the best for serialisation of all possible niches but the golden bowl isnt alas so employable fortunately however i still cling to the belief that there are as good fish in the seathat is my sea you mention to me a domestic eventin pillas lifewhich interests me scarce the less for my having taken it for granted but i bless you all yours always   henry james      to edward lee childe         the name of this friend an american long settled in france has      already occurred vol i p 50 in connection with h js early      residence in paris mr childe who died in 1911 is known as the      biographer of his uncle general robert e lee commander of the      confederate forces in the american civil war    lamb house rye  january 19th 1904    my dear old friend   you write in no high spiritsover our general milieu or moment but high spirits are not the accompaniment of mature wisdom and yours are doubtless as good as mine like yourself i put in long periods in the country which on the whole on this mild and rather picturesque south coast i find in my late afternoon of life a good and salutary friend and i havent your solace of companionshipi dwell in singleness save for an occasional imported visitorwho is usually of a sex however not materially to mitigate my celibacy i have a smalla very nice perch in london to which i sometimes goin a week or two for instance for two or three months but i return hither always with zestfrom the too many people and things and words and motionsinto the peaceful possession of as i grow older my more and more precious home hours i have a household of good books and reading tends to take for me the place of experienceor rather to become itself pour qui sait lire experience concentrated you will say this is a dull picture but i cultivate dulness in a world grown too noisy besides as an antidote to it i have committed myself to going some time this year to americamy first expedition thither for 21 years if i do go and it is inevitable i shall stay six or eight monthsand shall be probably much and variously impressed and interested but i am already gloating over the sentiments with which i shall expatriate myself here  you ask what is being published and thought hereto which i reply that england never was the land of ideas and that it is now less so than ever morleys life of gladstone in three big volumes is formidable but rich and is very well done a type of frank exhaustive intimate biography such as has been often well produced here but much less in france partly perhaps because so much cannot be told about the livesprivate livesof the grands hommes there of course the book is largely a history of english politics for the last 50 yearsbut very human and vivid as for talk i hear very littlenone in this rusticity but if i pay a visit of three days as i do occasionally i become aware that the free traders and the chamberlainites sentredévorent the question bristles for me with the rebarbative but my prejudices and dearest traditions are all on the side of the system that has made england greatand everything i am most in sympathy with in the country appears to be still on the side of it notably the betterthe bestsort of the younger men chamberlain hasnt in the least captured these but its the midnight hour and my fire while i write has gone out i return again most heartily your salutation i send the friendliest greeting to mrs lee childe and to the dear old perthuis well remembered of me and very tenderly and i am my dear childe your very faithful old friend   henry james      to w e norris    lamb house rye  january 27th 1904    my dear norris   i have as usual a charming letter from you too long unanswered and my sense of this is the sharper as in spite of your eccentric demonstration of yourthat is of our disparities or whatever or at least of your lurid implication of them it all comes round after all to our having infinitely much in common for i too am making arrangements to be cremated and my mind keeps yours company in whatever pensive hovering yours may indulge in over the graceful operations at woking if you will only agree to postpone these on your own part to the latest really convenient date i would quite agree to testify to our union of friendship by availing myself of the same occasion it might come cheaper for two and undergoing the process with you i find i do desire from the moment the question becomes a really practical one to throw it as far into the future as possible save at the frequent moments when i desire to die very soon almost immediately i cling to life and propose to make it last i blush for the frivolity but there are still so many things i want to do i give you more or less an illustration of this i feel when i tell you that i go up to town tomorrow for eight or ten weeks and that i believe i have made arrangements or incurred the making of them by others to meet rhoda broughton in the evening à peine arrivé at dinner but i shall make in fact a shorter winters end stay than usual for i have really committed myself to what is for me a great adventure later in the year i have taken my passage for the us toward the end of august and with that long absence ahead of me i shall have to sit tight in the interval so i shall come back early in april to begin to pack at least morally and the moral preparation will as well as the material be the greater as its definitely visible to me that i must if possible let this house for the six or nine months  but what a sprawling scrawl i have written you and its long past midnight good morning everything else i meant to say though there isnt much is crowded out   yours always and ever henry james       to mrs julian sturgis        julian sturgis novelist and poet a friend of h js by many      ties had died on the day this letter was written     reform club pall mall sw april 13 1904    dearest mrs julian   i ask myself how i can write to you and yet how i cannot for my heart is full of the tenderest and most compassionate thought of you and i cant but vainly say so and i feel myself thinking as tenderly of him and of the laceration of his consciousness of leaving you and his boys of giving you up and ceasing to be for you what he so devotedly was and that makes me pity him more than words can saywith the wretchedness of ones not having been able to contribute to help or save him but there he is in his sacrificea beautiful noble stainless memory without the shadow upon him or the shadow of a shadow of a single grossness or meanness or uglinessthe worlds dust on the nature of thousands of men everything that was high and charming in him comes out as one holds on to him and when i think of my friendship of so many years with him i see it all as fairness and felicity and then i think of your admirable years and i find no words for your loss i only desire to keep near you and remain more than ever yours   henry james      to j b pinker        mr pinker was now acting as he continued to do till the end as      h js literary agent this letter refers to the golden bowl     lamb house rye  may 20th 1904    dear mr pinker   i will indeed let you have the whole of my ms on the very first possible day now not far off but i have still absolutely to finish and to finish right i have been working on the book with unremitting intensity the whole of every blessed morning since i began it some thirteen months ago and i am at present within but some twelve or fifteen thousand words of finis but i can work only in my own waya deucedly good one by the same tokenand am producing the best book i seem to conceive that i have ever done i have really done it fast for what it is and for the way i do itthe way i seem condemned to which is to overtreat my subject by developments and amplifications that have in large part eventually to be greatly compressed but to the prior operation of which the thing afterwards owes what is most durable in its quality i have written in perfection 200000 words of the gbwith the rarest perfectionand you can imagine how much of that which has taken time has had to come out it is not assuredly an economical way of work in the short run but it is for me in the long and at any rate one can proceed but in ones own manner my manner however is at present to be making every dayit is now a question of a very moderate number of daysa straight step nearer my last page comparatively close at hand you shall have it i repeat with the very minimum further delay of which i am capable i do not seem to know by the way when it is methuens desire that the volume shall appeari mean after the postponements we have had the best time for me i think especially in america will be about next october and i promise you the thing in distinct time for that but you will say that i am overtreating this subject too believe me yours ever   henry james      to henry james junior    lamb house rye  july 26th 1904    dearest h   your letter from chocorua received a day or two ago has a rare charm and value for me and in fact brings to my eyes tears of gratitude and appreciation i cant tell you how i thank you for offering me your manly breast to hurl myself upon in the event of my alighting on the new york dock four or five weeks hence in abject and craven terrorwhich i foresee as a certainty so that i accept without shame or scruple the beautiful and blessed offer of aid and comfort that you make me i have it at heart to notify you that you will in all probability bitterly repent of your generosity and that i shall be sure to become for you a deadweight of the first water the most awful burden nuisance parasite pestilence and plaster that you have ever known but this said i prepare even now to me cramponner to you like grim death trusting to you for everything and invoking you from moment to moment as my providence and saviour i go on assuming that i shall get off from southampton in the kaiser wilhelm ii of the north german lloyd line on august 24ththe said ship being i believe a fiveday boat which usually gets in sometime on the monday of course it will be a nuisance to you my arriving in new yorkif i do arrive but that got itself perversely and fatefully settled some time ago and has now to be accepted as of the essence since you ask me what my desire is likely to he i havent a minutes hesitation in speaking of it as a probable frantic yearning to get off to chocorua or at least to boston and its neighbourhood by the very first possible train and it may be on the said monday i shall not have much heart for interposing other things nor any patience for it to speak of so long as i hang off from your mountain home yet at the same time if the boat should get in late and it were possible to catch the connecticut train i believe i could bend my spirit to go for a couple of days to the emmets on the condition that you can go with me so and so only could i think of doing it very kindly therefore let them know this by wire or otherwise in advance and determine for me yourself whichever you think the best move grace norton writes me from kirkland street that she expects me there and mrs j gardner writes me from brookline that she absolutely counts on me in consequence of all of which i beseech you to hold on to me tight and put me through as much as possible like an express parcel paying 50 cents and taking a brass check for me i shall write you again next month and meanwhile im delighted at the prospect of your being able to spend september in the mountain home i have all along been counting on that as a matter of course but now i see it was fatuous to do soand yet rejoice but the more that this is in your power but goodnight dearest hwith many caresses all round ever your affectionate   henry james      to mrs w k clifford    chocorua nh usa  september 16th 1904    my dear dear lucy c   ones too dreadfuli receive your note and your wire of august 23rd in far new england under another sky and in such another world i dont know by what deviltry i missed them at the last save by that of the reform being closed for cleaning and the use of the union other club fraught with other errors and delays but the wednesday am at waterloo was horrible for crowd and confusion passengers for ship so in their thousands and i cant be sorry you werent in the crush mainly of rich germanamerican jews but that is ancient history and the worst of this now here is that spent with letterwriting my american postbag swollen to dreadfulness more and more and interviewers only kept at bay till i get to boston and new york i can only make you tonight this incoherent signal waiting till some less burdened hour to be more decent and more vivid i came straight up here where i have been just a fortnight and these new hampshire mountains forests lakes are of a beauty that i hadnt from my 18th20th years dared to remember as so great and such golden september weatherthough already turning to what the leaf enclosed picked but by reaching out of window is a very poor specimen of it is a pure bucolic and arcadian wildly informal and unfrilled lifebut sweet to me after long yearsand with many such good old homely farmy new england things to eat yet a sheinterviewer pushed into it yesterday all the way from new york 400 miles and we ten miles from a station on the mere chance of me and i took pity and your advice and surrendered to her more or less on condition that i shouldnt have to read her stuffand i shant so you see i am well inand tomorrow i go to other places one by one and shall be in deeper its a vast queer wonderful countrytoo unspeakable as yet and of which this is but a speck on the hem of the garment forgive this poverty of wearied pen to your good old   henry james      to edmund gosse    the mount lenox mass  october 27th 1904    my dear gosse   the weeks have been many and crowded since i received not very many days after my arrival your incisive letter from the depths of the so different world from this here but its just because they have been so animated peopled and pervaded that they have rushed by like loudpuffing motorcars passing out of my sight before i could step back out of the dust and the noise long enough to dash you off such a response as i could fling after them to be carried to you and during my first three or four here my postbag was enormouslyappallinglyheavy i almost turned tail and reembarked at the sight of it and then i wanted above all before writing you to make myself a notion of how and where and even what i was i have turned round now a good many times though still for two months only in this corner of a corner of a corner that is round new england and the postbag has happily shrunken a good bit though with liabilities i fear of reexpanding and this exquisite indian summer day sleeps upon these really admirable little massachusetts mountains lakes and woods in a way that lulls my perpetual sense of precipitation i have moved from my own fireside for long years so little have been abroad till now but once for ten years previous that the mere quantity of movement remains something of a terror and a paralysis to methough i am getting to brave it and to like it as the sense of adventure of holiday and romance and above all of the great so visible and observable world that stretches before one more and more comes through and makes the tone of ones days and the counterpoise of ones homesickness i am at the back of my head and at the bottom of my heart transcendently homesick and with a sustaining private reference all the while at every moment verily to the fact that i have a tight anchorage a definite little downward burrow in the ancient worlda secret consciousness that i chink in my pocket as if it were a fortune in a handful of silver but with this i have a most charming and interesting time and am seeing feeling how agreeable it is in the maturity of age to revisit the long neglected and long unseen land of ones birthespecially when that land affects one as such a living and breathing and feeling and moving great monster as this one is it is all very interesting and quite unexpectedly and almost uncannily delightful and sympatheticpartly or largely from my intense impression all this glorious golden autumn with weather like tinkling crystal and colours like molten jewels of the sweetness of the country itself this new england rural vastness which is all that ive seen ive been only in the countryshamelessly visiting and almost only old friends and scattered relationsbut have found it far more beautiful and amiable than i had ever dreamed or than i ventured to remember i had seen too little in fact of old to have anything to speak of to rememberso that seeing so many charming things for the first time i quite thrill with the romance of elderly and belated discovery of boston i havent even had a full dayof ny but three hours and i have seen nothing whatever thank heaven of the littery world i have spent a few days at cambridge mass with my brother and have been greatly struck with the way that in the last 25 years harvard has come to mass so much larger and to have gathered about her such a swarm of distinguished specialists and such a big organization of learning this impression is increased this year by the crowd of foreign experts of sorts mainly philosophic etc who have been at the st louis congress and who appear to be turning up overwhelmingly under my brothers roofbut who will have vanished i hope when i go to spend the month of november with himwhen i shall see something of the goodly boston the blot on my vision and the shadow on my path is that i have contracted to write a book of noteswithout which contraction i simply couldnt have come and that the conditions of life time space movement etc really to see to get ones material are such as to threaten utterly to frustrate for me any prospect of simultaneous workwhich is the rock on which i may split altogetherwherefore my alarm is great and my project much disconcerted for i have as yet scarce dipped into the great basin at all only a large measure of time can help meto do anything as decent as i want wherefore pray for me constantly and all the more that if i can only arrive at a means of application for i see already from here my tone i shall do verily a lovely book i am interested up to my eyesat least i think i am but you will fear at this rate that i am trying the book on you already i may have to return to england only as a saturated sponge and wring myself out there i hope meanwhile that your own saturations and mrs nellys prosper and that the pyrenean in particular continued rich and ample if you are having the easy part of your year now i hope you are finding in it the lordliest or rather the unlordliest leisure i commend you all to felicity and am my dear gosse yours always   henry james      to w e norris    boston  dec 15 1904    my dear norris   there is nothing to which i find my situation in this great country less favourable than to this order of communication yet i greatly wish 1st to thank you for your beautiful letter of as long ago as sept 12th from malvern and 2nd not to fail of having some decent word of greeting on your table for xmas morning the conditions of time and space at this distance are such as to make nice calculations difficult and i shall probably be frustrated of the felicity of dropping on you by exactly the right post but i send you my affectionate blessing and i aspire at the most to lurk modestly in the heap you were in exile very elegant exile i rather judge when you last wrote but you will now i take it be breathing again bland torquay bland not blonda process having to my fancy a certain analogy and consonance with that of quaffing bland tokay this is neither tokay nor torquaythis slightly arduous process or adventure of mine though very nearly as expensive on the whole as both of those luxuries combined i am just now amusing myself with bringing the expense up to the point of ruin by having come back to boston after an escape temporary to new york to conclude a terrible episode with the dentistwhich is turning out an abyss of torture and tedium i am promised and shall probably enjoy prodigious results from itbut the experience the whole business has been so fundamental and complicated that anguish and dismay only attend it while it goes onembellished at the most by an opportunity to admire the miracles of american expertness these are truly a revelation and my tormentor a great artist but he will have made a cruelly deep dark hole in my time very precious for me here and in my pocketthe latter of such a nature that i fear no patching of all my pockets to come will ever stop the leak but meanwhile it has all made me feel quite domesticated consciously assimilated to the system i am losing the precious sense that everything is strange which i began by hugging close and it is only when i know i am quite whiningly homesick en dessous for lh and pall mall that i remember i am but a creature of the surface the surface however has its points new york is appalling fantastically charmless and elaborately dire but boston has quality and convenience and now that one sees american life in the longer piece one profits by many of its ingenuities the winter as yet is radiant and belllike in its frosty clearness the diffusion of warmth indoors is a signal comfort extraordinarily comfortable in the travelling by dayi dont go in for nights and a marvel the perfect organisation of the universal telephone with interviews and contacts that begin in 2 minutes and settle all things in them a marvel i call it for a person who hates notewriting as i dobut an exquisite curse when it isnt an exquisite blessing i expect to be free to return to ny the formidable in a few dayswhere i shall inevitably have to stay another month after which i hope for sweeter thingswashington which is amusing and the south and eventually californiawith probably mexico but many things are indefiniteonly i shall probably stay till the end of june i suppose i am much interestedfor the time passes inordinately fast also the country is unlike any otherto ones sensation of it those of europe from state to state seem to me less different from each other than they are all different from thisor rather this from them but forgive a fatigued and obscure scrawl i am really done and demoralized with my interminable surgical for it comes to that ordeal yet i wish you heartily all peace and plenty and am yours my dear norris very constantly   henry james      to edmund gosse    the breakers hotel palm beach florida  february 16th 1905    my dear gosse   i seem to myself to be under the disadvantage of this extraordinary process of seeing my native country perpetually writing letters and yet i blush with the consciousness of not having yet got round to you againsince the arrival of your so genial new years greeting i have been lately in constant or at least in very frequent motion on this large comprehensive scale and the right hours of recueillement and meditation of private communication in short are very hard to seize and when one does seize them as you know one is almost crushed by the sense of accumulated and congested matter so i wont attempt to remount the stream of time save the most sketchily in the world it was from lenox mass i think in the faraway prehistoric autumn that i last wrote you i reverted thence to boston or rather mainly to my brothers kindly roof at cambridge hard bywhere alas my five or six weeks were harrowed and ravaged by an appalling experience of american transcendent dentistrya deep dark abyss a trap of anguish and expense into which i sank unwarily though i now begin to see to my great profit in the short human hereafter of which i have not yet touched the fin fond i mention it as accounting for treasures of wrecked timei could do nothing else whatever in the state into which i was put while the long ordeal went on and this has left me belated as to everythingwork correspondence impressions progress through the land but i was temporarily liberated at last and fled to new york where i passed three or four appalled midwinter weeks dec and early jan appalled mainly i mean by the ferocious discomfort this season of unprecedented snow and ice puts on in that altogether unspeakable cityfrom which i fled in turn to philadelphia and washington i am going back to ny for three or four weeks of developed springi havent yet in a manner seen it or cowardly done it things and places southward have been more manageablesave that i lately spent a week of all but polar rigour at the highperched biltmore in north carolina the extraordinary colossal french château of george vanderbilt in the said nc mountainsthe house 2500 feet in air and a thing of the high rothschild manner but of a size to contain two or three mentmores and waddesdons philadelphia and washington would yield me a wild range of anecdote for you were we face to facewill yield it me then but i can only glance and passglance at the extraordinary and rather personallyfascinating presidentwho was kind to me as was dear j hay even more and wondrous blooming aspiring little jusserand all pleasant welcome and hospitality but i liked poor dear queer flat comfortable philadelphia almost ridiculously for what it isextraordinarily cossu and materially civilized and saw there a good deal of your friendas i think she isagnes repplier whom i liked for her bravery and almost brilliancy youll be glad to hear that she is extraordinarily better up to now these two years of the malady by which her future appeared so compromised however i am tracing my progress on a scale and the hours melt awayand my letter mustnt grow out of my control i have worked down here yearningly and for all too short a staybut ten days in all but florida at this southernmost tip or almost does beguile and gratify megiving me my first and last evidently sense of the tropics or à peu près the subtropics and revealing to me a blandness in nature of which i had no idea this is an amazing winterresortthe welltodo in their tens their hundreds of thousands from all over the land the property of a single enlightened despot the creator of two monster hotels the extraordinary agrément of which i mean of course the high pitch of mere monsterhotel amenity marks for me how the rate at which the way in which things are done over here changes and changes when i remember the hotels of twentyfive years ago even it will give me brilliant chapters on hotelcivilization alas however with perpetual movement and perpetual people and very few concrete objects of nature or art to make use of for assimilation my brilliant chapters dont get themselves writtenso little can they be notes of the current picturesquelike ones european notes they can only be notes on a social order of vast extent and i see with a kind of despair that i shall be able to do here little more than get my saturation soak my intellectual spongereserving the squeezingout for the subsequent ah the so yearnedfor peace of lamb house its all interesting but it isnt thrillingthough i gather everything is more really curious and vivid in the westto which and california and to mexico if i can i presently proceed cuba lies off here at but twelve hours of steamerand i am heartbroken at not having time for a snuff of that flamboyant flower   saint augustine feb 18th  i had to break off day before yesterday and i have completed meanwhile by having come thus far north my sad sacrifice of an intenser exoticism i am stopping for two or three days at the oldest city in americatwo or three being none too much to sit in wonderment at the success with which it has outlived its age the paucity of the signs of the same has perhaps almost the pathos the signs themselves would have if there were any there is rather a big and melancholy and toned with a patina old spanish fort of the 16th century but horrible little modernisms surround it on the other hand this huge modern hotel ponce de leon is in the style of the alhambra and the principal church presbyterian in that of the mosque of cordova so there are compensationsand a tiny old spanish cathedral front earliest church built in americalate 16th century which appeals with a yellow ancientry but i must pull offsimply sticking in a mementoa of a public development on my desperate part which i have no time to explain this refers to a past exploit but the leap is taken is being renewed i repeat the horrid act at chicago indianapolis st louis san francisco and later on in new yorkhave already done so at philadelphia always to private literary or ladies clubsat philadelphia to a vast multitude with miss repplier as brilliant introducer at bryn mawr to 700 personsby way of a little circle in fine i have waked up conférencier and find to my stupefaction that i can do it the fee is large of courseotherwise indianapolis offers £100 for 50 minutes it pays in short travelling expenses and the incidental circumstances and phenomena are full of illustration i cant do it oftenbut for £30 a time i should easily be able to only that would be death if i could come back here to abide i think i should really be able to abide in relative affluence one can on the spot make so much more moneyor at least i might but i would rather live a beggar at lamb houseand its to that i shall return let my biographer however recall the solid sacrifice i shall have made i have just read over your new years eve letter and it makes me so homesick that the bribe itself will largely seem to have been on the side of the reversionthe bribe to ones finest sensibility i have published a novelthe golden bowlhere in two vols in advance 15 weeks ago of the english issueand the latter will be i dont even know if its out yet in london in so comparatively mean and fineprinted a london form that i have no heart to direct a few gift copies to be addressed i shall convey to you somehow the handsome new york pagedont read it till then the thing has done much less ill here than anything i have ever produced  but goodnight verilywith all love to all and to mrs nelly in particular   yours always henry james

dearest old friend   i am leaving this subtropical floridian spot from one half hour to another but the horror of not having for so long despatched a word to you the shame and grief and contrition of it are so strong within me that i simply seize the passing moment by the hair of its head and glare at it till it pauses long enough to let meas it wereembrace you yet i feel have felt all along that you will have understood and that words are wasted in explaining the obvious letters all these weeks and weeks day to day and hour to hour letters have fluttered about me in a dense crowd even as the san marco pigeons in venice round him who appears to have corn to scatter so the whole queer time has gone in my scattering cornscattering and chattering and being chattered and scattered to and moving from place to place and surrendering to people the only thing to do heresince things apart from people are nil in staying with them literally from place to place and week to week though with old friends as it were alonethat is mostly thank godto avoid new obligations doing that as the only solution of the problem of seeing the country i am seeing very wellbut the weariness of so much of so prolonged and sustained a process is at times surpassing it would be a strain a weariness kept up so anywhere and it is extraordinarily tiresome on occasions here vastness of space and distance of number and quantity is the element in which one lives it is a great complication alone to be dealing with a country that has fifty principal citieseach a law unto itselfand unto you england poor old dear having to speak of but one on the other hand it is distinctly interestingthe business and the country as a whole there are no exquisite moments save a few of a funniness that comes to that but there are none from which one doesnt get somethingand meanwhile i am lecturing a little to pay the piper as i gofor high fees of course and as yet but three or four times but they give me gladly £50 for 50 minutes a pound a minutelike pattiand always for the same lecture as yet the lesson of balzac i do it beautifullyfeel as if i had discovered my vocationat any rate amaze myself it is wellfor without it i dont see how i could have held out  this winter has been a hideous succession of huge snowblizzards blinding polar waves and these southernmost places even are not their usual soft selves yet the very south tiptoe of florida from which i came three days ago has an air as of molten liquid velvet and the palm and the orange the pineapple the scarlet hibiscus the vast magnolia and the sapphire sea make it a vision of very considerable beguilement i wanted to put over to cubabut one night from this coast but it was for reasons not to be donereasons of time and money i shall try for mexicoand meanwhile pray for me hard my visit is doinghas donemy little reputation here save the mark great good the golden bowl is in its fourth editionunprecedented you see i answer your last newses and things not at allnot even the note of anxiety about t such are these cruelties these ferocities of separation but i drink in everything you tell me and i cherish you all always and am yours and the childrens twain ever so constantly   henry james      to edward warren    university club chicago  march 19th 1905    dearest edward   this is but a mere breathless blessing hurled at you as it were between trains and in ever so grateful joy in your brave double letter of the lame hand hero that you are which has just overtaken me here im not pretending to writei cant its impossible amid the movement and obsession and complication of all this overwhelming muchness of space and distance and time consumed and above all of people consuming i start in a few hours straight for californiaenter my train this monday night 730 and reach los angeles and pasadena at 230 thursday afternoon the train has i believe barbers shops bathrooms stenographers and typists so that if i can add a postscript without too much joggle i will but you will say here is joggle enough for alack i am already after 17 days of the great middle west rather spent and weary weary of motion and chatter and oh of such an unimagined dreariness of ugliness on many on most sides and of the perpetual effort of trying to do justice to what one doesnt like if one could only damn it and have done with it so much of it is rank with good intentions and then the kindnessthe princely as it were hospitality of these clubs besides the sense of power huge and augmenting power vast mechanical industrial social financial everywhere this chicago is huge infinite of potential size and form and even of actual black smoky oldlooking very like some preternaturally boomed manchester or glasgow lying beside a colossal lake michigan of hard pale green jade and putting forth railway antennae of maddening complexity and gigantic length yet this club which looks old and sober too is an abode of peace a benediction to me in the looming largeness i live here and they put one up always everywhere with ones so excellent room with perfect bathroom and wc of its own appurtenant the universal joy of this country in private houses or wherever a feature that is really almost a consolation for many things i have been to the south the far end of florida cbut prefer the far end of sussex in the heart of golden orangegroves i yearned for the shade of the old lh mulberry tree so you see i am loyal and i sail for liverpool on july 4th i go up the whole pacific coast to vancouver and return to new york am due there april 26th by the canadianpacific railway said to be in its first half sublime but i scribble beyond my time your letters are really a blessed breath of brave old britain but oh for a talk in a westminster panelled parlour or a walk on farshining camber sands all love to margaret and the younglings i have again written to jonathanhe will have more news of me for you yours dearest edward almost in nostalgic rage and at any rate in constant affection   henry james      to mrs william james    hotel del coronado coronado beach california  wednesday night april 5th 1905    dearest alice   i must write you again before i leave this place which i do tomorrow noon if only to still a little the unrest of my having condemned myself all too awkwardly to be so long without hearing from you i havent all this whilethat is these several dayshad the letters which i am believing you will have forwarded to monterey sent down to me here this i have abstained from mainly because having stopped over here these eight or nine days to write in extreme urgency an article and wishing to finish it at any price i have felt that i should go to pieces as an author if a mass of arrears of postal matter should come tumbling in upon meand particularly if any of it should be troublous however i devoutly hope none of it has been troublousand i have done my best to let you know in any need of wiring etc where i have been also the letterless state has added itself to the deliciously simplified social state to make me taste the charming sweetness and comfort of this spot california on these terms when all is said southern c at leastwhich however the real c i believe much repudiates has completely bowled me oversuch a delicious difference from the rest of the us do i find in it i speak of course all of nature and climate fruits and flowers for there is absolutely nothing else and the sense of the shining social and human inane is utter the days have been mostly here of heavenly beauty and the flowers the wild flowers just now in particular which fairly rage with radiance over the land are worthy of some purer planet than this i live on oranges and olives fresh from the tree and i lie awake nights to listen on purpose to the languid list of the pacific which my windows overhang i wish poor heroic harry could be herethe thought of whose privations while i wallow unworthy makes me tell him with all my love miserably sick and poisons much of my profit i go back to los angeles tomorrow to as i wrote you last reutter my now loathly lecture to a female culture club of 900 members whom i make pay me through the nose and on saturday pm 8th i shall be at monterey hotel del monte but my stay there is now condemned to bitterest brevity and my margin of time for all the rest of this job is so rapidly shrinking that i see myself brûlant mes étapes alas without exception and cutting down my famous visit to seattle to a couple of days it breaks my heart to have so stinted myself herebut it was inevitable and no one had given me the least inkling that i should find california so sympathetic it is strange and inconvenient how little impression of anything any one ever takes the trouble to give one beforehand i should like to stay here all april and may but i am writing more than my time permitsmy article is still to finish i ask you no questionsyou will have told me everything i live in the hope that the news from wm will have been good at least at monterey may there be some but good nightwith great and distributed tenderness yours dearest alice always and ever   henry james      to william james   dictated   95 irving street cambridge mass  july 2nd 1905    dearest w   i am ticking this out at you for reasons of convenience that will be even greater for yourself i think than for me your good letter of farewell reached me at lenox from which i returned but last eveningto learn however from a every circumstance of your departure and of your condition as known up to date the grim grey chicago will now be your daily medium but will put forth for you i trust every such flower of amenity as it is capable of growing may you not regret at any point having gone so far to meet its queer appetites alice tells me that you are to go almost straight thence though with a little interval here as i sympathetically understand to the adirondacks where i hope for you as big a bath of impersonal nature as possible with the tub as little tainted that is by the soapsuds of personal in other words all the board you need but no boarders i seem greatly to mislike not to say deeply to mistrust the adirondack boarderi greatly enjoyed the whole lenox countryside seeing it as i did by the aid of the whartons big strong commodious new motor which has fairly converted me to the sense of all the thing may do for one and one may get from it the potent way it deals with a country large enough for it not to rudoyer but to rope in in big free hauls a huge netful of impressions at oncethis came home to me beautifully convincing me that if i were rich i shouldnt hesitate to take up with it a great transformer of life and of the future all that country charmed me we spent the night at ashfield and motored back the next day after a morning there by an easy circuit of 80 miles between luncheon and a late dinner a circuit easily and comfortably prolonged for the sake of good roadsbut i mustnt rattle on i have still innumerable last things to do but the portents are all propitiousabsit any ill consequence of this fatuity i am living at alices instance mainly on huge watermelon dug out in spadefuls yet light to carry but good bye now your last hints for the speech are much to the point and i will try even thus late to stick them in may every comfort attend you   ever yours henry james      to miss margaret james        the project of a book on london was never carried further though      certain pages of the autobiographical fragment the middle years      written in 191415 no doubt shew the kind of line it would have      taken     lamb house rye  november 3rd 1905    dearest peg   in writing to your father which however i shall not be able to do by this same post i will tell him a little better what has been happening to me and why i have been so unsociable this unsociability is in truth all that has been happeningas it has been the reverse of the medal so to speak of the great arrears and urgent applications to work that awaited me here after i parted with you i have been working in one way and another with great assiduity squeezing out my american book with all desirable deliberation and yet in a kind of panting dread of the matter of it all melting and fading from me before i have worked it off it does melt and fade over here in the strangest wayand yet i did i think while with you so successfully cultivate the impression and the saturation that even my bare residuum wont be quite a vain thing i really find in fact that i have more impressions than i know what to do with so that evidently at the rate i am going i shall have pegged out two distinct volumes instead of one i have already produced almost the substance of onewhich i have been sending to harper and the nar as per contract though publication doesnt begin apparently in those periodicals till next month and then please mention to your dad all the time i havent been doing the american book i have been revising with extreme minuteness three or four of my early works for the edition définitive the settlement of some of the details of which seems to be hanging fire a little between my agent and my new york publishers not however in a manner to indicate i think a real hitch please however say nothing whatever any of you to any one about the existence of any such plan these things should be spoken of only when they are in full feather that for your dadi mean the information as well as the warning in particular on whom you see i am shamelessly working off after all a good deal of my letter mention to him also that still other tracts of my time these last silent weeks have gone have had to go toward preparing for a job that i think i mentioned to him while with youmy pledge already a couple of years old to do a romanticalpsychologicalpictorial social london of the general form length pitch and type of marion crawfords ave roma immortalis for the macmillans and i have been feeling so nervous of late about the way america has crowded me off it that i have had for assuagement of my nerves to begin with piety and prayer some of the very considerable reading the task will require of me all this to show you that i havent been wantonly uncommunicative but goodnight dear peg i am going to do another for aleck with copious embraces   henry james      to h g wells    lamb house rye  november 19th 1905    my dear wells   if i take up time and space with telling you why i have not sooner written to thank you for your magnificent bounty i shall have properly to steal it from my letter my letter itself a much more important matter and yet i must say in three words that my course has been inevitable and natural i found your first munificence here on returning from upwards of 11 months in america toward the end of julyreturning to the mountain of arrears produced by almost a years absence and superficially thereby a years idleness i recognized even from afar i had already done so that the utopia was a book i should desire to read only in the right conditions of coming to it coming with luxurious freedom of mind rapt surrender of attention adequate honours for it of every sort so not bolting it like the morning paper and sundry many other vulgarly importunate things and knowing moreover i had already shown you that though i was slow i was safe and even certain i came to it only a short time since and surrendered myself to it absolutely and it was while i was at the bottom of the crystal well that kipps suddenly appeared thrusting his honest and inimitable head over the edge and calling down to me with his note of wondrous truth that he had business with me above i took my time however there below though below be a most improper figure for your sublime and vertiginous heights and achieved a complete saturation after which reascending and making out things again little by little in the dingy air of the actual i found kipps in his place awaiting meand from his so different but still so utterly coercive embrace i have just emerged it was really very well he was there for i found and its even a little strange that i could read you onlyafter youand dont at all see whom else i could have read but now that this is so i dont see either my dear wells how i can write you about these thingsthey make me want so infernally to talk with you to see you at length let me tell you however simply that they have left me prostrate with admiration and that you are for me more than ever the most interesting literary man of your generationin fact the only interesting one these things do you to my sense the highest honour and i am lost in amazement at the diversity of your genius as in everything you do and especially in these three last social imaginations it is the quality of your intellect that primarily in the utopia obsesses me and reduces meto that degree that even the colossal dimensions of your cheek pardon the term that i dont in the least invidiously apply fails to break the spell indeed your cheek is positively the very sign and stamp of your genius valuable today as you possess it beyond any other instrument or vehicle so that when i say it doesnt break the charm i probably mean that it largely constitutes it or constitutes the force which is the force of an irony that no one else among us begins to haveso that we are starving in our enormities and fatuities for a sacred satirist the satirist with ironyas poor dear old thackeray was the satirist without it and you come admirably to save us there are too many things to saywhich is so exactly why i cant write cheeky cheeky cheeky is any youngmanatsandgates offered plan for the life of manbut so far from thinking that a disqualification of your book i think it is positively what makes the performance heroic i hold with you that it is only by our each contributing utopias the cheekier the better that anything will come and i think there is nothing in the book truer and happier than your speaking of this struggle of the rare yearning individual toward that suggestion as one of the certain assistances of the future meantime you set a magnificent exampleof caring of feeling of seeing above all and of suffering from and with the shockingly sick actuality of things your epilogue tag in italics strikes me as of the highest of an irresistible and touching beauty bravo bravo my dear wells  and now coming to kipps what am i to say about kipps but that i am ready that i am compelled utterly to drivel about him he is not so much a masterpiece as a mere born gemyou having i know not how taken a header straight down into mysterious depths of observation and knowledge i know not which and where and come up again with this rounded pearl of the diver but of course you know yourself how immitigably the thing is doneit is of such a brilliancy of true truth i really think that you have done at this time of day two particular things for the first time of their doing among us 1 you have written the first closely and intimately the first intelligently and consistently ironic or satiric novel in everything else there has always been the sentimental or conventional interference the interference of which thackeray is full 2 you have for the very first time treated the english lower middle class etc without the picturesque the grotesque the fantastic and romantic interference of which dickens eg is so misleadingly of which even george eliot is so deviatingly full you have handled its vulgarity in so scientific and historic a spirit and seen the whole thing all in its own strong light and then the book has throughout such extraordinary life everyone in it without exception and every piece and part of it is so vivid and sharp and raw kipps himself is a diamond of the first water from start to finish exquisite and radiant coote is consummate chitterlow magnificent the whole first evening with chitterlow perhaps the most brilliant thing in the bookunless that glory be reserved for the way the entire matter of the shop is done including the admirable image of the boss it all in fine from cover to cover does you the greatest honour and if we had any other than skindeep criticism very stupid too at that it would have immense recognition  i repeat that these things have made me want greatly to see you is it thinkable to you that you might come over at this ungenial season for a nightsome time before xmas could you would you i should immensely rejoice in it i am here till jan 31stwhen i go up to london for three months i go away probably for four or five days at xmasand i go away for next saturdaytuesday but apart from those dates i would await you with rapture  and let me say just one word of attenuation of my only apparent meanness over the golden bowl i was in america when that work appeared and it was published there in 2 vols and in very charming and readable form each vol but moderately thick and with a legible handsome largetyped page but there came over to me a copy of the london issue fat vile smalltyped horrific prohibitive that so broke my heart that i vowed i wouldnt for very shame disseminate it and i havent with that feeling had a copy in the house or sent one to a single friend i wish i had an american one at your dispositionbut i have been again and again depleted of all ownership in respect to it you are very welcome to the british brick if you at this late day will have it  i greet mrs wells and the third party very cordially and am yours my dear wells more than ever   henry james      to william james    lamb house rye  november 23rd 1905    dearest william   i wrote not many days since to aleck and not very very many before to peggybut i cant tonight hideously further postpone acknowledging your so liberal letter of oct 22nd the one in which you enclosed me alecks sweet one albeit i have been in the house all day without an outing and very continuously writing and it is now 11 pm and i am rather fagged however i shall write to alice for informationall the more that i deeply owe that dear eternal heroine a letter i am not satisfied about her please tell her with my tender love and should have testified to this otherwise than by my long cold silence if only i hadnt been for stress of composition putting myself on very limited contribution to the post the worst of these bad manners are now over and please tell alice that my very next letter shall be to her only she mustnt put pen to paper for me not so much as dream of it before she hears from me i take a deep and rich and brooding comfort in the thought of how splendidly you are all turning out all the whileespecially harry and bill and especially peg and above all aleckin addition to alice and you i turn you over in my spiritual pocket collectively and individually and make you chink and rattle and ring getting from you the sense of a great though toomuch for my use tiedup fortune i have great joy tell him with my love of the news of bills so superior work and yearn to have some sort of a squint at it tell him at any rate how i await him for his holidays out hereon this spotand i wish i realized more richly harrys present conditions i await him here not less  i mean in response to what you write me of your having read the golden b to try to produce some uncanny form of thing in fiction that will gratify you as brotherbut let me say dear william that i shall greatly be humiliated if you do like it and thereby lump it in your affection with things of the current age that i have heard you express admiration for and that i would sooner descend to a dishonoured grave than have written still i will write you your book on that twoandtwomakefour system on which all the awful truck that surrounds us is produced and then descend to my dishonoured gravetaking up the art of the slate pencil instead of longer the art of the brush vide my lecture on balzac but it is seriously too late at night and i am too tired for me to express myself on this questionbeyond saying that im always sorry when i hear of your reading anything of mine and always hope you wontyou seem to me so constitutionally unable to enjoy it and so condemned to look at it from a point of view remotely alien to mine in writing it and to the conditions out of which as mine it has inevitably sprungso that all the intentions that have been its main reason for being with me appear never to have reached you at alland you appear even to assume that the life the elements forming its subjectmatter deviate from felicity in not having an impossible analogy with the life of cambridge i see nowhere about me done or dreamed of the things that alone for me constitute the interest of the doing of the noveland yet it is in a sacrifice of them on their very own ground that the thing you suggest to me evidently consists it shows how far apart and to what different ends we have had to work out very naturally and properly our respective intellectual lives and yet i can read you with rapturehaving three weeks ago spent three or four days with manton marble at brighton and found in his hands ever so many of your recent papers and discourses which having margin of mornings in my room through both breakfasting and lunching there by the habit of the house i found time to read several ofwith the effect of asking you earnestly to address me some of those that i so often in irving st saw you address to others who were not your brother i had no time to read them there philosophically in short i am with you almost completely and you ought to take account of this and get me over altogetherthere are two books by the way one fictive that i permit you to raffoler about as much as you like for i have been doing so myselfh g wellss utopia and his kipps the utopia seems to me even more remarkable for other things than for his characteristic cheek and kipps is quite magnificent read them both if you haventcertainly read kippstheres also another subject im too full of not to mention the good thing ive done for myselfthat is for lamb house and my gardenby moving the greenhouse away from the high old wall near the house into the back garden setting it up betteragainst the street wall and thereby throwing the liberated space into the front garden to its immense apparent extension and beautification   but oh fondly goodnight  ever your henry      to w e norris    lamb house rye  december 23rd 1905    my dear norris   it is my desire that this which i shall post here tomorrow shall be a tiny item in the hecatomb of friendship gracing your breakfast table on christmas morning and mingling the smoke of certain aged and infirm victims with the finer and fresher fumes of the board but the aged and infirm propose and the postman disposes and i can only hope i shall not be either disconcertingly previous or ineffectively subsequent if my minds eye loses you at sweet yet sublime underbank i still see you in a devonshire mild light and feel your torquay window letting in your torquay airwhich at this distance in this sadly southeasternized corner suggests all sorts of enviable balm and beatitude it was a real pang to me some weeks ago when you were coming up to town to have to put behind me with so ungracious and uncompromising a gesture the question and the great temptation of being there for a little at the same moment but there are hours and seasonsand i know the face of them wellwhen my need to mind my business here and to mind nothing else becomes absolutelondon tending rather overmuch moreover to set frequent and freshlybaited traps at all times for a still too susceptible and guileless old country mouse all my consciousness centres necessarily just now on a single small problem that of managing to do an american book or rather a couple of them that i had supposed myself in advance capable of doing on the spot but that i had there in fact utterly to forsweartime energy opportunity to write every possibility quite failing mewith the consequence of my material my documents over here quite failing me too and there being nothing left for me but to run a race with an illusion the illusion of still seeing it which is as it recedes so to speak a thousand lengths ahead of me i shall keep it up as a tour de force and produce my copy somehow i have indeed practically done one vol of impressionsthere are to be two separate and differentlytitled but i am unable meanwhile to dally by the waythe sweet wayside of pall mallor to turn either to the right or the left my subjectunless i grip it tightmelts awayrye sussex is so little like it and then where am i and yet the thing interests me to do though at the same time appalling me by its difficulty but i didnt mean to tell you this long story about it i hope you are plashing yourself in more pellucid watersand i find i assume that there is in every way a great increase of the pellucid in your case by the fact of the neighbouring presence of your as i again and i trust not fallaciously assume sympathetic collaterals i should greatly like here a collateral or two myselfto find the advantage across the sea of the handful of those of mine who are sympathetic makes me miss them or the possibility of them in this country of my adoption which is more than kind but less than kin i spend the month of january further in this placethen i do seek the metropolis for 12 or 14 weeks i expect to hear from you that you have carried off some cup or other sculling for preference in your bank holiday sportsso for heavens sake dont disappoint me youre my one link with the athletic world and i like to be able to talk about you therefore àpropos of cups all power to your elbow i know none nowno cupbut the uninspiring cocoawhich i carry with a more and more doddering hand but i am still my dear norris very lustily and constantly yours   henry james      to paul harvey    lamb house rye  march 11 1906    my dear paul   it is delightful to me please believe not wholly to lose touch of youghostly and ineffective indeed as that touch seems destined to feel itself i find myself almost wishing that the whirligig of time had brought round the day of your inscription with many honours on some comfortable retired list which might keep you a little less on the dim confines of the empire and make you thereby more accessible and conversible only i reflect that by the time the grey purgatory of south kensington or wherever crowns and pensions your bright career i alas shall have been whirled away to a sphere compared to which salonica and even furthest ind are easy and familiar resorts with no crown at all most probablynot even heavenly and no communication with you save by tableraps and telepathists like a really startling communication i have just had fromor througha medium in america near boston a message purporting to come from my mother who died 25 years ago and from whom it ostensibly proceeded during a séance at which my sisterinlaw with two or three other persons was present the point is that the message is an allusion to a matter known so personal is it to myself to no other individual in the world but menot possibly either to the medium or to my sisterinlaw and an allusion so pertinent and initiated and tender and helpful and yet so unhelped by any actual earthly knowledge on any ones part that it quite astounds as well as deeply touches me if the subject of the message had been conceivably in my sisterinlaws mind it would have been an interesting but not infrequent case of telepathy but as i say it couldnt thinkably have been and she only transmits it to me after the fact not even fully understanding it so i repeat i am astoundedand almost equally astounded at my having drifted into this importunate mention of it to you but the letter retailing it arrived only this am and i have been rather full of iti had heard of your present whereabouts from edward childe  and i give you my word of honour that my great thought was already before your own good words had come to attest to you on my own side and pen in hand my inextinguishable interest in you i came back from the us after an absence of nearly a year 11 months by last midsummer whereupon my joy at returning to this so little american nook took the form of my having stuck here fast with great arrears of sedentary occupation c till almost the other day  i found my native land after so many years interesting formidable fearsome and fatiguing and much more difficult to see and deal with in any extended and various way than i had supposed i was able to do with it far less than i had hoped in the way of visitationi found many of the conditions too deterrent but i did what i could went to the far south the middle west california the whole pacific coast c and spent some time in the eastern cities it is an extraordinary world an altogether huge proposition as they say there giving one i think an immense impression of material and political power but almost cruelly charmless in effect and calculated to make one crouch ever afterwards as cravenly as possible at lamb house ryeif one happens to have a poor little lh r to crouch in this i am accordingly doing very hardwith intervals of london inserted a good deal at this seasoni go up again in a few days to stay till about may so i am not making history my dear paul as you are i am at least only making my very limited and intimate own vous avez beau dire you and mrs paul and miss paul are making that of europethough you dont appear to realize it any more than m jourdain did that he was talking prose have patience meanwhileyou will have plenty of south kensington later on among other retired proconsuls and where miss paul will come out and meanwhile you are from the lh point of view a family of thrilling romance and it must be interesting to améliorer le sort des populationsand to see real live turbaned turks going about you and above all to have even in the sea a house from which you look at divine olympus you live with the gods if not like themand out of all this unutterable anglosaxon banalityso extrabanalized by the extinction of dear arthur balfour i take great joy in the prospect of really getting hold of you all three next summer i count fondly on your presence here and i send the very kindest greeting and blessing to your two companions the elder is of course still very young but how old the younger must now be  yours my dear paul always and ever   henry james      to william james        professor and mrs william james had been in california at this      time of the great san francisco earthquake and conflagration they      fortunately escaped uninjured but for some days h j had been in      deep anxiety not knowing their exact whereabouts     reform club pall mall sw  may 4th 1906    beloved ones   i wrote you feverishly last saturday but now comes in a blest cable from harry telling of your being as far on your way home as at denver and communicating thence in inspired accents and form and this for which i have been yearning the news of your having to that extent shaken off the dust of your ruin fills me with such joy that i scrawl you these still agitated words of jubilationthough i cant seem to you less than incoherent and beside the mark i fear till i have got your letter from stanford which harry has already announced his expedition of on the 28th this must come in a day or two more meanwhile there was three days ago an excellent letter in the times from stanford itself or pa enabling me for the first time to conceive a little and a trifle less luridly to imagine the facts of your case i had at first believed those facts to be that you were thrown bedless and roofless upon the world semiclad and semistarving and with all that class of phenomena about you but how do i know after all even yet and i await your light with an anxiety that still endures i have just parted with bill who dined with me and who is to lunch with me tomorrowi going in the evening to the academy dinner i have since the arrival of harrys telegram or cable of reassurancethe second to that effect not this of today which makes the third and besti have been as i say trying under pressure a three days motor trip with the whartons much frustrated by bad weather and from which i impatiently and prematurely and gleefully returned today so that i have been separated from b for 48 hours but i tell you of him rather than talk to you in the air of your own weird experiences he is to go on to paris on the 6th having waited over here to go to the private view of the academy to see me again and to make use of sunday 6th a dies non in paris as here for his journey it has been delightful to me to have him near me and he has spent and respent long hours at the national gallery from which he derives as also from the wallace collection great stimulus and profit i am extremely struck with his seriousness of spirit and intentionhe seems to me all in the thing he wants to do and awfully intelligent about it so that in fine he seems to me to bring to his design quite an exceptional quality and kind of intensity what a familywith the gallantries of the pair of you thrown in well you beloved alice have needed so exceedingly a change and i was preaching to you that you should arrive at one somehow or perishwhereby you have had it with a vengeance and i hope the effects will be appreciable that is not altogether accurst to you what i really now most feel the pang and the woe of is my not being there to hang upon the lips of your conjoined eloquence i really think i must go over to you again for a monthjust to listen to you but i wait and am ever more and more fondly your   henry      to william james    the athenaeum pall mall sw  may 11th 1906    dearest william   today at last reach me an hour ago your blest letter to myself of april 19th and alices not less sublime one or a typecopy of the same addressed to irving st and forwarded by dear peg to whom all thanks  i have written to harry a good deal from the first and to your dear selves last week and you will know how wide open the mouth of my desire stands to learn from you everything and anything you can chuck into it most vivid and pathetic these so surprisingly lucid pictures dashed downor rather so calmly committed to paperby both of you in the very midst of the crash and what a hell of a time you must have had altogether what a noble act your taking your miss martin to the blazing and bursting san franciscoand what a devil of a day of anxiety it must have given to the sublime alice dearest sublime alice your details of feeding the hungry and sleeping in the backyard bring tears to my eyes i hope all the later experience didnt turn to worse dreariness and wearinessit was probably kept human and vivid by the whole associated elements of drama yet how differently i read it all from knowing you now restored to your liberal home and lovely broodwhere i hope you are guestreceiving and housekeeping as little as possible how your mother must have folded you in i kept thinking of her for days please tell her almost more than of you its hideous to want to condemn you to write on top of everything elseyet i sneakingly hope for more though indeed it wouldnt take much to make me sail straight homejust to talk with you for a week  i return to rye on the 16th with raptureafter too long a tangle of delays here however it is no more than the right moment for adequate charm of season drop unberufen of east wind etcbut why do i talk of these trifles when what i am after all really full of is the hope that they have been crowning you both with laurels and smothering you with flowers at cambridge also greedily for you with the hope that you didnt come away minus any lecturemoney due to you  but goodbye for nowwith ever so tender love   ever your henry      to miss margaret james    lamb house rye  november 8th 1906    dearest peggot   i have had before me but an hour or two your delightful though somewhat agitating letter of october 29th and i am so touched by your faithful memory of your poor fond old uncle and by your snatching an hour to devote to him even as a brand from the burning that i scribble you this joyous acknowledgment before i go to bed i have been immensely interested in your whole collegiate adventurefragments of the history of which so far as youve got ive had from your motherand all the more interested that by a blest good fortune i happen to know your scholastic shades and so am able in imagination to cling to you and follow you round i seem to make out that you are very physically comfortable all round and i have indeed a very charming image of bryn mawr though i dare say these months adorn it less than my junetime i yearn tenderly over your homesicknessand fear i dont help you with it when i tell you how well i understand it as at first your inevitable portion to exchange the realm of talk and taste of irving st and the privileges and luxury of your dads and your mothers company and genius for the common doings and sayings the common air and effluence of other american homes represents a sorry dropwhich can only be softened for you by the diversion of seeking out what charms of sorts these other homes may have had that irving st lacks you may not find any to speak of but meanwhile you will have wandered away and in so doing will have left the bloom of your nostalgia behind it doesnt remain acute but there will be always enough for you to go home with again and you will make your little sphere of relationswhich will give out an interest of their own and see a lot of life and realise a lot of types not to speak of all the enriching of your mind and augmentation of your power your poor old uncle groans with shame when he bethinks himself of the scant and miserable education and educative opportunity he had compared with his magnificent modern niece no one took any interest whatever in his development except to neglect or snub it where it might have helpedand any that he was ever to have he picked up wholly by himself but that is very ancient history nowand he is very glad to have picked up lamb house where he sits writing you this of a wet november night and communes so far as possible on the spot with the ghost of the little niece who came down from harrow to spend her holidays in so dull and patient and waverleynovelly a fashion with him i rejoice greatly in your sweet companioni mean in the sweetness of her as chum and comrade for you and i send i hope not presumptuously a slice of your uncles blessing also is it uplifting to hear that you find miss carey thomas benevolent and inspiringshe struck me as a very able and accomplished and intelligent lady and i should like to send her through you if you have a chance my very faithful remembrance and to thank her very kindly for her appreciation of my niece but i hope she doesnt or wont work you to the bone goodnight dear child   your fond old uncle      to mrs dewsmith        this refers to the revision of roderick hudson which was to head      the new york edition of his novels now definitely announced     lamb house rye  november 12th 1906    dear mrs dewsmith   very kind your note about the apples and about poor rh burgess noakes is to climb the hill in a day or two basket on arm and bring me back the rosy crop which i am finding quite the staff of life  as for the tidiedup book i am greatly touched by your generous interest in the question of the tidyingup and yet really think your view of that process erratic andquite of coursemy own view well inspired but we are really both right for to attempt to retouch the substance of the thing would be as foolish as it would be in a done and impenetrable structure impracticable what i have tried for is a mere revision of surface and expression as the thing is positively in many places quite vilely written the essence of the matter is wholly unalteredsave for seeming in places i think a little better brought out at any rate the deed is already perpetratedand i do continue to wish perversely and sorely that you had waitedto reperusefor this prettier and cleaner form however i ought only to be devoutly gratefulas in fact i amfor your power to reperuse at all and will come and thank you afresh as soon as you return to the fold as to which i beg you to make an early signal to yours most truly   henry james      to mrs wharton        the desired visit to george sands nohant was brought off in the      following year when h j motored there with mrs wharton rue      barbet de jouy is the address in paris of m paul bourget     reform club pall mall sw  november 17th 1906    dear mrs wharton   i had from you a shortish time since a very beautiful and interesting letterinto the ink to thank you for which my pen has been perpetually about to dip and now comes the further thrill of your quaint little picture card with its news of the paris winter and the romantic rue de varenne on which the pen straightway plunges into the fluid this is really charming and uplifting news and i applaud the free sweep of your line of life with all my heart we shall be almost neighbours and i will most assuredly hie me as promptly as possible across the scant interspace of the channel the pasdecalais c where the very first question on which i shall beset you will be your adventure and impression of nohantas to which i burn and yearn for fond particulars perhaps if you have the proper vehicle of passionas i make no doubtyou will be going there once morein which case do take me and such a suave and convenient crossing as i meanwhile wish youand such a provision of philosophy laid up in advance for use in and about rue barbet de jouy you will have finished your new fiction i presumeif it isnt presumptuousbefore embarking and i do so for the right of the desire to congratulate in that case and envy and sympathisebeing in all sorts of embarras now myself over the finish of many things i pant for the start of that work and languish to take it up i think i have had no chance to tell you how much i admired your single story in the aug scribnerbeautifully done i thought and full of felicities and achieved values and pictures all the same with the rue de varenne c dont go in too much for the french or the francoamerican subjectthe real field of your extension is hereit has far more fusability with our native and primary material between which and french elements there is i hold a disparity as complete as between a life led in trees say and a life led inseadepths or in other words between that of climbers and swimmersor crudely that of monkeys and fish is the play thing meanwhile climbing or swimmingi take much interest in its fate but you will tell me of these thingsin february it will be then i shall scramble over i go home an hour or two hence to stay as still as possible after a nightonlyspent in town the perpetual summonses and solicitations of london some of which have to be met are at times a maddening worryor almost i am wondering if you are not feeling just now perhaps a good deal at lenox in the apparently delightful old 1840 waya good snowstorm ending and the westinghouse colouring as i suppose a good deal blurred but how i want to have it allthe gossip of the countrysidefrom you some of it has come to me as rather dreadful  and that is what some of the lone houses in the deep valleys we motored through used to make me think of   i am meanwhile yours very constantly  henry james      to w e norris    16 lewes crescent brighton  december 23rd 1906    my dear norris   i think it was from here i wrote you last christmas by which i devoutly hope i dont give you a handle for saying and not from anywhere since then but i am but too aware that it has been at the best a hideous record of silence and apparent gloom and also fully feel that after such base laideurs of behaviour explanations attenuations protestations are as the mere rustle of the wind and had really better be left unuttered that only adds to the dark burden of ones consciousness when one does write one crawls into the dear outraged presence with all ones imperfections on ones head so ill indulge at any rate in no specific pleabut only in that general one of the fact that the letterwriting faculty within me has become extinct through increasing age infirmity embarrassment the spelling faculty even you see almost extinct and general demoralization and desolation twenty reproachful spectres rise up before meout of whom your fine sad face is only the most awful all i can say for myself and you is that among these feeble reparations that i am trying to make in the way of hardy annualshardy in the sense i fear of a sort of shameful brazennessthis christmas letter to you takes absolute precedence i wrote indeed to rhoda broughton a couple of days since from town but that was a melancholy matter on the occasion of my having gone up to poor dear hamilton aïdés memorial service where i didnt see her though she may have been present and of which i thought she would care for some little account it was a very beautiful and touching musical service but i havent seen her for a long time alasamid these years of more and more interspacedand finishedoccasions of course i am hoping that this will lie on your table on xmas morningin all sorts of charming company and not before and not after but its difficult to time communications at this upheaved season especially from another nonlondon province and i trust to the happy hazard though still a little ruffled by a sense of the breakdown of things the public services that compelled me yesterday coming down here from victoria to be shoved into as the only place in the train the small connectingspace between two pullmans where i stuck all the way in a tight bunch of five or six other men and three portmanteaux and boxes quite the sort of treatment ones nose half in the wc included that the english traveller writes from italy infuriated letters to the times about i figure you at all events exempt from any indignity of movement and the conditions of movement nowadays almost all include indignity and still sitting up on your torquay slope as on a mild olympus and with this strife of circulating humans far below you but when i reflect that i dont know for certain any of your actualities i reflect with a crimson countenance on the months that have elapsed i have before me as i write a beautiful letter from you of the date of which nothing would induce me to remind youbut that is not quite your contemporary history putting your own news at its quietest however my own runs it closefor save for this small episode a stay with some old and intensely tranquil american friends established here for the ending of their days and putting aside a few days at a time in london which i find periodically inevitable and even quite like i havent stirred for ages from my own house the suitability of which to my modest scheme of existence grows fortunately more and more marked i spent last summer therethe most beautiful of ones life i thinkwithout the briefest of breaksand that gregarious time is the one at which i like least to circulate the little place alas becomes itselflike all places save torquay i judgemore and more gregarious and there were a good many days when even my own small premises bristled too much with the invader but there is a great virtue in sitting tightyou sit out many things even bores are comparatively speaking loose and i had a blest sort of garden by which im far from meaning gardening summer what it must have been beside your sapphire sea i return at any rate in a few days to sit tight again till early in february when there are reasons for my probably going for five or six weeks to paris and even possiblyor impossiblyto rome one of the principal of these being that the prospect fills me with a blackness of horror that i find really alarming as a sign of moral paralysis and abjection so that i ought to try to fly in the face of it but i shall fly at the best i fear very low  i neednt tell you how much i hope and pray that this may find you as they say in health theres an icy blast here todayyet i take for granted that if it werent sunday you would be doing something very prodigious and muscular in the teeth of it the prize of long activity and sweet survival is with those whose hardness is greater than other hardnesses and yours is greater than that of the seawave and all the rest of opposing naturethough i make this imputation only on behalf of your sporting resources i appeal to the softest corner of the softest part of the rest of you to make before too long some magnanimous sign to yours very constantly   henry james      to thomas sergeant perry        mr perry whose recollections of h j and his brothers at newport      have been read on an early page of these volumes was at this time      living in paris     brighton  boxing day 1906    my dear thomas   i have remained silentin the matter of your last good letterunder a great stress of correspondence de fin dannée which you on your side must be having also to reckon with the end is not yet but i want to greet you without a more indecent delay and to impress you with a sense of my cordial and seasonable sentiments such as you will communicate please unreservedly to les vôtres around the xmastide hearth i am spending the so equivocal period with some very quiet old friends at this place and i write this in presence of a shining silvery shimmery sea on one of the prettiest possible southcoast mornings its like the old brighton that you may read about miss honeymans in the early chapters of the newcomes but you are of course bathed in paris in a much more sumptuous splendour but what a triste nouvel an for the poor foolish or misguided church not of france a little more and we protestantsyou and iwill have to subscribe for it your censeur was very welcome and the portrait of mme barboux of the last heartbreaking expertness but somehow these things are all pen as if all life had run to itand one wonders what becomes of the rest of consciousnesssave the literary yet the literary breaks down with them too on occasionas in the apparent failure to discover that the value of shakespeare is that of the most splendid poetry as expression that ever was on earth and that they are reckoning for him apparently as by the langue of sardou how funnily solemn or solemnly funny the little goncourt academyyet when they have made up their mind i shall like to hear on whom and what and you must tell me and i will get the book  bill i am afraid meanwhile will have been absent from your yuletide revels if he has gone to geneva of the bise as he hinted to me that he might and as i dont quite envy him but à cet âge i think i really shall see you dans le courant de février i presently go home to work toward that end ferme i send again a thousand friendships to mrs thomas and the miss thomases and am always yours and theirs   henry james      to gaillard t lapsley  mr lapsley now settled in england had become the neighbour at cambridge of mr a c benson and the present editorthe islander and the librarian of the following letter    16 lewes crescent brighton  december 27th 1906    my dear dear gaillard   i am touched almost to anguish by your beautiful and generous letter and lose not an instant in thanking you for it with the last effusion it is no vain figure of speech but a solemn an allsolemn verity that even were i not thus blessedly hearing from you at this felicitous time i should have been within the next two or three days writing to you and i had formed and registered the sacred purpose and vow to tell you that really these long lapses of sight and sound of you dont do for me at all and that i groan over the strange fatality of this last so persistent failureduring long months yearsof my power to become in any way possessed of you my own fault oh yesa thousand times for which i bow my forehead in the dust my intense respect for your so noble occupations and your so distinguished personality have had a good deal to say to the matter moreover there is a vulgar untimeliness of approach to the highlydevoted and the deeplycloistered of which i have always hated to appear capable it is just what i may however even now be guilty of if i put you the crude question of whether there isnt perhaps any moment of this january when you could come to me for a couple of deeply amicable days i dont quite know what your holidays are nor what heroic immersions in scholastic abysses you may not cultivate the depressing ideal of carrying on even while they last but i seem to reflect that you never will be able to come to me free and easy theres a sweet prophecy for you and that my only course therefore is to tug at you blindfold through and in spite of your tangle of silver coils i know no one better that its hateful to pay visits and especially winter ones from far and to far tother side of town but to brood on such invidious truths is simply to plot for your escaping me altogether and i reflect further that you are with your great trainservices decently suburban to london and that the dear old 428 from charing cross to rye brings you down in exactly two not discomfortable hours also my poor little house is now really warmeven hot i put in very effective hotwater pipes only this autumn ponder these things my dear gaillardand the further fact that i intensely yearn for youstruggle with them master them subjugate them then pick out your pair of days two full and clear ones with me i mean exclusive of journeys and let me know that you arrive i hate to worry you about it and shall understand anything and everything but come if you humanly can  when i think of the charm of possibly taking up with you by the lamb house fire the various interesting impressions allusions american references and memories etc with which your letter is so richly bedight i kind of feel that you must come to tell me more of everything so just yet i shall reserve these thrills for i feel that i shall and must by hook or by crook see you i expect to go abroad about feb 5th for a few weeksbut that wont prevent i rejoice to hear your news however sketchy of the islander of ely and the librarian of magdalene commend me as handsomely as possible to the lone islanderhow gladly would i at the very perfect right moment be his man friday or saturday or even better sundayand tell percy lubbock with my love that i missed him acutely the other week at windsor which he will understand and perhaps even believe what disconcerted me in your letter was your mention of your having while in america been definitely illa proceeding of which i wholly disapprove i desire to talk to you about that too even though i meanwhile discharge upon you my dear gaillard the abounding sympathy of yours always and ever   henry james      to bruce porter        mr bruce porter had written from san francisco describing the      earthquake of the preceding spring     lamb house rye  february 19th 1907    my dear bruce porter   i have had from you a very noble and beautiful letter which has given me exceeding great joy and which i have only not sooner thanked you forwell by reason of many interruptions and preoccupationsmainly those resulting from my being in london the hourly importunate when it came to me at which seasons and during which sojourns i always put off as much correspondence as possible till i get back to this comparative peace i returned here but three days since how shall i tell you at any rate today how your letter touches and even as it were relieves me i had felt like such a backward brute in writing mine but now in communication with your treasures of indulgence and generosity i feel only your admirable virtue and the high price i set upon your friendship so i thank you all tenderly and assure you that you have poured balm on much of my anxiety not to say on my shame your account of those unimaginable weeks of your great crisis are of a thrilling and uplifting interestand yet everything remains unimaginable to meas to the sense of your whole actual situation and the lurid newspapers on all this do nothing but darken and distract my vision i hope you are living in less of a pandemonium than they basest afflictions of our afflicted age give you out to bebut verily the bridge of comprehension is strained and shaky and impassable between this little oldworld russet shore and your vertiginous cosmic coast let me cling therefore to you dear bruce porter personally as to the friend of those three or four all but fabulous antediluvian days and keep my hands on you tight till by gentle insistent pressure i have made you yield to that delightful possibility of your perhaps at some nearish day presenting yourself here you speak of it as a discussable thingits the cream of your letter let me just say once for all you shall have the very eagerest and intensest welcome heaven therefore speed the day i go to the continent for a few weekseight or ten probably at mosta fortnight hence but return after that to be here in the most continuous fashion for months and months to comeall summer and autumn you are vividly interesting too on the subject of fanny stevenson and her situationand your picture is filled out a little by my hearing of her as in a rather obscure and inaccessible town somewhere on the riviera communicating with a friend or two in london in an elusive and deprecative fashionwithholding her address so as not to be overtaken or met with apparently poor lady poor barbarous and merely instinctive ladyah what a tangled web we weave i probably shall fail of seeing her and yet with a sneaking kindness for her that i have shall be sorry wholly to lose her she wont i surmise come to england but if i see you here i shall repine at nothing do manage to be sustained for the gallant pilgrimageand do let it count a little for that that i am here my dear bruce porter ever so clingingly and constantly yours   henry james      to miss grace norton    lamb house rye  march 5th 1907    dearest grace   hideous as is really the time that has elapsed since i last held any communication with you on that torrid july 3d pm in kirkland sti wont name the year it has seemed to me extraordinarily brief and has in fact passed like a flash measured by the calendar its incrediblemeasured by my sense of the way the months whizz by more and more like the telegraphposts at the window of the train it has been a simple good run from the eve of my leaving america to the present moment i came straight back hereto a great monotony and regularity and tranquillity of life on the whole and havent had really and shouldnt have didnt i begin to count any of the conscious desolation of having drifted away from you however beginning to count makes it another and rather horrible matteror would make it so if you and i ever counted in the dreary way of times of writing or ever had or ever will at the same time i yearn to hear from you and it may increase my chance of that boon if i tell you with all urgency how much i do on that side though you through your habitual magnanimity wont mind my long silence unduly i mind it myself with this very first word of my breaking it because im talking with you now again and that brings back so many too many things and to do so seems the pleasantest and dearest and most natural thing in the world i leave this place tomorrow for paristhat is sleep at doverbut an hour and a half henceand go farther the next day which is the first time ive stirred except for an occasional week in london since i last stirred out of sight of you ive been for a long time under the promise of going over to see williams bill who is working tooth and nail to every appearance at julians studio if i can i shall dash down to italyto florence and venicefor a short spell before restorationto this domicilethe last time i daresay that i shall ever brave the distinctly enfeebled spell as i last felt it to beseven years ago of those places so utterly the prey of the barbarian now that if you still ever yearn for them take an easy comfort and thank your stars that you knew them in the less blighted and dishonoured time it is very singular to me living here in this comparatively oldworld corner which has nothing else but its own little immemorial blots and vulgarismsbesides all its great merits to find myself plunged into the strain of the rankest and most promiscuous actuality as soon as crossing to the continent i direct myself to the shrines of a superior antiquity one is so out of the stream here that one almost wholly forgets itand then it is incongruously the most sacred pilgrimages that most vociferously remind onebecause to put it as gracefully as possible most cosmopolitanly left to myself i really think i should scarce ever budge from here againunless to go back to the us which honestly i should like almost as much as i should in some connectionsthe travelling above all dread it but the dread wouldnt be the same dread of the americananglican and german italy these will strike you as cheerful sentiments for the eve of a pleasuretrip abroad and i shall feel better when ive started but even so the travelimpulse which ive had almost no opportunity in my life really to gratify is extinct as from inanition and personal antiquity and above all more and more the only way i care to travel is by reading to stay at home and read is more and more my idealand its one that you have beautifully realized i think it was the sense of all that it has so admirably done for you that confirmed me while i was with you in my high estimation of it great every way dear grace and allexemplary i thought the dignity and coherency and benignity of your lifelong after beholding it as it has taken me by the tiresome calendar again to make you this declaration i at any rate have the greatest satisfaction in the thoughtthe fireside visionof your still and always nobly leading it i dont know and how should i much about you in detailbut i think i have a kind of instinct of how the sidebrush of the things that i do get in a general way a reverberation of touches and affects you and as in one way or another there seems to have been plenty of the stress and strain and pain of life on the circumference and even some of it at the centre as it were of your circle ive not been without feeling and responding to i boldly say some of your vibrations i hope at least the most acute of them have proceeded from causes presenting for youwell what shall i sayan interest even the most worrying businesses often have onebut there are sides of them that we could discover in talk over the fire but that i dont appeal to you lucidly to portray to me besides i can imagine them exquisitelyas well as where they fail of that beguilement and believe me therefore i am living with you as i write quite as much as if i made outas i used toby your pharoslooking lamplight through your ample and lucid windowpane that you were sitting in as they say here and were thereupon planning an immediate invasion i have given intense ear to every breath of indication about charles and his condition and in particular to the appearance that so far as i understand he has been presiding and dignifying as he alone remains to have done the longfellow centenarya symptom as it has seemed to me of very handsome vitality  i have been very busy all these last months in raising my productions for a severelysifted collective and definitive editionof which i even spoke to you i think when i saw you last as it was then more or less definitely planned then hitches and halts supervenedthe whole matter being complicated by the variety and the conflict of my scattered publishers till at last the thing is on the right basis in the two countriesfor it has all had to be brought about by quite separate arts here and in america and a handsomei hope really handsome and not too cheapin fact sufficiently deararray will be the resultowing much to close amendment and even rewriting of the four earliest novels and to illuminatory classification collocation juxtaposition and separation through the whole series the work on the earlier novels has involved much labourto the best effect for the vile things im convinced but the real tussle is in writing the prefaces to each vol or book which are to be longvery longand loquaciousand competent perhaps to pousser à la vente the edition is to be of 23 vols and there are to be some 15 prefaces as some of the books are in two and twentythree lovely frontispiecesall of which i have this winter very ingeniously called into being so that they at least only await process reproduction the prefaces as i say are difficult to dobut i have found them of a jolly interest and though i am not going to let you read one of the fictions themselves over i shall expect you to read all the said introductions thus my dear grace do inot at all artlesslyprattle to you artfully on the contrary toward casting some spell of chatter on yourself meanwhile the irving street echoes that have come to me have been of the din of voices and the affluence of strangers and the conflict of nationalities and the rush of everything i dont quite distinguish you in the thick of it but i suppose shady hill has had its share will you give my tender love there when you next go will you kindly keep a little in the dark for the present my fond chatter about my poor edition above all dearest grace will you believe me through thick and thin your ever devoted old friend   henry james   illustration page of the american original version as revised by henry james 1906     to william james junior    grand hotel pau  march 26 1907    dearest bill   this is just a word to tell you that your poor old farflying uncle is safe and sound and greatly enjoying himself so far after étapes consisting of bois poictiers and bordeaux with wonderful minor stops déjeuners and other impressions in between we got here last nightinto the balmiest tepidest dustiest south and stay three days or so for excursions going probably after todays luncheon to lourdes and back this large smooth old france is wonderful wisely seen as we are seeing it and i know it already much more infinitely well the motor is a magical marveldiscreetly and honourably used as we are using itand my hosts are full of amenity sympathy appreciation etc as well as of wondrous other servanted and avantcourierd arts of travel so that we are an excellent combination and most happy familyincluding our most admirable american chauffeur from lee mass whose native yankee saneness and intelligence projected into these unprecedented conditions makes me as proud of him as he is of his panhard car on thursday or friday at furthest we turn her head to parisbut of course with other stops and impressionsthough none i think of more than one night dont dream of troubling to writei will write again as we draw nearer i hope these efflorescent days if you have them dont turn your stomach too much against the thick taste of the julian broth i already long to see you again   ever your affectionate henry james      to howard sturgis        the plan of approaching italy through south germany and austria was      not carried out he presently went straight from paris to rome     58 rue de varenne paris  april 13th 1907    dearest howard   i find your beautiful tragic wail on my return from a wondrous miraculous motor tour of three weeks and a day with these admirable friends of ours who so serve one up all the luxuries of the season and all the ripe fruits of time that ones overloaded plate will hold we got back fromfrom everywhere literallylast night and in presence of a table groaning under arrears and calendars and other stationery i can but as it were fold you in my arms you talk of sad and fearful things  and i dont know what to say to you at least in this poor inky scratchy way what i should like to be able to say is that i will come down to rome and see you even now but this alas is not in my power without my altering all sorts of other pressing arrangements and combinations already made i do hope to go to rome for a littlea very littlestay later but not before the middle or 20th of may a timea generally emptier quieter timei greatly prefer there to any other it is of extreme importance to me to be to remain in paris till may 1sti havent been here for years and shall probably never once again be here or come abroad once again like you for the rest of my natural life ergo i am taking what there is of it for mei cant afford as it were not to and i have made my plans if they hold for approaching italy by south germany vienna trieste venice call of which will bring me to rome by the 20th of may about when i fear you will well nighor certainlyhave cleared out altogether from rome and florence  i shall return straight homewhere at least then i must infallibly see you or shall you pass through this placehomewardbefore may 1st the gentlest of lionesses bids me tell you what a tenderest welcome you would have from them hold up your heart meanwhile and remember for gods sake that there is a point beyond which the follies and infirmities of our friends and our proches have no right to ravage and wreck our own independence of soul that quantity is too precious a contribution to the saving human sum of good of lucidity and we are responsible for the entretien of it so keep yours shake yours upwell upmy dearest friend and to this end believe in your admirable human use to be crushed is to be of no use and i for one insist that you shall be of some and the most delightful to me feel everything tant que vous voudrezbut then soar superior and dont leave tatters of your precious person on every bush that happens to bristle with all the avidities and egotisms we shall judge it all sanely and taste it all wisely and talk of it all even thrillinglyand profitablyyet and i depend on your keeping that appointment with me this is all dearest howard now i almost blush to break through your obsessions to the point of saying that my three weeks of really seeing this large incomparable france in our friends chariot of fire has been almost the time of my life its the old travellingcarriage way glorified and raised to the 100th power will you very kindly say to maud story for me with my love that i am coming to rome very nearly all to see her i bless your companions and am your tout dévoué   henry james      to howard sturgis        from rome h j went to cernitoio mr edward boits villa near      vallombrosa     hôtel de russie rome  may 29th 1907    dearest howard   ive been disgustingly silent in spite of your so good prompt blessed letterbut the waters of rome have been closing over my head for i have each day a good part of each something urgent and imperative to do for myself as it wereand everything the hours and the people bring forth has to be crowded into too scant a margin with a consequent sensation of breathlessness that ill consorts alike with my figure my years and my inclinations i am sitting for my bust into the bargainto hendrik andersen it will be i think better than some other such work of his and that makes practically a great hole of two hours and a half in the daywithout which in truth the promise to hold out to the end of the ordeal i should already have broken away from this now very highlydeveloped heat and dust and glare my days abroad are violently shrinkingi am long since due at home and my yearning for a damp grey temperate clime hourly develops however i didnt mean to pour forth this plaintive floodbut rather to take a fine healthy jolly tone over the fact of your own so happily achieved i trust liberation from the roman yoke and your probable inhalation at this moment of the fresh air of the summits and of the tonic influence of admirable friends need i say that i number poor dear deafened rhodas florentine contact as among the stimulatingsince it surely must take more than deafness must take utter and cataclysmal dumbnessand im not sure even that would get the better of her practical acuityto make her fall from the tonic but im very sorryi mean for her i trust temporary troubleand if i but knew where she iswhich you dont mentionand when departing or how long staying would reach her if i might i cherish the thought of getting off tuesday at very latestif i return intact from a long motorday that awaits me at the hands of the filippo filippis on saturdayas i believe i drove with mrs mason out yesterday afternoon to the abbotts villathat is a very charming late afternoon teagarden and they told me you are soon to have them at cernitoio expansive not to say expensive and illimitable you all this time i dont tell youtell mildred seymoura tenth of the comfort i am deriving amid continued tension from the sense that her and your bow is for the time unstrung and hung up for the vallombrosa pines to let the mountainbreeze loosely play with it i expect to be here till tuesday ambut i see ive said so you shall then and so shall edward boit to whom and his girls i send tanti saluti as well as to brave and beneficent mr william have further news of yours my dear howard ever affectionately   henry james      to madame wagnière        the name of this correspondent recalls a meeting at florence      described in an early letter vol i p 28 madame wagnière born      huntington was now living in switzerland     palazzo barbaro venice  june 23rd 1907    dear laura wagnière   i have waited since getting your good note to have the right moment and right light for casting the right sort of longing lingering look on the little house with the giardinetto on the canal grande to the right of guggenheim as you face guggenheim i hung about it yesterday afternoon in the gondola with mrs curtis and we both thought it very charming and desirable only that she has perhaps a little vaguely heard it spoken of as damp which i confess it looks to me just a trifle however this may be the vainest of calumnies it does look expensive and also a trifle contracted and is at present clearly occupied and with no outward trace of being to let about it at all for myself in this paradise of great household spaces i mean venice generally i kind of feel that even the bribe of the canal grande and a giardinetto together wouldnt quite reconcile me to the purgatory of a very small really and not merely relatively small house mrs curtis is eloquent on the sacrifices one must make to a high rent here if one must have for smartness the canal grande at any price she makes me feel afresh what ive always felt that what i should probably do with my own available ninepence would be to put up with some large marble halls in some comparatively modest or remote locality especially della parte di fondamenta nuova etc that is so i got there air and breeze and light and pulizia and a dozen other conveniences in fine the place you covet is no doubt a dear little fancy place but as to the question of coming to venice if one can i have but a single passionate emotion a thousand times yes it would be for me i feel in certain circumstances were i free with a hundred other facts of my life different the solution of all my questions and the consolation of my declining years never has the whole place seemed to me sweeter dearer diviner it leaves everything else out in the cold i wish i could dream of coming to me mettre dans mes meubles except that my meubles would look so awful here beside you i presume to enter into it with a yearning sympathy happy you to be able even to discuss it  this place and this large cool upper floor of the barbaro with all the space practically to myself and draughts and scirocco airs playing over me indecently undressed is more than ever delicious and unique the breath of the lagoon still plays up but i mingle too much of another fluid with my ink and i have no more clothes to take off i greet affectionately yes affectionately kind henry and the exquisite goldhaired maiden and i am dear laura wagnière your very faithful old friend   henry james      to mrs wharton        the vicomte robert dhumières poet and essayist fell in action in      france april 26 1915     lamb house rye  august 11th 1907    my dear edith and my dear edward   the dhumières have just been lunching with me and that has so reknotted the silver cord that stretched so tense from the first days of last march to the first of those of maywasnt itthat i feel it a folly in addition to a shame not yet to have written to you as i have been daily and hourly yearning to do ever since my return from italy about a month ago you flung me the handkerchief edith just at that timeliterally cast it at my feet it met me exactly boundingreboundingfrom my halltable as i recrossed my threshold after my long absence which fact makes this tardy response i am well aware all the more graceless and then came the charming little picturecard of the poor lamb house hack grinding out his patient prose under your light lash and dear walter bswhich should have accelerated my production to the point of its breaking in waves at your feet and yet its only tonight that my overburdened spiritpushing its way ever since my return through the accumulations and arrears in every sort of absenceputs pen to paper for your especial benefitif benefit it be the charming dhumières both as i say touringtrainingin england through horrid wind and weather with a bonne grace and a wit and a parisianism worthy of a better cause amiably lunched with me a couple of days since on their way from town to folkestone and so back to plassac dont you like plassac down in our dear old gascony the seat of m de dampierreto whom à ce quil paraît that day at luncheon we were all exquisitely sympathetic well it threw back the bridge across the gulfs and the months even to the very spot where the great noblyclanging glass door used to open to the arrested the engulfing and disgorging carfor we sat in my little garden here and talked about you galore and kind of made plans wild vain dreams though i didnt let them see it for our all somehow being together again but oh i should like to remount the stream of time much further back than their passage hereif it werent as it somehow always is when i get at urgent letters ever so much past midnight it was only with my final return hither that my deep draught of riotous living came to an end and as the cup had originally been held to my lips all by your hands i somehow felt in presence of your interest and sympathy up to the very last and as if you absolutely should have been avertie from day to dayi did the matter that justice at least too much of the story has by this time dropped out but there are bits i wish i could save for you but i must break offits 115 am  aug 12th i wrote you last from rome i thinkdidnt i but it was after that that i heard of your having had at the last awful delays and complications awful strikebotherations over your sailing i knew nothing of them at the time i can only hope that the horrid memory of it has been brushed and blown away for you by the wind of your american kilometres i remained in romefor myselfa goodish while after last writing you and there were charming moments faint reverberations of the oldtime refrainswith a happy tendency of the superfluous the incongruous crew to take its departure as the summer came on yet i feel that i shouldnt care if i never saw the perverted place again were it not for the memory of four or five adorable occasionscharming chancesenjoyed by the bounty of the filippis my point is that they carried me in their wondrous car he drove it himself all the way from paris via macerata and with four or five more pickedup inmates first to two or three adorable roman excursionsto fiumicino eg where we crossed the tiber on a medieval raft and then had teaout of a piccadilly teabasketon the cool seasand and for a divine day to subiaco the unutterable where i had never been and then second down to naples where we spent two days and back going by the mountains the valleys really and monte cassino and returning by the seaie by gaeta terracina the pontine marshes and the castelliquite an ineffable experience this brought home to me with an intimacy and a penetration unprecedented how incomparably the old coquine of an italy is the most beautiful country in the worldof a beauty and an interest and complexity of beauty so far beyond any other that none other is worth talking about the day we came down from posilipo in the early june morning getting out of naples and round about by that endthe road from capua on coming is archidamnable is a memory of splendour and style and heroic elegance i never shall loseand never shall renew noyou will come in for it and cook will picture it up bless him repeatedlybut i have drunk and turned the glass upside downor rather i have placed it under my heel and smashed itand the gipsy life with itfor ever apropos of smashes two or three days after we had crossed the level crossing of caianello near caserta seven neapolitan smarts were all killed deadand this by no coming of the train but simply by furious reckless driving and a deviation a slip that dashed them against a rock and made an instant end the italian driving is crapulous and the roads mostly not good enough but i mustnt expatiate i wish i were younger but for that matter the state line would do me well enough this eveningfor its again the stroke of midnight if it werent i would tell you more yes i wish i were to be seated with you tomorrowcatching the breezeborne burr from under cooks fine nose how is gross dear woman and how are mitou and nicettewhom i missed so at monte cassino i spent four daysout from florenceat ned boits wondrousreally quite divine eyrie of cernitoio over against vallombrosa a dream of tuscan loveliness and a really admirable séjour i spent at the last two divine weeks in veniceat the barbaro i dont care frankly if i never see the vulgarized rome or florence again but venice never seemed to me more loveablethough the vaporetto rages they keep their cars at mestre and i am devotedly yours both   henry james      to miss gwenllian palgrave    lamb house rye  aug 27 1907    my dear gwenllian palgrave   it is quite horrid for me to have to tell you and after a little delay caused by a glut of correspondence at once and a pressure of other occupations that your gentle appeal on your friends behalf in the matter of the favourite quotation finds me utterly helpless and embarrassed the perverse collectress proposes i fear to collect the impossible i havent a favourite quotationabsolutely not any more than i have a favourite day in the year a favourite letter in the alphabet or a favourite wave in the sea and the collectress in general has ever found me dark and dumb and odious and i am too aged and obstinate and brutal to change such is the sorry tale i have to ask you all patiently to hear i wish you were or had been coming over to see me from canterburyinstead of labouring in that barren vineyard of other friendship do come without fail the next time you are there and believe me yourand your sistersvery faithful even if very flowerless and leafless wellwisher from long ago   henry james      to william james    lamb house rye  october 17th 1907    dearest william   i seem to have followed your summer rather well and intimately and rejoicingly thanks to bills impartings up to the time he left me and to the beautiful direct and copious news aforesaid from yourself and from alice and i make out that i may deem things well with you when i see you so mobile and mobilizable so emancipated and unchained for being so as well as so fecund and so still overflowing your annual go at keene valley which im never to have so much as beheld and the nature of your references to itas this one tonightfill me with pangs and yearningsi mean the bitterness almost of envy there is so little of the keene valley side of things in my life but i went up to scotland a month ago for five days at john cadwaladers of ny vast shooting in forfarshire let to him out of lord dalhousies real principality and there in absolutely exquisite weather had a brief but deep draught of the glory of moor and mountain as that air and tenmile trudges through the heather and by the braeside to lunch with the shooters delightfully give it it was an exquisite experience but those things are over and i am settled in here dv for a good quiet time of urgent work during the season here that on the whole i love best for it makes for concentrationand il ny a que çafor me which will float me i trust till the end of february when i shall simply go up to london till the midmay no more abroad for me within any calculable time heaven grant why the devil i didnt write to you after reading your pragmatismhow i kept from iti cant now explain save by the very fact of the spell itself of interest and enthralment that the book cast upon me i simply sank down under it into such depths of submission and assimilation that any reaction very nearly even that of acknowledgment would have had almost the taint of dissent or escape then i was lost in the wonder of the extent to which all my life i have like m jourdain unconsciously pragmatised you are immensely and universally right and i have been absorbing a number more of your followingsup of the matter in the american journal of psychology which your devouring devotee manton marble  plied and always on invitation does ply me with i feel the reading of the book at all events to have been really the event of my summer in which connection that of books i am infinitely touched by your speaking of having read parts of my american scene of which i hope bill has safely delivered you the copy of the english edition to mrs brycepaying them the tribute of that test of their value indeed the tribute of your calling the whole thing köstlich stuff and saying it will remain to be read so and really gauged gives me more pleasure than i can say and quickens my regret and pain at the way the fates have been all against all finally and definitely now my having been able to carry out my plan and do a second instalment embodying more and complementary impressions of course i had a planand the second vol would have attacked the subject and my general mass of impression at various other angles thrown off various other pictures in short contributed much more but the thing was not to be  but i am writing on far into the dead unhappy night while the rain is on the roofand the wind in the chimneys oh your windless gateless cambridge choyezle tell alice that all this is for her too but she shall also soon hear further from yours and hers all and always   henry      to w e norris    lamb house rye  december 23rd 1907    my dear norris   i want you to find this as by ancient and inviolate custom or at least intention on your table on christmas am but am convinced that whenever i post it it will reach you either before or after and not with true dramatic effect it will take you in any case however the assurance of my affectionate fidelitylittle as anything else for the past year or i fear a longer time may have contributed to your perception of that remembrance the years and the months go and somehow make our meetings ingeniously rarer and our intervals and silences more monstrous it is the effect alas of our being as it were antipodal provincialsfor even if one of us were a capitalist the problem of occasional common days in london would be by so much simplified i am in london less on the whole than during my first years in this place and as you appear now to be there never i flap my wings and crane my neck in the void last spring i confess i committed an act of comprehensive disloyalty i went abroad at the winters end and remained till the first days of july the first half of the time in paris roughly speakingand on a long and very interesting extraordinarily interesting motortour in france the second in rome and venice as to take leave of them forever this took london almost utterly out of my year and i think i heard from gosse who happily for him misses you so much less than i do i mean enjoys you so much morebut no that isnt right either that you had in may or june shone in the eye of london i am not this year however i thank my stars to repeat the weird exploit of a long continental absencesuch things have quite ceased to be in my real moeursand i shall therefore plan a campaign in town for may and june that will have for its leading feature to encounter you somewhere and somehow till thenthat is to a later date than usuali expect to bide quietly here where a continuity of occupationstrange to saycauses the days and the months to melt in my grasp and where in spite of rather an appalling invasion of outsiders and idlers a spreading colony and a looming menace the conditions of life declare themselves as emphatically my rustic fit as i ten years ago made them out to be i have lived into my little house and garden so thoroughly that they have become a kind of domiciliary skin that cant be peeled off without painand in fact to go away at all is to have rather the sense of being flayed nevertheless i was glad last spring to have been tricked rather into a violent change of manners and practicesviolent partly because my ten weeks in paris were for me on a basis most unprecedented i paid a visit of that monstrous length to friends i had never done so in my life before and in a beautiful old house in the heart of the rive gauche amid old private hotels and hidden gardens rue de varenne tasted socially and associatively so to speak of a new paris altogether and got a bellyful of fresh and nutritive impressions yet i have just declined a repetition of it inexorably and its more and more vivid to me that i have as much as i can tackle to lead my own lifei cant ever again attempt for more than the fleeting hour to lead other peoples i have indeed i should add suffered infiltration of the poison of the motorcontemplatively and touringly used that truly is a huge extension of life of experience and consciousness but i thank my stars that im too poor to have one im afraid ive no other adventure to regale you with i am engaged none the less in a perpetual adventure the most thrilling and in every way the greatest of my life and which consists of having more than four years entered into a state of health so altogether better than i had ever known that my whole consciousness is transformed by the intense alleviation of it and i lose much time in pinching myself to see if this be not really none of i that fact however is much more interesting to myself than to other peoplepartly because no one but myself was ever aware of the unhappy nature of the physical consciousness from which i have been redeemed it may give a glimmering sense of the degree of the redemption however that i should in the first place be willing to fly in the face of the jealous gods by so blatant a proclamation of it and in the second find the value of it still outweigh the formidable the heapedup and pressed together burden of my years  but enough of my own otherwise meagre annals i must catch my post i havent sounded you for the least news of your ownit being needless to tell you that i hold out my cap for it even as an organgrinder who makes eyes for pence to a gentleman on a balcony especially when the balcony overhangs your luxuriant happy valley and your turquoise sea i go on taking immense comfort in the second home as i beg your pardon for calling it that your sister and her husband must make for you and am almost as presumptuously pleased with it as if i had invented it i am myself literally eating a baked apple and a biscuit on xmas evening all alone i have no one in the house i never dine out here under any colour there are to be found people who do and i have been deaf to the syren voice of paris and to other gregarious pressure but i wish you a brave feast and a blameless year and am yours my dear norris all faithfully and fondly   henry james      to w e norris        hj had inadvertently addressed the preceding letter to e w      norris esq     lamb house rye  december 26 1907    my dear norris   it came over me in the oddest way weirdly and dimly as i lay soaking in my hot bath an hour ago that my jaded and inadvertent hand i have written so many letters in so few days and you see the effect on everyone doubtless but your own impeccably fingered self superscribed my xmas envelope with the monstrous collocation ew the effect has been probably to make you think the letter a circular and chuck it into the fireor if you have opened it to convince you that my handsome picture of my health is trueif true at allof my digestion and other vulgar parts at the expense of my brain clearly you must believe me in distinct cerebral decline yet im not i am onlyor wasin a state of purely and momentarily manual muddle but the curious and interesting thing is why suddenly as i lay this cold morning agreeably steaming did the vision of the hindpartbefore order come straight at me out of the vapours after three or four days when i didnt know i was thinking of you  well it only shows how much you are my dear norris in the thoughts of yours remorsefully   henry james   ps i hope now i did do it

dear william and letitia   it would be monstrous of me to say that what i most valued in williams last brave letter was letitias gentle drag upon it and i hasten to insist that when i dwell on the pleasure so produced by letitias presence in it to the extent of her gently dragging i feel that she at least will know perfectly what i mean explain this to william my dear letitia i leave all the burden to youso used as you are to burdens it was delightful i can honestly say to hear from you no long time sinceand whether by controlled or uncontrolled inspiration and i tick a small space clear this morningclear in an air fairly black with the correspondence of the seasonjust to focus you fondly in it and make for the friendly sound of my remington a penetrable medium and a straight course i am shut up as mostly you see in the little stronghold your assault of which has never lost you honour at leasti mean the honour of the brave besiegerhowever little else it may have brought you and i waggle this small white flag at you from my safe distance over the battlements as for a cheerful truce or amicable new years parley i think i must figure to you a good deal as a bankedin esquimau with his head alone extruding through the sole orifice of his hut or perhaps as a digger indian bursting through his mound by the same perforation even as a chicken through its shell by reason of the abject immobility practised by me while you and letitia hurl yourselves from one ecstasy of movement one form of exercise one style of saddled or harnessed or milked or prodded or perhaps merely fattened quadruped to another your letterthis lastis a noble picture of a free quadrupedal lifewhich gives me the sense all delightful of seeing you both alone erect and nimble and graceful in the midst of the browsing herd of your subjects well it all sounds delightfully pastoral to one whose stable consists but of the gocart in which the gardener brings up the luggage of those of my visitors from the station who advance successfully to the stage of that question of transport and my outhouses of the shed under which my solitary henchman but sufficient to a drawbridge that plays so easily up attends to the boots of those confronted with the inevitable subsequent phase of early matutinal departure all of which means dear both of you that i do seem to read into your rich record the happiest evidences of health as well as of wealth you take my breath awayas for that matter you can but too easily figure with your evernatural image of me gaping through a crevice of my doorthe only other at all equal loss of it proceeding but from my mild daily revolution up and down our little local eminence here no you wont believe itthat these have been my only revolutions since i last risked at a loophole seeing you thunder past i shall risk it again when you thunder backand really though it spoils the consistency of my builded metaphor watch fondly for the charming flash that will precede and prepare i havent been even as far as to see the good abbeys at fairfordwas capable of not even sparing that encouragement when she kindly wrote to me for a visit toward the autumns end i havent so much as pilgrimised to the other shrine in tite stand having so little to tell you really mustnt prolong this record of my vacancy i am quite spending the winter herebracing for what the spring and summer may bring but i do get as the very breath of the spiceislands the balmy sidewind of your general luxuriance and it makes me glad and grateful for you and keeps me just as much as ever your faithful vigilant steady sturdy friend   henry james      to mrs wharton        the work just finished was the revision of the high bid shortly      to be produced by mr and mrs forbes robertson     lamb house rye  january 2nd 1908    my dear edith   g t lapsley has gone to bedhe has been seeing the new year in with me generously giving a couple of days to itand i snatch this hour from out the blizzard of xmas and years end and new years beginning missives to tell you too belatedly how touched i have been with your charming little xmas mementoan exquisite and interesting piece for which i have found a very effective position on the little old oakwainscotted wall of my very own room there it will hang as a fond reminder of tout ce que je vous dois i am trying to make use of an accursed fountain penbut its a vain struggle it beats me and i recur to this familiar and wellworn old unimproved utensil i have passed here a very solitary and casanier christmastide of wondrous still and frosty days and nights of huge silver stars and yesterday finished a job of the last urgency for which this intense concentration had been all vitally indispensable i got the conditions here at home thus in perfectioni put my job through and nowor in timeit may have on my scant fortunes a farreaching effect if it does have youll be the first all generously to congratulate me and to understand why under the stress of it i couldnt indeed break my little started spell of application by a frolic absence from my field of action if it on the contrary fails of that influence i offer my breast to the acutest of your silver arrows though the beautiful charity with which you have drawn from your critical quiver nothing more fatallyfeathered than that dear little framed and glazed squared and gilded étrenne serves for me as a kind of omen of my going unscathed to the end i admit that its horrible that we cantnous autrestalk more face to face of the other phenomena but life is terrible tragic perverse and abysmalbesides patientons i cant pretend to speak of the phenomena that are now renewing themselves round you for there is the eternal penalty of my having shared your cup last yearthat i must taste the liquor or go withoutthere can be no question of my otherwise handling the cup ah im conscious enough i assure you of going without and of all the rich arrears that will neverfor mebe made up but i hope for yourselves a thoroughly good and full experienceabout the possibilities of which as i see them there is alas all too much to say let me therefore but wonder and wish but its long past midnight and i am yours and teddys ever so affectionate   henry james      to gaillard t lapsley    reform club pall mall sw  march 17th 1908    my dear dear gaillard   i cant tell you with what tender sympathy your rather disconcerting little news inspires me nor how my heart goes out to you alack alack how we do have to pay for thingsand for our virtues and grandeurs and beauties even as you are now doing overworked hero and model of distinguished valour as well as for our follies and mistakes however you have on your record exactly that mistake of too generous a sacrifice fortunately you have been pulled up before you have quite chucked away your all it must be deuced drearyyet if you ask me whether i think of you more willingly and endurably thus or as your image of pale overstrain haunted me after you had left me at the new year i shall have no difficulty in replying in fact dearest gaillard and at the risk of aggravating you i like to keep you a little before me in the passive the recumbent the luxurious and ministeredto posture and my imagination rings all the possible changes on the forms of your noble surrender lie as flat as you can and live and think and feel and talk and keep silent as idlyand you will thereby be laying up the most precious treasure its a heavenappointed interlude and cela ne tient quà vous i mean to the wave of your white hand to let it become a thing of beauty like the masque of comus cultivate horizontally the waving of that handand you will brush away for the time all responsibilities and superstitions and the peace of the lord will descend upon you and you will become as one of the most promising little good boys that ever was après quoi the whole process and experience will grow interesting amusing tissuemaking

from me dear dear g that your cure will have a social iridescence for your acute and ironic and genial observation of the most beguiling kind but you dont need to take that or any other wisdom that your beautiful intelligence now plays with from any other source but that intelligence therefore be beholden to me almost only for the fresh reassurance that i am more affectionately than ever yours

my dear edith   this is just a tremulous little line to say to you that the daily services of intercession and propitiation to the infernal gods those of jealousy and guignon that i feel sure you have instituted for me will continue to be deeply appreciated they have already borne fruit in the shape of a desperate comparative calmin my racked breastafter much agitationand even today sunday of a feverish gaiety during the journey from manchester to this place achieved an hour ago by special train for my whole troupe and its impedimentai travelling with the animals like the liontamer or the serpentcharmer in person and quite enjoying the caravanquality the bariolé bohemian or picaresque note of the affair here we are for the last desperate throesbut the omens are good the little play pretty and pleasing and amusing and orthodox and mercenary and safe absit omencravenly ignobly canny also clearly to be very decently acted indeed little gertrude elliott on whom it so infinitely hangs showing above all a gallantry capacity and vaillance on which i had not ventured to build she is a scrap personally physically where she should be a presence and handicapped by a face too small in size to be a field for the play of expression but allowing for this she illustrates the fact that intelligence and instinct are capables de toutso that i still hope and each time they worry through the little piggery it seems to me more firm and more intrinsically without holes and weak spotsin itself i mean and not other in short than consummately artful i even quite awfully wish you and teddy were to be hereeven so far as that do i go but wire me a wordhereon thursday amand i shall be almost as much heartened up i will send you as plain and unvarnished a one after the event as the case

rewriting retouching prefacemaking and proofcorrecting has so paralysed meas a panic fearthat i have let other decencies go to the wall the printers and publishers tread on my heels and i feel their hot breath behind mewhereby i keep at it in order not to be overtaken fortunately i have kept at it so that i am almost out of the wood and the next very few weeks or so will completely lay the spectre the case has been complicated badly moreover the last monthand even beforeby my having of all things in the world let myself be drawn into a theatrical adventurewhich fortunately appears to have turned out as well as i could have possibly expected or desired forbes robertson and his wife produced on the 26th last in edinburghbeing on tour and the provincial production to begin with as more experimental having good reason in its favoura threeact comedy of mine the high bidwhich is just only the little oneact play presented as a tale at the end of the volume of the two magics the oneact play proving really a perfect threeact one dividing itself by two short entractes without fiddles perfectly at the right little places as climaxeswith the artful beauty of unity of time and place preserved etc it had a great and charming success before a big house at edinburgha real and unmistakable victorybut what was most brought home thereby is that it should have been discharged straight in the face of london that will be its real and best function this i am hoping for during may and june it has still to be done at newcastle liverpool etc was done this past week three times at glasgow of course on tour three times in a week is the most they can give a play in a minor city but my great point is that preparations rehearsals lavishments of anxious time over it after completely rewriting it and improving it to begin with have represented a sacrifice of days and weeks to them that have direfully devoured my scant marginthus making my intense nervousness about them doubly nervous i left home on the 17th last and rehearsed hard every blessed day at manchester and at edinburgh till the productionhaving already three weeks before that in london given up a whole week to the same i came back to town a week ago tonight saw a second night in edinburgh which confirmed the impression of the first and return to lh tomorrow after a very decent huitaine de jours here during which i have had quiet mornings and even evenings of work i go to paris about the 20th to stay 10 days at the most with mrs wharton and shall be back by may 1st i yearn to know positively that your dad and mother arrive definitely on the oxford job then i have had to be horribly inhuman to them in respect to the fond or repeated expression of that yearningbut they will more than understand why druv as ive been and also understand how the prospect of having them with me and being with them for a while has been all these last months as the immediate jewel of my spur read them this letter and let it convey to them all tenderly that i live in the hope of their operative advent and shall bleed half to death if there be any hitch  but i embrace you all in spirit and am ever your fond old uncle   henry james      to w d howells        the lucubrations are of course the prefaces written for the      collected edition the number of volumes was eventually raised to      twentyfour but the bostonians was not included the one thing      referred to towards the end of this letter as likely to involve      another visit to america would seem to be the possible production      there of one of his plays while the further reason for wishing to      return was doubtless connected with his project of writing a novel      of which the scene was to be laid in americathe novel that      finally became the ivory tower     dictated  lamb house rye  17th august 1908    my dear howells   a great pleasure to me is your good and generous letter just receivedwith its luxurious implied licence for me of seeking this aid to prompt response at a time when a pressure of complications this is the complicated time of the year even in my small green garden defeats too much and too often the genial impulse but so far as compunction started and guided your pen i really rub my eyes for vision of where it maysave as most misguidedlyhave come in you were so far from having distilled any indigestible drop for me on that pleasant ultimissimo sunday that i parted from you with a taste in my mouth absolutely saccharinesated with sweetness or with sweet reasonableness so to speak and aching or wincing in no single fibre extravagant and licentious almost your delicacy of fear of the contrary so much so in fact that i didnt remember we had even spoken of the heavy lucubrations in question or that you had had any time or opportunity since their inception to look at one however your fond mistake is all to the good since it has brought me your charming letter and so appreciative remarks you therein make my actual attitude about the lucubrations is almost only and quite inevitably that they make to me for weariness by reason of their number and extentive now but a couple more to write this staleness of sensibility in connection with them blocks out for the hour every aspect but that of their being all done and of their perhaps helping the edition to sell two or three copies more they will have represented much labour to this latter endthough in that they will have differed indeed from no other of their fellowmanifestations in general whatever and the resemblance will be even increased if the two or three copies dont in the form of an extra figure or two mingle with my withered laurels they are in general a sort of plea for criticism for discrimination for appreciation on other than infantile linesas against the so almost universal anglosaxon absence of these things which tends so in our general trade it seems to me to break the heart however i am afraid im too sick of the mere doing of them and of the general strain of the effort to avoid the deadly danger of repetition to say much to the purpose about them they ought collected together none the less to form a sort of comprehensive manual or vademecum for aspirants in our arduous profession still it will be long before i shall want to collect them together for that purpose and furnish them with a final preface ive done with prefaces for ever as for the edition itself it has racked me a little that ive had to leave out so many things that would have helped to make for rather a more vivid completeness i dont at all regret the things pretty numerous that ive omitted from deepseated preference and design but i do a little those that are crowded out by want of space and by the rigour of the 23 vols and 23 only which were the condition of my being able to arrange the matter with the scribners at all twentythree do seem a fairly blatant arrayand yet i rather surmise that there may have to be a couple of supplementary volumes for certain too marked omissions such being on the whole detrimental to an all professedly comprehensive presentation of ones stuff only these i pray god without prefaces and i have even in addition a dim vague view of reintroducing with a good deal of titivation and cancellation the toodiffuse but i somehow feel tolerably full and good bostonians of nearly a quarter of a century ago that production never having even to my muchdisciplined patience received any sort of justice but it will take doubtless a great deal of artful redoingand i havent now had the courage or time for anything so formidable as touching and retouching it i feel at the same time how the series suffers commercially from its having been dropped so completely out basta purebasta  i am charmed to hear of your roman book and beg you very kindly to send it me directly it bounds into the ring i rejoice moreover with much envy and also a certain yearning and impotent nonintelligence at your being moved today to roman utterancei mean in presence of the so bedrenched and vulgarised i mean more particularly commonised and transformed city as well as alas more or less suburbs of our current time there was nothing i felt to myself i could less do than write again in the whole presencewhen i was there some fifteen months agone the idea of doing so even had any periodical wanted my stuff much less bid for it would have affected me as a sort of giveaway of my ancient and other reactions in presence of all the unutterable old rome i originally found and adored it would have come over me that if those ancient emotions of my own meant anything no others on the new basis could mean much or if any on the new basis should pretend to sense it would be at the cost of all imputable coherency and sincerity on the part of my prime infatuation in spite all the same of which doubtless too pedantic viewit only means i fear that i am to my great disadvantage utterly bereft of any convenient journalistic easei am just beginning to redo  certain little old italian papers with titivations and expansions in form to match with a volume of english hours refabricated three or four years ago on the same system in this little job i shall meet again my not much more than scant yet still appreciable old roman stuff in my pathand shall have to commit myself about it or about its general subject somehow or other i shall trick it out again to my best ability at any rateand to the cost i fear of your thinking i have retitivation on the brain i haventi only have it on to the end that i may then have it a little consequently in the flat pocketbook the system has succeeded a little with english hours which have sold quite vulgarlyfor wares of mine whereas the previous and original untitivated had long since dropped almost to nothing in spite of which i could really shed salt tears of impatience and yearning to get back after so prolonged a blocking of traffic to too dreadfully postponed and neglected creative work an accumulated store of ideas and reachingsout for which even now clogs my brain  we are having here so bland and beautiful a summer that when i receive the waft of your furnacemouth blown upon my breakfasttable every few days through the cornucopia or improvised resounding trumpet of the times i groan across at my brother william now happily domesticated with me ah why did they poor infatuated dears why did theyand he always knows i mean why did you three hie you home from one of the most beautiful seasons of splendid cool summer or splendid summery cool that ever was just to swoon in the arms of your kittery genius loci genius of perspirationto whose terrific embrace you saw me four years ago or whatever terrible time it was almost utterly succumb in my small green garden here the elements have been ever since you left quite enchantingly mixed and i have been quite happy and proud to show my brother and his wife and two of his children who have been more or less collectively and individually with me what a decent english season can be  let me thank you again for your allusion to the slightly glamourtinged but more completely and consistently forbidding and forbidden lecture possibility i refer to it in these terms because in the first place i shouldnt have waited till now for it but should have waked up to it eleven years ago and because in the second there are other and really stouter things too definite ones i want to do with which it would formidably interfere and which are better worth my resolutely attempting i never have had such a sense of almost bursting late in the day though it be with violent and lately too much repressed creative again intention i may burst before this intention fairly or completely flowers of course but in that case even i shall probably explode to a less distressing effect than i should do under stress of a fatal puncture on the too personally and physically arduous and above all too gregariouslyassaulted which is what makes it most arduous lectureplatform there is one thing which may conceivably if it comes within a couple of years take me again to the contorni of kittery and on the spot once more one doesnt know what might happen then i should take grateful counsel of you with all the appreciation in the world and i want very much to go back for a certain thoroughly practical and special artistic reason which would depend however on my being able to pass my time in an ideal combination of freedom and quiet rather than in a luridly real one of involved and exasperated exposure and motion but i may still have to talk to you of this more categorically and wont worry you with it till then you wring my heart with your report of your collective dental pilgrimage to boston in mrs howells distressful interest i read of it from your page somehow as i read of siberian or armenian or macedonian monstrosities through a merciful attenuating veil of distance and difference in a column of the times the distance is half the globeand the difference for me from the dear ladys active afflictedness that of having when in america undergone myself so prolonged and elaborate a torture in the chair of anguish that i am now on tother side of jordan altogether with every ghost even of a wincing nerve extinct and a horrible inhuman acheless void installed as a substitute void or not however i hope mrs howells and you all are now acheless at least and am yours my dear howells ever so faithfully   henry james   ps with all of which i catch myself up on not having told you decently and gratefully of the always sympathetic attention with which i have read the fennel and rue you so gracefully dropped into my lap at that last hour and which i had afterwards to toy with a little distractedly before getting the right peaceful moments and right retrospective mood this in order to remount the stream of time to the very fontaine de jouvence of your subjectmatter down here for what comes out of it to me more than anything else is the charming freshness of it and the general miracle of your being capable of this under the supposedly more or less heavy bloom of a rich maturity there are places in it in which you recover absolutely your first fine rapture you confound and dazzle me so go on recoveringit will make each of your next things a new document on immortal freshness i cant remountbut can only drift on with the thicker and darker tide wherefore pray for me as who knows what may be at the end     to mrs wharton    lamb house rye  october 13th 1908    my very dear friend   i cabled you an hour ago my earnest hope that you may see your way to sailing  on the 20thand if you do manage that this wont catch you before you start nevertheless i cant not write to youhowever briefly i mean on the chance of my letter being uselessafter receiving your two last of rapprochées dates which have come within a very few days of each otherthat of oct 5th only today i am deeply distressed at the situation you describe and as to which my power to suggest or enlighten now quite miserably fails me i move in darkness i rack my brain i gnash my teeth i dont pretend to understand or to imagine only sit tight yourself and go through the movements of life that keeps up our connection with lifei mean of the immediate and apparent life behind which all the while the deeper and darker and unapparent in which things really happen to us learns under that hygiene to stay in its place let it get out of its place and it swamps the scene besides which its place god knows is enough for it live it all through every inch of itout of it something valuable will comebut live it ever so quietly andje maintiens mon direwaitingly what i am really hoping is that youll be on your voyage when this reaches the mount if youre not youll be so very soon afterwards wont youand youll come down and see me here and well talk à perte de vue and there will be something in that for both of us believe meanwhile and always in the aboundingly tender friendshipthe understanding the participation the princely though i say it who shouldnt hospitality of spirit and soul of yours more than ever   henry james      to jb pinker        by this time the monthly issue of the volumes of the new york      edition was well under waywith the discouraging results to be      inferred from the following letter     lamb house rye  october 23rd 1908    my dear pinker   all thanks for your letter this am received i have picked myself up considerably since tuesday am the hour of the shock but i think it would ease off my nerves not a little to see you and should be glad if you could come down on monday next 26th sayby the 425 and dine and spend the night if monday isnt convenient to you i must wait to indicate some other near subsequent day till i have heard from a person who is to come down on one of those dates and whom i wish to be free of i am afraid my anticlimax has come from the fact that since the publication of the series began no dimmest light or lead as to its actualities or possibilities of profit has reached mewhereby in the absence of special warning i found myself concluding in the sense of some probable fair returnbeguiled thereto also by the measure known only to myself of the treasures of ingenuity and labour i have lavished on the ameliorations of every page of the thing and as to which i felt that they couldnt not somehow tell i warned myself indeed and kept down my hopessaid to myself that any present payments would be moderate and fragmentaryvery but this didnt prevent my rather building on something that at the end of a very frequented and invaded and hospitable summer might make such a difference as would outweigha littlemy so disconcerting failure to get anything from  the nonresponse of both sources has left me rather high and drythough not so much so as when i first read scribners letter i have recovered the perspective and proportion of thingsi have committed thank god no anticipatory follies the worst is having made out my incometax return at a distinctly higher than at all warranted figurewhereby i shall have early in 1909 to payas i even did last yearon parts of an income i have never receivedand above all am aching in every bone to get back to outandout creative work the long interruption of which has fairly sickened and poisoned me that is the real hitch i am afraid that moreover in my stupidity before those unexplainedthough so grimlookingfigurelists of scribners i even seemed to make out that a certain 211 a phrase in his letter seeming also to point to that interpretation is all the same owing me but as you say nothing about this i see that i am probably again deluded and that the mystic screed meant it is still owing them which is all that is wanted verily to my sad rectification however i am now as it were prepared for the worst and as soon as i can get my desk absolutely clear for like the convolutions of a vast smothering boaconstrictor such voluminosities of proofof the editionto be carefully readstill keep rolling in that mere fact will by itself considerably relieve me and i have such visions and arrears of inspiration but of these we will speakand as i say i shall be very glad if you can come monday believe me yours ever   henry james      to miss ellen emmet        h js interest in the work of this paintresscousin afterwards      mrs blanchard rand has already appeared in a letter to her      mother mrs george hunter vol i p 258     lamb house rye  november 2d 1908   i have taken moments beloved bay to weep yes to bedew my pillow with tears over the foul wrong i was doing you and the generous and delightful letter i so long ago had from youand in respect to whose noble bounty your present letter received only this evening and already moving me to this feverish response is a heaping on my unworthy head of coals of fire it is delightful at any rate dearest bay to be in relation with you again and to hear your sweet voice as it were and to smell your glorious paint and turpentineto inhale in a word both your goodness and your glory and i shall never again consent to be deprived of the luxury of you long enough to notice it on any terms whatever  november 3d i had to break off last night and go to bedand as it is now much past midnight again i shall almost surely not finish but only scrawl you a few lines more and then take you up to london with me and go on with you there as i am obliged to make that move for a few days by the 930 am among the things i have to do is to go to see my portrait by jacques blanche at the private view of the new gallery autumn showhe having done me in paris last may he is now quite the bay emmet of the londonin particularportrait world and does all the billionaires and such like thats where i come invery big and fat and uncanny and brainy and awful when i last saw myselfso that i now quite tremble at the prospect though he has done a rather wondrous thing of thomas hardywho however lends himself i will add a word to this after i have been to the ng and if i am as unnatural as i fear you must settle really to come out and avenge me  when you see william to get on again with his portraitin which i am infinitely and yearningly interestedas i am in every invisible stroke of your brush over which i ache for baffled curiosity or wondermentwhen you do go on to cambridge sooner i trust than later he and alice and peggy will have much to tell you about their quite long summer here lately brought to a close and about poor little old lamb house and its corpulent slowlycirculating and slowlymasticating master it was an infinite interest to have them here for a good many weeksthey are such endlessly interesting people and alice such a heroine of devotion and of everything we have had a wondrous seasona real golden one for weeks and weeksand still it goes on bland and breathless and changelessthe rarest autumn and summer from june on known for years a proof of what this muchabused climate is capable of for benignity and convenience dear little old lamb house and garden have really become very pleasant and developed through being much and virtuously lived in and i do wish you would come out and add another flourish to its happy sequel but i must go to bed dearest bayim ashamed to tell you what sort of hour it is but ive not done with you yet   105 pall mall november 6th ive been in town a couple of days without having a moment to return to thisfor the london tangle immediately begins what it will perhaps most interest you to know is that i attended yesterday the private view of the society of portrait painters exhibition and saw blanches big portrait of poor h j his two exhibits are that one and one of himselfthe latter very flattered the former not the funny thing about it is that whereas i sat in almost full face and left it on the canvas in that bloated aspect when i quitted paris in june it is now a splendid profile and with the body and more of the body in a quite different attitude a wonderful tour de force the sort of thing you ought to do if you understand your real interestconsisting of course of his having begun the whole thing afresh on a new canvas after i had gone and worked out the profile in my absence by the aid of fond memory secret notes on my silhouette he also says surreptitiously taken by him and several photographs also secretly taken at that angle while i sat there with my whole beauty as i supposed turned on the result is wonderfully fine for meconsidering i think one sees a little that its a chicd thing but ever so much less than youd have supposed he dines with me tonight and i will get him to give me two or three photographs of the picture not of me and send them to you for curiositys sake but i really think that for a certain styleof presentation of hjthat it has a certain dignity of intention and of indicationof who and what poor creature he is it ought to be seen in the us he blanche wants to go there himselfso put in all your own triumphs first however it would kill himso his triumphs would be brief and yours would then begin again meanwhile he was almost as agreeable and charming and beguiling to sit to as you dear bay in your own attaching personwhich somebody once remarked to me explained half the run on you dear gaillard lapsley i hope immensely youll see him on his way to colorado or wherever has given me occasional news of eleanor and elizabethin which i have rejoicedseeming to hear their nurseries ring with the echo of their prosperity as they must now have children enough for them to take care of each other havent they i hope they are thinking of profiting by it to come out here againwhere they are greatly desired but beloved bay i must get this off now i send tenderest love to the mother and the sister i beseech you not to let your waiting laurel here wither ungathered and am ever your fondest   henry james      to george abbot james        this refers to the death of mrs g a james sister of the hon h      cabot lodge senior senator for massachusetts h js friendship      with his correspondent dating from early years is commemorated in      notes of a son and brother     lamb house rye  nov 26th 1908    my dear old friend   mrs lodge has written to me and i have answered her letter but i long very particularly to hold out my hand to you in person and take your own and keep it a moment ever so tenderly and faithfully all these months i havent known of the blow that has descended on you or im sure you feel that i would have made you some sign my communications with boston are few and faint in these daysthough what i do hear has in general more or less the tragic note you must have been through much darkness and living on now in a changed world i hadnt seen her you know for long years and as i have just said to mrs lodge always thought of her or remembered her as i saw her in youthcharming and young and bright animated and eager with life all before her great must be your alteration i wonder about you and yet spend my wonder in vain and somehow think we were meant not so to missduring long yearssight and knowledge of each other but life does strange and incalculable things with us alllife which i myself still find interesting i have a hope that you doin spite of everything i wish i hadnt so awkwardly failed practically of seeing you when i was in america then i should be better able to write to you now make me some signwonderful above all would be the sign that in great freedom you might come again at last to these regions of the earth how i should hold out my hands to you but perhaps you stick as it were to your past i dont know you see and i can only make you these uncertain yet all affectionate motions the best thing i can tell you about myself is that i have no second self to part withhaving lived always deprived but ive had other things and may you still find you havea few dont fail of feeling me at any rate my dear george ever so tenderly yours   henry james      to hugh walpole    lamb house rye december 13th 1908    my dear young friend hugh walpole   i had from you some days ago a very kind and touching letter which greatly charmed me but which now that i wish to read it over again before belatedly thanking you for it i find i have stupidly and inexplicably mislaidat any rate i cant tonight put my hand on it but the extremely pleasant and interesting impression of it abides with me i rejoice that you were moved to write it and that you didnt resist the generous movementsince i always find myself when the rare and blest revelationonce in a blue moontakes place the happier for the thought that i enjoy the sympathy of the gallant and intelligent young i shall send this to arthur benson with the request that he will kindly transmit it to yousince i fail thus provokingly of having your address before me i gather that you are about to hurl yourself into the deep sea of journalismthe more treacherous currents of which and they strike me as numerous i hope you may safely breast give me more news of this at some convenient hour and let me believe that at some propitious one i may have the pleasure of seeing you i never see acb in these days to my loss and sorrowand if this continues i shall have to depend on you considerably to give me tidings of him however my appeal to him my only resource to put you in possession of this will perhaps strike a welcome sparkso you see you are already something of a link believe me very truly yours   henry james      to george abbot james    lamb house rye dec 21st 1908    my dear dear george   how i wish i might for a while be with you or that you were here a little with me i am deeply touched by your letter which makes me feel all your desolation clearly you have lived for long years in a union so close and unbroken that what has happened is like a violent and unnatural mutilation and as if a part of your very self had been cut off leaving you to go through the movements of life without itmovements for which it had become to you indispensable your case is rare and wonderfulthe suppression of the other relations and complications and contacts of our common condition for the most partand such as no example of seems possible in this more infringing and insisting world over herewhich creates all sorts of inevitabilities of life round about one perhaps for props and crutches when the great thing fallsperhaps rather toward making any one and absorbing relation less intensei dont pretend to say but you sound to me so lonelyand i wish i could read more human furniture as it were into your void and i cant even speak as if i might plan for seeing youor dream of it with any confidence the roaring rushing world seems to me myselfwith its brutal and vulgar racketall the while a less and less enticing place for moving about inand i ask myself how one can think of your turning to it at this late hour and after the long luxury as it were of your so united and protected independence still what those we so love have done for us doesnt wholly fail us with their presenceisnt that true and you are feeling it at times im sure even while your ache is keenest in fact their so making us ache is one way for us of their being with us of our holding on to them after a fashion but i talk my dear george for mere tendernessand so i say vain wordswith only the fact of my tenderness a small thing to touch you i have known you from so far backand your image is vivid and charming to me through everythingthrough everything things abidegood thingsfor that time and we hold together even across the grey wintry sea near which perhaps we both of us are tonight i should have a lonely christmas here were not a young nephew just come to me from his oxford tutors you dont seem to have even that but you have the affectionate thought of yours always   henry james      to we norris   lamb house rye december 23rd 1908    my dear norris   i have immensely rejoiced to hear from you tonight though i swear on my honour that that has nothing to do with this inveterateisnt itand essentially pious pleasure belonging to the date of making you myself a sign i have had the sad sense for too long past of being horrid however of never having acknowledgedat the psychological momentyour beautiful and interesting last and it has been for me as if i should get no more than my deserts were you to refuse altogether any more commerce with me your noble magnanimity lifting that shadow from my spirit i perform this friendly function now with a lighter heart and a restored confidence being horrid in those ways none the less seems to announce itself as my final doom and settled attitude i grow horrider and horrider as a correspondent as i grow more aged and more obese without at the same time finding that my social air clears itself as completely as those vices or disfigurements would seem properly to guarantee most of my friends and relatives are dead and a due proportion of the others seem to be dying in spite of which my daily prospect these many months past has bristled almost overwhelmingly with people and to people more or less on the spot or just off it in motors and preparing to be more than ever on it again or most of all haling me up to town for feverish and expensive dashes in the name of damnable and more than questionable duties interests profits and pleasuresto such unaccountable and irrepressible hordes i say i keep having to sacrifice heavily the world to my great inconveniencethat is the london aggregation of itinsists on treating me as suburbanwhich gives me thus the complication without my having any of the corresponding ease if ease there be of the state and appalling is the immense incitement to that sort of invasion or expectation that the universal motoruse hereabouts compels one to reckon with but this is a profitless groandrawn from me by a particularly ravaged summer and autumn as it happensand at a season of existence and in general conditions in which one had fixed ones confidence on precious simplifications a house and a little garden and a little possible hospitality in a little supposedly picturesque place 60 miles from london are in short stiff final facts that in our more and more awful age utterly decline to be simplifiedand here i sit in the midst of them and exhale to you to you almost only my helpless plaint fortunately for the moment i take the worst to be over ive a younga very youngamerican nephew who has come to me from his oxford tutor to spend xmas and i have in order to amuse him engaged to go with him tomorrow and remain till saturday with some friends six miles hence but after that i cling to the vision of a great stretch of undevastated time here till april or better still may when i may go up to town for a month absorbing occupationsthe only ones i really care forawait me in abysmal arrearsbut i spare you my further overflow  it has kept me really all this time from saying to you what i had infinitely more on my mindhow my sense of your torquay life with all that violent sadness that great gust of extinction breathed upon it has kept you before me as a subject of much affectionate speculation of course youve picked up your life after a fashion but we never pick up alltoo much of it lies there broken and ended but i seem to see you going on as youre so gallantly capable of doing in the manner of one for whom nothing more has happened than you were naturally prepared for in a world that you decently abstain from characterizingand i congratulate you again on your mastery of the art of lifeof the torquay variety of it in particular we have to decide on the kind we will masterbut i havent mastered this kind i at any rate saw gosse in town some three weeks ago and he spoke of having seen you not long previous and of the excellent figure you made to him i didnt know you were therebut indeed a certain turmoil about me herespeaking as a man loving his own hours and his own companymust have been then i think at its thickest  i hope something or other pleasant has brushed you with its wingand even that youve been able to put forth a quick hand and seize it if so keep tight hold of itnurse it in your bosomfor 1909and believe me my dear norris yours always and ever   henry james      to mrs henry white        mr white was at this time american ambassador in paris     lamb house rye dec 29 1908    dearest margaret white   i sit here tonight i quite crouch by my homely little fireside muffled in soundless snowwhere the loud tick of the clock is the only soundand give myself up to the charmed sense that in your complicated career amid all the more immediate claims of the bonne année you have been moved to this delightful sign of remembrance of an old friend who is on the whole and has always been condemned to lose so much more of you through divergence of ways than he has been privileged to enjoy snatches snatches and happy and grateful momentsand then great empty yearning intervals onlyand under all the great ebbing melting and irrecoverableness of life but this is almost a happy and grateful momentalmost a real one i meanthough again with bristling frontiers long miles of land and water doing their best to make it vain and fruitless you live on the crest of the wave and i deep down in the hollowand your waves seem to be all crests just as mine are only concave formations i feel at any rate very much in the hollow these winter monthswhen great adventures like paris look far and formidable and i see a domestic reason for sitting tight wherever i turn my eyes that reads as if i had thirteen childrenor thirty wivesinstead of being so lone and lorn but what it means is that i have in profusion modest backward labours we have been having here lately the great and glorious pendulum in person mrs wharton on her return oscillation spending several weeks in england for almost the first time ever and having immense successso that i think she might fairly fix herself hereif she could stand it but she is to be at 58 rue de varenne again from the new year and you will see her and she will give you details my detail is that though she has kindly asked me to come to them again there this month or spring i have had to plead simple abject terrorterror of the pendulous life i am a stopped clockand i strike that is i caper about only when very much wound up now i dont have to be wound up at all to tell you what a yearning i have to see you all back hereand what a kind of sturdy faith that i absolutely shall then your crest will be much nearer my hollow and vice versa and you will be able to look down quite straight at me and we shall be almost together againas we really must manage to be for these interesting times to come i dont want to miss any more harrys freshness of return from the great countrywith the golden apples of his impression still there on the tree i have always only tasted them plucked by other hands andbaked i want to munch these with youen famille therefore i confidently await and evoke you i delight in these proofs of

lamb house rye new years eve 1908    my dear howells   i have a beautiful xmas letter from you and i respond to it on the spot it tells me charming things of yousuch as your moving majestically from one beautiful home to another apparently still more beautiful such as the flow of your inspiration never having been more various and more torrentialand all so deliciously remunerated an inspiration such as your having been on to dear c e ns obsequieswhat a cambridge date that even for you and meand having also found time to see and appreciate my dear collaterals of the two generations arent they extraordinarily good and precious collaterals such finally as your recognising with so fine a charity a message in the poor little old siege of london which in all candour affects me as pretty dim and rococo though i did lately find in going over it that it holds quite well together and i touched it up where i could i have but just come to the end of my really very insidious and ingenious labour on behalf of all that seriesthough it has just been rather a blow to me to find that ive come as yet to no reward whatever ive just had the pleasure of hearing from the scribners that though the edition began to appear some 13 or 14 months ago there is on the volumes already out no penny of profit owing meof that profit to which i had partly been looking to pay my new years bills it will have landed me in bankruptcyunless it picks up for it has prevented my doing any other work whatever which indeed must now begin i have fortunately broken ground on an american novel but when you draw my ear to the liquid current of your own promiscuous abundance and facilitya flood of many affluentsi seem to myself to wander by contrast in desert sands and i find our art all the while more difficult of practice and want with that to do it in a more and more difficult way it being really at bottom only difficulty that interests me which is a most accursed way to be constituted i should be passing a veryor a ratherinhuman little xmas if the youngest of my nephews williams minoreaged 18hadnt come to me from the tutors at oxford with whom he is a little woefully coaching but he is a dear young presence and worthy of the rest of the brood and ive just packed him off to the little rye annual subscription ball of new years eveat the old monasterywith a part of the county doubtless coming in to keep up the traditionunder the sternest injunction as to his not coming back to me engaged to a quadragenarian hack or a military widowthe mature women being here the greatest dancersyou tell me of your roman book but you dont tell me youve sent it me and i very earnestly wish you wouldthough not without suiting the action to the word and anything you put forth anywhere or anyhow that looks my way in the least i should be tenderly grateful for i should like immensely to come over to you againreally like it and for uses still  to be possible but its practically materially physically impossible too latetoo late the long years have betrayed mebut i am none the less constantly yours all   henry james      to edward lee childe    lamb house rye jan 8 1909    my dear old friend   please dont take my slight delay in thanking you for your last remembrance as representing any limit to the degree in which it touches me you are faithful and courtois and gallant in this unceremonious age to the point of the exemplary and the authoritativein the sense that vous y faites autorité and only the multitudinous waves of the christmastide and the new years high tide as all that matter lets itself loose in this country have kept me from landing correspondentially speaking straight at your door i like to know that you so admirably keep up your tone and your temper and even your interest and perhaps even as much your general faith as i try for that matter to do myself in spite of disconcerting years and discouraging sensationsonce in a way perhaps in spite briefly of earthquakes and newspapers and motorcars and aeroplanes i myself frankly have lost the desire to live in a situation by which i mean in a world in which i can be invaded from so many sides at once i go in fear i sit exposed and when the german emperor carries the next war hideous thought into this country my chimneypots visible to a certain distance out at sea may be his very first objective you may say that that is just a good reason for my coming to paris again all promptly and before he arrivesand indeed reasons for coming to paris as for doing any other luxurious or licentious thing never fail me the drawback is that they are all of the sophisticating sort against which i have much to brace myself if you were to see from what you summon me it would be brought home to you that a small rude sussex burgher must feel the strain of your parisian high pitch haute élégance general glittering life and conversation the strain of keeping up with it all and mingling in the fray  let me thank you further for indicating to me the new volumes by the duchesse de dinowhat a wealth of such stored treasures does the french world still at this time of day producewhen one would suppose the sack had been again and again emptied the literary supplement of this weeks times has a sympathetic review of the bookwhich i shall send for by reason of the duchess and the english reminiscences and not for any sake of talleyrand who always affects me as a repulsive figure such as i couldnt have borne to be in the same room with i should have asked you had i lately had a preliminary chance for a word of news of paul harvey and whether he is actually or still in egypt i wish madame marie all peace and plenty for the coming yearthough i am not sure i envy her lausanne in january but i am yours and hers all faithfully   henry james      to hugh walpole    lamb house rye  march 28th 1909    my dear hugh   i have had so bad a conscience on your score ever since last writing to you with that as yet unredeemed promise of my poor image or effigy that the benignity of your expressions has but touched me the more on coming to look up some decent photograph among the few odds and ends of such matters to be here brought out of hiding i found nothing that wasnt hateful to me to put into circulation i have been very little and very ill always very ill representedand not at all for a long time and shall never be again and of the two or three disinherited illustrations of that truth that i have put away for you to choose between you must come here and make selection yourself carrying them off my reluctant hand cant bring itself to send them heaven forbid such sendings  can you come some daysome saturdayin aprili mean after easter bethink yourself and let it be the 17th or the 24th if possible i expect to go up to town for four or five weeks the 1st may you are keeping clearly such a glorious holiday now that i fear you may hate to begin again but youll have with me in every way much shorter commons much sterner fare much less purple and fine linen and in short a much more constant reminder of your mortality than while you loll in a c bs chariot of fire therefore as i say come grimly down loll none the less however meanwhile to your utmostsuch opportunities i recognise are to be fondly cherished if you give a c b this news of me please assure him with my love that i am infinitely that i am yearningly aware of that hed see soon enough if he were some day to let me loll however i am going to cambridge for some as yet undetermined 48 hours in may and if he will let me loll for one of those hours at magdalene it will do almost as welli mean of course he being there however even if he does flee at my approachand the possession of a fleeingmachine must enormously prompt that sort of thingi rejoice immensely meanwhile that you have the kindness of him i am magnanimous enough for that likewise i am tenderhearted enough to be capable of shedding tears of pity and sympathy over young hugh on the threshold of fictive artand with the long and awful vista of large production in a largely producing world before him ah dear young hugh it will be very grim for you with your faithful and dismal friend   henry james      to mrs wharton    lamb house rye april 19th 1909    my dear edith   i thank you very kindly for your so humane and so interesting letter even if i must thank you a little brieflyhaving but this afternoon got out of bed to which the doctor three days ago consigned mefor a menace of jaundice which appears however to have been thank heaven averted i once had it and basta così so that i am a little shaky and infirm you give me a sense of endless things that i yearn to know more of and i clutch hard the hope that you will indeed come to england in june i have hadto be franka bad and worried and depressed and inconvenient winterwith the serpenttrail of what seemed at the timethe time you kindly offered me a princely hospitalitya tolerably ominous cardiac crisisas to which i have since however got considerable information and reassurancefrom the man in london most completely master of the subjectthat is of the whole mystery of hearttroubles i am definitely better of that condition of decemberjanuary and really believe i shall be better yet only that particular brush of the dark wing leaves one never quite the sameand i have not i confess with amelioration even been lately very famous which i shouldnt mention none the less were it not that i really believe myself for definite reasons and intelligent ones on the way to a much more complete emergenceboth from the above mentioned and from other worries so much mainly to explain to you my singularly unsympathetic silence during a period of anxiety and discomfort on your own part which i all the while feared to be not smallbut which i now see with all affectionate participation to have been extreme sit loose and live in the daydont borrow trouble and remember that nothing happens as we forecast itbut always with interesting and as it were refreshing differences tired you must be even you indeed and paris as i look at it from here figures to me a great blur of intense white light in which attached to the hub of a revolving wheel you are all whirled round by the finest silver strings mazes of heat and sound envelop you to my wincing visiongiven over as i am to a craven worship only henceforth of peace at any price this dusky village all deadening grey and damp muffling green meets more and more my supreme appreciation of stillnessand here in june you must come and find meto let me emphasize thatappreciationstill further youll rest with me here then but dont wait for that to rest somehowsomewhere en attendant i am afraid you wont rest much in a retreat on the place de la concorde however so does a poor old croaking barnyard fowl advise a golden eagle  i am dearest edith all constantly and tenderly yours   henry james      to arthur christopher benson    queens acre windsor june 5th 1909    my dear arthur   howard s has given me so kind a message from you that it is like the famous coals of fire on my erring headrenewing my rueful sense of having suffered these last days to prolong the too graceless silence that i have in your direction been constantly intending and constantly failing to break it isnt only that i owe you a letter but that i have exceedingly wanted to write itever since i began too many weeks ago to feel the value of the gift that you lately made me in the form of the acquaintance of delightful and interesting young hugh walpole he has been down to see me in the country and i have had renewed opportunities of him in townthe result of which is that touched as i am with his beautiful candour of appreciation of my feeble efforts etc i feel for him the tenderest sympathy and an absolute affection i am in general almostor very oftensorry for the intensely young intensely confident and intensely ingenuous and generousbut i somehow dont pity him for i think he has some gift to conciliate the fates i feel him at any rate an admirable young friend of the openest mind and most attaching nature and anything i can ever do to help or enlighten to guard or guide or comfort him i shall do with particular satisfaction and with a lively sense of being indebted to you for the interesting occasion of it of these last circumstances please be very sure  i go to cambridge next friday for almost the first time in my lifeto see a party of three friends whom i am in the singular position of never having seen in my life i shall be for two or three days with charles sayle 8 trumpington street and i confess to a hope of finding you there if so be it you can by chance be though if you flee before the turmoil of the days in question when everything i am told is at concert pitch i wont insist that i shant have understood it if you are at any rate at magdalene i should like very much to knock at your door and see you face to face for halfanhour if that may be possible and i wont conceal from you that i should like to see your college and your abode and your genre de vieeven though your countenance most of all if you are not in a manner well as howard hints to me i shant perhaps i cant make you any worseand i may make you a little better meditate on that and do in the connection what you can for me boldly at any rate shall i knock and if you are absent i shall yearn over the sight of your ancient walls  i am spending a dark cold dripping sunday herewith two or three other amis de la maison but above all with the ghosts somehow of a promiscuous past brushing me as with troubled wings and the echoes of the ancient years seeming to murmur to me dont you wish you were still youngor young againeven as they so wonderfully are my fellowvisitors and inexhaustibly softhearted host i dont know that i particularly do wish itbut the melancholy voices i mean the inaudible ones of the loquacious saloon have thus driven me to a rather cold room my own of refuge to invoke thus scratchily your fine friendly attention and to reassure you of the constant sympathy and fidelity of yours my dear arthur all gratefully   henry james      to charles sayle        for several years past h j had received a new year greeting from      three friends at cambridgemr charles sayle mr a t      bartholomew mr geoffrey keynesnone of whom he had met till he      went up to cambridge this month to stay with mr sayle during      mayweek it was on this occasion that he first met rupert brooke     reform club pall mall sw june 16th 1909    my dear charles sayle   i want to send you back a gratefuland gracefulgreetingand to let you all know that the more i think over your charming hospitality and friendly labour and so to speak loyal service the more i feel touched and convinced my three days with you will become for me a very precious little treasure of memorythey are in fact already taking their place in that character in a beautiful little innermost niche where they glow in a golden and rosecoloured light i have come back to sterner things you did nothing but beguile and waylaymaking me loll not only figuratively but literally so unforgettablyall that wondrous monday morning on perfect surfaces exactly adapted to my figure for their share in these generous yet so subtle arts please convey again my thanks to all concernedand in particular to the gentle geoffrey and the admirable theodore with a definite stretch toward the insidious rupertwith whose name i take this liberty because i dont know whether one loves ones love with a surname terminal e or not please take it from me all that i shall live but to testify to you further and in some more effective way than thismy desire for which is as a long rich vista that can only be compared to that adorable great perspective of st johns gallery as we saw it on saturday afternoon peace then be with youi hope it came promptly after the last strain and stress and all the rude porterage so appreciated to which i subjected you ill fetch and carry in some fashion or other for you yet and am ever so faithfully yours   henry james   ps just a momentary drop to meaner thingsto say that i appear to have left in my room a sleepingsuit blue and white pyjamasjacket and trousers which in the hurry of my departure and my eagerness to rejoin you a little in the garden before tearing myself away i probably left folded away under my pillows if your brave housekeeper who evaded my look about for her at the last will very kindly make of them such a little packet as may safely reach me here by parcels post she will greatly oblige yours again and hers   h j      to mrs wk clifford        the two plays on which hj was at work were the other house      written many years before and now revised and the outcry     lamb house rye  july 19th 1909    dearest lucy c   i have been a prey to agitations and complications many assaults invasions and inconveniences since leaving townwhereby i have had to put off thanking you for two brilliant letters and yet i have wanted to writeto tell you explaining how i found myself swallowed up by one social abyss after another and tangled in a succession of artful feminine webs at stafford house that evening so that i couldnt get into touch with you or with ethel again before you were gone as i found when i finally made a dash for you that too was very complicated and eveningparties bristle with dangers the very critical business of the final luminous copy is how ever coming to an endi mean the arriving at the utterly last intense reductions and compressions so much has to come out however that i am sickened and appalledand this sacrifice of the very lifeblood of ones play the mere vulgar anatomy and barebones poverty to which one has to squeeze it more and more is the nauseating side of the whole desperate job in spite of which i am interesting myself deeply in the three act comedy i have undertaken for frohmanand which i find ferociously difficultbut with a difficulty that thank god draws me on and fascinates if i can go on believing in my subject i can go on treating it but sometimes i have a mortal chill and wonder if i aint damnably deluded however the balance inclines to faith and i think it works out you shall hear what comes of iteven at the worst meanwhile for yourself dearest lucy buck up and patiently woo the muse she responds at last always to true and faithful wooingto the right artful patienceand turns upon one the smile from which light breaks i have been reading over the long duel which i immediately returnwith a sense of its having great charm and care of execution and quality and grace but also dear lucy of its drawbacks for practical prosperity the greatest of these seems to me to be fundamentalto reside in the fact that the subject isnt dramatic that it deals with a state a position a situation of the static kind and not save in a very minor degree with an action a progression which fact highly favourable to it for a tale a psychologic picture is detrimental to its tensenessto its being matter for a play and developed into 4 acts a play appears to me of necessity to involve a struggle a question of whether and how will it or wont it happen and if so or not so how and whywhich we have the suspense the curiosity the anxiety the tension in a word of seeing and which means that the whole thing shows an attack upon oppositionswith the victory or the failure on one side or the other and each wavering and shifting from point to point but your hero is thus not an agent he is passive he doesnt take the field i say all this because i think there is light on the matter of the history of the fate of the play in itand also think that there are other elements of disadvantage for the piece too the elderly or almost french artist with a virtuous lovesorrow doesnt for the bp belong to the actual hes romantic and oldfashionedly romantic and remote and the case is aggravated by the corresponding maturity of the heroine you will say that there is the young couple and what comes of their being there and their action but the truth about that i fear is that innocent young lovers as such and not as being engaged in other difficulties and with other oppositions of their own have practically ceased to be a dramatic valuearent any longer an element or an interest to conjure with dont hate me for saying these thingsfor working them out critically and so far as may be illuminatingly in face of the difficulty the ld seems to have had in getting itself brought out we are dealing with an art prodigiously difficult and arduous every wayand in which one seems most of all to sink into a sea of colossal waste im not sure that the other house after all my nottobereckoned labour and calculation on it isnt to be wasted but these are dreary wordsit is much past midnight i am damned criticalfor its the only thing to be and all else is damned humbug but i dont mean a douche of cold water and am ever so tenderly and faithfully yours   henry james      to miss grace norton    lamb house rye  august 10th 1909   i break ground with you thus dear grace late in the evening too latefor i shall soon have to go most belatedly to bed of a singularly beautiful and glowingly hot summers dayone of a succession that august has at last brought us and with more apparently in store after a wholly damnable june and july a hideous ordeal of wet and cold english fine weather is worth waiting forit is so sovereign in quality when it comes and the capacity of this little place of a few marked odd elements to become charming to shine and flush and endear itself is then so admirable i went out for my afternoon walk under stress of having promised my good little gardener a real pearl of pricethese eleven yearsin the way of a servingman to come and witness his possible triumphs at our annual little horticultural show given this year in some charming private grounds on a high hill overlooking our little huddled and lowerhilled purple town there i found myself in the extraordinary positionsave that other summers mightbut haventsoftened the edge of the monstrosityof seeing henry james esq figure on thirteen large cards commemorative of first second and third prizesand of more first even if you can believe it than the others it always seems to point more than anything else the moral for me of my long expatriation and to put its advantages into a nutshell in what corner of our native immensity could i have fallenand practically without effort helpless ignoramus though i beinto the uncanny flourish of a swell at local flower shows here it has come of itselfand it crowns my career how i wish you werent too far away for me to send you a box of my victorious carnations and my triumphant sweet peas however i remember your telling me with emphasis long years ago that you hated cut flowers and i have treasured your brave heresy the memory of it so ineffaceably so as to find support in it always and fine precedent for a very lukewarm adhesion to them myself except for a slight inconsistency in the matter of roses and sweet peas both supremely lovable i think in their kind which increase and multiply and bless one in proportion as one tears them from the stem however its 130 am oclockand i am putting this to bed till tomorrow night again when i shall pull it forth and add to its yearning volume i have to write at night and even late at nightto write letterthings at all for the simple reason of being so vilely constituted for work that when my regularly recurring morning stint is done from after breakfast to luncheontime i am done utterly and so cerebrally spent with the effort to distil quality for three or four hours that i cant touch a pen till as much as possible of the day has elapsed to build out and disconnect my mornings association with it that is one reasonand always has beenof my baseness as a correspondent the question is whether the effect i produce as a story writer is of a nature to make up for it you will say most certainly notand who shall blame you but goodnight and à demain  august 11th i dont mean this to be a diarybut it has been another splendid summer dayand i am wondering if you sit in the loose but warm embrace of bowery cambridge every now and then i read in the times of 92° in the shade in america and cambridge is so intensely your america that i ask myselfthough my imagination breaks down in the effort to place you anywhere even as i write again by my late ticking clock in this hot stillness but in the vinetangled porch where i sat so often anciently but only a little alas that other more often and more variously hindered year it has been almost 92° in the shade or has almost felt like it here today in spite of which i tookand enjoyeda long slow walk over the turf by our tidal channel here which goes straight forth to the channel and over to france at the end of a mile or two and has a beautiful colour at the flow  im spending a very quiet summer to which the complete absence of any visiting or sojourning relative a frequent and prized feature with me most other years gives a rather melancholy blankness but im hoping for a nephew or twowilliams bill that is next month and meanwhile the season melts in my grasp and ebbs with an appalling rush dont you find at our age for there are still things i want to do and i ask myself at such a rate how i lately as i think ive mentioned spent a couple of months in london and saw as much as i could of sally and lily whom i found most agreeable and confirmed in their respective types of charm and character lily is still in englandand of course you know all about heri hope to have her with me here before long for a couple of days but there is nothing i more wonder at dear grace than the question of what cambridge has become to you or seems to you without practically a shady hill after the long years it must be altogether much of a changed worldand thus afar off i wonder it is a way of getting again into communication with you or at any rate of making you a poor wild and wandering sign as over broken and scarce sounding wires of the perfect affectionate fidelity of your firm old friend my dear grace of all and all the wonderful years   henry james      to william james    lamb house rye  aug 17th 1909    dearest william   i respond without delay to the blessing of your letter of the 6thwhich gives me so general a good impression of you all that i must somehow celebrate it i like to think of your tranquilif the word be the least applicablechocorua summer and as the time of year comes round again of my sole poor visit there my mere fortnight from september 1st 1904 the yearning but baffled thought of being with you on that woodland scene and at the same season once more tugs at my sensibilities and is almost too much for me i have the sense of my then leaving it all unsated after a beggarly snatch only and of how i might have done with so much more of it but i shall pretty evidently have to do with what i got the very smell and sentiment of the american summers end there and of alices beautiful rustic hospitality of overflowing milk and honey to say nothing of squash pie and icecream in heroic proportions all mingle for me with the assault of forest and lake and of those delicious orchardy yet rocky vaguenesses and arcadian nowheres which are the note of what is sweetest and most attaching in the dear old american or particularly new england scenery it comes back to me as with such a magnificent beckoning loosenessin relieving contrast to the consummate tightness a part too oddly of the very wealth of effect du pays dici it isnt however luckily that i have really turned agin my landscape portion here for never so much as this summer eg have i felt the immensely noble the truly aristocratic beauty of this splendid county of sussex especially as the winged car of offence has monstrously unfolded it to me this afternoon an amiable neighbour mrs richard hennessy motored me over to hurstmonceux castle which in spite of its being but about ten miles back of hastings and not more than twenty from here i had never yet seen its a prodigious romantic ruin in an adorable old ruined park but the splendour of the views and horizons and of the rich composition and perpetual picture and inexhaustible detail of the country had never more come home to me i dont do such things however every day thank goodness and am having the very quietest summer i think that has melted away for me how they do melt since i came to live here i miss the tie of consanguinitythat i have so often feltand now especially since your letter for you mention his other plans i find myself calling on the hopedfor bill in vain we lately have had it broke but yesterday a splendid heated termvery highly heatedfollowing on a wholly detestable june and july and having lasted without a lapse the whole month up to nowwhich has been admirable and enjoyable and of a renewed consecration to this dear little old garden i hope it hasnt broken for good as complications of sorts loom for me next monthbut the high possibility is that we shall still have earned and have suffered for in advance a fine augustend and september my window is open wide even nowbut to the blustering softlystorming southwindy midnight and through thick and thin i have been very quietly and successfully working it all pans out i think in a very promising way but it is too important for me to chatter about save on the proved or proveable basis that now seems rather largely to await it and i grow i think small step by small step physically easier and easier and seem to know pretty steadily more and more where i am i have been following you and alice in imagination to the kind and beautiful intervale hospitalitymy charming taste of which has remained with me ever so gratefully and uneffacedly please tell the merrimans when you have another chance you tell me that alice and harry lift all practical burdens from your geniusthan which they surely couldnt have a nobler or a more inspiring taskbut what a fate and a fortune yours tooto have an alice reinforced by a harry and a harry multiplied by an alice lun vaut lautreas they appear to me in the wondrous harmony you dont mention harrys getting to you at allbut my mind recoils with horror from the thought that he is not in these days getting somewhere its a blow to me to learn that bill is again to hibernate in bostonbut softened by what you so delightfully tell me of your portrait and of the nature and degree of his progress if he can do much and get on so there why right he is of course to stayand most interesting is it to learn that he can do so much i wish i could see somethingand cant your portrait be photographed but i lately wrote to him appealingly and he will explain to me all things admirable your evocation of the brave and brown and beautiful pegof whom i wish i werent so howlingly deprived but please tell her i drench her with her old uncles proudest and fondest affection i hang tenderly over aleckwhile he poor boy hangs so toughly over god knows whatand fervently do i pray for him and you and alice i embrace   ever your henry      to h g wells    lamb house rye  october 14th 1909    my dear wells   i took down ann veronica in deep rich draughts during the two days following your magnanimous donation of her and yet have waited till now to vibrate to you visibly and audibly under that pressed spring i never vibrated under anything of yours on the whole i think more than during that intense inglutition but if i have been hanging fire of acclamation and comments as i hung it to my complete selfstultification and beyond recovery over tonobungay it is simply because confound you there is so much too much to say always after everything of yours and the critical principle so rages within me by which i mean the appreciative the real gustatory that i tend to labour under the superstition that one must always say all but i cant do that and i wontso that i almost intelligently and coherently choose which simplifies a little the question and nothing matters after the fact that you are to me so much the most interesting representational and ironic genius and faculty of our anglosaxon world and life in these bemuddled days that you stand out intensely vivid and alone making nobody else signify at all and this has never been more the case than in av where your force and life and ferocious sensibility and heroic cheek all take effect in an extraordinary wealth and truth and beauty and fury of impressionism the quantity of things done in your whole picture excites my liveliest admirationso much so that i was able to let myself go responsively and assentingly under the strength of the feeling communicated and the impetus accepted almost as much as if your method and fifty other thingsby which i mean sharp questions coming upleft me only passive and convinced unchallenging and uninquiring which they dontno they dont i dont think as regards this latter point that i can make out what your subject or idea the prime determinant one may be detected as having been lucidity and logic on that score not to my sense reigning supreme but there i am as if i were wanting to say allwhich im not now i find a bit i only want to say that the thing is irresistible or indescribable in its subjective assurance and its rare objective vividness and colour you must at moments make dear old dickens turnfor envy of the eye and the ear and the nose and the mouth of youin his grave i dont think the girl herselfher projected egothe best thing in the booki think it rather wants clearness and nuances but the men are prodigious all and the total result lives and kicks and throbs and flushes and glaresi mean hangs there in the very air we breathe and that you are a very swagger performer indeed and that i am your very gaping and grateful   henry james      to miss henrietta reubell        crapy cornelia embodiment of the new york of hjs youth will      be remembered as one of the stories in the finer grain     lamb house rye  oct 19 1909    dearest etta reubellmy very old friend indeed   your letter charms and touches me and i rejoice you were moved to write it you have understood crapy corneliaand people so very often seem not to understandthat that alone gives me pleasure but when you tell me also of my now living really in green and gold in the dear little old petit salon and almost resting on the beloved red velvet sofa on whichin other daysi so often myself have rested and which figures to me as the basis or background of a hundred delightful hours the tears quite rise to my eyes and i have a sense of success in life that few other things have ever given me i have not had a very good yeara baddish crisis about a twelvemonth ago but i have gradually worked out of it and the prospect ahead is fairer i really think i shall even be able to come and see you and sit on the immemorial sofa and see my kind and serried shelves play their part in your musée and figure as a class by themselves among your relicsand to have that emotion i am capable of a great effort i have great occasional bouffées of fond memory and longing from our dear old past paris it affects me as rather ghosty but life becomes more and more that and i have learnt to live with my pale spectres more than with my ruddy respirers they will sit thick on the old red sofa but with you the shepherdess of the flock it will be all right you are not cornelia but i am much whitemason and i shall again sit by your fire   your toutdévoué henry james      to william james    lamb house rye  october 31st 1909    dearest william   i have beautiful communications from you all too long unacknowledged and unrequitedthough i shall speak for the present but of the two most prized letters from you from cambridge and chocorua respectivelynot counting quaint sequels from franconia autumntint postcards etc a few days ago or thereabouts and leaving aside altogether but only for later fond treatment please assure them an admirable one from harry and an exquisite one from bill to these i add the arrival still more recently of your brave new book which i fell upon immediately and have quite passionately absorbedto within 50 pages of the end a great number previous to which i have read this eveningwhich makes me late to begin this i find it of thrilling interest triumphant and brilliant and am lost in admiration of your wealth and power i palpitate as you make out your case since it seems to me you so utterly do as i under no romantic spell ever palpitate now and into that case i enter intensely unreservedly and i think you would allow almost intelligently i find you nowhere as difficult as you surely make everything for your critics clearly you are winning a great battle and great will be your fame your letters seem to me to reflect a happy and easy summer achievedand i recognise in them with rapture and i trust not fallaciously a comparative immunity from the horrid human incubi the awful people fallacy of the past and your ruinous sacrifices to that bloody moloch may this luminous exemption but grow and grow and with it your personal and physical peace and sufficiency your profitable possession of yourself amen amenover which i hope dear alice hasnt lieu to smile  november 1st i broke this off last night and went to bedand now add a few remarks after a grey soft windless and miraculously rainless day under a most rainful sky which has had rather a sad hole made in it by a visitation from a young person from new york  who stole from me the hour or two before my small evening feed in which i hoped to finish the meaning of truth but i have done much toward this since that repast and with a renewed eagerness of inglutition you surely make philosophy more interesting and living than anyone has ever made it before and by a real creative and undemolishable making whereby all you write plays into my poor creative consciousness and artistic vision and pretension with the most extraordinary suggestiveness and force of application and inspiration thank the powersthat is thank yoursfor a relevant and assimilable and referable philosophy which is related to the rest of ones intellectual life otherwise and more conveniently than a fowl is related to a fish in short dearest william the effect of these collected papers of your present volumewhich i had read all individually beforeseems to me exquisitely and adorably cumulative and so to speak consecrating so that i for my part feel pragmatic invulnerability constituted much will this suffrage help the causenot less inspiring to me for that matter is the account you give in your beautiful letter of october 6th from chocorua of alice and the offspring bill and peggot in particular confirming so richly all my previous observation of the son and letting in such rich further lights upon the daughter i mean truly to write her straight and supplicate her for a letter  but goodnight againas my thoughts flutter despairingly of attainment toward your farawayness under the hope that the cambridge autumn is handsome and wholesome about you i yearn over alice to the point of wondering if some day before xmas she may find a scrap of a moment to testify to me a little about the situation with her now too unfamiliar pen oh if you only can next summer come out for two years this home shall be your fortress and temple and headquarters as never never even before i embrace you alli send my express love to mrs gibbensand am your fondest of brothers   henry james      to mrs wharton    lamb house rye  december 13th 1909    dear edith   im horribly in arrears with you and it hideously looks as if i hadnt deeply revelled and rioted in your beautiful german letter in particularwhich thrilled me to the core you are indeed my ideal of the dashing woman and you never dashed more felicitously or fruitfully for my imagination than when you dashed at that particular psychologic moment off to dear old rococo munich of the initials of my tender youth and again of my faraway 30th year ive never been there depuis vivid and charming and sympathetic au possible your image and echo of it all only making me gnash my teeth that i wasnt with you or that at least i cant ply you face to face with more questions even than your letter delightfully anticipates it came to me during a fortnight spent in londonand all letters that reach me there when im merely on the branch succeed in getting themselves treasured up for better attention after im back here but the real difficulty in meeting your gorgeous revelations as they deserve is that of breaking out in sympathy and curiosity at points enoughand leaping with you breathless from schiller to tiepolothrough all the gothicry of augsburg würzburg und so weiter i want the rest none the lessall the rest after augsburg and the weinhandlung and above all how it looks to you from paris if not paradise regained againin respect to which gaping contrast i am immensely interested in your superlative commendation of the ensemble and welldoneness of the second play at munich though it is at cabale und liebe that i ache and groan to the core for not having been with you it is curious how a strange deepburied teutonism in one without detriment to the tropical forest of surface and halfwaydown latinism stirs again at moments under stray germanic souffles and makes one so far from being sorry to be akin to the race of goethe and heine and dürer and their kinship at any rate i rejoice that you had your plungewhich the whole pride and pomp of which makes me sit here with the feeling of a mere aged british pauper in a workhouse however of course i shant get real thrilling and throbbing items and illustrations till i have them from your lips to which remote and precarious possibility i must resign myself and now i am back here fori hopemany weeks to come having a morbid taste for some even mostthough not allof the midwinter conditions of this place turkeys and mince pies are being accumulated for xmas as well as calendars penwipers and formidable lists of persons to whom tips will be owing a fine old yuletide observance in general quoi but good nighttanti saluti affetuosi   ever your  h j      to madame wagnière    lamb house rye  dec 22nd 1909    my dear laura wagnière   the general turmoil of the years end has done its best to prevent my sooner expressing to you my great rejoicing in all the pleasantness of your news of your settled state by the plus beau des lacs a consummation on which i heartily congratulate you both a real rest for the soles of ones feet a receptacle and domestic temple for ones battered possessions is what i myself found better than i had ever found it before some dozen years ago in this decent nook and i feel i can only wish you to even get half as much good of it as i have got of my small impregnable strongholdor better still incorruptible hermitage yours isnt a hermitage of course since hermits dontin spite of st anthony and his famous complications or rather and doubtless by reason of themhave wives or female friends and very holy women dont even have husbands  but its evidently a delightful place on which i cast my benediction and which i shall rejoice some day to see so that you must let me tenderly nourish the hope i have always had and from far back my première jeunesse a great sentiment for all your vaudois lake shore i remember perfectly your tour de peilz neighbourhood and at the thought of all the beauty and benignity that crowds your picture i envy you as much as i applaud if i did not live in this country and in this possibility of contact with london for which i have many reasons i think i too would fix myself in switzerland and in your conveniently cosmopolite part of it where you are in the very centre of europe and of a whole circle of easy communications and excursions i was immensely struck with the way the simplon tunnel makes a deliciously near thing of italy the last and first time i came through it a couple of years ago and when i remember how when i left milan well after luncheon i was at my hotel at lausanne at 1030 or so your position becomes quite ideal granting the proposition that one doesnt any longer so much want to live in that unspeakable country as to feel whenever one will well on the way to it and you are on the way to so many other of the interesting countries the roads to which all radiate from you as the spokes from the hub of a wheelwhich remarks however you will have all been furiously making to yourselves all i say because i suppose marguerite is now with you and i dont suppose that even she wants to be always on the way to boston only  i hope you are having làbas a less odious year than we poverini who only see it go on from bad to worse the deluge en permanence with mud up to our necks and a consequent confinement to the house that is like an interminable stormy sea voyage under closed hatches i have now spent some ten or eleven winters mainly in the country and find myself reacting violently at last in favour of pavements or street lamps and lighted shop frontsplaces where one can go out at 4 or at 5 or at 6 if the deluge has been on the hour before and has mercifully abated here at 5 or 6 the plunge is only into black darkness and the abysmal crotte aforesaid i dont say this to discourage you for i am sure you have shopfronts and pavements and tramcars highly convenient and also without detriment to the charminglooking house of which you send me the likeness it is evidently a most sympathetic spot and i shall positively try on some propitious occasion to knock at its door i envy you the drop into italy that you will have by this time made or come back from after meeting your daughter i send her my kindest remembrance and the same to her father  i catch the distracted post so distracted and distracting at this british xmastide and am dear laura wagnière your affectionate old friend   henry james      to thomas sergeant perry    lamb house rye  dec 22 1909    my dear thomas   as usual my silence has become so dense and coagulated that you might cut monstrous slabs and slices off it for distribution in your familywere you maliciously disposed but my whole securityas my whole decency so far as claim to decency for myself goesis that we are neither of us malicious and that i have often enough shown you before that deep as i may seem to plunge into the obscure there ever comes an hour when panting and puffing as even now my head emerges again to say nothing of my heart i have treasured your petit mot from a point of space unidentified but despatched from a hollandamerica ship and bearing a french and a pasdecalais postagestamp a bit bewilderinglytreasured it for the last month as a link with your receding form the recession of which makes me miss your presence in this hemisphere out of proportion somehow to theto anyfrequency with which fortune enables me to enjoy it but i still keep hold of the pledge that your retention as i understand you of your paris apartment constitutes toward your soon coming backand really feel that with a return under your protection and management absolutely guaranteed me i too should have liked to tempt again the adventure with you should have liked again to taste of the natal airand perhaps even in a wider draught than you will go in for however i have neither your youth your sinews nor your fortunelet alone your other domestic blessings and reinforcementsand somehow the memory of what was fierce and formidable in our colossal country the last time i was there prevails with me over softer emotions and i feel i shall never alight on it again save as upborne on the wings of some miracle that isnt in the least likely to occur the nearest i shall come to it will be in my impatience for your return with the choice collection of notes i hope you will have taken for me you have chosen a good year for absencei mean a deplorable an infamous one in europe for any joy or convenience of air or weather the pleasant land of france lies soaking as well as this more confessed and notorious sponge i believeand i have now for months found life no better than a beastly seavoyage of storms and submersions under closed hatches we rot with dampness confinement and despairin short we are reduced to the abjectness as you see of literally talking weather you will see our nephew bill i trust promptly in your rich artworld làbas and i beg you to add your pressure to mine on the question of our absolutely soon enjoying him over here i am under a semidemipledge to go to paris for a fortnight in aprilbut it would be a more positive prospect i think if i knew i were to find you all there give my bestest love to lilla please and my untutored homages to the daughters of music try to see howells chez luiso as to bring me every detail feel thus how much i count on you and receive from me every invocation proper to this annual crisis may the genius of our common country have you in its mostor leastenergetic keeping yours my dear thomas ever   henry james      to owen wister        the links will be recognised in this letter with h js old      friend mrs fanny kemble her daughters were mrs leigh wife of      the dean of hereford and the mother of mr owen wister     lamb house rye  dec 26th 1909    dearest owen   your so benevolent telegram greatly touches me and i send you off this slowertravelling but all faithful and affectionate acknowledgment within an hour or two of receiving it it hasnt told me muchsave indeed that you sometimes think of me and are moved as it were toward me and that verilythough i am incapable of supposing the contraryis not a little what i miss and deplore is some definite knowledge of how you aredeeply aware as i am that it adds a burden and a terror to illhealth to have to keep reporting to ones friends how ill one isor isnt thats the last thing i dream of from youand i possess my soul and my desire for you in patienceor i try to i dont see any one however whom i can appeal to for light about youfor i missed most lamentably florence la farge during her heartbreaking little mockery of sixteen days in england a few weeks ago she having written me in advance that she would come and see me and then within a few hours after her arrival engaged herself so deep that she apparently couldnt manage itnor i manage to get to london during the snatch of time she was there for she was mainly in the country only i had had an idea that she would authentically know about you and had i seen her i would have pumped her dry i was at the deanery for three or four days in september quite incrediblyfor the hereford festival and they were most kind the dean dear and delightful beyond even his ancient dearness etc but we only could fondly speculate and vainly theorize and yearn over youand that didnt see us much forrarder that i hope you are safe and sound again and firm on your feet and planning and tending somehow hitherwardthat i hope this with fierce intensity i need scarcely assure you need i but the years melt away and the changes multiply and the facilities some of them diminish the sands in the hourglass run in short and sister anne comes down from her tower and says she sees nothing of you but here i am where you last left meand writing even now late at night in the little old oaken parlour where we had such memorable and admirable discourse the sofa on which you stretched yourself is there behind meand it holds out appealing little padded arms to you i dont seem to recognise any particular nearness for my being able to revisit your prodigious scene the more the chill of age settles upon me the more formidable it seems and i havent myself had a very famous year herefor a few months in fact rather a bad and perturbing one but which has considerably cleared and redeemed itself now we are just emerging from the rather deadly oppression of the english xmastidewhich i have spent at home for the first time for four yearsa lone and lorn and stranded friend or two being with me with a long breath of relief that the worst is over terrific postal matter has accumulated howeverand the arrears of my correspondence make me quail and almost collapse you see in this already the rather weary hand and headbut please feel and find in it too with my true blessing on your wife and weans all the old affection of your devoted   henry james      vii  rye and chelsea  19101914   for the next yearthat is for the whole of 1910henry james was under the shadow of an illness partly physical but mainly nervous which deprived him of all power to work and caused him immeasurable suffering of mind in spite of a constitution that in many ways was notably strong the question of his health was always a matter of some concern to him and he was by nature inclined to anticipate trouble so that his temperament was not one that would easily react against a malady of which the chief burden was mental depression of the darkest kind it would be impossible to exaggerate the distress that afflicted him for many months but his determination to surmount it was unshaken and his recovery was largely a triumph of will fortunately he had the most sympathetic help at hand over and above devoted medical care professor and mrs william james had planned to spend the summer in europe again and when they heard of his condition they hastened out to be with him as soon as possible the company of his beloved brother and sisterinlaw was the best in the world for himindeed he could scarcely face any other only with their support he felt able to cover the difficult stages of his progress it was william jamess health once more that had made europe necessary for him he was in fact much more gravely ill than his brother but it was not until later in the summer that his state began to cause alarm by that time henry after paying a visit with his sisterinlaw to mr and mrs charles hunter at epping had joined him at nauheim in germany where a very anxious situation had to be met while william james was losing ground henry was still suffering greatly and the prospect of being separated from his family by their return to america was unendurable to him it was decided that he should go with them and they sailed before the end of august they had just received the news of the death in america of their youngest brother robertson james whose epitaph memorial of an agitated and agitating life was afterwards written with grave tenderness in the notes of a son and brother  william james sank very rapidly as they made the voyage and the end came when they reached his home in the new hampshire mountains there is no need to say how deeply henry mourned the loss of the nearest and dearest friend of his whole life nothing can be added to the letters that will presently be read all the more he clung to his brothers family the centre of his profoundest affection he remained with them during the winter at cambridge where very gradually he began to emerge from the darkness of depression and to feel capable of work again he took up with interest a suggestion made to him by mrs william james that he should write some account of his parents and his early life and as this idea developed in his mind it fed the desire to return home and devote himself to a record of old memories he lingered on in america however for the summer of 1911 now so much restored that he could enjoy visits to several friends he welcomed furthermore two signs of appreciation that reached him almost at the same timethe offer of honorary degrees at harvard and at oxford the harvard degree was conferred before he left america the oxford doctorate of letters in the following year when he received it in the company of the poet laureate  as soon as he was established at lamb house again september 1911 he set to work upon a small boy and others and for a long time to come he was principally occupied with this book and the sequel to it he went abroad no more and was never long away from rye or london but his power of regular work was not what it had been before his illness and excepting a few of the papers in notes on novelists the two volumes of reminiscences were all that he wrote before the end of 1913 his health was still an anxiety and his letters show that he began to regard himself as definitely committed to the life of an invalid yet it would be easy perhaps to gain a wrong impression from them of his state during these years his physical troubles were certainly sometimes acute but he kept his remarkable capacity for throwing them off and in converse with his friends his vigour of life seemed to have suffered little he had always loved slow and lengthy walks with a single companion and possibly the most noticeable change was only that these became slower than ever with more numerous pauses at points of interest or for the development of some picturesque turn of the talk the grassy stretches between rye and its seashore were exactly suited to long afternoons of this kind and with a friend better still a nephew or niece to walk with him such was the occupation he preferred to any other for the winter and spring he continued to return to london where he still had his clublodging in pall mall after a sharp and very painful illness at rye in the autumn of 1912 he moved into a more convenient dwellinga small flat in cheyne walk overhanging the chelsea riverside here the long level of the embankment gave him opportunities of exercise as agreeable in their way as those at rye and he found himself liking to stay on in this simplified london until the height of the summer  april 15 1913 was his seventieth birthday and a large company nearly three hundred in number of his english circle seized the occasion to make him a united offering of friendship they asked him to allow his portrait to be painted by one of themselves mr john s sargent henry james was touched and pleased and for the next year the fortunes of mr sargents work are fully recorded in the correspondencefrom its happy completion and the private view of it in the artists studio to the violence it suffered at the hands of a political agitatress while it hung in the royal academy exhibition of 1914 and its successful restoration from its injuries the picture now belongs to the national portrait gallery on mr sargents commission a bust of henry james was at the same time modelled by mr derwent wood  early in 1914 after an interval of all but ten years henry james began what he had often said he should never begin againa long novel it was the novel at last of american life long ago projected and abandoned and now revived as the ivory tower slowly and with many interruptions he proceeded with it and he was well in the midst of it when he left chelsea for lamb house in july 1914 his health was now on a better level than for some time past and he counted on a peaceful and fruitful autumn of work at rye     to t bailey saunders    l h  jan 27th 1910    my dear bailey   i am still in bed attended by doctor and nurse but doing very well and mending now very steadily and smoothlyso that i hope to be practically up early next week also i am touched by and appreciative of your solicitude you see i still cling to syntax or style or whatever it is but i have had an infernal time reallyi may now confide to youpretty well all the while since i left you that sad and sinister morning to come back from the station a digestive crisis making food loathsome and nutrition impossibleand sick inanition and weakness and depression permanent however bed the good skinner md the gentle nurse with very small feedings administered every 2 hours have got the better of the cursed state and i am now hungry and redeemed and convalescent the election fight has revealed to me how ardent a liberal lurks in the cold and

tumbles wrongeven when one has wanted to make the most delicate geste in life but the great thing is that we always tumble togethermore and more never apart and that for that happy exercise and sweet coincidence of agility we may trust ourselves and each other to the end of time so i gratefully grovel for everythingand for your beautiful and generous inquiry of skinner  more than even anything else the purple clusters are none the less of a prime magnificence and of an inexpressible relevance to my state this is steadily betteringthanks above all to three successive morning motorrides that skinner has taken me of an hour and a half each today in fact nearly two hours while he goes his rounds in a fairly far circuit over the countryside i sit at cottage and farmhouse doors while he warns and comforts and commands within and these days having been mild and grey and convenient the effect has been of the last benignity i am thus exceedingly sustained and also by the knowledge that you are not being wrenched from your hardbought foyer and your neighbourhood to your best of brothers cramponnezvousy i dont ask you about poor great parisi make out as i can by mortons playing flashlight

february 20th 1910    my dear eternally martyred and murdered goody   i am horribly ashamed to have my poor hand forced you see what it is and what its reduced to into piling up on your poor burdened consciousness the added load of my base woes as if you werent lying stretched flat beneath the pressure of your own and those of some special dozen or two of your most favourite and fatal vampires i proposed you should know nothing of mine till they were all overif they ever should be which they are not quite yet and that if one had to speak of them to you at all it might thus be in the most pluperfect of all past tenses and twiddling ones fingers on the tip of ones nose quite vulgarly as to intimate that you were a day after the fair but why do i unfold this gruesome tale when just what i most want is not to wring your insanely generous heart or work upon your perversely exquisite sensibility i am pulling through and though ive been so often somewhat better only to find myself topple back into black despairwith bad vilely bad days after good ones and not a very famous one todayi do feel that i have definitely turned the corner and got the fiend down even though he still kicks as viciously as he can yet manage i am up and dressed and in short i eatafter a fashion and have regained considerable weight oh i had become the loveliest sylph and even i am told a certain charm of appearance my good nephew harry james priceless youth my elder brothers eldest son sailed from ny yesterday to come out and see meand that alone lifts up my heartfor i have felt a very lonesome and stranded old idiot my conditions of circumstance house and care c have on the other hand been excellentmy servants angels of affection and devotion i have indeed been all in doctors and nurses hands so dont take it hard now take it utterly easy and allow your charity to stray a little by way of a change into your own personal premises take a look in there and let it even make you linger to hear you are doing that will do me more good than anything else  i yearn unutterably to get on far enough to begin to plan to come up to town for a while i have of late reacted intensely against this exile from some of the resources of civilization in winterand deliriously dream of some future footing in london again other than my club for the space of time between xmas or so and june what is the rent of a houseunfurnished of course a little good inside onein your terraceand are there any with 2 or 3 servants bedrooms  dont answer this absurdity nowbut wait till we go and look at 2 or 3 together such is the recuperative yearning of your enfeebled but not beatenyou can see by this scrawlold   h j      to mrs bigelow    lamb house rye  april 19th 1910    my dear edith   i have been much touched by your solicitude but till now absolutely too bad to writeto do anything but helplessly yearningly languish and suffer and surrender i have had a perfect hell of a timesince just after xmasnearly 15 long weeks of dismal dreary interminable illness with occasional slight pickingsup followed by black relapses but the tide thank the powers has at last definitely turned and i am on the way to getting not only better but as i believe creepily and abjectly well i sent my nurse my second flying the other day after ten deadly weeks of her and her predecessors aggressive presence and policy and the mere relief from that overdone discipline has done wonders for me i must have patience much yetbut my face is toward the light which shows beautifully that i look ten years older with my bonny tresses ten degrees whiter like marie antoinettes in the conciergerie however if ive lost all my beauty and by my expenses most of my money i rejoice ive kept my friends and i shall come and show you that appreciation yet i am so delighted that you and the daughterling had your go at italyeven though i was feeling so preeminently unitalian the worst of that paradise is indeed that one returns but to purgatories at the best have a little patience yet with your still struggling but all clinging   henry james      to w e norris    hill hall theydon bois epping  may 22nd 1910    my dear norris   forgive a very brief letter and a very sad one in which i must explain long and complicated things in a very few words i have had a dismalthe most dismal and interminable illness going on these five months nearly since christmasand of which the end is not yet and of which all this later stage has been these ten or twelve weeks a development of nervous conditions agitation trepidation black melancholia and weakness of athe mostformidable and distressing kind my brother and sisterinlaw most blessedly came on to me from america several weeks ago without them i hadshould havequite gone

but im too ill to be here really and shall crawl home as soon as possible im afraid i cant see you in londoni can plan nor do nothing and can only ask you in my weakness depression and helplessness to pardon this doleful story from your affectionate and afflicted old   henry james      to mrs wharton    bittongs hotel hohenzollern bad nauheim  june 10th 1910    dearest edith   your kindest note met me here on my arrival with my sister last evening we are infinitely touched by the generous expression of it but there had been and could be no question for us of parisformidable at best that is in general as a place of rapid transit i had to my sorrow a baddish drop on coming back from high epping forest that is theydon mount to poor little flat and stale and illnesshaunted ryeand i felt my dr strongly urging safety to be in a prompt escape by the straightest way calais brussels cologne and frankfort to this place of thick woods groves springs and general kurort soothingness where my brother had been for a fortnight waiting us alone here i am then and having made the journey in great heat far better than i feared slowly but definitely i am emergingyet with nervous possibilities still too latent too in ambush for me to do anything but cling for as much longer as possible to my brother and sister i am wholly unfit to be alonein spite of amelioration that being alone i cant even as yet think ofand yet feel that i must for many months to come have none of the complications of society in fine to break to you the monstrous truth i have taken my passage with them to america by the canadian pacific steamer line short sea on august 12thto spend the winter in america i must break with everythingof the last couple of years in englandand am trying if possible to let lamb house for the winteralso am giving up my london perch when i come back i must have a better there are the grim factsbut now that i have accepted them i see hope and reason in them i feel that the completeness of the change làbas will help me more than anything else canand the amount of corners i have already turned though my nervous spectre still again and again scares me is a kind of earnest of the rest of the process i cling to my companions even as a frightened crybaby to his nurse and protectorbut of all that it is depressing almost degrading to speak this place is insipid yet soothingvery bosky and sedative and admirably arranged à lallemandebut with excessive and depressing heat just now and a toneless air at the best the admirable ombrages and walks and pacifying pitch of life make up however for much we shall be here for three weeks longer i seem to entrevoir and then try for something swiss and tonic we must be in england by aug 1st  and now i simply fear to challenge you on your own complications i can bear tragedies so little tout se rattache so à the thingthe central depression and yet i want so to knowand i think of you with infinite tenderness participationand such a large and helpless devotion well we must hold on tight and we shall come out again face to facewiser than ever before if thats any advantage this address i foresee will find me for the next 15 daysand we might be worse abrités germany has become comfortable note that much as i yearn to you i dont nag you with categorical even though in germany questions ever your unspeakable

nauheim it seems to me with the nightmare of switzerland that followedmunich and the tyrol etc which i believe i then hinted at to you proved the vainest crazy dream of but a momenti feel what the strain and stress of the sequel that awaited me really became that dire ordeal attempted nachkurs for my poor brother at low swiss altitudes constance zurich lucerne geneva c terminated however a fortnight agoor moreand after a bad week in london we are here waiting to sail on aug 12th i am definitely much better and on the road to be well a great gain has come to me in spite of everything during the last ten days in particular i say in spite of everything for my dear brothers condition already so bad on leaving the treacherous and disastrous nauheim has gone steadily on to worsehe is painfully ill weak and down and the anxiety of it with our voyage in view is a great tension to me in my still quite struggling upward state but i stand and hold my ground none the less and we have really brought him on since we left london but the dismalness of it alland of the sudden death a fortnight ago of our younger brother in the us by heartfailure in his sleepa painless peaceful enviable end to a stormy and unhappy careermakes our common situation all these months back and now fairly tragic and miserable however i am convinced that his getting home if it can be securely done will do much for williamand i am myself now on a much higher plane than i expected a very few weeks since to be i kind of want uncannily to go to america tooapart from several absolutely imperative reasons for it i rejoice unspeakably in the vision of seeing you  hereor even in london or at windsorone of these very next days   ever your allaffectionate dear edith henry james      to bruce porter        the bêtises were certain baconian clues to the authorship of      shakespeares plays which mr bruce porter had come from america      to investigate     lamb house rye  august 1910    my dearverybruce   i rejoice to hear from you even though it entails the irritation i brutally showed you in town my accessibility to that of your misguided search for a sensation you renew my harmless ragefor i hate to see you associated with my firm affection for you with the most provincial bêtises and to have come so far to do itto be it given over to a to the bêtise in a fine finished old england with which one can have so much better relations and so many of themit would make me blush or bleed for you could anything you do cause me a really deep discomfort but nothing cani too tenderly look the other way so there we are besides you have had your measlesand though you might have been better employed go in peacebe measly no more at any rate i grossly want you to know that i am really ever so much better than when we were together in london i go on quite as well as i could decently hope its an ineffable blessing its horrible somehow that those brief moments shall have been all our meeting here and that a desert wider than the sea shall separate us over there but this is a part of that perversity in life which long ago gave me the ultimate ache and i cherish the memory of our scant london luck my brother too has taken a much better turnand we sail on the 12th definitely so rejoice with me and believe me my dear bruce all affectionately yours   henry james      to miss grace norton    chocorua new hampshire  august 26 1910    dearest grace   i am deeply touched by your tender noteand all the more that we have need of tenderness in a special degree here now we arrived william and alice and i in this strange sad rude spot a week ago tonightafter a most trying journey from quebec though after a most beautiful quick in itself auspicious voyage too but with william critically mortally ill and with our anxiety and tension now he has rapidly got so much worse a real anguish alice is terribly exhausted and spentbut the rest she will be able to take must presently increase and harry who after leaving us at quebec started with a friend on a muchneeded holiday in the new brunswick woods for shooting and fishing was wired to yesterday to come back to us at once so i give you dear grace our dismal chronicle of suspense and pain my own fears are the blackest and at the prospect of losing my wonderful beloved brother out of the world in which from as far back as in dimmest childhood i have so yearningly always counted on him i feel nothing but the abject weakness of grief and even terror but i forgive myself weaknessmy emergence from the long and grim ordeal of my own peculiarly dismal and trying illness isnt yet absolutely complete enough to make me wholly firm on my feet but my slowly recuperative process goes on despite all shakes and shocks while dear williams in the full climax of his intrinsic powers and intellectual ambitions meets this tragic cruel arrest however dear grace i wont further wail to you in my nervous soreness and sorrowstill in spite of so much revival more or less under the shadow as i am of the miserable damnable year that began for me last christmastime and for which i had been spoiling for two years before i will only wait to see youwith all the tenderness of our long unbroken friendship and all the host of our common initiations i have come for a long staythough when we shall be able to plan for a resumption of life in irving street is of course insoluble as yet then at all events with what eagerness your threshold will be crossed by your faithfullest old   henry james   ps its today blessedly cooler hereand i hope you also have the reprieve  ps i open my letter of three hours since to add that william passed unconsciously away an hour agowithout apparent pain or struggle think of us dear grace think of us     to thomas sergeant perry    chocorua nh sept 2nd 1910    my dear old thomas   i sit heavily stricken and in darknessfor from far back in dimmest childhood he had been my ideal elder brother and i still through all the years saw in him even as a small timorous boy yet my protector my backer my authority and my pride his extinction changes the face of life for mebesides the mere missing of his inexhaustible company and personality originality the whole unspeakably vivid and beautiful presence of him and his noble intellectual vitality was still but at its climaxhe had two or three ardent purposes and plans he had cast them away however at the endi mean that dreadfully suffering he wanted only to die alice and i had a bitter pilgrimage with him from far offhe sank here on his threshold and then it went horribly fast i cling for the present to themand so try to stay here through this month after that i shall be with them in cambridge for several morewe shall cleave more together i should like to come and see you for a couple of days much but it would have to be after the 20th or even october 1st i think and i fear you may not then be still in villeggiatura if so i will come you knew himamong those living nowfrom furthest back with me yours and lillas all faithfully   henry james      to mrs wharton    chocorua nh sept 9th 1910    dearest edith   your letter from annecy  touches me as i sit here stricken and in darkness with the tenderest of hands it was all to become again a black nightmare what seems to me such now from very soon after i left you to these days of attempted readjustment of life on the basis of my beloved brothers irredeemable absence from it in which i take my part with my sisterinlaw and his children here i quitted you at folkestone august 9th just a month ago todayand it seems six to find him at lamb house apparently not a little eased by the devoted skinner and with the elements much more auspicious for our journey than they had been a fortnight before we got well enough to town on the 11th and away from it to liverpool on the 12th and the voyage in the best accommodations c we had ever had at sea and of a wondrous lakelike and riverlike fairness and brevity might if he had been really less ill have made for his holding his ground but he grew rapidly worse again from the start and suffered piteously and dreadfully with the increase of his difficulty in breathing and we got him at last to this place on the evening of the friday following that of our sailing only to see him begin swiftly to sink the sight of the rapidity of it at the last was an unutterable pangmy sense of what he had still to give of his beautiful genius and noble intellect at their very climax never having been anything but intense and in fact having been intenser than ever all these last months however my relation to him and my affection for him and the different aspect his extinction has given for me to my life are all unutterable matters fortunately as there would be so much to say about them if i said anything at all the effect of it all is that i shall stay on here for the presentfor some months to come i mean in this country and then return to england never to revisit these shores again i am inexpressibly glad to have been and even to be here nowi cling to my sisterinlaw and my nephews and niece they are all wonderful to say such admirable lovable able and interesting persons and they cling to me in return i hope to be in this spot with them till oct 15ththere is a great appeal in it from its saturation with my brothers presence and life here his use and liking of it for 23 years a sad subtle consecration which plays out the more where so few other things interfere with it ah the thin empty lonely melancholy american beautywhich i yet find a cold prudish charm in i shall go back to cambridge with my companions and stay there at least till the new yearwhich is all that seems definite for the present  all devotedly yours dearest edith   henry james      to mrs charles hunter    chocorua nh oct 1 1910    dearest mary hunter   beautiful and tender the letter i just receive from youand that follows by a few days an equally beneficent one to my sister she will if she hasnt done it already thank you for this herselfand tell you how deeply we feel the kindly balm of your faithful thought of us our return here with my brother so acutely suffering and so all too precipitately none the less succumbing altogetherquite against what seemed presumable during our last three weeks in englandwas a dreadful time from the worst darkness of which we are however gradually emerging what is for the time a great further support is the wondrous beauty of this region where we are lingering on three or four weeks more when it becomes too cold in a house built only for summerin spite of glorious woodfires this season being the finest thing in the american year for weather and colour the former is golden and the latter amid these innumerable mountains and great forests and frequent lakes a magnificence of crimson and orange a mixture of flames and gems i shall stay for some months i mean on this side of the sea and yet i am so homesick that i seem to feel that when i do get back to dear little old england i shall never in my life leave it again we cling to each other all of us here meanwhile and i can never be sufficiently grateful to my fate for my having been with my dearest brother for so many weeks before his death and up to the bitter end i am better and better than three months ago thank heaven in spite of everything and really believe i shall end by being better than i have been at all these last years when i was spoiling for my illness i pray most devoutly that salso will again repay and refresh and comfort you i absolutely yearn to see you and i am yours all affectionately always   henry james      to mrs w k clifford    95 irving street cambridge mass october 29th 1910    dearest lucy   my silence has been atrocious since the receipt of two quite divine letters from you but the most particular blessing of you is that with you one neednt explain nor elaborate nor take up the burden of dire demonstration because you understand and you feel you allow and you know and above all you love your poor old entangled and afflicted hj now at last i am really on the rise and on the higher ground againmore than i have been and more unmistakeably than at any time since the first of my illness your letters meanwhile dearest lucy were admirable and exquisite in their rare beauty of your knowing for the appreciation of such a loss and such a wound immensely what you were talking about every word went to my heart and it was as if you sat by me and held my hand and let me wail and wailed yourself so gently and intelligently with me the extinction of such a presence in my life as my great and radiant even in suffering and sorrow brothers means a hundred things that i cant begin to say but immense all the same are the abiding possessions the interest and the honour we will talk of all these things by your endlessly friendly fire in due time again oh how i gnash my teeth with homesickness at that dear little chilworth st vision of old lamp lit gossiping hours and we will pull together meanwhile as intimately and unitedly as possible even thus across the separating sea i have pretty well settled to remain on this side of that wintry obstacle till late in the spring i am at present with my priceless sisterinlaw and her dear delightful children we came back a short time since from the country i going for ten days to new york the prodigious from which i have just returned while she after her so long and tragic absence settled us admirably for the winter we all hang unspeakably together and thats why i am staying i am getting back to workthough the flood of letters to be breasted by reason of my brothers death and situation has been formidable in the extreme and the breasting with the very weak hand only that i have been able till now to lend is even yet far from over my companions are unspeakably kind to me and i cherish the break in the excess of solitude that i have been steeped in these last years if i get as well as i see reason now at last to believe i shall be absolutely better than at any time for three or fourand shall even feel sweetly younger by a miraculous emergence from my hideous year dreams of work come back to mewhich ive a superstitious dread still however of talking about materially and carnally speaking my comfortodious wordin a most pleasant commodious house is absolute and is much fostered by my having brought with me my devoted if diminutive burgess whom you will remember at lamb house during all which time however see how i dont prod you with questions about yourselfin spite of my burning thirst for knowledge after the generosity of your letters of last month how can i ask you to labour again in my too thankless cause but i do yearn over you and i neednt tell you how any rough sketch of your late history will gladden my sight i wrote a day or two ago to hugh walpole and besought him to go and see you and make me some sign of youwhich going and gatheringin i hope he of himself and constantly takes to i think of you as always heroicbut i hope that no particular extra need for it has lately salted your cup is margaret on better ground again god grant it but such things as i wish to talk abouti mean that we might but with patience the hour will strikelike silver smiting silver till then i am so faroffishly and so affectionately yours   henry james      to w e norris    95 irving st cambridge mass dec 13th 1910    my dear norris   i detest the thought that some good word or other from me shouldnt add to the burden with which your xmas table will groan fortunately too the decently good word as goods go at this dark crisis is the one that i can break my long and hideous silence to send you the only difficulty is that when silences have been so long and so hideous the renewal of the communication the patchingup as regards the mere facts of the weakened and ragged link becomes in itself a necessity or a question formidable even to deterrence i have had verily an année terriblethe fagend of which is however an immense improvement on everything that has preceded it i wont attempt none the less to make up arrears of information in any degree whateverbut simply let off at you this rude but affectionate signal from the desertisland of my shipwreckor what would be such if my situation were not on the whole the one with which i am for the present most in tune i am staying on here with my dear and admirable sisterinlaw and her children with whom i have been ever since my beloved and illustrious elder brothers death in the country at the end of august my younger brother had died just a month beforeand i am alone now of my fathers once rather numerous house but therei am trying to pick up lost chordswhich is what i didnt mean to  i expect to stick fast here through january and then go for a couple of months to new yorkafter which i shall begin to turn my face to englandheaven send that day the detail of this is however fluid and subject to alterationin everything save my earnest purpose of struggling back by april or may at furthest to your or verily my distressed country for which i unceasingly languish the material conditions here that is the best of themothers intensely and violently not suit me singularly at present as for instance the great and glorious american fact of weather to which it all mainly comes back but which since last august here i have never known anything to surpass while i write you this i bask in golden december sunshine and dry crisp mild frostover a great nappe of recent snow which flushes with the tenderest lights this does me a world of goodand the fact that i have brought with me my little lamb house servant who has lived with me these 10 years but for the rest my life is exclusively in this one rich nest of old affections and memories i put you you see no questions but please find half a dozen very fond ones wrapped up in every good wish i send you for the coming year a couple of nos of the times have just come inand though the telegraph has made them rather ancient history i hang over them for the dear old more vivid sense of it all  yours my dear norris all affectionately   henry james      to mrs wharton    95 irving street cambridge mass feb 9th 1911    dearest edith   hideous and infamous yes my interminable my abjectly graceless silence but it always comes in these abnormal months from the same sorry little cause which i have already named to you to such satiety that i really might omit any further reference to it somehow none the less i find a vague support in my consciousness of an unsurpassable abjection as aforesaid in naming it once more to myself and putting afresh on record that theres a method in what i feel might pass for my madness if you werent so nobly sane to write is perforce to report of myself and my conditionand nothing has happened to make that process any less an evil thing its horrible to me to report darkly and dismallyand yet i never venture three steps in the opposite direction without having the poor effrontery flung back in my face as an outrage on the truth in other words to report favourably is instantlyor at very short orderto be hurled back on the couch of anguishso that the only thing has for the most part been to stay my pen rather than not report favourably youll say doubtless damn you why report at allif you are so crassly superstitious answer civilly and prettily and punctually when a lady and such a lady as browning says generously and à deux reprises writes to youwithout dragging in velasquez at all very well then ill trythough it was after all pretty well poor old velasquez who came back three evenings since from 23 days in new york and at 21 east 11th st of which the last six were practically spent in bed he had had a very fairly flourishing fortnight in that kindest of houses and tenderest of cares and genialest of companiesand then repaid it all by making himself a burden and a bore i got myself out of the way as soon as possibleby scrambling back here and yet all inconsequently i think it likely i shall return there in march to perform the same evolution in the intervals i quite take noticebut at a given moment everything temporarily goes i come up again and quite well upas how can i not in order again to retaste the bitter cup but here i am reporting of myself with a vengeanceforgive me if its too dreary when alls said and done it will eventuallythe whole casebecome less so meanwhile too for my consolation i have picked up here and there windborne bribes of a more or less authentic savour from your own groaning board and my poor old imagination does me in these days no better service than by enabling me to hover like a tooparticipant larbin behind your louis xiv chair if it isnt your chair louis quatorze at least your larbin takes it so i gather youve been able to drive the spirited pen without cataclysms i take unutterable comfort in the thought that two or three months hence youll probably be seated on the highpiled and done bookin the magnificent authority of the position even as catherine ii on the throne of the czars forgive the implications of the comparison work seems far from me yetthough perhaps a few inches nearer a report even reaches me to the effect that theres a possibility of your deciding  to come over and spend the summer at the mount and this is above all a word to say that in case you should do so at all betimes you will probably still see me here as though i have taken my passage for england my date is only the 14th june therefore should you come may 1stwell porphyro grows faint i yearn over thissince if you shouldnt come then and yet should be coming at all heaven knows when we shall meet again there are enormous reasons for my staying here till then and enormous ones against my staying longer  such dearest edith is my meagre budgetforgive me if it isnt brighter and richer i am but just pulling throughand i am doing that but no more and so you see have no wild graces or wavy tendrils left over for the image i project i shall try to grow some again little by little but for the present am as ungarnished in every way as an aged plucked fowl before the cook has dealt with him may the great chef see his way to serve me up to you some day in some better sauce as i am at any rate share me generously with your i am sure not infrequent commensaux  and ask them to make the best of me an they love meas i love them even if you give them only the drumsticks and keep the comparatively tender though much shrivelled if once mighty pinion for yourself  i saw no one of the least real fascination excusez du peu of the conception in nybut the place relieved and beguiled meso long as i was deboutand mary cadwal and beatrix were as tenderest nursing mother and bonniest soeur de lait to me the whole day long i really think i shall takeshall riskanother go of it before long again and even snatch a bite of washington washington pie as we used to say to which latter the dear h whites have most kindly challenged me well such dearest edith are the short and simple annals of the poor i hang about you however inarticulately de toutes les forces de mon être and am always your fondly faithful old   henry james      to miss rhoda broughton    95 irving street cambridge mass february 25th 1911    dear rhoda broughton   i hate and have hated all along the accumulation of silence and darkness in the once so bright and animated air of our ancient commercethat is our old and so truly valid friendship and i am irresistibly moved to strike a fresh light as it were and sound a hearty callso that the uncanny spell may break working as it has done so much by my own fault or my great infirmity i have just had a letter from dear mary clarke not overflowing with any particularly blest tidings and containing as an especial note of the minor key an allusion to your apparently aggravated state of health and rather captive condition this has caused a very sharp pang in my battered breastfor steadily battered i have myself been battered all round and altogether these long months and months past even if not to the complete extinction of a tender sense for the woes of others  i tell you my sorry tale please believe me not to harrow you up or work upon youunder the harrow as you have yourself been so cruelly condemned to sit but only because when one has been long useless and speechless and graceless and when ones poor powers then again begin to reach out for exercise one immensely wants a few persons to know that one hasnt been basely indifferent or unaware but simply gagged so to speak and laid lowsimply helpless and reduced to naught and then my desire has been great to talk with you and i even feel that i am doing so a little through this pale and limping substituteand such are some of the cheerful points i should infallibly have made had i beenor were i just nowface to face with you heaven speed the day for some occasion more like that larger and braver contact than these ineffectual accents such are the prayers with which i beguile the tedium of vast wastes of homesickness herewhere frankly the sense of aching exile attends me the livelong day and resists even the dazzle of such days as these particular ones happen to bea glory of golden sunshine and air both crisp and soft that pours itself out in unstinted floods and would transfigure and embellish the american scene to my jaundiced eye if anything could but better fifty years of foglandwhere indeed i have alas almost had my fifty years however count on me to at least try to put in a few more  i hear from howard sturgis and i hear that is have heard from w e norris but so have you doubtless oftener and more cheeringly than i all such communications seem to me today in the very minor key indeedin which respect they match my own you at least will say but i dont dream of your answering thisit pretends to all the purity of absolutely disinterested affection i only wish i could fold up in it some faint reflection of the flood of golden winter sunshine some breath of the still mild already vernal air that wraps me about here as i just mentioned while i write and reminds me that grim and prim boston is after all in the latitude of romethough indeed only to mock at the aching impatience of your all faithful forthreaching old friend   henry james      to h g wells    95 irving street cambridge mass march 3rd 1911    my dear wells   i seem to have had notice from my housekeeper at rye that you have very kindly sent me there a copy of the new machiavelliwhich she has forborne to forward me to these tariffguarded shores in obedience to my general instructions but this neednt prevent me from thanking you for the generous gift which will keep company with a brave row of other such valued signs of your remembrance at lamb house thanking you all the more too that i hadnt waited for gift or guerdon to fall on you and devour you but have just lately been finding the american issue of your wondrous book a sufficient occasion for that thus it is that i cant rest longer till i make you some small sign at last of my conscious indebtedness  i have read you then i need scarcely tell you with an intensified sense of that life and force and temperament that fulness of endowment and easy impudence of genius which makes you extraordinary and which have long claimed my unstinted admiration you being for me so much the most interesting and masterful prosepainter of your english generation or indeed of your generation unqualified that i see you hang there over the subject scene practically all alone a farflaring even though turbid and smoky lamp projecting the most vivid and splendid golden splotches creating them about the fieldshining scattered innumerable morsels of a huge smashed mirror i seem to feel that there can be no better proof of your great giftthe nm makes me most particularly feel itthan that you bedevil and coerce to the extent you do such a reader and victim as i am i mean one so engaged on the side of ways and attempts to which yours are extremely alien and for whom the great interest of the art we practise involves a lot of considerations and preoccupations over which you more and more ride roughshod and triumphantwhen you dont that is with a strange and brilliant impunity of your own leave them to one side altogether which is indeed what you now apparently incline most to do your big feeling for life your capacity for chewing up the thickness of the world in such enormous mouthfuls while you fairly slobber so to speak with the multitudinous tastethis constitutes for me a rare and wonderful and admirable exhibition on your part in itself so that one should doubtless frankly ask ones self what the devil in the way of effect and evocation and general demonic activity one wants more well i am willing for today to let it stand at that the whole of the earlier part of the book or the first half is so alive and kickingand sprawlingso vivid and rich and strongabove all so amusing in the high sense of the word and i make remonstrancefor i do remonstratebear upon the bad service you have done your cause by riding so hard again that accurst autobiographic form which puts a premium on the loose the improvised the cheap and the easy save in the fantastic and the romantic copperfield jane eyre that charming thing of stevensons with the bad titlekidnapped it has no authority no persuasive or convincing forceits grasp of reality and truth isnt strong and disinterested r crusoe eg isnt a novel at all there is to my vision no authentic and no really interesting and no beautiful report of things on the novelists the painters part unless a particular detachment has operated unless the great stewpot or crucible of the imagination of the observant and recording and interpreting mind in short has intervened and played its partand this detachment this chemical transmutation for the aesthetic the representational end is terribly wanting in autobiography brought as the horrible phrase is up to date thats my main criticism on the nmand on the whole ground there would be a hundred things more to say its accurst that i am not near enough to you to say them in less floundering fashion than thisbut give me time i return to england in june never again dv to leave itsurprise mr remington thereby as i may and we will jaw as far as you will keep me company meanwhile i dont want to send across the wintry sea anything but my expressed gratitude for the immense impressionistic and speculative wealth and variety of your book yours my dear wells ever   henry james   ps i think the exhibition of love as lovefunctional lovealways suffers from a certain inevitable and insurmountable flatfootedness for the readers nerves etc which is only to be counterplotted by roundabout artsas by tracing it through indirectness and tortuosities of application and effectto keep it somehow interesting and productive though i dont mean reproductive but this again is a big subject  ps 2 i am like your heros forsaken wife i know having things the things of life history the world only as and by keeping them so and so only i do have them     to c e wheeler        the outcry had not appeared on the stage but was shortly to be      published in the form of a narrative the following refers to a      suggestion not carried further at this time that the play might      be performed by the stage society     21 east eleventh street new york city april 9th 1911    dear christopher wheeler   i am not back in england as you see and shall not be till toward the end of june i have almost recovered from the very compromised state in which my long illness of last year left me but not absolutely and wholly i am however in a very much better way and the rest is a question of more or less further patience and prudence about the outcry in the light of your plan i am afraid that the moment isnt favourable for me to discuss or decide i have made a disposition a literary use of that work so as not to have to view it as merely wasted labour on the one hand and not sickeningly to hawk it about on the other which isnt propitious to any other present dealing with itthough it might not in fact certainly wouldnt be unfavourable to some eventual theatrical life for it before i do anything else i must first see what shall come of the application i have made of my play this you see is a practically unhelpful answer to your interesting inquiry and i am sorry the actual situation so limits the matter i rejoice in your continued interest in the theatrical question and i dare say your idea as to a repertory effort on the lines you mention is a thing of light and life but i have little heart or judgment left as i grow older for the mere theatrical mystery the drama interests me as much as ever but i see the theatreexperiment of this that or the other supposedly enlightened kind prove all round me so abysmally futile and fallacious and treacherous that i am practically quite off from it and can but let it pass pardon my weary cynicismand try me again later the conditionsthe theatrequestion generallyin this country are horrific and unspeakableutter and so far as i can see irreclaimable barbarism reigns the anomalous fact is that the theatre so called can flourish in barbarism but that any drama worth speaking of can develop but in the air of civilization however keep tight hold of your clue and believe me yours ever   henry james      to dr j william white    95 irving street cambridge mass may 12th 1911    my dear j william   i have from far back so dragged you and the gentle letitia even not less through the deep dark desperate discipline of my unmatched genius for not being quick on the epistolary trigger that with such a perfection of schoolingquite my prize pupils and little show performers in shorti can be certain that you wont so much as have turned a hair under my recent probably unsurpassed exhibitions of it nevertheless i shall expect you to sit up and look bright and gratified even quite intelligentlike true heads of the class now that i do write and reward your exemplary patience and beautiful drill yes dear prize pupils i feel i can fully depend on you to regard the present as a regular answer to your sweet letter from bermuda or to behave beautifully as if you didwhich comes to the same thing above all i can trust you to believe that if your discipline has been stiff that of your battered and tattered old disciplinarian himself has been stifferincessant and uninterrupted and really not leaving him a moments attention for anything else he is still very limp and bewildered with it allyet with a gleam of better things ahead that after his dire and interminable ordeal and though the gleam has but just broken out causes him to turn to you again with that fond fidelity which enjoyed its liveliest expression in the ancient past on the day never to be forgotten when we had such an affectionate scuffle to get ahead of each other in making a joyous bonfire of lamb house in honour of your so acclaimed arrival there letitia sitting by with her impartial smile as the queen of beauty at a tournament she will remember how she crowned the victori modestly forbear to name him and what a ruinouslyto himgenial feu de joie resulted from the expensive application of my brandished torch well the upshot of it all is that i have put off my sailing by the mauretania of june 14thbut not alas to your olympic vessel of the gods evidently later that month i have shifted to the same mauretania of august 2ndurgent and intimate family reasons making for my stopover till then so when i see you in england as i fondly count on doing after this dismal interlude it will be during the delightful weeks you will spend there in the autumn when all your athletic laurels have been gathered all your highclass hotels checked off all your obedient servants except me tipped and all your portentous drafts honoured let us plot out those sweet september days a little even nowlet me at least dream of them as a supreme test proof and consecration of what returning health will once more enable me to stand i am too unutterably glad to be going back even with a further delayi am wasted to a shadow even though the shadow of a still formidable mass by homesickness for the home i once hadbefore we applied the match you see the loss for you nowby the way if you had only allowed it to stand i have taken places in the reform gallery for the coronationand won them by ballotfor the second procession and now palmed them off on two of my female victimsafter such a quandary in the choice apropos of coronations and suchlike wont you when you write very kindly give me some news of the dear dashing abbeys long lost to sight and sound of me it has come round to me in vague ways that they have at last actually left morgan hall for some newlyacquired princely estate do you know where and what the place is a gentle word on this head would immensely assuage my curiosity whereever and whatever it is let us stay there together next september you see therefore how practical my demand is of course ned will paint this coronation toowhile his hand is in and oh you should be here now to share a holy rage with me such is this babyish democracy  ever your grand yet attached old aristocrat   henry james      to t bailey sanders    barackmatiff farm salisbury conn may 27 1911    my dear bailey   it greatly touches and gratifies me to hear from youeven though i have to inflict on you the wound of a small announced positively last postponement of my reappearance i like to think that you may be a little woundedwanton as that declaration sounds for it gives me the measure of my being cared for in poor dear old distracted englandthan which there can be no sweeter or more healing sense to my bruised and aching and oh so nostalgic soul i am exceedingly better in health i thank the powersand even presume to figure it out that i shall next slip between the soft swingdoors of athene in the character of a confirmed improver struggler upward or even baycrowned victor over ills dont lament my small procrastinationa matter of only six weeks for i shall then still better know where and how i am i am at the present

elms and maples is very noble and charming and sympathetic and madeon its great scale of extentto be dealt with by the blest motorcar the consolation of my declining years this luxury i am charitably much treated to and it does me a world of good the enormous the unique ubiquity of the auto here suggests many reflectionsbut i cant go into these now or into any branch of the prodigious economic or sociological side of this unspeakable and amazing country i must keep such matters to regale you withal in poor dear little lamb house garden for one brick of the old battered purple wall of which i

autobiographically regale me not a bit less than yours my dear bailey all faithfully   henry james      to sir t h warren        the following letter to the president of magdalen refers to the      offer of an honorary degree at oxford subsequently conferred in      1912     salisbury connecticut may 29th 1911    my dear president   i was more sorry than i can say to have to cable you last evening in that disabled sense i had some time ago taken my return passage to england for june 14th but more lately the president of harvard was so good as to invite me to receive an honorary degree at their hands on the 28th of that monththe same day as your encaenia urgent and intimate family reasons conspired to make a delay advisable so i accepted the harvard invitation and have shifted my departure to august 2nd  behold me thus committed to harvardand unable moreover at this season of the multitudinous i mean of the rush to europe to get a decent berth on an outward ship even were i to try the formal document from the university arrived with your kind letterproposing to me the degree of doctor of letters as your letter mentions and quickened my great regret at being thus perversely prevented from embracing an occasion the appeal of which i might so have connected with your benevolence  i should feel an oxford degree a very great honour and a great consideration and i am writing of course to the registrar of the university i rejoice to be going back at last to a more immediateor more possiblesight and sound of you and of all your surrounding amenities and glories yet i wish too i could open to you for a few days the impression of the things about me here in the warm the very warm heart of new england at its best such a vast abounding arcadia of mountains and broad vales and great rivers and large lakes and white villages embowered in prodigious elms and maples it is extraordinarily beautiful and graceful and idyllicfor america  i am very sincerely and faithfully and gratefully yours   henry james      to miss ellen emmet        mrs george hunter and her daughters had been h js hostesses at      salisbury connecticut in the preceding may     lamb house rye aug 15th 1911    beloved dearest darling bay   your so beautifully human letter of aug 1st reaches me here this am through harrywho appears to have picked it out of perdition at the belmont after i had sailed at peep of dawn on aug 2nd it deeply and exquisitely touches meso bowed down under the shame of my long silence to all your house to your splendid mother in particular have i remained ever since the day i brought my little visit to you to a heated closewhich sounds absurdly as if i had left you in a rage after a violent discussion but you will know too well what i mean and how the appalling summer that was even then beginning so actively to cook for us could only prove a wellnigh fatal dish to your aged and infirm uncle i met the full force of this awful and almost to the moment i sailed unbroken visitation just after leaving youand frankly it simply demoralized me and flattened me out manners memories decencies all alike fell from me and i simply lay for long weeks a senseless stricken perspiring inconsiderate unclothed mass i expected and desired nothing but to melt utterly awayand could only treat my nearest and dearest as if they expected and desired no more i am convinced that you all didnt and that you noticed not at all that i had become a most ungracious and uncommunicative recipient of your bounty i lived from day to day most of the time in my bath and please tell your mother that when i thought of you it was to say to myself oh theyre all up to their necks together in their foxhunter spring and it would be really indiscreet to break in upon them that is how i do trust you have mainly spent your timethough in your letter youre too delicate to mention it i was caught as in two or three firetrapsi mean places of great and special suffering as during a week at the terrific intervale nh from july 1st to 8th or so with the kind merrimans themselves salamanders who served me nothing but hot food and expected clothing but i found a blest refuge betimes with my kind old friend george james widower of lily lodge at the tip end of the nahant promontory quite out at sea where amid gardens and groves and on a vast breezy verandah my life was most mercifully saved and where i stuck fast till the very eve of my sailing i got back here myself with a great sense that it was quite desperately high time though alas i came upon the same brassy sky and redhot air here as i left behind meit has been as formidable a summer here as in the us everything is scorched and blightedmy garden a thing almost of cinders there has been no rain for weeks and weeks the thermometer is mostly at 90 and still it goes on 90 in this thick english air is like 100 with us the like was never seen and faminethreatening strikes at london and liverpool docks with wars and rumours of wars and the smash of the house of lords and as many people hold of the constitution complete the picture of a distracted and afflicted country nevertheless i shouldnt mind it so much if we could only have rain then i think all troubles would end or mendand at least i should begin to find myself again i cant do so yet and am waiting to see how and where i am  i directed notman of boston to send you a photograph of a little oldever so ancientambrotype lent me by lilla perry to have copiedher husband tsp having been in obscure possession of it for half a century it will at least show you where and how i was in about my 16th year i strike myself as such a sweet little thing that i want you and your mother to see it in order to believe itthough she will believe it more easily than you it looks even a great deal like her about that time toowe were always thought to look a little alike my journey voyage out on the big smooth swift mauretania gave me and has left me with such a sense as of a few hours pampered ferry making a mere mouthful of the waste of waters that i kind of promise myself to come back all the time i had never been so blandly just lifted across tell your mother and rosina and leslie that i just cherish and adore them all i cling to the memory of all those lovely motorhours tell leslie in particular how dear i hold the remembrance of our run together to stockbridge and emily ts that wonderful long day and i had the sweetest passages with great rosina but i fold you all together in my arms with grenville please well in the thick of it and am darling bay your most faithfully fond old   henry james      to howard sturgis    lamb house rye august 17th 1911    beloved creature   as if i hadnt mainly spent my time since my return here a week ago yesterday in writhing and squirming for very shame at having left your several or at least your generously two or three last exquisite outpourings unanswered but i had long before sailing from làbas dearest howard and especially during the final throes and exhaustions been utterly overturned by the savage heat and drought of a summer that had set in furiously the very last of may going crescendo all that timeand of which i am finding here so far as the sky of brass and the earth of cinders is concerned so admirable an imitation i have shown you often enough i think how much more i have in me of the polar bear than of the salamanderand in fine at the time i last heard from you pen ink and paper had dropped from my perspiring grasp though while in the grasp they had never felt more adhesively sticky and i had become a mere prostrate panting liquefying mass wailing to be removed i was removedat the date i mentionpressing your supreme benediction in the form of eight sheets of lovely stamped paper as they say in the us to my heaving bosom but only to less sustaining and refreshing conditions than i had hoped for here you will understand how some of thesein this seamed and cracked and blasted and distracted countrystrike me and perhaps even a little how i seem to myself to have been transferred simply from one sizzling gridiron to anotherat a time when my further toleration of gridirons had reached its lowest ebb such a pile of waiting letters greeted me heremost of them pushing in with an indecency of clamour before your dear delicate signal but it is always of you dear and delicate and supremely interesting that i have been thinking and here is just a poor palpitating stopgap of a reply dont take it amiss of my wise affection if i tell you that i am heartily glad you are going to scotland go go and stay as long as you ever canits the sort of thing exactly that will do you a world of good i am to go there i believe next month to stay four or five days with john cadwaladerand eke with minnie of that ilk or more or less in forfarshirebut that will probably be lateish in the month and before i go you will have come back from the eshers and i have returned from a visit of a few days which i expect to embark upon on saturday next then when we are gathered in no power on earth will prevent me from throwing myself on your bosom forgive meanwhile the vulgar sufficiency and banality of my advice above as to what will do you goodloathsome expression but one grasps in ones haste the cheapest current coin i commend myself strongly to the gentlest no thats not the wordsay the firmest even while the fairest of williams and am yours dearest howard ever so yearningly   henry james   ps i dont know of course in the least what eshers operation may have beenbut i hope not very grave and that he is coming round from it i should like to be very kindly remembered to herwho shines to me from far back in so amiable a light     to mrs william james    hill theydon mount epping august 27th 1911    dearest alice   i want to write you while i am hereand it helps me thus putting pen to paper does to conjure away the darkness of this black anniversaryjust a little i have been dreading this dayas i have been living through this week as you and peg will have done and bill not less under the shadow of all the memories and pangs of a year agobut there is a strange strange enough kind of weak anodyne of association in doing so here where thanks to your support and unspeakable charity utterly and entirely i got sufficiently better of my own then deadly visitation of misery to struggle with you on to nauheim i met here at first on coming down a weeknine daysago quite fleeing from the hot and blighted rye the assault of all that miserable and yet in a way helpful visionbut have since been very glad i came just as i am glad that you were here thenin spite of everything i am adding day to day here as you seepartly because it helps to tide me over a badnot physically badtime and partly because my admirable and more than ever wonderful hostess puts it so as a favour to her that i do that i can only oblige her in memory of all her great goodness to uswhen it did make such a differenceof may 1910 so i daresay i shall stay on for ten or twelve days more i dont want to stir for one thing till we have had some relief by water it has now rained in some places but there has fallen as yet no drop here or hereaboutsand the earth is sickening to behold i have my old roomand i have paid a visit to yourswhich is empty mrs swynnerton is doing an historical picture for a decorative competitionthe embellishment of the chelsea town hall i believe queen elizabeth taking refuge at chelsea under an oak during a thunderstorm and she finds the great oak here and mrs hunter in a wonderful tudor dress and headgear and red wig to be admirably though too beautifully the queen with the big canvas set up out of doors by the tree where her marvellous model still finds time on top of everything to pose hooped and ruffled and decorated and in a most trying queenly position mrs s is also doingfinishingthe portrait of me that she pushed on so last year  but goodbye dearest alice dearest all i hope your mother is with you and that harry has begun to take his holidaybless him i bless your mother too and send her my affectionate love goodbye dearest alice your all faithful   henry      to mrs john l gardner    hill theydon mount epping september 3rd 1911    dearest isabella gardner   yes it has been abominable my silence since i last heard from youso kindly and beautifully and touchinglyduring those few last flurried and worried days before i left america they were very difficult they were very deadly days i was ill with the heat and the tension and the trouble and amid all the things to be done for the windup of a years stay i allowed myself to defer the great pleasure of answering you yet the general pain of taking leave of you to some such supposedly calmer hour as this i fled away from my little south coast habitation a very few days after reaching itby reason of the brassy sky the shadeless glare and the baked and barren earth and took refuge among these supposedly dense shadesyet where also all summer no drop of rain has fallen there is less of a glare nevertheless and more of the cooling motorcar and a very vast and beautiful old william and mary and older house of a very interesting and delightful character which has lately come into possession of an admirable friend of mine mrs charles hunter who tells me that she happily knows you and that you were very kind and helpful to her during a short visit she made a few or several years ago to america it is a splendid old houseand though in the midst of epping forest it is but a ninety minutes motorride from london its as sequestered and woodlanded as if it were much deeper in the country and there are innumerable other interesting old places about and such oldworld nooks and corners and felicities as make one feel in the thick of revolution that anything that happenshappens disturbinglyto this wonderful little attaching old england the ripest fruit of time can only be a change for the worse even the north shore and its rich wild beauty fades by comparisoneven east gloucester and cecilias clamorous little bower make a less exquisite harmony nevertheless i think tenderly even of that bustling desert nowsuch is the magic of fond association george jamess shelter of me in his seaward fastness during those else insufferable weeks was a mercy i can never forget and my beautiful day with you from lynn on and on to the lovely climax abovementioned is a cherished treasure of memory i water this last sweet withered flower in particular with tears of regretthat we mightnt have had more of them i hope your month of august has gone gently and reasonably and that you have continued to be able to put it in by the sea i found the salt breath of that element gave the only savouror the main onethat my consciousness knew at those bad times and if you cultivated it duly and cultivated sweet peace into the bargain as hard as ever you could ill engage that youre better nowand will continue so if youll only really take your unassailable stand on sweet peace you will find in the depth of your admirable nature more genius and vocation for it than you have ever let yourself find outand i hereby give you my blessing on your now splendid exploitation of that hitherto least attendedto of your many gardens become rich in indifferenceto almost everything but your fondly faithful old   henry james      to mrs wharton        by her is meant mrs whartons motor always referred to by the      chauffeur as she     lamb house rye sept 27th 1911    dearest edith   alas it is not possibleit is not even for a moment thinkable i returned practically but last night to my longabandoned home where every earthly consideration and every desire of my heart conspires now to fix me in some sort of recovered peace and stability i cling to its very doorposts for which i have yearned for long months and the idea of going forth again on new and distant and expensive adventure fills me withlet me frankly sayabsolute terror and dismaythe desire the frantic impulse of scared childhood to plunge my head under the bedclothes and burrow there not to let it ie her get me in fine i want as little to renew the junketings and squanderings of exiletime priceless timesquanderings as they are for me nowas i want devoutly much to do something very different to which i must begin immediately to address myselfand even if my desire were intense indeed there would be gross difficulties for me to overcome but enoughdont let me pile up the agony of the ungraciousas any failure of response to a magnificent invitation can only be let me simply gape all admiringly from a distance at the splendour of your own spirit and general resourcesor rather let me just simply stay my pen and hide my head under the bedclothes beforementioned my finest deepest sense of the general matter is that the whole economy of my future in which i see myself reviving again to certain things very definite things that i want to do absolutely lays an interdict to which i oh so fondly bow on my ever leaving these shores again and i have no scruple of saying this to youyour beautiful genius being so for great globeadventures and putting girdles round the earth mine is incomparably for brooding like the hen whom i differ from but by a syllable in designation and see how little i personally lose by it since your putting on girdles so quite inevitably involves your passing at a given moment where i can reach forth and grab you a little dont despise me for a spiritless worm only livrezvousy yourself  with all pride and power and unroll the rich record later to your so inevitably deprived though so basely resigned and always so faithfully fond old   henry james      to mrs wilfred sheridan    lamb house rye oct 2nd 1911    dear incomparable child   what is one to do how is your poor old battered and tattered exneighbour above all to demean himself in the glittering presence of such a letter yes i havethrough the force of dire accidentstreated you to the most confused and aching void that could pretend to pass for the mere ghost of conversability and yet you shine upon me still with your own sole lightthe absolute dazzle of which very naturally brings tears to my eyes you are a monsteror almostof magnanimity as well as beauty and ability and above all clearly of felicity and there is nothing for me i quite recognise but to collapse and grovel behold me before you wormlike thereforea pretty ponderous worm but still capable of the quiver of sensibility and quite inoffensively transportablewhether by motorcar or train or the local frugal fly there is an almost incredible kindness for me in your and wilfreds being prepared literally to harbour and nourish to exhibit on your bright scene publicly and all incongruously so aged and dingy a parasite but a real big breezy happiness sometimes begets i know a regular wantonness of charity a fond extravagance of altruism and i surrender myself to the wild experiment with the very most pious hope that you wont repent of it you shall not at any point i promise you if the effort on my part decently to grace the splendid situation can possibly stave it off i will bravely come then on friday 27tharriving in the afternoon by any conveyance that you are so good as to instruct me to adopt and even as the earthworm might aspireoccasion offeringto mate with the silkworm i will gladly arrange with dear glossy howard to present myself if possible in his company i rejoice in your offering me that cherished company there is a rare felicity in it for howard is the person in all the world who is kindest to me next after you i shall rejoice to see wilfred again and be particularly delighted to see him as my host our acquaintance began a long time ago but seemed till now to have been blighted by adversity this splendidly makes upand all the good i thought of him is confirmed for me by his thinking so much good of you it will thrill me likewise to see your bower of blissa fester burg in a distracted world just now and where i pray that good understandings shall ever hold their own it mustnt be difficult to be happy with you and by you dear clare and you will see how i for my permitted part shall pull it off i was lately very happy in scotlandhappy for me and for scotlandand it must have been something to do with the fact that i being in forfarshire you were or were even about to be though unknown to me in the neighbouring county this created an atmosphereover and above the bonny scotch i kind of sniffed your great genialityfrom afar so you see the kind of good you cant help doing me its rapture to think that youll do me yet moreat closer quarters and i am yours my dear clare all affectionately   henry james      to miss alice runnells        h js nephew william his brothers second son had just become      engaged to miss runnells     lamb house rye oct 4th 1911    my very dear niece   i must tell you at once all the pleasure your beautiful and generous letter of the 23rd september has given me its a genuine joy to have from you so straight the delightful truth of the whole matter and i cant thank you enough for talking to me with an exquisite young confidence and treating me as the fond and faithful and intensely participating old uncle that i want to be it makes me feelall you sayhow right ive been to be glad and how righter still i shall be to be myself confident how shall i tell you in return what an interest i am going to take in youand how i want you to multiply for me the occasions of showing it you see i take the greatest and tenderest interest in billand you and i feel then exactly together about that we shall doalways more or less togethereverything we can think of to help him and back him up and we shall find nothing more interesting and more paying i expect somehow or other to see a great deal of himand of you and count on you to bring him out to me on the very first pretext and on him to bring you he is splendidly serious and entier its a great thing to be as entier as that and he has great ability great possibilities which will take and so much reward all the bringing out and wooing forth and caring and looking out for that we can give themas faith and affection can do these things though of a certainty they would go their own way in spite of usthe fine powers wouldif unluckily for us they didnt appeal to us i like to think of you working out your ideasplanning all those possibilities togetherin the wondrous chocorua octoberwhere i hope you are staying to the endand even if intensity at the studio naturally suffers for the time it has only fallen back a little to gather again for the spring i mean in particular the intensity of which you were the subject and centre and which must have at first been somewhat hampered by its own very excess bills only danger is in his tendency to be intensely intensewhich is a bit of a waste if one is intense and its the only thing for an artist to be one should be economically that is carelessly and cynically so in that way one limits the conditions and tangles of ones problem but dont give bill this for a specimen of the way you and i are going to pull him through we shall do much better yetonly its past far past midnight and the deep hush of the little old sleeping town suggests bedtime rather as the great question for the moment i have come back to this admirable small corner with great joy and profitand oh dear alice how earnestly you are awaited here at some not really distant hour by your affectionate old uncle   henry james      to mrs frederic harrison        the small fiction sent to mrs harrison was the outcry     reform club pall mall sw oct 19 1911    dear mrs harrison   i am more touched than i can say by your gentle and generous acknowledgment of the poor little sign of contrition and apology in the shape of a slight offered beguilement that referred to my graceless silence after the receipt of a beautiful word of sympathy in a great sorrow months and months agoi am ashamed to remind you of how many you now heap coals of fire as the phrase is on my headand i can scarcely bear it for the pure crushing sense of your goodness i was in truth at the time of your other letter deeply submergedat once horribly bereft and very ill physically but i was really almost as much touched by the kindness of which yours was a part as i was either only i was unable to do anything at the time in the way of recognitionat the time or for a long while afterwards and when at last i did begin to emergeafter a very difficult year in america which came to an end only two months ago my very indebtednesses were paralysingmy long silence required to my sore sense so much explanation however i have little by little explainedto some friends though i think not to those i count as closestfor such one feels are the best comprehenders without ones having to tell too much  i am in town you seenot at rye having gone back there definitely three weeks ago to the questionable experiment of taking up my abode there for the season to come the experiment broke downi can no longer stand the solitude and confinement the immobilisation of that contracted corner in these shortening and darkening weeks and months these things have the worst effect upon meand i fled to london pavements lamplights shopfronts taxisand friends amid all of which i have recovered my equilibrium excellently and shall do so still more it means definitely for me no more winters at rueful ryeonly summers though i hope plenty of them i go down there however for bits to keep my small household togetheri cant yet or till i arrange some frugal footing bring it up here and i shall be delighted to profit by one of those occasions to seek your hospitality in a neighbourly way for a couple of nights i shall be eager for this and will communicate with you as soon as the opportunity seems to glimmer please express to frederic harrison my hearty participation by sympathy and sense in all the fine things that are now so handsomely happening to him he is a splendid example and incitement excitement in fact for those climbing the great hillthe hill of the long faith and the stout staffjust after him and who see him so little spent and so erect against the sky at the top we see you with him dear mrs harrison making scarcely less brave a figureat least to your very faithful old friend   henry james   ps i have it at heart to mention that my small fiction was written two years agoin 1909     to miss theodora bosanquet        on this appeal miss bosanquet h js amanuensis secured rooms      for him in lawrence street chelsea     105 pall mall sw october 27th 1911    dear miss bosanquet   oh if you could only have the real right thing to miraculously propose to me you and miss bradley when i see you on tuesday at 430 for you see by this bolting in horror and loathing but dont repeat those expressions from rye for the winter my situation suddenly becomes special and difficult and largely through this that having got back to work and to a very particular job the need of expressing myself of pushing it on on the old remingtonese terms grows daily stronger within me but i havent a seat and temple for the remington and its priestesscant have here at this club and on the other hand cant now organize a permanent or regular and continuous footing for the london winter which means something unfurnished and taking wasting now time and thought i want a small very cheap and very clean furnished flat or trio of rooms etc like the one we talked of under the kings cross delusiononly better and with some a very few tables and chairs and fireplaces that i could hire for 2 or 33 or 4months to drive ahead my job inthe remington priestess and i converging and meeting there morning by morningand it being preferably nearer to her than to me though near tubes and things for both of us i must keep on this place for food and bed etci have it by the yeartill i really have something else by the yearfor winter purposesto supersede it lamb house abides for long summers your researches can have only been for the unfurnishedbut look think invent two or three decent little tabled and chaired and lighted rooms would do i catch a train till monday probably late but on tuesday   yours ever henry james      to mrs william james        the book on which h j was now at work was a small boy and      others     the athenaeum pall mall sw nov 13th 1911    dearest alice   i must bless you on the spot for your dear letter of the 22ndcontinued on the 31st i clutch so at everything that concerns and emanates from you all that i kind of pine for the need of it all the whileor at any rate am immensely and positively bettered by every scrap of the dear old library life that you can manage to waft over to me i find naturally that i can think of you all and mingle with you so ever so much more vividly than i could of oldthrough the effect of all those weeks and months of last yearwhich have had at any rate that happy result that i have the constant image of your days and doings you must think now very cheerfully and relievedly of minebecause distinctly yes dear brave old london is working my cure the conditions here were what i needed all the while that i was so far away from themi mean because they are of the kind materially best addressed to helping me to work my way back to an equilibrium i shall see how it worksfrom 1030 to 130 each dayand let you hear more but it represents the yearning effort really to get more surely and swiftly now up to my neck into the book about william and the rest of us i have written to harry to ask him for certain of the young youthful letters copies of them which i didnt bring away with meon the other hand i have found some six or eight very precious ones mixed up with the mass of fathers that i have with me thrust into fathers envelopes etc of fathers alas very few are useable they are so intensely domestic private and personal  november 19th i find with horror dearest alice that i have inadvertently left this all these days in my portfolio interrupted where i broke off above under the impression that i had finished and posted it this is dreadful and i am afraid shows how the beneficent london for all its beneficence does interpose invade and distract giving one too many things to do and to bear in mind at once what sickened me is that i have thus kept my letter over a whole wasted weekso far as being in touch with you all is concerned on the other hand this lapse of time enables me blessedly to confirm in the light of further experience whatever of good and hopeful the beginning of the present states to you  in the third place a most valued letter from harry has come accompanying a packet of more of williams letters typed for which i heartily thank him and promising me some others yet i am writing to him in a very few days and will then tell him how i am entirely at one with him about the kind of use to be made by me of all these early things the kind of setting they must have the kind of encompassment that the book as my book my play of reminiscence and almost of brotherly autobiography and filial autobiography not less must enshrine them in the book i see and feel will be difficult and unprecedented and perilousbut if i bring it off it will be exquisite and unique bring it off as i inwardly project it and oh so devoutly desire it i greatly regret only also the almost complete absence of letters from alice she clearly destroyed after fathers death all the letters she had written to themhim and motherin absence and this was natural enough but it leaves a perfect blankthough there are on the other hand all my own intimate memories could you seeaskif fanny morse has kept any that is just possible she wrote after all so little i marvel that i have noneduring the cambridge years but she was so ill that writing was rare for hervery rare however i must end this i hope the irving st winter wears a friendly face for you i think so gratefully and kindly now of the little chintzy parlourblest refuge i reembrace dearest peg and i do so want some demonstration of what aleck is doing its a pang to hear from you that he isnt so well physically what does that sadly mean i send him all my love and to your mother ever your   henry      to mrs wharton    reform club pall mall sw nov 19th 1911    dearest edith   there are scarce degrees of difference in my constant need of hearing from you yet when that felicity comes it manages each time to seem preeminent and to have assuaged an exceptional hunger the pleasure and relief at any rate three days since were of the rarest qualityand its always least discouraging for the exchange of sentiments to know that your wings are for the moment folded and your field a bit delimited i knew you were back in paris as an informer passing hereby on his way thence again to ny had seen you dining at the ritz en nombreuse compagnie looking awfully handsome and stunningly dressed and mary hunter cesjoursci had given me earlier and more exotic news of you yet coloured with a great vividness of sympathy and admiration but i feel that it takes a hard assurance to speak to you of arriving anywhereas that implies starting and continuing and before your great heroic rushes and revolutions i can only gape and sigh and sink back it requires an association of easewith the whole heroic question of the up and doing statewhich i dont possess to presume to suggestionise on the subject of a new advent great will be the glory and joy and the rushing to and fro when the wide wings are able marvellously to show us symptoms of spreading againand here i am mainly here this winter to thrill with the first announcement london is better for me during these months than any other spot of earth or of pavement and even here i seem to find i can workand nai pas maintenant dautre idée apropos of which aid to life your remarks about my small latestborn are absolutely to the point the little creature is absolutely of the irresistible sex of her most intelligent criticfor i dont pretend like lady macbeth to bring forth menchildren only you speak at your ease chère madame of the interminable and formidable job of my producing à mon âge another golden bowlthe most arduous and thankless task i ever set myself however on all that il y aurait bien des choses à dire and meanwhile i blush to say the outcry is on its way to a fifth edition in these few weeks whereas it has taken the poor old gb eight or nine years to get even into a third and i should have to go back and live for two continuous years at lamb house to write it living on dried herbs and cold waterfor staying powermeanwhile and that would be very bad for me would probably indeed put an end to me altogether my own sense is that i dont want and oughtnt to try to attack ever again anything longer save for about 70 or 80 pages more than the outcry that is déjà assez difficilethe artistic economy of that inferior little product being a much more calculated and ciphered much more cunning and to use your sweet expression crafty one than that of five gbs the vague verbosity of the oxusflood beau nom terrifies mesates me whereas the steel structure of the other form makes every parcelle a weighed and

outcriesand on données autrement rich about this present one hangs the inferiority the comparative triviality of its primal origin but pardon this flood of professional egotism i have in any case got back to workon something that now the more urgently occupies me as the time for me circumstantially to have done it would have been last winter when i was insuperably unfit for it and that is extremely special experimental and as yet occult i apply myself to my effort every morning at a little repaire in the depths of chelsea a couple of little rooms that i have secured for quiet and concentrationto which our blest taxi whirls me from hence every morning at 10 oclock and where i meet my amanuensis of the days of the composition of the gb to whom i gueuler to the best of my power in said repaire i propose to crouch and me blottir in the english shade of the word for so intensely revising an animal as well for many many weeks so that i fear dearest edith your idea of whirling me away will have to adapt itself to the sense worn by awayas it clearly so gracefully will for there are senses in which that particle is for me just the most obnoxious little object in the language make your fond use of it at any rate by first coming awayaway hither   yours all and always henry james   ps this was begun five days agoand was raggedly and ruthlessly broken offhad to beand i didnt mark the place this sunday am where i took it up againon page 6th but i put only todays dateas i didnt put the other days at the time     to w e norris    lamb house rye january 5th 1912    my dear norris   i dont know whether to call this a belated or a premature thing as a new years offering and my hand is tremendously in for those just now though it is also tremendously fatigued it is a bit behind whereas for an independent overture it follows perhaps indiscreetly fast on the heels of my christmas letter however as since this last i have had the promptest and most beautiful one from youa miracle of the perfect fist as well as of the perfect ease and gracei make bold to feel that i am not quite untimely that you wont find me so and i offer you still all the compliments of the seasonsated and gorged as you must by this time be with them and vague thin sustenance as they at best afford if i hadnt already in the course of the several score of letters which had long weighed on me and which i really retired to this place on dec 30th to work off as much as anything else run into the ground the image of the coming year as the grim veiled equivocal and sinister figure who holds us all in his dread hand and whom we must therefore grovel and abase ourselves at once on the threshold of as to curry favour with him i would give you the full benefit of itbut i leave it there as it is though if you do wish to crawl beside me here i am flat on my face i am putting in a few more days herein order to bore if possible through my huge heap of postal obligations the accumulation of three or four years and not very visibly reduced even by the heroic efforts of the last week i have never in all my life written so many letters within the same space of timeand i really think that is in the full sense of the term documentary proof of my recovery of a normal senile strength i go tomorrow over into kent to spend sunday with some friends near maidstone they have lately acquired and extraordinarily restored allington castle which is down in a deep sequestered bottom plants its huge feet in the medway actually overflowed i believe up to its middle i come back here again with acute lumbago i quite expect and begin againthat is write 300 more letters after which i relapse fondly and i think very wisely upon london now that i am not obliged to be in this place by having so committed myself to it for better for worse as i had in the past i find i quite like ithaving enjoyed the deep peace and ease of it this last week but i have to go away to prove to myself the nonobligation to stay and that takes some doingwhich i shall have set about by the 15th london was quite delicious during that brown still xmastidethe four or five days after i wrote to you the drop of life and of traffic was beyond anything of the sort i had ever seen in that frame the gregariousness of movement of the population is an amazing phenomenonthey had vanished so in a bunch that the streets were an uncanny desert with the difference from of old that the taxis and motors were more absent than the cabs and carriages and busses ever were for at any given moment the horizon is through this power of disappearance void of themwhereas the old things had through their slowness to hang about one gets a taxi by the way much faster than one ever got a handsome lo i have managed to forget how to write the extinct objectand yet one gets it from so much further away and from such an at first hopeless void  very romantic and charming the arrival of your gallant georgefrom all across europefor his xmas eve with you your account of it touches me and i find myself ranking you with the celebrated fair of history and fable for whom the swimmings of the hellespont and the breakings of the lance were perpetrated i congratulate you on such a george in these for the most part merely awfully sorry days and him on a chance of which he must have been awfully glad and àpropos of such felicitiesor rather of felicities pure and simple and not quite such i do heartily hope that you will go on to spain with your niece in the springim convinced that youll find it a charming adventure ive myself utterly ceased to travelim a limpet now for the rest of my life on the rock of britain but i intensely enjoy the travels of my friends  my pen fails and my clock strikes and i am yours all faithfully   henry james      to miss m betham edwards    lamb house rye jan 5th 1912    dear miss betham edwards   i can now at last tell you the sad story of the book for emily morganwhich i am having put up to go to you with this as well as explain a little my long silence the very day or the very second day after last seeing you a change suddenly took place under great necessity in my then current plans and arrangements i departed under that stress for london practically to spend the winter and have come back but for a very small number of daysi return there next week but you will say why didnt you send the promised volume for e m from london then what matter to us where it came from so long as it came to which i reply well i had in this house a small row of books available for the purpose and among which i could choosealso which i came away in my precipitation too soon to catch up in flight in london i should have to go and buy the thing my own productionwhile i have two or three brannew volumes which will be an economy to a man utterly depleted by the inordinate number of copies of the outcry that he has given away and all but six of which he has had to pay forhis sanguinary admire my restraint publisher allowing him but six why then couldnt you write home and have one of the books in question sent youor have it sent to hastings directly from your house because i am the happy possessor of a priceless parlourmaid who loves doing up books and other parcels and does them up beautifully and if the volume comes to me here to be inscribed i shall then have to do it up myself an act for which i have absolutely no skill and which i dread and loathe and tumble it forth clumsily and insecurely besides i was vague as to which of my works i did have on the accessible shelfi only knew i had someand would have to look and consider and decide which i have now punctually done and the thing will be beautifully wrapped thats all very well but why then didnt you write and explain why it was that you were keeping us unserved and uninformed oh because from the moment i go up to town i plungeplunge into the great whirlpool of postal matter social matter and above all this time grey matter of cerebrationhaving got back to horrible arrears of work and being at best so postally submerged during these last weeks that every claim of that sort that could be temporarily dodged was a claim that found me shameless and heartless but you see the penalty of all is that i have to write all this now  im glad you like adverbsi adore them they are the only qualifications i really much respect and i agree with the fine author of your quotations in sayingor in thinkingthat the sense for them is the literary sense none other is much worth speaking of but i hope my volume wont contain too many for emily morgan dont let her dream of acknowledging it she can do so when we meet again perhaps you can even help her out with the book by reading yourself the beast in the jungle sayor the birthplace may our generally so ambiguous 1912 be all easy figuring for you yours dear miss betham edwards all faithfully   henry james      to wilfred sheridan        mr and mrs wilfred sheridan had asked him to be godfather to      their eldest child     105 pall mall sw jan 12th 1912    my dear wilfred   beautiful and touching to me your conjoined appeal with dear clares but i beg you to see the matter in the clear and happy light when i say that im afraid it wont do and that the blest babe must really be placed on the threshhold of life there should be but one h theredont teach her to spell by me under some more valid and more charming protection than that of my accumulated and before long so concluding years she mustnt be taken for her first happy holiday to visit her late godfathers tombas would certainly be the case were i to lend myself to the fond anachronism her too rosyvisioned parents so flatteringly propose you see dear wilfred i speak from a wealth of wisdom and experiencelife has made me rather exceptionally acquainted with the godpaternal function so successful an impostor would i seem to have been and it was long since brought home to me that the character takes more wearing and its duties more performing than i feel i have ever been able to give it i have three godchildren living for to some i have been fataltwo daughters and a son and my conscience tells me that i have long grossly neglected them they write meat considerable length sometimes and i just remember that i have one of their last sweet appeals still unanswered this dear clare and dear wilfred is purely veracious historya dark chapter in my life let me not add anotherlet me show at last a decent compunction let me not offer up a helpless and unconscious little career on the altar of my incompetence frankly the lovely child should find at her font a younger and braver and nimbler presence one that shall go on with her longer and become accessible to her personal knowledge you will feel this together on easier reflectionjust as you will see how my plea goes hand in hand with my deep appreciation of your exquisite confidence  you must indeed wilfred have been through terrific tensioni gathered from ethel dilkes letter that clares crisis had been dire such are not the hours when a man most feels the privilege and pride of fatherhood but i rejoice greatly in the good conditions now and already make out that the daughter is to be of prodigious power beauty and stature i feel for that matter that by the time easter comes i should drop her straight into the ritual reservoirwith a scandalous splash it will take more than me though you may well say you dont want moreafter so many words i embrace you all three and am devotedly yours   henry james      to walter v r berry        h j never at any time received presents easily and the      difficulty seems to have reached a climax over one recently sent      him by mr berry it may not be obvious that the gift in question      was a leather dressingcase     lamb house rye february 8th 1912    trèscher et trèsgrand ami   how you must have wondered at my silence but it has been alas inevitable and now is but feebly and dimly broken just after you passed through londonor rather even while you were passing through iti began to fall upon evil days again a deplorable bout of unwellness which making me fit for nothing gave me a sick struggle first in those awkward pall mall conditions and then reduced me to scrambling back here as best i might where i have been these several days but a poor ineffectual rag i shall get better here if i can still further draw on my sadly depleted store of time and patience but meanwhile i am capable but of this weak and appealing grimaceso deeply discouraged am i to feel that there are still and after i have travelled so far such horrid little deep holes for me to tumble into this has been a deeper one than for many months though i am i believe slowly scrambling out and blest to me has been the resource of crawling to cover herefor better aid and comfort  the case has really and largely been however all the while dearest walter that of my having had to yield just after your glittering passage in town to that simply overwhelming coup de massue of yourwell of your you know what it was that that knocked me downwhen i was just trembling for a fall it was that that laid me flat  february 14th well dearest walter it laid me after all so flat that i broke down a week ago in the foregoing attempt to do you and your ineffable procédé some manner of faint justice i wasnt then apt for any sort of right or worthy approach to you and there was nothing for me but resignedly to intermit and me recoucher you had done it with your own mailed fistmailed in glittering gold speciously glazed in polished inconceivably and indescribably sublimated leather and i had rallied but too superficially from the stroke it claimed its victim afresh and i have lain the better part of a week just languidly heaving and groaning as a result de vos oeuvresand forced thereby quite to neglect and ignore all letters i am a little more on my feet again and if this continues shall presently be able to return to town saturday or monday where however the monstrous object will again confront me that is the grand fact of the situationthat is the tawny lion portentous creature in my path i cant get past him i cant get round him and on the other hand he stands glaring at me refusing to give way and practically blocking all my future i cant live with him you see because i cant live up to him his claims his pretensions his dimensions his assumptions and consumptions above all the manner in which he causes every surrounding object on my poor premises or within my poor range to tell a dingy or deplorable taleall this makes him the very scourge of my life the very blot on my scutcheon he doesnt regild that rusty metalhe simply takes up an attitude of gorgeous swagger straight in front of all the rust and the rubbish which makes me look as if i had stolen somebody elses regarnished blason and were trying to palm it off as my own cher et bon gaultier i simply cant afford him and that is the sorry homely truth he is out of the pictureout of mine and behold me condemned to live forever with that canvas turned to the wall do you know what that meansto have to give up going about at all lest complications of the most incalculable order should ensue from its being seen what i go about with bonne renommée vaut mieux que sacdevoyage doré and though i may have had weaknesses that have brought me a little under public notice my modest holdall which has accompanied me in most of my voyage through life has at least so far as i know never fait jaser all this i have to think ofand i put it candidly to you while yet there is time that you shouldnt have counted the costto yourselfthat is after all perhaps conceivable quoiquà peine but that you shouldnt have counted the cost to me to whom it spells ruin that ranks you with those great lurid though lovely romantic and historic figures and charmers who have scattered their affections and lavished their favours only as it has presently appeared to consume and to destroy more prosaically dearest walter if one of the most lyric acts recorded in historyand one of the most finely aesthetic and one stamped with the most matchless grace has a prosaic side i have been truly overwhelmed by the princely munificence and generosity of your procédé and i have gasped under it while tossing on the bed of indisposition for a beau geste cest le plus beau by all odds of any in all my life ever esquissé in my direction and it has as such left me really and truly panting helplessly afteror rather quite intensely beforeit what is a poor man to do mon prince mon bon prince mon grand prince when so prodigiously practised upon there is nothing you see for the proceeding itself swallows at a gulp with its open crimson jaws such a rosy mouth like carlyles mirabeau all formulas one doesnt thank i take it when the heavens openthat is when the whale of mr allensinthestrand celestial shopfront doesand discharge straight into ones lap the perfect compendium the very burden of the song of just what the angels have been raving about ever since we first heard of them well may they have ravedbut i cant you see i have to take the case the incomparable suitcase in abject silence and submission ah walter walter why do you do these things theyre magnificent but theyre notwell discussable or permissible or forgiveable at least not all at once it will take a long long time only little by little and bucklehole by bucklehole shall i be able to look with you even one strap in the face as yet a sacred horror possesses me and i must ask you to let me please though writing you at such length not so much as mention the subject its better so perhaps your conscience will tell you whytell you i mean that great supreme gestes are only fair when addressed to those who can themselves gesticulate i cantand it makes me feel so awkward and graceless and poor i go about tryingso as to hurl it something or other back on you but it doesnt come offpractice doesnt make perfect you are victor winner master oh irresistible oneyouve done it youve brought it off and got me down forever and i must just feel your weight and bear your might to bless your nameeven to the very end of the days of yours dearest walter all too abjectly and too touchedly   henry james      to w d howells        the following open letter was written to be read at the dinner      held in new york in celebration of mr howellss seventyfifth      birthday     105 pall mall sw february 19th 1912    my dear howells   it is made known to me that they are soon to feast in new york the newest and freshest of the splendid birthdays to which you keep treating us and that your many friends will meet round you to rejoice in it and reaffirm their allegiance i shall not be there to my sorrow and though this is inevitable i yet want to be missed peculiarly and monstrously missed so that these words shall be a public apology for my absence read by you if you like and can stand it but better still read to you and in fact straight at you by whoever will be so kind and so loud and so distinct for i doubt you see whether any of your toasters and acclaimers have anything like my ground and title for being with you at such an hour there can scarce be one i think today who has known you from so far back who has kept so close to you for so long and who has such fine old reasonsso old yet so well preservedto feel your virtue and sound your praise my debt to you began wellnigh half a century ago in the most personal way possible and then kept growing and growing with your own admirable growthbut always rooted in the early intimate benefit this benefit was that you held out your open editorial hand to me at the time i began to writeand i allude especially to the summer of 1866with a frankness and sweetness of hospitality that was really the making of me the making of the confidence that required help and sympathy and that i should otherwise i think have strayed and stumbled about a long time without acquiring you showed me the way and opened me the door you wrote to me and confessed yourself struck with mei have never forgotten the beautiful thrill of that you published me at onceand paid me above all with a dazzling promptitude magnificently i felt and so that nothing since has ever quite come up to it more than this even you cheered me on with a sympathy that was in itself an inspiration i mean that you talked to me and listened to meever so patiently and genially and suggestively conversed and consorted with me this won me to you irresistibly and made you the most interesting person i knewlost as i was in the charming sense that my best friend was an editor and an almost insatiable editor and that such a delicious being as that was a kind of property of my own yet how didnt that interest still quicken and spread when i became aware thatwith such attention as you could spare from us for i recognised my fellow beneficiariesyou had started to cultivate your great garden as well the tract of virgin soil that beginning as a cluster of bright fresh sunny and savoury patches close about the house as it were was to become that vast goodly pleasaunce of art and observation of appreciation and creation in which you have laboured without a break or a lapse to this day and in which you have grown so grand a show ofwell really of everything your liberal visits to my plot and your freehanded purchases there were still greater events when i began to see you handle yourself with such ease the key to our rich and inexhaustible mystery then the question of what you would make of your own powers began to be even more interesting than the question of what you would make of mineall the more i confess as you had ended by settling this one so happily my confidence in myself which you had so helped me to gave way to a fascinated impression of your own spread and growth for you broke out so insistently and variously that it was a charm to watch and an excitement to follow you the only drawback that i remember suffering from was that i your original debtor couldnt print or publish or pay youwhich would have been a sort of ideal repayment and of enhanced credit you could take care of yourself so beautifully and i could unless by some occasional happy chance or rare favour scarce so much as glance at your proofs or have a glimpse of your endings i could only read you fullblown and finishedand see with the rest of the world how you were doing it again and again  that then was what i had with time to settle down tothe common attitude of seeing you do it again and again keep on doing it with your heroic consistency and your noble genial abundance during all the years that have seen so many apparitions come and go so many vain flourishes attempted and achieved so many little fortunes made and unmade so many weaker inspirations betrayed and spent having myself to practise meaner economies i have admired from period to period your so ample and liberal flow wondered at your secret for doing positively a littlewhat do i say a little i mean a magnificent dealof everything i seem to myself to have faltered and languished to have missed more occasions than i have grasped while you have piled up your monument just by remaining at your post for you have had the advantage after all of breathing an air that has suited and nourished you of sitting up to your neck as i may sayor at least up to your waistamid the sources of your inspiration there and so you were at your post there and so the spell could ever work for you there and so your relation to all your material grow closer and stronger your perception penetrate your authority accumulate they make a great array a literature in themselves your studies of american life so acute so direct so disinterested so preoccupied but with the fine truth of the case and the more attaching to me always for their referring themselves to a time and an order when we knew together what american life wasor thought we did deluded though we may have been i dont pretend to measure the effect or to sound the depths if they be not the shallows of the huge wholesale importations and socalled assimilations of this later time i can only feel and speak for those conditions in which as quiet observers as careful painters as sincere artists we could still in our native our human and social element know more or less where we were and feel more or less what we had hold of you knew and felt these things better than i you had learnt them earlier and more intimately and it was impossible i think to be in more instinctive and more informed possession of the general truth of your subject than you happily found yourself the real affair of the american case and character as it met your view and brushed your sensibility that was what inspired and attached you and heedless of foolish flurries from other quarters of all wild or weak slashings of the air and wavings in the void you gave yourself to it with an incorruptible faith you saw your field with a rare lucidity you saw all it had to give in the way of the romance of the real and the interest and the thrill and the charm of the common as one may put it the character and the comedy the point the pathos the tragedy the particular homegrown humanity under your eyes and your hand and with which the life all about you was closely interknitted your hand reached out to these things with a fondness that was in itself a literary gift and played with them as the artist only and always can play freely quaintly incalculably with all the assurance of his fancy and his irony and yet with that fine taste for the truth and the pity and the meaning of the matter which keeps the temper of observation both sharp and sweet to observe by such an instinct and by such reflection is to find work to ones hand and a challenge in every bush and as the familiar american scene thus bristled about you so year by year your vision more and more justly responded and swarmed you put forth a modern instance and the rise of silas lapham and a hazard of new fortunes and the landlord at lions head and the kentons that perfectly classic illustration of your spirit and your form after having put forth in perhaps lighterfingered prelude a foregone conclusion and the undiscovered country and the lady of the aroostook and the ministers chargeto make of a long list too short a one with the effect again and again of a feeling for the human relation as the social climate of our country qualifies intensifies generally conditions and colours it which married in perfect felicity to the expression you found for its service constituted the originality that we want to fasten upon you as with silver nails tonight stroke by stroke and book by book your work was to become for this exquisite notation of our whole democratic light and shade and give and take in the highest degree documentary so that none other through all your fine long season could approach it in value and amplitude none let me say too was to approach it in essential distinction for you had grown master by insidious practices best known to yourself of a method so easy and so natural so marked with the personal element of your humour and the play not less personal of your sympathy that the critic kept coming on its secret connection with the grace of letters much as fenimore coopers leatherstockingso knowing to be able to do itcomes in the forest on the subtle tracks of indian braves however these things take us far and what i wished mainly to put on record is my sense of that unfailing testifying truth in you which will keep you from ever being neglected the critical intelligenceif any such fitful and discredited light may still be conceived as within our spherehas not at all begun to render you its tribute the more inquiringly and perceivingly it shall still be projected upon the american life we used to know the more it shall be moved by the analytic and historic spirit the more indispensable the more a vessel of light will you be found its a great thing to have used ones genius and done ones work with such quiet and robust consistency that they fall by their own weight into that happy service you may remember perhaps and i like to recall how the great and admirable taine in one of the fine excursions of his french curiosity greeted you as a precious painter and a sovereign witness but his appreciation i want you to believe with me will yet be carried much further and thenthough you may have argued yourself happy in your generous way and with your incurable optimism even while noting yourself not understoodyour really beautiful time will come nothing so much as feeling that he may himself perhaps help a little to bring it on can give pleasure to yours all faithfully   henry james      to mrs wharton        the following refers to the third volume covering the years 1838      to 1848 of mme vladimir karénines george sand sa vie et ses      oeuvres an article on which written by h j for the      quarterly review appears in notes on novelists     reform club pall mall sw march 13th 1912    dearest edith   just a word to thank youso inadequatelyfor everything your letter of the 1st infinitely appeals to me and the 3d vol of the amazing vladimir amazing for acharnement over her subject has rejoiced my heart the more that i had quite given up expecting it the two first vols had long ago deeply held mebut i had at last had to suppose them but a colossal fragment fortunately the whole thing proves less fragmentary than colossal and our dear old george ressort more and more prodigious the nearer one gets to her the passages you marked contribute indeed most to this ineffable effectand the long letter to sweet solange is surely one of the rarest fruits of the human intelligence one of the great things of literature and what a value it all gets from our memory of that wondrous day when we explored the very scene where they pigged so thrillingly together what a crew what moeurs what habits what conditions and relations every wayand what an altogether mighty and marvellous georgenot diminished by all the greasiness and smelliness in which she made herself and so many other persons at home poor gentlemanly crucified chopnot naturally at home in greasebut having been originally pulled inand floundering there at last to extinction ce qui dépasse howeverand it makes the last word about dear old g reallyis her overwhelming glibness as exemplified eg in her long letter to gryzmala or whatever his name the one to the first page or two of which your pencilmarks refer me and in which she posts him as they say at stockbridge as to all her amours to have such a flow of remark on that subject and everything connected with it at her command helps somehow to make one feel that providence laid up for the french such a store of remark in advance and as it were should the worst befall that their conduct and moeurs coming after had positively to justify and do honour to the whole collection of formulae phrases and as i say glibnessesso that as there were at any rate such things there for them to inevitably say why not simply do all the things that would give them a rapport and a sense the things we poor disinherited race do we have to do so dimly and sceptically without the sense of any such beautiful cadres awaiting usand therefore poorly and going but halfor a tenthof the way it makes a difference when you have to invent your suggestions and glosses all after the fact you do it so miserably compared with providenceespecially providence aided by the french language which by the way convinces me that providence thinks and really expresses itself only in french the language of gallantry it will be a joy when we can next converse on these and cognate themesi know of no such link of true interchange as a community of interest in dear old george  i dont know what else to tell younor where this will find you i kind of pray that you may have been able to make yourself a system of some sortto have arrived at some modus vivendi the impossible wears on us but we wear a little here i think even on the coalstrike and the mass of its attendant misery though they produce an effect and create an atmosphere unspeakably dismal and depressing to which the windowsmashing women add a darker shade i am blackly bored when the latter are at large and at work but somehow i am still more blackly bored when they are shut up in holloway and we are deprived of them  yours all and always dearest edith   henry james      to h g wells        this refers to a proposal which did not take effect that mr      wells should become a member of the lately formed academic      committee of the royal society of literature     105 pall mall sw march 25th 1912    my dear wells   your letter is none the less interesting for being what alas i believed it might be in spite of which interestor in spite of which belief at leasthere i am at it again i know perfectly what you mean by your indifference to academies and associations bodies and boards on all this ground of ours no one should know better as it is precisely my own state of mindreally caring as i do for nothing in the world but lonely patient virtue which doesnt seek that company nevertheless i fondly hoped that it might end for you as it did under earnest invitation for mein your having said and felt all those things and then joinedfor the general amenity and civility and unimportance of the thing giving it the benefit of the doubtfor the sake of the goodnature you will say that you had no doubt and couldnt therefore act on any but that germ alas was what my letter sought to implantin addition to its not being a question of your acting but simply of your not that is of your not refusing but simply lifting your oar and letting yourself float on the current of acclamation there would be no question of your being entangled or hampered or even i think of your being bored the common ground between all lovers and practitioners of our general form would be under your feet so naturally and not at all out of your way and it wouldnt be you in the least who would have to take a step backward or aside it would be we gravitating toward you melting into your orbit as a mere more direct effect of the energy of your genius your plea of your being anarchic and seeing your work as such isnt in the least believe me a reason against for also believe me you are essentially wrong about that no talent no imagination no application of art as great as yours is able not to make much less for anarchy than for a continuity and coherency much bigger than any disintegration theres no representation no picture which is your form that isnt by its very nature preservation association and of a positive associational appealthat is the very grammar of it none that isnt thereby some sort of interesting or curious order i utterly defy it in short not to make all the anarchy in the world aiding far more than it unmakesjust as i utterly defy the anarchic to express itself representationally art aiding talent aiding the play of invention aiding in short you aiding without the grossest the absurdest inconsistency so it is that you are in our circle anyhow you can fix it and with us always drawing more around though always at a respectful and considerate distance fascinatedly to admire and watchall to the greater glory of the english name and the brave as brave as possible english array the latter brave even with the one american blotch upon it oh patriotismthat mine the mere paying guest in the house should have its credit more at heart than its unnatural its proud and perverse son however all this isnt to worry or to weary i wish it could your ruthlessness its only to drop a sigh on my shattered dream that you might have come among us with as much freedom as grace i prolong the sigh as i think how much you might have done for our freedomand how little we could do against yours  dont answer or acknowledge this unless it may have miraculously moved you by some quarter of an inch but then oh dothough i must warn you that i shall in that case follow it up to the death   yours all faithfully henry james      to lady bell    reform club pall mall sw may 17th 1912    my dear florence bell   a good friend of oursin fact one of our very bestspoke to me here a few days ago of your having lately had all unknown to me a great tribulation of illness but also told me to my lively relief that you are getting steadily well again and that thankful at the worst for small mercies after such an ordeal you are in some degree accessible to the beguilement and consolation of letters i have only taken time to wonder whether just such a mercy as this may not be even below the worstbut am letting the question rest on the basis of my feeling that you must never and that you will never dream of any acknowledging of so inevitable a little sign of sympathy such dreams i too well know only aggravate and hamper the upward struggle dont in the least lighten or quicken it take absolute example by mewho had a very dismal bad illness two and a half years ago from out of the blackness of which i havent even now wholly emerged and who reflect with positive complacency on all my letters the received ones of that time that still and that largely always will remain unanswered i want you to be complacent toothough at this rate there wont be much for you to be so about i really hope you go on smoothly and serenelyand am glad now that i didnt helplessly know you were so stricken but i wish i had for you a few solid chunks of digestible that is mainly good newssuch as given your constitutional charity will melt in your mouth there are people for whom only the other sort is digestible but i somehow in these subdued daysi speak of my own very personal onesdont make news i even rather dread breaking out into it or having it break into me its so much oftener     may 26th hill hall theydon mount epping   i began the above now many days ago and it was dashed from my hand by a sudden flap of one of the thousand tentacles of the london daybroken off short by that aggressive gesture if the flapping of a tentacle is a conceivable gesture and here i take it up again in another place and at the first moment of any sort of freedom and ease for it as i read it over the interruption strikes me as a sort of blessing in disguise as i cant imagine what i meant to say in that last portentous sentence now doubtless never to be finished and not in the least deserving iteven if it can have been anything less than the platitude that the news one gets is much more usually bad than good and that as the news one gives is scarce more mostly than the news one has got so the indigent state in that line is more gracefully worn than the bloated i must have meant something better than that at any rate see how indigent i amthat with all the momentous things that ought to have happened to me to explain my sorry lapse for so many days my chronicle would seem only of the smallest beer put it at least that with these humble items the texture of my life has bristledeven to the effect of a certain fever and flurry but they are such matters as would make no figure among the great issues and processions of rountonas i believe that great order to proceed the nearest approach to the showy is my having come down here yesterday for a couple of daysin order not to prevent my young american nephew and niece just lately married and to whom i have been lending my little house in the country from the amusement of it as being invited they yet wouldnt come without my dim protectionso that i have made dimly protective thus much of a dash into the worldwhere i find myself quite vividly resigned it is the world of the wonderful and delightful mrs charles hunter whom you may know long my very kind friend and all swimming just now in a sea of music john sargent as much a player as a painter percy grainger roger quilter wilfred von glehn and others round whose harmonious circle however i roam as in outer darkness catching a vague glow through the veiled windows of the temple but on the whole only intelligent enough to feel and rue my stupiditywhich is quite the wrong condition it is a great curse not to be densely enough indifferent to enough impossible things most things are impossible to me but i blush for itcant brazen it out that they are no loss brazening it out is the secret of lifefor the peu doués but what need of that have you lady of the full programme and the rich performance what i do enter here beyond the lovingkindness de toute cette jeunesse is the fresh illustration of the beauty and amenity and ancientry of this wondrous old england which at twenty miles or so from london surrounds this admirable and interesting and historic house with a green country as wide and free and apparently as sequestered and strikingly as ruralin the constable wayas if it were on the other side of the island but i leave it tomorrow to go back to town till probably about july 1st before which i fondly hope you may be so firm on your feet as to be able to glide again over those beautiful parquets of 95 in that case i shall be so delighted to glide in upon youassuming my balance preservedat some hour gently appointed by yourself then i shall tell you moreif you can stand more after thisfourteen sprawling and vacuous pages alas i am but too aware there is nothing in them nothing that is but the affectionate fidelity with every blessing on your further complete healing of yours all constantly   henry james      to mrs w k clifford        on may 7 1912 the academic committee of the royal society of      literature celebrated the centenary of the birth of robert      browning h j read a paper on the novel in the ring and the      book

1912    dearest lucy   your impulse to steep me and hold me down under water in the fountain of youth with charles boyd muscularly to help you is no less beautiful than the expression you have given it by which i am more touched than i can tell you i take it as one of your constant kindnessesbut i had all the same i fear taken filson youngs invidious epithet in that little compliment as inevitable wholly though i believe it was mainly applied to my voice my voice was on that centenary itself centenarianfor reasons that couldnt be helpedfor i really that day wasnt fit to speak as for ones own sense of antiquity my own what is one to sayit varies goes and comes at times isnt there at all and at others is quite sufficient thank you i cultivate not thinking about itand yet in certain ways i like it like the sense of having had a great deal of life the young on the whole make me pretty sadthe old themselves dont but the pretension to youth is a thing that makes me saddest and oldest of all the acceptance of the fact that i am all the while growing older on the other hand decidedly rejuvenates me i say what then and the answer doesnt come there doesnt seem to be any and that quite sets me up so i am young enoughand you are magnificent simply i get from you the sense of an inexhaustible vital freshness and your voice is the voice so beautiful of your twentieth year your going to america was admirably youngan act of your twentyfifth dont be younger than that dont seem a year younger than you do seem for in that case you will have quite withdrawn from my side keep up with me a little i shall come to see you again at no distant day but the coming week seems to have got itself pretty well encumbered and on the 24th or 26th i go to rye for four or five days after that i expect to be in town quite to the end of june i am reading the green book in bitsas it werethe only way in which i can read or at least do read the contemporary novelthough i read so very fewalmost none my only way of readingapart from thatis to imagine myself writing the thing before me treating the subjectand thereby often differing from the author and hisor herway i find g w very brisk and alive but i have to take it in pieces or liberal sips and so have only reached the middle what i feel critically and i can feel about anything of the sort but critically is that you dont squeeze your material hard and tight enough to press out of its ounces and inches what they will give that material lies too loose in your handor your hand otherwise expressed doesnt tighten round it that is the fault of all fictive writing now it seems to methat and the inordinate abuse of dialoguethough this but one effect of the not squeezing its a wrong a disastrous and unscientific economy altogether i squeeze as i read youbut that as i say is rewriting however i will tell you more when i have eaten all the pieces and i shall love and stick to you alwaysas your old very old oldest old   h j      to hugh walpole    reform club pall mall sw may 19th 1912   your letter greatly moves and regales me fully do i enter into your joy of sequestration and your bliss of removal from this scene of heated turmoil and dusty despairwhich however reawaits you never mind sink up to your neck into the brimming basin of nature and peace and teach yourselfby which i mean let your grandmother teach youthat with each revolving year you will need and make more piously these precious sacrifices to pan and the muses history eternally repeats itself and i remember well how in the old london years of my old londonthis isnt that one i used to clutch at these chances of obscure flight and at the possession less frustrated of my soul my senses and my hours so keep it up i miss you little as i see you even when here for i feel you more than i see you but i surrender you at whatever cost to the beneficent powers therefore i rejoice in the getting on of your workhow splendidly copious your flow and am much interested in what you tell me of your readings and your literary emotions these latter indeedor some of them as you express them i dont think i fully share at least when you ask me if i dont feel dostoieffskys mad jumble that flings things down in a heap nearer truth and beauty than the picking and composing that you instance in stevenson i reply with emphasis that i feel nothing of the sort and that the older i grow and the more i go the more sacred to me do picking and composing becomethough i naturally dont limit myself to stevensons kind of the same dont let any one persuade youthere are plenty of ignorant and fatuous duffers to try to do itthat strenuous selection and comparison are not the very essence of art and that form is not substance to that degree that there is absolutely no substance without it form alone takes and holds and preserves substancesaves it from the welter of helpless verbiage that we swim in as in a sea of tasteless tepid pudding and that makes one ashamed of an art capable of such degradations tolstoi and d are fluid puddings though not tasteless because the amount of their own minds and souls in solution in the broth gives it savour and flavour thanks to the strong rank quality of their genius and their experience but there are all sorts of things to be said of them and in particular that we see how great a vice is their lack of composition their defiance of economy and architecture directly they are emulated and imitated then as subjects of emulation models they quite give themselves away there is nothing so deplorable as a work of art with a leak in its interest and there is no such leak of interest as through commonness of form its opposite the found because the soughtfor form is the absolute citadel and tabernacle of interest but what a lecture i am reading youthough a very imperfect onewhich you have drawn upon yourself as moreover it was quite right you should but no matteri shall go for you againas soon as i find you in a lone corner  well dearest hugh love me a little better if you can for this letter for i am ever so fondly and faithfully yours   henry james      to miss rhoda broughton    reform club pall mall sw june 2nd 1912    my dear rhoda   too many days have elapsed since i got your kind letterbut london days do leak away even for one who punily tries to embank and economise themas i do they fall as it were fromor better still they utterly dissolve inmy nerveless grasp in that enfeebled clutch the pen itself tends to waggle and drop and hence in short my appearance of languor over the inkstand this is a dark moist sunday am and i sit alone in the great dim solemn library of this club thackerays megatherium or whatever and say to myself that the conditions now at last ought to be auspiciousthough indeed that merely tends to make me but brood inefficiently over the transformations of london as such scenes express them and as i have seen them go on growing now at last the place becomes an utter void a desert peopled with ghosts for all except three days about of the weekspeaking from the social point of view the old victorian social sunday is dust and ashes and a holy stillness a repudiating blankness has possessionwhich however after all has its merits and its conveniences too cadogan gardens meanwhile know me no morethe region has turned to sadness as if with your absence all the blinds were down and i now have no such confident and cordial afternoon refuge left very promptly next winter the blinds must be up again and i will keep the tryst i have been talking of you this evening with dear w e norris who is paying one of his much interspaced visits to town and has dined with me amiably without other attractions this letter begun this am and interrupted i take up again toward midnight   goodnight however nowi must stagger really from the force of too total an abstinence to my neverunappreciated couch norris dined on a bottle of sodawater and i on no drop of anything i pray you be bearing grandly up and i live in the light of your noble fortitude one is always the better for a great example and i am always allfaithfully yours   henry james      to henry james junior    lamb house rye july 16th 1912    dearest harry   i came down here from town but five days ago and feel intensely after so long an absence the blest the invaluable little old refugequality of dear l h at this and kindred seasons a tremendous wave of heat is sweeping over the landpassed on apparently from your sideand i left london a fiery furnace and the reform club a feather bed on top of one in the same the visitation still goes on day after day but with immense mitigation i can bear it herewhere nothing could be more mitigating than my fortunate conditions  the working expensively meanwhile signifies for me simply the literary and artistic the technical side of the matterthe fact that in doing this book i am led by the very process and action of my idiosyncrasy on and on into more evocation and ramification of old images and connections more intellectual and moral autobiography though all closely and as i feel it exquisitely associated and involved than i shall quite know what to do withto do with that is in this book i shall doubtless be able to use rejected or suppressed parts in some other way its my more and more or long since established difficulty always that i have to project and do a great deal in order to choose from that after the fact what is most designated and supremely urgent that is a costly way of working as regards time material etcat least in the short run in the long run and by and large it i think abundantly justifies itself that is really all i meant to convey to you and to your mother through billas a kind of precaution and forewarningfor your inevitable sense of my slowness of course too i have had pulls up and breaks sometimes disheartening ones through the recurrence of bad physical conditionsand am still liable strictly speaking to these but the main thing to say about these once for all is that they tend steadily and most helpfully to diminish both in intensity and in duration and that i have really now reached the point at which the successful effort to work really helps me physicallyto say nothing of course of a thousand times morally it remains true that i do worry about the moneyquestionby nature and fate since i was born worrying though myself much more than othersand that this is largely the result of these last years of lapse of productive work while my expenses have gone more or less while i was with you all in america less ruthlessly on but of this its also to be cheeringly said that i have only to be successfully and continuously at work for a period of about ten days for it all to fall into the background altogether all the worry and be replaced by the bravest confidence of calculation so much for that and now for the momentfor this post at least i must pull up well of course do i understand that with your big new preoccupations and duties close at hand you maynt dream of a move in this direction and i should be horrified at seeming to exert the least pressure toward your even repining at it more still than the delight of seeing you will be that of knowing that you are getting into close quarters with your new job i repeat that you have no idea of the good this will do meas to which i sit between your mother and peg clasping a hand of each while we watch your every movement and gloat ecstatically over you oh give my love so aboundingly to them and to your grandmother on it all  yours dearest harry more affectionately than ever   h j      to r w chapman        mrs brookenham is of course the mother of the young heroine of      the awkward age     lamb house rye july 17th 1912    dear mr chapman   i very earnestly beg you not to take as the measure of the pleasure given me by your letter the inordinate delay of this acknowledgment that admirable communication reaching me at the climax of the london june found me in a great tangle of difficulties over the command of my time and general conduct of my correspondence and other obligations so that after a vain invocation of a better promptness where you were concerned i took heart from the fact that i was soon to be at peace down here and that hence i should be able to address you at my ease i have in fact been here but a few days and my slight further delay has but risen from the fact that i brought down with me so many letters to answerthough none of them let me say begins to affect me with the beauty and interest of yours  i am in truth greatly touched deeply moved by it what is one to say or do in presence of an expression so generous and so penetrating i can only listen very hard as it were taking it all in with bowed head and clasped hands not to say moist eyes even and feel thatwell that the whole thing has been after all worth while then but one is simply in the hands of such a reader and appreciator as youone yields even assentingly gratefully and irresponsibly to the current of your story and consistency of your case i feel that i really dont know muchas to what your various particulars implysave that you are delightful are dazzling and that you must be beautifully right as to any view that you take of anything let me say for all that if you think so so it must be for clearly you see and understand and discriminatewhile one is at the end of time ones self so very vague about many things and only conscious of ones general virtuous intentions and considerably strenuous effort what one has done has been conditioned and related and involvedso to say fatalisedevery element and effort jammed up against some other necessity or yawning over some consequent voidand with anything good in ones achievement or fine in ones faculty conscious all the while of having to pay by this and that and the other corresponding dereliction or weakness you let me off however as handsomely as you draw me on and i see you as absolutely right about everything and want only to square with yours my impression that is to say any but that of my being dim in respect to some of the aspects possibly of mrs brookenhamwhich i dont think i am i really think i could stand a stiff crossexamination on that lady but this is a detail and i can meet you only in a large and fond presubmission on the various points you make i greatly wish our contact at oxford the other day had been less hampered and reducedso that it was impossible in the event altogether to get within hail of you at oriel but i have promised the kind president of magdalen another visit and then i shall insist on being free to come and see you if you will let me i cherish your letter and our brief talk meanwhile as charminglycoloured lights in the total of that shining occasion what power to irradiate has oxford at its bestand as it was the other week so greatly at that best i think the gruesome little errors of text you once so devotedly noted for me in some of my original volumes dont for the most part survive in the collective editionbut though a strenuous i am a constitutionally fallible proofreader and i am almost afraid to assure myself however i must more or less face it and i am yours dear mr chapman all gratefully and faithfully   henry james      to hugh walpole    lamb house rye aug 14th 1912   i rejoice that you wander to such good purposeby which i mean nothing more exemplary that that you apparently live in the light of curiosity and cheer im very glad for you that these gentle passions have the succulent scene of munich to pasture in i havent been there for long yearswas never there but once at all but havent forgotten how genial and sympathetic i found it drink deep of every impression and have a lot to tell me when the prodigal returns i love travellers talesespecially when i love the traveller therefore have plenty to thrill me and to confirm that passion withal i travel no further than this and never shall again but it serves my lean purposes or most of them and im thankful to be able to do so much and to feel even these quiet and wholesome little facts about me were having in this rude climate a summer of particularly bad and brutal mannersso far the sweetness of the matter fails but i get out in the lulls of the tempest it does nothing but rain and rage and when im within my mind still to me a kingdom is however dismembered and shrunken i havent seen a creature to talk of you withbut i see on these terms very few creatures indeed none worth speaking of still less worth talking to clearly you move still in the human mazebut i like to think of you there may it be long before you find the clue to the exit you say nothing of any return to these platitudes so i suppose you are to be still a good while on the warpath but when you are ready to smoke the pipe of peace come and ask me for a light its good for you to have read taines english lit he lacks saturation lacks waste of acquaintance but sees with a magnificent objectivity reacts with an energy to match expresses with a splendid amplitude and has just the critical value i think of being so off so far given such an intellectual reach and judging and feeling in so different an air its charming to me to hear that the ambassadors have again engaged and still beguile you it is probably a very packed production with a good deal of one thing within another i remember sitting on it when i wrote it with that intending weight and presence with which you probably often sit in these days on your trunk to make the lid close and all your trousers and boots go in i remember putting in a good deal about chad and strether or strether and chad rather and am not sure that i quite understand what in that connection you missi mean in the way of what could be there the whole thing is of course to intensity a picture of relationsand among them is though not on the first line the relation of strether to chad the relation of chad to strether is a limited and according to my method only implied and indicated thing sufficiently there but strethers to chad consists above all in a charmed and yearning and wondering sense a dimly envious sense of all chads young living and easilytaken other relations other not only than the one to him but than the one to mme de vionnet and whoever else this very sense and the sense of chad generally is a part a large part of poor dear strethers discipline development adventure and general history all of it that is of my subject seems to me givengiven by dramatic projection as all the rest is given how can you say i do anything so foul and abject as to state you deserve that i should condemn you to read the book over once again however instead of this i only impose that you come down to me on your return for a couple of dayswhen we can talk better i hold you to the heart of your truest old   h j      to edmund gosse        with regard to the dread effulgence of their lordships it will be      remembered that mr gosse was at this time librarian of the house      of lords the allusion at the end is to mr gosses article on      swinburne in the dictionary of national biography further dealt      with in the next letter    dictated   lamb house rye 7th october 1912    my dear gosse   forgive this coldblooded machineryfor i have been of late a stricken man and still am not on my legs though judging it a bit urgent to briefly communicate with you on a small practical matter i have had quite a devil of a summer a very bad and damnable july and august through a renewal of an ailment that i had regarded as a good deal subdued but that descended upon me in force just after i last saw you and then absolutely raged for many weeks i allude to a most deplorable tendency to chronic pectoral or more specifically anginal pain which however i finally about a month ago got more or less the better of in a considerably reassuring way i was but beginning to profit by this comparative reprieve when i was smitten with a violent attack of the atrocious affection known as shinglesmy impression of the nature of which had been vague and inconsiderate but to the now grim shade of which i take off my hat in the very abjection of respect it has been a very horrible visitation but i am getting better only i am still in bed and have to appeal to you in this graceless mechanical way my appeal bears on a tiny and trivial circumstance the fact that i have practically concluded an agreement for a flat which i saw and liked and seemed to find within my powers before leaving town no 21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw and which i am looking to for a more convenient and secure basis of regularly wintering in london for the possibly brief remainder of my days than any i have for a long time had i want in response to a letter just received from the proprietors of the same to floor that apparently rather benighted and stupid body who are restless over the question of a social reference in addition to my reference to my bankers by a regular knockdown production of the most eminent and exalted tie i can produce whereby i have given them your distinguished name as that of a voucher for my respectabilityas distinguished from my solvency for which latter i dont hint that you shall however dimly engage so i have it on my conscience you see to let you know of the liberty i have thus taken with you this on the chance of their really applying to you which some final saving sense of their being rather silly may indeed keep them from doing if they do kindly very kindly abound in my sense to the extent of intimating to them that not to know me famed for my respectability is scarcely to be respectable themselves that is all i am able to trouble you with now i am as yet a poor thing more even the doctors than mine own but shall come round presently and shall then be able to give you a better account of myself there is no question of my getting into the flat in question till some time in january i dont get possession till dec 25th but this preliminary has had to be settled dont be burdened to write i know your cares are on the eve of beginning again and how heavy they may presently be i have only wanted to create for our ironic intelligence the harmless pleasure of letting loose a little in a roundabout way upon the platitude of the city and west end properties limited the dread effulgence of their lordships the latter being the light and you the transparent lantern that my shaky hand holds up more as i say when that hand is less shaky i hope all your intimate news is good and am only waiting for the new vol of the dictionary with your swinburne which a word from sidney lee has assured me is of maximum value all faithful greeting   yours always henry james      to edmund gosse   dictated   lamb house rye october 10th 1912    my dear gosse   your good letter of this morning helps to console and sustain one really needs any lift one can get after this odious experience i am emerging but it is slow and i feel much ravaged and bedimmed fortunately these days have an intrinsic beautyof the rarest and charmingest here and i try to fling myself on the breast of nature though i dont mean by that fling myself and my poor blisters and scars on the dewsprinkled lawn and forget imperfectly that precious hours and days tumble unrestrained into the large round the deep dark the ever open hole of sacrifice i am almost afraid my silly lessors of the chelsea flat wont apply to you for a character of me if they havent done so by now afraid because the idea of a backhander from you reaching them straight would so gratify my sense of harmless sport it was only a question of a word in case they should appeal kindly dont dream of any such if they let the question rest in spite indeed of their having intimated that they would thoroughly thresh it out  i received with pleasure the small swinburneof so chaste and charming a form the perusal of which lubricated yesterday two or three rough hours your composition bristles with items and authenticities even as a tight little cushion with individual pins and i take it is everything that such a contribution to such a cause should be but for the not quite ample enough for my appetite conclusive estimate or appraisement i know how little far too little to my sense that element has figured in those pages in general but i should have liked to see you in spite of this formulate and resume a little more the creatures character and genius the aspect and effect of his general performance you will say i have a morbid hankering for what a dictionary doesnt undertake what a sidney lee perhaps even doesnt offer space for i admit that i talk at my easeso far as ease is in my line just now very charming and happy lord redesdales contributionshowing afresh how everything about such a being as s becomes and remains interesting prettily does redesdale writeand prettily will  have winced if indeed the pretty even in that form or the wincing in any could be conceived of him  i have received within a day or two dear old george merediths letters and though i havent been able yet very much to go into them i catch their emanation of something so admirable and on the whole so baffled and tragic we must have more talk of themand also of wells book with which however i am having extreme difficulty i am not so much struck with its hardness as with its weakness and looseness the utter going by the board of any real selfrespect of composition and of expression what lacerates me perhaps most of all in the meredith volumes is the meanness and poorness of editingthe absence of any attempt to project the image of character temper quantity and quality of mind general size and sort of personality that such a subject cries aloud for to the shame of our purblind criticism for such a vividness to go abegging  when one thinks of what vividness would in france in such a case have leaped to its feet in commemorative and critical response but there is too much to say and i am able in this minor key to say too little we must be at it again i was afraid your wife was having another stretch of the dark valley to treadi had heard of your brotherinlaws illness may peace somehow come i regreet and regret you all and am all faithfully yours   henry james      to edmund gosse   dictated   lamb house rye october 11th 1912    my dear gosse   let me thank you again on this lame basis though i still be for the charming form of your news of your having helped me with my fastidious friends of the flat clearly they were to be hurled to their doom for the proof of your having with your potent finger pressed the merciless spring arrives this morning in the form of a quite obsequious request that i will conclude our transaction by a signature this i am doing and i am meanwhile lost in fond consideration of the so susceptible spot susceptible to profanation that i shall have reached only after such purgations i thank you most kindly for settling the matter  very interesting your notein the matter of george meredith yes i spent much of yesterday reading the letters and quite agree with your judgment of them on the score of their rather marked nonillustration of his intellectual wealth they make one it seems to me enormously like himbut that one had always done and the series to morley and in a minor degree to maxse contain a certain number of rare and fine things many beautiful felicities of wit and vision but the whole aesthetic range understanding that in a big sense strikes me as meagre and short he clearly lived even less than one had the sense of his doing in the world of artin that whole divine preoccupation that whole intimate restlessness of projection and perception and this is the more striking that he appears to have been far more communicative and overflowing on the whole ground of what he was doing in prose or verse than i had at all supposed to have lived and wrought with all those doors more open and publicly slamming and creaking on their hinges as it were than had consorted with ones sense and with the whole legend of his intellectual solitude his whole case is full of anomalies however and these volumes illustrate it even by the light they throw on a certain poorness of range in most of his correspondents save for morley et encore most of them figure here as folk too little à la hauteur though of course a man even of his distinction can live and deal but with those who are within his radius he was starved to my vision in many waysand that makes him but the more nobly pathetic in fine the whole moral side of him throws out some splendidly clear lightswhile the artist the secondary shakespeare remains curiously dim your missing any letters to me rests on a misconception of my very limited even though extremely delightful to me active intercourse with him i had with him no sense of reciprocity he remained for me always a charming a quite splendid and rather strange exhibition so content itself to be one all genially and glitteringly but all exclusively that i simply sat before him till the curtain fell and then came again when i felt i should find it up but i never rang it up never felt any charge on me to challenge him by invitation or letter but one or two notes from him did i find when will meredith wrote to me and these though perfectly charming and kind i have preferred to keep unventilated however i am little enough observing that same discretion to you i slowly mend but its absurd how far i feel ive to come back from sore and strained has the horrid business left me but nevertheless i hope and in fact almost propose   yours all faithfully henry james      to edmund gosse        the morning post article was a review by mr gosse of the      letters of george meredith    dictated  lamb house rye  october 13th 1912    my dear gosse   this is quite a feverish flurry of correspondencebut please dont for a moment feel the present to entail on you the least further charge i only want to protest against your imputation of sarcasm to my figure of the pincushion and the pinsand this all genially that image having represented to myself the highest possible tribute to your biographic facture what i particularly meant was that probably no such tense satin slope had ever before grown within the same number of square inches so dense a little forest of discriminated upright stems there you are and i hear with immense satisfaction of the prospect of another crop yetthis time i infer on larger ground and with beautiful alleys and avenues and vistas piercing the plantation  i rejoice alike to know of the mp article on which i shall be able to put my hand here betimes tomorrow i cant help wishing i had known of it a little beforei should have liked so to bring in time a few of my gleanings to your mill but evidently we are quite under the same general impression and your point about the dear mans confoundingness of allusion to the products of the french spirit is exactly what one had found oneself bewilderedly noting there are two or three rather big felicities and sanities of judgment in this order in one place a fine strong rightlydiscriminated apprehension and characterisation of victor hugo but for the rest such queer lapses and wanderings wild with the striking fact above all that he scarcely once in the 2 volumes makes use of a french phrase or ventures on a french passage as in sundry occasional notes of acknowledgment and other like flights without some marked inexpertness or gaucherie three or four of these things are even painfulthey cause one uncomfortably to flush and he appears to have gone to france thanks to his second wifes connections there putting in little visits and having contacts of a scattered sort much oftener than i supposed he went abroad for that matter during certain years a good deal more than i had fancied him able towhich is an observation i find even now of much comfort but ones impression of his lack of what its easiest to call most comprehensively aesthetic curiosity is i take it exactly what you will have expressed your sense of he speaks a couple of times of greatly admiring a novel of daudets numa roumestan with the remark twice over that he has never liked any of the others he only likes this one the tone is of the oddest coming from a man of the crafteven though the terms on which he himself was of the craft remain so peculiarand such as there would be so much more to say about to a fellownovelist who could read daudet at all and i cant imagine his not in such a relation being read with curiosity with critical appetite numa might very well appear to stand out from the others as the finest flower of the same method but not to take it as one of them or to take them as of its family and general complexion is to reduce liking and notliking to the sort of use that a spellingout schoolgirl might make of them most of all if i dont bore you i think one particular observation countsor has counted for me the fact of the nonoccurrence of one name the one that aesthetic curiosity would have seemed scarce able in any real overflow to have kept entirely shy of that of balzac i mean which meredith not only never once even stumbles against but so much as seems to stray within possible view of of course one would never dream of measuring play of mind in such a case by any mans positive mentions few or many of the said b yet when he isnt ever mentioned a certain desert effect comes from it at least it does to thirsty me and i make all sorts of little reflections but i am making too many now and they are loose and casual and you mustnt mind them for the present all the more that im sorry to say i am still on shaky ground physically this odious ailment not being apparently a thing that spends itself and clears off but a beastly poison which hangs about even after the most copious eruption and explosion and suggests dismal relapses and returns to bed i am really thinking of this latter form of relief even nowafter having been up but for a couple of hours however dont mind me even if im in for a real relapse some of the sting will i trust have been drawn   yours rather wearily henry james   ps i am having it appearssunday 2 pmto tumble back into bed though i rose but at 10     to edmund gosse   dictated   lamb house rye  october 15th 1912    my dear gosse   here i am at it againfor i cant not thank you for your two notes last night and this morning received your wife has all my tenderest sympathy in the matter of what the loss of her brother cost her intimately will her feet have learnt to know these ways so it goes on till we have no one left to loseas i felt with force two summers ago when i lost my two last brothers within two months and became sole survivor of all my fathers house i lay my hand very gently on our friend  with your letter of last night came the cornhill with the beautifully done little swinburne chapter what a grateful subject somehow in every way that gifted beingputting aside even i mean the value of his genius he is grateful by one of those arbitrary values that dear gm for instance doesnt positively command in proportion to his intrinsic weight and who can say quite why charming and vivid and authentic at any rate your picture of that occasion to say nothing of your evocation charged with so fine a victorian melancholy of swinburnes time at vichy with leighton mrs sartoris and richard burton what a felicitous and enviable image they do make togetherand what prodigious discourse must even more particularly have ensued when s and b sat up late together after the others distinct to me the memory of a sunday afternoon at flauberts in the winter of 7576 when maupassant still inédit but always round regaled me with a fantastic tale irreproducible here of the relations between two englishmen each other and their monkey a picture the details of which have faded for me but not the lurid impression most deliciously victorian that tooi bend over it all so yearningly and to the effect of my hoping ever so that you are in conscious possession of material for a series of just such other chapters in illustration of s each a separate fine flower for a vivid even if loose nosegay  im much interested by your echo of haldanes remarks or whatever about g m only the difficulty is of a truth somehow that ces messieurs he and morley and maxse and stephen and two or three others lady ulrica included really never knew much more where they were on all the aesthetic ground as one for convenience calls it than the dear man himself did or where he was so that the whole history seems a record somehow so far as art and letters are in question of a certain absence of point on the part of every one concerned in it still it abides with us i think that meredith was an admirable spirit even if not an entire mind he throws out to my sense splendid great moral and ethical what he himself would call spiritual lights and has again and again big strong whiffs of manly tone and clear judgment the fantastic and the mannered in him were as nothing i think to the intimately sane and straight just as the artist was nothing to the good citizen and the liberalised bourgeois however lead me not on i thank you ever so kindly for the authenticity of your word about these beastly recurrences of my disorder i feel you floated in confidence on the deep tide of philips experience and wisdom still i am trying to keep mainly out of bed again after 48 hours just renewedly spent in it but on these terms youll wish me back thereand im yours with no word more   henry james      to edmund gosse        mr gosse had asked for further details with regard to maupassants      tale referred to in the previous letter the legend in question      was connected with etretat and the odd figure of george e j      powell swinburnes host there during the summer of 1868 and more      than once afterwards    dictated   lamb house rye  october 17th 1912    my dear gosse   its very well invoking a close to this raging fever of a correspondence when you have such arts for sending and keeping the temperature up i feel in the presence of your letter last night received that the little machine thrust under ones tongue may well now register or introduce the babble of a mind affected though interestingly so let me add since it is indeed a thrill to think that i am perhaps the last living depositary of maupassants wonderful confidence or legend i really believe myself the last survivor of those then surrounding gustave flaubert i shrink a good deal at the same time i confess under the burden of an honour unto which i was not born or more exactly hadnt been properly brought up or preadmonished and preinspired to i pull myself together i invoke fond memory as you urge upon me and i feel the huge responsibility of my office and privilege but at the same time i must remind you of certain inevitable weaknesses in my position certain essential infirmities of my relation to the precious fact meaning by the precious fact maupassants having in that night of time and that general failure of inspiring prescience so remarkably regaled me you will see in a moment everything that was wanting to make me the conscious recipient of a priceless treasure you will see in fact how little i could have any of the right mental preparation i didnt in the least know that m himself was going to be so remarkable i didnt in the least know that i was going to be i didnt in the least know and this was above all most frivolous of me that you were going to be i didnt even know that the monkey was going to be or even realise the peculiar degree and nuance of the preserved lustre awaiting ces messieurs the three taken together guys story he was only known as guy then dropped into my mind but as an unrelated thing or rather as one related and indeed with much intensity to the peculiarly rum weird macabre and unimaginable light in which the interesting or in other words the delirious in english conduct and in english character areor were especially thenviewed in french circles sufficiently selfrespecting to have views on the general matter at all or in other words among the truly refined and enquiring here they are at it i remember that as my main inward comment on maupassants vivid little history which was thus thereby somehow more vivid to me about him than about either our friends or the monkey as to whom as i say i didnt in the least foresee this present hour of arraignment  at the same time i think im quite prepared to say in fact absolutely that of the two versions of the tale the two quite distinct ones to which you attribute a mystic and separate currency over there maupassants story to me was essentially version no i it wasnt at all the minor the comparatively banal anecdote really what has remained with me is but the note of two elementsthat of the monkeys jealousy and that of the monkeys death how brought about the latter i cant at all at this time of day be sure though i am haunted as with the vague impression that the poor beast figured as having somehow destroyed himself committed suicide through the separate injuria formae the third person in the fantastic complication was either a young man employed as servant within doors or one employed as boatman and in either case i think english and some thin ghost of an impression abides with me that the jealousy was more on the monkeys part toward him than on his toward the monkey with which the circumstance that the death i seem most yet so dimly to disembroil is simply and solely or at least predominantly that of the resentful and impassioned beast who hovers about me as having seen the other fellow the jeune anglais or whoever installed on the scene after he was more or less lord of it and so invade his province you see how light and thin and confused are my data how i wish i had known or guessed enough in advance to be able to oblige you better now not a stone then would i have left unturned not an i would i have allowed to remain undotted no analysis or exhibition of the national character of either of the national characters so involved would i have failed to catch in the act yet i do so far serve you it strikes me as to be clear about thisthat whatever turn the dénouement took whichever life was most luridly sacrificed of those of the two humble dependants the drama had essentially been one of the affections the passions the last cocasserie with each member of the quartette involved disentangle it as you cani think browning alone could really do so does this at any ratethe best i can do for youthrow any sufficient light i recognise the importance the historic bearing and value of the most perfectly workedout view of it such a pity with this that as i recover the fleeting moments from across the long years it is my then active figuration of the so tremendously averti young guys intellectual critical vital experience of the subjectmatter that hovers before me rather than my comparatively detached curiosity as to the greater or less originality of ces messieurseven though with this highly original they would appear to have been i seem moreover to mix up the occasion a little i mean the occasion of that confidence with another still more dim on which the so communicative guy put it to me àpropos of i scarce remember what that though he had remained quite outside of the complexity i have been glancing at some jeune anglais in some other connection had sought to draw him into some scarcely less fantastic or abnormal one to the necessary determination on his part of some prompt and energetic action to the contrary the details of which now escape meits all such a golden blur of oldtime flaubertism and goncourtism how many more strange flowers one might have gathered up and preserved there was something from goncourt one afternoon about certain swans they seem to run so to the stranger walks of the animal kingdom who figured in the background of some prodigious british existence and of whom i seem to recollect there is some faint recall in la faustin not by the way le faustin as i think the printer has betrayed you into calling it in your recent cornhill paper but the golden blur swallows up everything everything but the slowcrawling the too lagging loitering amendment in my tiresome condition outdistanced by the impatient and attached spirit of yours all faithfully   henry james      to h g wells   dictated   lamb house rye october 18th 1912    my dear wells   i have been sadly silent since having to wire you nearly three weeks ago my poor plea of inability to embrace your so graceful offer of an occasion for my at last meeting in accordance with my liveliest desire the eminent arnold bennett sadly in fact is a mild word for it for i have cursed and raged i have almost irrecoverably sufferedwith all of which the end is not yet i had just been taken when i answered your charming appeal with a violent and vicious attack of shinglesunder which i have lain prostrate till this hour i dont shake it offand perhaps you know how fell a thing it may be i am precariously up and can do a little to beguile the black inconvenience of loss of time at a most awkward season by dealing after this graceless fashion with such arrears of smashed correspondence as i may so presume to patch up but i maynt yet plan for the repair of other lossesi see no hope of my leaving home for many days and havent yet been further out of this house than to creep feebly about my garden where a blest season has most fortunately reigned a couple of months hence i go up to town to stay i have taken a lease of a small unfurnished flat in chelsea on the river and there for the ensuing five or six months i shall aim at inducing you to bring the kind bennett whom i meanwhile cordially and ruefully greet to partake with me of some modest hospitality  meanwhile if ive been deprived of you on one plane ive been living with you very hard on another you may not have forgotten that you kindly sent me marriage as you always so kindly render me that valued service which ive been able to give myself to at my less afflicted and ravaged hours i have read you as i always read you and as i read no one else with a complete abdication of all those principles of criticism canons of form preconceptions of felicity references to the idea of method or the sacred laws of composition which i roam which i totter through the pages of others attended in some dim degree by the fond yet feeble theory of but which i shake off as i advance under your spell with the most cynical inconsistency for under your spell i do advancesave when i pull myself up stock still in order not to break it with so much as the breath of appreciation i live with you and in you and almost canniballike on you on you h g w to the sacrifice of your marjories and your traffords and whoever may be of their company not your treatment of them at all but much more their befooling of you pass me the merely scientific expressioni mean your fine high action in view of the red herring of lively interest they trail for you at their heels becoming thus of the essence of the spectacle for me and nothing in it all happening so much as these attestations of your character and behaviour these reactions of yours as you more or less follow them affect me as vividly happening i see you behave all along much more than i see them even when they behave as im not sure they behave most in marriage with whatever charged intensity or accomplished effect so that the ground of the drama is somehow most of all the adventure for younot to say of youthe moral temperamental personal expressional of your setting it forth an adventure in fine more appreciable to me than any of those you are by way of letting them in for i dont say that those you let them in for dont interest me too and dont come off and people the scene and lead on the attention about as much as i can do with but only and always that you beat them on their own ground and that your story through the five hundred pages says more to me than theirs youll find this perhaps a queer rigmarole of a statement but i ask you to allow for it just now as the mumble at best of an invalid and wait a little till i can put more of my hand on my sense mind you that the restriction i may seem to you to lay on my view of your work still leaves that work more convulsed with life and more brimming with blood than any it is given me nowadays to meet the point i have wanted to make is that i find myself absolutely unable and still more unwilling to approach you or to take leave of you in any projected light of criticism in any judging or concluding any comparing in fact in any aesthetic or literary relation at all and this in spite of the fact that the light of criticism is almost that in which i most fondly bask and that the amusement i consequently renounce is one of the dearest of all to me i simply declinethats the way the thing worksto pass you again through my cerebral oven for critical consumption i consume you crude and whole and to the last morsel cannibalistically quite as i say licking the platter clean of the last possibility of a savour and remaining thus yours abjectly   henry james      to mrs humphry ward   dictated   lamb house rye  october 22nd 1912    dear mary ward   having to acknowledge in this coldblooded form so gracious a favour as your kind letter just received is so sorry a business as to tell at once a sad tale of the stricken state i have been laid up these three weeks with an atrocious visitation of shingles as the odious ailment is so vulgarly and inadequately calledthe medical herpes zonalis meeting much better the malign intensity of the caseand the end is not yet i am still most sore and sorry and can but work off in this fashion a fraction of my correspondence cest assez vous dire that i can make no plan for any social adventure within any computable time forgive my taking this occasion to add further and with that final frankness that winds up periods of life and earthly stages as it were that i feel the chapter of social adventure now forever closed and that i must go on for the rest of my days such as that rest may be only tout doucement as utterly doucement as can possibly be managed i am aged infirm hideously unsociable and utterly detached from any personal participation in the political game to which i am naturally and from all circumstances so alien here and which forms the constant carnival of all you splendid young people dont take this unamiable statement please for a profession of relaxed attachment to any bright individual or least of all to any valued old friends but just pardon my dropping it as i pass in the interest of the great pusillanimity that i find it important positively to cultivateeven at the risk of affecting you as solemn and pompous and ridiculous i will admit to you should you be so gently patient as to be moved in the least to contend with me that this prolonged visitation of pain doesnt suggest to one views of future ease of any kind i have none the less a view of coming up to town for the rest of the winter as soon as possible after christmas and i reserve the social adventure of tea in grosvenor placeeffected with impunityas the highest crown of my confidence i shall trust you then to observe how exactly those charming conditions may seem suited to my powers im delighted to know meanwhile that you have finished a gallant piece of work which is more than i can say of myself after a whole summer of stiff frustration for my current complaint is but the overflow of the bucket just see how your great goodnature has exposed you to that spatterment but i pull upthis is too lame a gait and am yours all not less faithfully than feebly   henry james      to mrs humphry ward   dictated   lamb house rye  october 24th 1912    my dear mary ward   i feel i must really thank you afresh even by the freedom of this impersonal mechanism for your renewed expression of kindnessvery soothing and sustaining to me in my still rather dreary case i am doing my utmost to get better but the ailment has apparently endless secrets of its own for preventing that an infernal player with still another and another vicious card up his sleeve this is precisely why your generous accents touch memaking me verily yearn as i think of the balm i should indeed find in talking with you of the latest products of those producers few though they be who lend themselves in a degree to remark i have but within a day or two permitted myself a modicum of remark to hg wellswho had sent me marriage but i should really rather have addressed the quantity to you on whom its not so important i should make my impression i mean i should be in your case comparatively irrelevantwhereas in his i feel myself relevant only to be by the same stroke as it were but vain and ineffectual strange to mein his affairthe coexistence of so much talent with so little art so much life with so to speak so little living but of him there is much to say for i really think him more interesting by his faults than he will probably ever manage to be in any other way and he is a most vivid and violent objectlesson but its as if i were pretending to talkwhich for this beastly frustration i am not i envy you the quite ideal and transcendent jollity as if marie corelli had herself evoked the image for us of having polished off a brilliant coup and being on your way to celebrate the case in paris its for me today as if people only did these things in marieand in mary do while you are there reenter if convenient to you into relation with mrs wharton if she be back that is from the last of her dazzling her incessant braveries of far excursionism you may in that case be able to appease a little my always lively appetite for news of her dont i beseech you acknowledge in any manner this with all you have else to do not even to hurl back upon me in refutation reprobation or whatever the charge i still persist in of your liking politics because of your all having as splendid young people the perpetual good time of being so intimately in them they never cease to remind me personally here close corporation or intimate social club as they practically affect the aged and infirm the lone and detached the abjectly literary and unenrolled alien as being that one must sacrifice all sorts of blest freedoms and immunities treasures of detachment and perception that make up for the outsider state on any occasion of practical approach to circling round the camp for penetration into which i havent a single one of your passwordsyours i again mean of the splendid young lot but dont pity me all the same for this picture of my dim exclusion it is so compatible with more other initiations than i know on the whole almost what to do with i hear the passwords givenfor it does happen that they sometimes reach my ear and then so far from representing for me the salt of life as you handsomely put it they seem to form for me the very measure of intellectual insipidity all of which however is so much more than i meant to be led on to growl back at your perfect benevolence still still stillwell still i am harmoniously yours   henry james      to gaillard t lapsley   dictated   lamb house rye  october 24th 1912  my dear grand gaillard   i seem to do nothing just now but hurl back gruff refusals at gracious advancesand all in connection with the noble shades and the social scenes you particularly haunt i wrote howard s last night that i couldnt for weary dreary reasons come to meet you at quacre and now i have just polished off by this mechanical means to which for the time im squalidly restricted the illustrious master of magdalene who artfully and insidiously backed by your scarce less shining self has invited me to exhibit my battered old person and blighted old wit on some luridly near day in those parts i have had to refuse him though using for the purpose the most grovelling language and i have now to thank you with the same morbid iridescence of form and the same invincible piggishness of spirit for your share in the large appeal things are complicated with me to the last degree please believe at present and the highest literary flights i am capable of are these vain gestes from the dizzy edge of the couch of pain i have been this whole month sharply illunder an odious visitation of shingles and am not yet free or healed or able not at all on my feet or at my ease it has been a most dismal summer for me for after a most horrid and undermined july and august i had begun in september to face about to work and hope when this new plague of egypt suddenly broketo make confusion worse confounded i am up to my neck in arrears disabilities and i should add despairswere my resolution not to be beaten however battered not so adequate apparently to my constitutional presumption meanwhile oh yes i am of course as bruised and bored as deprived and isolated and even as indignant as you like but that i still can be indignant seems to kind of promise perhaps its a symptom of dawning salvation the great thing at any rate is for you to understand that i look forward to being fit within no calculable time either to prance in public or prattle in private and that i grieve to have nothing better to tell you very charming and kind to me your own news from làbas i wont attempt to do justice now to all that side i sent howard last night some express message to youwhich kindly see that he delivers we shall manage something all the same yet and i am all faithfully yours   henry james      to john bailey        the following refers to the offer transmitted by mr bailey of      the chairmanship of the english association    dictated   lamb house rye  november 11th 1912    my dear john   forgive and while you are about it please commiserate my having to take this roundabout way of acknowledging your brave letter i am stricken and helpless stilli cant sit up like a gentleman and drive the difficult pen i am having an absolutely horrid and endless visitationbeing now in the seventh week of the ordeal i had the other day to mention to you its a weary dreary business perpetual atrocious suffering and you must pardon my replying to you as i can and not at all as i would and i speak here i have alas to say not of my form of utterance onlyfor my matter given that of your own charming appeal would have in whatever conditions to be absolutely the same let me for some poor comforts sake make the immediate rude jump to the one possible truth of my case it is out of my power to meet your invitation with the least decency or grace when one declines a beautiful honour when one simply sits impenetrable to a generous and eloquent appeal one had best have the horrid act over as soon as possible and not appear to beat about the bush and keep up the fond suspense for me frankly my dear john there is simply no question of these things i am a mere stony ugly monster of dissociation and detachment i have never in all my life gone in for these other things but have dodged and shirked and successfully evaded themto the best of my power at least and so far as they have in fact assaulted me all my instincts and the very essence of any poor thing that i might or even still may trump up for the occasion as my genius have been against them and are more against them at this day than ever though two or three of them meaning by them the collective and congregated bodies the splendid organisations aforesaid have successfully got their teeth in spite of all i could do into my bewildered and badgered antiquity and this last you see is just one of the reasons for my not collapsing further not exhibiting the last demoralisation under the elegant pressure of which your charming plea is so all but dazzling a specimen i cant go into it all much in this sorry condition a bad and dismal one still for my ailment is not only at the end of so many weeks as tedious as you suppose but quite fiendishly painful into the bargainbut the rough sense of it is that i believe only in absolutely independent individual and lonely virtue and in the serenely unsociable or if need be at a pinch sulky and sullen practice of the same the observation of a lifetime having convinced me that no fruit ripens but under that temporarily graceless rigour and that the associational process for bringing it on is but a bright and hollow artifice all vain and delusive i speak here of the artsor of my own poor attempt at one or two of them the other matters must speak for themselves let me even while i am about it heap up the measure of my grossness the mere dim vision of presiding or what is called i believe taking the chair at a speechifying public dinner fills me and has filled me all my life with such aversion and horror that i have in the most odious manner consistently refused for years to be present on such occasions even as a guest preassured of protection and effacement and have not departed from my grim consistency even when cherished and excellent friends were being offered the banquet i have at such times let them know in advance that i was utterly not to be counted on and have indeed quite gloried in my shame sitting at home the while and gloating over the fact that i wasnt present in fine the revolution that my pretending to lend myself to your noble combination would propose to make in my life is unthinkable save as a convulsion that would simply end it this then must serve as my answer to your kindest of lettersuntil at some easier hour i am able to make you a less brutal one i know you would or even will wrestle with me or at least feel as if you would like to and i wont deny that to converse with you on any topic under the sun and even in a connection in which i may appear at my worst can never be anything but a delight to me the idea of such a delight so solicits me in fact as i write that if i were only somewhat less acutely laid up and free to spend less of my time in bed and in anguish i would say at once do come down to lunch and dine and sleep so that i may have the pleasure of you in spite of my nasty attitude as it is please let me put it thus that as soon as i get sufficiently better if i ever do at this rate to rise to the level of even so modest an hospitality as i am at best reduced to i will appeal to you to come and partake of it in your magnanimity to that extent not to show you that i am not utterly adamant but that for private association for the banquet of two and the fellowship of that fine scale i have the best will in the world we shall talk so much and i am convinced in spite of everything so happily that i wont say more nowexcept that i venture all the same to commend myself brazenly to mrs john and that i am yours all faithfully   henry james      to dr j william white   dictated   lamb house rye  november 14th 1912    my dear william   i am reduced for the present to this graceless machinery but i would rather use it on you than let your vivid letter pass under stress of my state and so establish a sad precedent since you know i never let your letters pass i have been down these seven weeks with an atrocious and apparently absolutely endless attack of shinglesherpes zonalis you see i knowof the abominable nature of which at their worst you will be aware from your professional experience even if you are not as i devoutly hope by your personal i have been having a simple hell saving letitias presence of a time for at its worst and a mysterious providence has held me worthy only of that the pain and the perpetual distress are to the last degree excruciating and wearing the end moreover is not yet i go on and onand feel as if i might for the rest of my lifeor would honestly so feel were it not that i have some hope of light or relief from an eminent specialist  who has most kindly promised to come down from london and see me three days hence my good local practitioner has quite thrown up the spongehe can do nothing for me further and has welcomed a consultation with an alacrity that speaks volumes for his now at last quite voided state  this is a dismal tale to regale you withaccustomed as even you are to dismal tales from me but let it stand for attenuation of my failure to enter with any lightness of step upon the vast avenue of complacency over which you invite me to advance to some fonder contemplation of mr roosevelt i must simply state to you my dear william that i cant so much as think of mr roosevelt for two consecutive moments he has become to me these last months the mere monstrous embodiment of unprecedented resounding noise the steps he lately took toward that effectof presenting himself as the noisiest figure or agency of any kind in the long dire annals of the human racehaving with me at least so consummately succeeded i can but see him and hear him and feel him as raging sound and fury and if ever a man was in a phase of his weary development or stage of his persistent decline as you will call it or crisis of his afflicted nerves which you will say i deserve not to wish to roar with that babel or to be roared at by it that wormlike creature is your irreconcileable friend let me say that i havent yet read your eulogy of the monster as enclosed by you in the newspaper columns accompanying your letterthis being a bad weak oppressed and harassed moment for my doing so you see the savagery of last summer thundering upon our tympanums pardon me tympana from over the sea has left such scars such a jangle of the auditive nerve am i technically right as to make the least menace of another yell a thing of horror i dont mean dear william that i suppose you yellmy auditive nerve cherishes in spite of everything the memory of your vocal sweetness but your bristling protégé has but to peep at me from over your shoulder to make me clap my hands to my ears and bury my head in the deepest hollow of that pile of pillows amid which i am now passing so much of my life however i must now fall back upon themand i rejoice meanwhile in those lines of your good letter in which you give so handsome an account of your own soundness and physical saneness i take this fondly too for the picture of letitias formknowing as i do with what inveterate devotion she ever forms herself upon you i embrace you both my dear williamso far as you consent to my abasing you and abasing letitia which is graver to the pillows aforesaid and am ever affectionately yours and hers   henry james      to edmund gosse        mr gosses volume was his portraits and sketches just      published    dictated   lamb house rye  november 19th 1912    my dear gosse   i received longer ago than i quite like to give you chapter and verse for your sovividly interesting volume of literary portraits but you will have or at least i earnestly beg you to have no reproach for my long failure of acknowledgment when i tell you that my sorry state under this dire physical visitation has unintermittently continued and that the end or any kind of real break in a continuity of quite damnable pain has still to be taken very much on trust i am now in my 8th week of the horrible experience which i have had to endure with remarkably little medical mitigationreally with none worth speaking of stricken and helpless therefore i can do but little to this communicative tune on any one day which has been also the more the case as my admirable secretary was lately forced to be a whole fortnight absentwhen i remained indeed without resource i avail myself for this snatch of one of the first possible days or rather hours since her return but i read your book with lively reactions within the first week of its arrival and if i had then only had you more within range should have given you abundantly the benefit of my impressions making you more genial observations than i shall perhaps now be able wholly to recover i recover perfectly the great one at any rateit is that each of the studies has extraordinary individual life and that of swinburne in particular of course more than any image that will ever be projected of him this is a most interesting and charming paper with never a drop or a slackness from beginning to end i cant help wishing you had proceeded a little further criticallythat is i mean in the matter of appreciation of his essential stuff and substance the proportions of his mixture etc as i should have been tempted to say to you for instance go into that a bit now when you speak of the early settingin of his arrest of development etc but this may very well have been out of your frameit might indeed have taken you far and the space remains wonderfully filledin the figure allconvincing beautiful too the bailey the horne and the creightonthis last very rich and fine and touching i envy you your having known so well so genial a creature as creighton with such largeness of endowment you have done him very handsomely and tenderly and poor little shorthouse not to the last point of tenderness perhaps but no doubt as handsomely none the less as was conceivably possible i wont deny to you that it was to your andrew lang i turned most immediately and with most suspenseand with most of an effect of drawing a long breath when it was over it is very prettily and artfully brought offbut you would of course have invited me to feel with you how little you felt you were doing it as we should so to speak have really liked of course there were the difficulties and of course you had to defer in a manner to some of them but your paper is of value just in proportion as you more or less overrode them his recent extinction the facts of long acquaintance and camaraderie let alone the wonder of several of his gifts and the mass of his achievement couldnt and still cant in his case not he complicating clogging and qualifying circumstances but what a pity with them all that a figure so lending itself to a certain amount of interesting real truthtelling should honestly speaking enjoy such impunity as regards some of its idiosyncrasies should get off so scotfree scotfree is exactly the word on all the ground of its greatest hollowness so much of its most successful puerility and perversity where i cant but feel that he should be brought to justice is in the matter of his whole giveaway of the value of the wonderful chances he so continually enjoyed enjoyed thanks to certain of his very gifts i admitgiveaway i mean by his cultivation absolutely of the puerile imagination and the fourthrate opinion the coming round to that of the old applewoman at the corner as after all the good and the right as to any of the mysteries of mind or of art his mixture of endowments and vacant holes and the making of the part of each would by themselves be matter for a really edifying critical studyfor which however i quite recognise that the day and the occasion have already hurried heedlessly away and i perhaps throw a disproportionate weight on the whole questionmerely by reason of a late accident or two such as my having recently read his in two or three respects so able joan of arc or maid of france and turned over his justpublished i think posthumous compendium of english literature which lies on my table downstairs the extraordinary inexpensiveness and childishness and impertinence of this latter gave to my sense the measure of a whole side of lang and yet which was one of the sides of his greatest flourishing his extraordinary voulu scotch provincialism crowns it and rounds it off really making one at moments ask with what kind of an innermost intelligence such inanities and follies were compatible the joan of arc is another matter of course but even there with all the accomplishment all the possession of detail the sense of reality the vision of the truths and processes of life the light of experience and the finer sense of history seem to me so wanting that in spite of the things being written so intensely at anatole france and in spite of some of a fs own and so different perversities one kind of feels and believes andrew again and again bristlingly yet bêtement wrong and anatole sinuously yet oh so wisely right  however all this has taken me absurdly far and youll wonder why i should have broken away at such a tangent you had given me the opportunity but its over and i shall never speak again i wish you would all the samesince it may still somehow come your way your paper as it stands is a gage of possibilities but goodbyei cant in this condition keep anything up scarce even my confidence that time to which i have been clinging is going after all to help i had from saturday to sunday afternoon last it is true the admirably kind and beneficent visit of a london friend who happens to be at the same time the great and allknowing authority and expert on herpes he was so angelic as to come down and see me for 24 hours thoroughly overhaul me and leave me with the best assurance and with what is more to the point a remedy very probably more effective than any yet vouchsafed to me when i do at last emerge i shall escape from these confines and come up to town for the rest of the winter but i shall have to feel differently first and it may not be for some time yet it in fact cant possibly be soon you shall have then at any rate more newswhich à la mrs gamp i hope your own has a better show to make   yours all and all faithfully henry james   ps i hope my last report on the little etretat legendit seems not the legend but the report of so long agogave you something of the light you desired and how i should have liked to hear about the colvin dinner and its rich chiaroscuro he has sent me his printedcharming i thinkspeech the best thing he has done     to mrs bigelow   dictated   lamb house rye  november 21st 1912    my dear edith   it is interesting to hear from you on any groundeven when i am in the stricken state that this form of reply will suggest to you for a couple of hours in the morning i can work off letters in this waythis way only but let the rest be silence till i scramble somehow or other if i ever do out of my hole pray for me hard meanwhileyou and baby and even the ingenuous young man pray for me with every form and rite of sacrifice and burntoffering  as for the matter of your little request it is of course easy too easy to comply with why shouldnt you for instance just nip off my simple signature at the end of this and hand it to the artless suppliant i call him by these bad names in spite of your gentle picture of him for the simple reason that the time long ago half a century ago passed away when a request for ones autograph could affect one as anything but the cheapest and vaguest and emptiest tribute the futility of our common nature is capable of i should like your young friend so much better and believe so much more in his sentiments if it exactly hadnt occurred to him to put forth the banal claim my heart has been from far back as i say absolutely hard against it and the rate at which it is saving your presence postally vomited forth is one of the least graceful features one of the vulgarest and dustiest and poorest of the great and glorious country beyond the sea these ruthless words of mine will sufficiently explain to you why i indulge in no further flourish for our common admirer for im sure you share him with me than my few and bare terminal penstrokes here shall represent put him off with themand even if you like read him my relentless words then if he winces or weeps or does anything nice and penitent and above all intelligent press him to your bosom pat him on the back which you would so be in a position to do and tell him to sin no more  what is much more interesting are your vivid little words about yourself and the child i shall put them by with your address upon them till emerging from my long tunnel as god grant i may i come up to town to put in the rest of the winter i have taken the lease a longish one of a little flat in chelsea cheyne walk which must now give me again a better place of london hibernation than i have for a long time had it had become necessary for lifesaving and as soon as i shall have turned round in it you must come and have tea with me and bring baby and even the ingenuous one if my wild words havent or dont turn his tender passion to loathing i shall really like much to see himand even send him my love and blessing even if i have produced in him a vindictive reaction i will engage to take him in hand and so gently argue with him on the horrid autograph habit that he will perhaps renew his generous vows i shall have nothing to show you later on so charming as the rhythmic butchers or the musical pub only a dull inhuman view of the riverwhich however adds almost as much to my rent as i gather that your advantages add to yours yours all faithfully   henry james   ps i see the infatuated youth is on reading your note fondly over not at your side but on the other side and therefore not amenable to your bosom worse luck for himso i scrawl him my sign independently of this but the moral holds     to robert c witt        it will be remembered that the story of the outcry turns on the      fortunes of a picture attributed to il mantovano    dictated   lamb house rye  november 27th 1912    dear sir   i am almost shocked to learn through your appreciative note that in imaginatively projecting for use in the outcry such a painter as the mantovano i unhappily coincided with an existing name an artistic identity a real one with visible examples in the annals of the art i had never heard in i am afraid my disgraceful ignorance of the painter the two specimens of whom in the national gallery you cite and fondly flattered myself that i had simply excogitated for its part in my drama a name at once plausible that is of good italian type and effective as it were for dramatic bandyingabout it was important you see that with the great claim that the story makes for my artist i should have a strictly supposititious onewith no awkward existing data to cast a possibly invidious or measurable light so my mantovano was a creature of mere convincing fancyand this revelation of my not having been as inventive as i supposed rather puts me out but i owe it to you none the less that i shall be ableafter i have recovered from this humiliationto go and have a look at our ng interloper i thank you for this and am faithfully yours   henry james      to mrs wharton        mrs wharton had sent him her recently published novel the reef    dictated   lamb house rye  december 4th 1912    my dear e w   your beautiful book has been my portion these several days but as other matters of a less ingratiating sort have shared the fair harbourage i fear i have left it a trifle bumped and bousculé in that at the best somewhat agitated basin there it will gracefully ride the waves however long after every other temporarily floating object shall have sunk as so much comparative rot beneath them this is a rude figure for my sense of the entire interest and charm the supreme validity and distinction of the reef i am even yet alas in anything but a good wayso abominably does my ailment drag itself out but it has been a real lift to read you and taste and ponder you the experience has literally worked at its hours in a medicating sense that neither my local nor my london doctor present here in his greatness for a night and a day shall have come within miles and miles of let me mention at once and have done with it that the advent and the effect of the intenser london light can only be described as an anticlimax in fact as a tragic farce of the first water in short one of those mauvais tours as far as results are concerned that make one wonder how a patient ever survives any relation with a doctor my visitor was charming intelligent kind all visibly a great master of the question but he prescribed me a remedy to begin its action directly he had left that simply and at a short notice sent me down into hell where i lay sizzling never such a sizzle before for three days and has since followed it up with another under the dire effect of which i languish even as i now write so much to express both what i owe you or have owed you at moments that at all lent themselvesin the way of pervading balm and to explain at the same time how scantly i am able for the hour to make my right acknowledgment  there are fifty things i should like to say to you about the book and i shall have said most of them in the long run but there are some that eagerly rise to my lips even now and for which i want the benefit of my first flush of appreciation the whole of the finest part is i think quite the finest thing you have done both more done than even the best of your other doing and more worth it through intrinsic value interest and beauty  december 9th i had to break off the other day my dear edith through simple extremity of woe and the woe has continued unbroken ever sincei have been in bed and in too great suffering too unrelieved and too continual for me to attempt any decent form of expression i have just got up for one of the first times even now and i sit in command of this poor little situation ostensibly instead of simply being bossed by it though i dont at all know what it will bring to attempt in this state to rise to any worthy reference to the reef seems to me a vain thing yet there remains with me so strongly the impression of its quality and of the unspeakably fouillée nature of the situation between the two principals more gone into and with more undeviating truth than anything you have done that i cant but babble of it a little to you even with these weak lips it all shows partly what strength of subject is and how it carries and inspires inasmuch as i think your subject in its essence is very fine and takes in no end of beautiful things to do each of these two figures is admirable for truth and justesse the woman an exquisite thing and with her characteristic finest scarce differentiated notes that is some of them sounded with a wonder of delicacy im not sure her oscillations are not beyond our notation yet they are so held in your hand so felt and known and shown and everything seems so to come of itself i suffer or worry a little from the fact that in the prologue as it were we are admitted so much into the consciousness of the man and that after the introduction of anna anna so perfectly named we see him almost only as she sees himwhich gives our attention a different sort of work to do yet this is really i think but a triumph of your method for he remains of an absolute consistent verity showing himself in that way better perhaps than in any other and without a false note imputable not a shadow of one to his manner of so projecting himself the beauty of it is that it is for all it is worth a drama and almost as it seems to me of the psychologic racinian unity intensity and gracility anna is really of racine and one presently begins to feel her throughout as an eriphyle or a bérénice which by the way helps to account a little for something qui me chiffonne throughout which is why the whole thing unrelated and unreferred save in the most superficial way to its milieu and background and to any determining or qualifying entourage takes place comme cela and in a specified localised way in francethese nonfrench people electing as it were to have their story out there this particularly makes all sorts of unanswered questions come up about owen and the notorious wickedness of paris isnt at all required to bring about the conditions of the prologue oh if you knew how plentifully we could supply them in london and i should suppose in new york or in boston but the point was as i see it that you couldnt really give us the sense of a boston eriphyle or boston givré and that an exquisite instinct back of your racinian inspiration and settling the whole thing for you whether consciously or not absolutely prescribed a vague and elegant french colonnade or gallery with a french river dimly gleaming through as the harmonious fond you required in the key of this with all your reality you have yet kept the whole thing and to deepen the harmony and accentuate the literary pitch have never surpassed yourself for certain exquisite moments certain images analogies metaphors certain silver correspondences in your façon de dire examples of which i could pluck out and numerically almost confound you with were i not stammering this in so handicapped a way there used to be little notes in you that were like fine benevolent fingermarks of the good george eliotthe echo of much reading of that excellent woman here and there that is sounding through but now you are like a lost and recovered ancient whom she might have got a reading of especially were he a greek and of whom in her texture some weaker reflection were to show for dearest edith you are stronger and firmer and finer than all of them put together you go further and you say mieux and your only drawback is not having the homeliness and the inevitability and the happy limitation and the affluent poverty of a country of your own comme moi par exemple it makes you this does as you exquisitely say of somebody or something at some moment elegiac what penetration what delicacy in your use there of the termmakes you so that is for the raciniansérieuxbut leaves you more in the desert for everything else that surrounds apex city but you will say that youre content with your lot that the desert surrounding apex city is quite enough of a dense crush for you and that with the colonnade and the gallery and the dim river you will always otherwise pull through to which i can only assentafter such an example of pulling through as the reef clearly you have only to pull and everything will come  these are tepid and vain remarks for truly i am helpless i have had all these last days a perfect hell of an exasperation of my dire complaint the 11th week of which begins today and have arrived at the point reallythe weariness of pain so greatof not knowing à quel saint me vouer in this despair and because change at any hazard and any cost is strongly urged upon me by both my doctors and is a part of the regular process of dénouement of my accursed ill i am in all probability trying to scramble up to london by the end of this week even if i have to tumble howling out of bed and go forth in my bedclothes i shall go in this case to garlants hotel suffolk street where you have already seen me and not to my club which is impossible in illness nor to my little flat 21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk chelsea sw which will not yet or for another three or four weeks be ready for me the change to london may possibly do something toward breaking the spell please pray hard that it shall forgive too my muddled accents and believe me through the whole bad business not the less faithfully yours   henry james      to a f de navarro   dictated   lamb house rye  december 12th 1912    my dear delightful tony   your missive so vivid and genial reaches me alas at a time of long eclipse and depression during which my faculties have been blighted my body tortured and my resources generally exhausted i tell you these dismal things to explain in the first place why i am reduced to addressing you by this graceless machinery i havent written a letter with my own poor hand for long and helpless weeks and in the second place why i bring to bear on your gentle composition an intelligence still clouded and weakened but i have read it with sympathy and i think i may say most of all with envy so haunted with pangs while one tosses on the couch of painand mine has been from the nature of my situation a poor lone and unsurrounded palletall ones visionary and imaginative life which one imputes day by day to happy people who frisk among fine old gardens and oscillate between clubs of the arts and monuments of the past i am delighted that the country life people asked you for your paper which i find ever so lightly and brightly done with a touch as easy and practised as if you were the darling of the staff that is in fact exactly what i hope your paper may make youclearly you have the right sympathetic turn for those evocations and i shall be glad to think of you as evoking again and again i only wish you hadnt to deal this time with a house so amply modernised in fact so renewed altogether save for a false front or two or rather for a true one with false sides and backs as i gather abbotswood to be the irrepressible lutyens rages about us here known at a glance by that modern note of the archaic which has become the most banal form of our cleverness there is nothing left for me personally to like but the little mouldy nooks that country life is too proud to notice and everyone else including the photographers too rich to touch with their fingers of gold i have too the inimitable old garden on my nerves living here in a great garden county i have positively almost grown to hate flowersso that only just now my poor contaminated little gardener is turning the biggest border i have scarce bigger it is true than my large unshaven cheek into a question a begged question of turf so that we shall presently have chucked flora altogether forgive however these morbid maussade remarks the blue devils of a long illness still interposing in their insistent attitude between my vision and your beautyin which i include marys largely and that of all the fine complexion of broadway i return your lucid sheets with this but make out that as you are to be in town only till thursday pm unless i am mistaken they will reach you the sooner by my sending them straight home my wish for their best luck go with them i ought to mention that under extreme push of my doctors for i luxuriate in two i am seeking that final desperate remedy of a change which imposes itself at last in a long illness to break into the vicious circle and dissipate the blight by going up to townalmost straight out of bed and dangling my bedclothes about me this will i trust smash the black spell i have taken a small flat there  on what appears to be a lease that will long survive me and there i earnestly beg you to seek me as soon as may be after the new year i am having first to crouch at an obscure hotel i embrace you both and am in much dilapidation but all fidelity yours always   henry james      to henry james junior    21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw  january 19th 1913    dearest harry   i wrote very copiously and i hope not worryingly at all for i only meant to be reassuring to your mother yesterday from whom i had had two beautiful unacknowledged letters within the last days or so unacknowledged save for a cable of a cheerful stamp which i sent off to irving street about a week ago and which will have been sent on to you but all the while your most blest letter written during your christmas moment at cambridge has been for me a thing to be so grateful for that i must express to you something of it todayeven at the risk of a glut of information my long silencesince i came up to town including i mean my pretty dismal weeks at that garlants of ill associationhas had a great inevitability from several causes but into these i shall have gone to your mother whom i think i explicitly asked to send you on my letter and i dont want to waste force in repetitions it wont be repeating too much to say again what i said to her even with extreme emphasis that i feel singularly justified of this basis for my winter times in london so much does it appear now that the preliminary and just postliminary strain of it is over the very best thing i could have done for myself my southward position as to the rooms i most use immediately over the river is verily an asset and not even in the gardenroom at lh of summer mornings have i been better placed for work with which all the detail here is right and pleasant and workable my servants extremely rejoice in itbut i am too much repeating above all my forenoons being by the mercy of the powers whoever or whatever they are my best time i have got back to work and with my uncanny interest in it and zeal for it still unimpaired feel that it must mean something that i am thus reserved after many troubles for a productive relation with it the proofsheets of a small boy and others have been coming in upon me rapidlyall but the very last and it ought by the end of next month at furthest to burst upon the world of course i shall have advance copies sent promptly to you and to irving street but with this i intensely want you to take into account that the book was written through all these months of hampering and baffling illness it went so haltingly and worriedly even last winter as distinguished from anything i was able to do in the summer and could get at all during the last afflicted three or four months last winter having really been a much more difficult time than i could currently confess to or than dear bill and alice probably got any sense of the point is at any rate that the book is now under whatever disadvantages wholly done and that if it seems good in spite of these the proof of my powers when my powers have really worked off more of the heritage of woe of the last three years will be but the more substantial a very considerable lot of notes of a son etc is done and i am now practically back at it with this appearance of a free little field in spite of everything i welcome immensely what i didnt mention to your motherwaiting to do it thus the valuable and delightful little collection received from you of your grandfathers correspondence with emerson what beautiful and characteristic things in it and how i hope to be able to use the best of these on your grandfathers part at least as regards emersons side of the matter i doubt whether i can do enough in the way of extracts from him to make it even necessary for me to apply to edward for licence i think i can hope but at the most to summarise or give the sense of some of emersons passages the reason of this being my absolute presumable want of space the book will have to be a longer one than a small boy but even with this there must be limits involving suppressions and omissions my own text i cant help attaching enough sense and importance and value to not to want to keep that too utterly under and i am more and more moved to give all of your grandfather on his vivid and original side that i possibly can add to this all the application of an illustrative kind that i cant but see myself making of your dads letters and i see little room for any one elses though what i most deplore my meagre provision of is those of your aunt alice written to our parents mainly during her times and especially her final time in europe the poverty of this resource cuts from under my feet almost all ground for doing much as i had rather hoped in a manner to do with her  jan 23rd 1913 i have been unable to go on with this these several days and yet also unwilling to let it go without saying a few more things i wantedso the long letter i have got off to your mother will precede it by longer than i meant i still write under my disabilities of damaged body with difficulty i mean perform the act of writing but this is diminishing substantially though slowlyand i mainly mention it to extenuate these clumsy characters  my conditions of situation etc here meanwhile this winteri mean these admirable and ample two rooms southward over the river so still and yet so animatedare ideal for work some other time i will explain it to youso far as you wont have noted it for yourselfhow and why it is that i come to be so little beforehand financially my fatally interrupted production of fiction began it six years or more agoand that began so utterly against my preconception of such an effect when i addressed myself to the so much longer and more arduous and more fataltoeverythingelse preparation of my edition than had been measurable in advance that long period cut dreadfully into current gainsthrough complete arrest of other current labour and when it was at last ended i had only time to do two small books the finer grain and the outcry before the disaster of my long illness of jan 1910 descended upon me and laid a paralysis on everything this hideous herpetic episode and its developments have been of the absolute continuity of that as they now make it i hope dire but departing climax and they have represented an interminable arrest of literary income to speak of now that i can look to apparently again getting back to decent continuity of work it becomes vital for me to aim at returning to the production of the novel my departure from which with its heartbreaking loss of time was a catastrophe a perversity and fatality so little dreamed of by me or intended i yearn for it intellectually and with all the force of my genius and imaginationartistically in shortand only when this relation is renewed shall i be again on a normal basis only how i want to complete notes of a son and brother with the last perfection first which is what i shall i trust during the next three or four months do with far greater rapidity than i have done the first bookfor all last winter and spring my forenoon my working hours were my worst and for long times so bad and my later ones the better whereas it is now the other way round  jan 28th i have had alas dearest harry to break this off and not take it up againthrough blighted bedridden late afternoons and whole eveningsmy only letterwriting time unless i steal precious dictationhours from miss bosanquet and the book my vitality my still sufficient cluster of vital assets to say nothing of my will to live and to write assert themselves in spite of everything this is 515 on a dismal wet afternoon i have been out but i came in again on purpose to get this off by tomorrows wednesdays post this apartment grows in gracenothing really could have been better for me i went into that long account just above of the reasons why through the frustration of fond fiction i have so much illness so aiding sunk to this momentary gêne i wanted to tell you as against the appearance of too squalid a helplessnessfor an early return to fond fiction will alter everything but what an endless sordid illegible appeal take it dearest harry in all indulgence from your lately so muchtried and perhaps a little nervously overanxious by the effect of so much suffering but all unconquered and devoted old uncle   henry james   ps a beautiful letter from your mother of jan 13th on receipt of my cable has just come in all tenderest love     to miss grace norton   dictated   21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw feb 6th 1913    dearest old friend   dont shudder i beg you at the sight of this grim legibilityeven when you compare it with your own exquisite mastery of legibility without grimness let me down easily in view of the long the oh so much too long ordeal that has pressed on me and that has so hampered and hindered and harrowed me that almost any sort of making shift to project my sentiments to a distance is a sort of victory won or patch of ground wrested from darkness and the devil i am slowly slowly getting better of an interminable complicated siege of pain and distress but it has left me with arrears of every sort piled up around me like the wild fragments of some convulsion of nature and i pick my way or grope it or even feebly and fatally fail of it as i best can there are things that help withal and one of these has been to receive your allbenignant little letter of two days ago i neednt reaffirm to you at this time of day that all your long patiences and fidelities all your generosities and gallantries of always rallying yet again are always more beautiful to me than i ever seem to have managed punctually enough to help you if need be to feelespecially as of any such urgent help there need be no question now you have had enough news of me from over your way i infer pretty dismal though it may have been for me not to want fatuously to dose you with it i mean given its bitter quality further or at first hand therefore let me rather convey to you at first hand that i am getting into distinctly less pitiful case i have been too complicated a sufferer for it to clear at every point at the same time but the general sense is ever so much betterand i am going to ask of your charity to let alice over the way see these yearning pages for her better reassuranceeven if i have after a fashion managed just of late to reassure her more directly i want her to have all the testimony i can treat her and by the same token my dear grace treat you to  your little letter breathes all your characteristic courage and philosophywhile i confess at the same time it fills outor rather perhaps more exactly further removes the veil frommy in its very nature vivid enough picture of your fairly august state of lone cambridge survivorship i admired you on that state at closer quarters winter before lasteven though my testimony to my so doing was at that time from poor physical interferences hampered and awkward but history is so interesting when one is able to follow with closeness a particular attaching strain of it that my imagination my intention my affection and fidelity hang and hover about your own particular noble exhibition of it as intelligently yes my dear grace as intelligently nothing less i insist as you could possibly desire or put up with your letter fills in again for me a passage or two of detailso that i feel myself the more possessed and qualified what i mean is above all that even this imperfect snatch of talk with you is dear and blest to me and that if by hook or by crook and through whatever densities of medium and distance i draw out a little the sense of relation with you it will have been better than utter frustration i look out here while i thus communicate from a bit of the oldtime stretch of riverside chelsea my first faraway glimpse or sense of which has like so many of my first london glimpses and senses my very first of all i mean a neverlost association with you and yours or at least with yours and thereby with you which means my having come here first of all one day of the early spring of 1869 with charles and susan they having in their kindness brought me to call with them on the great if great and strange and more or less sinister d g rossetti whom charles was in good relation with difficult as that appeared already then to have become for most people and my impression of whom on the occasion with everything else of it i have always closely retained part of it was just this impression of the really interesting and delightful old thamesside chelsea over the admirable waterview of which these windows now hangquite as if i had then secretly vowed to myself that some window of mine some day should the river is more pompously embanked making an admirable walk all the way to westminster of the most salutary value to me when i can at the soberest of paces attempt it but the sense of it all goes back as i say to my fond participation in that prehistoric queens gate terrace winter however i am drenching you with numbered pagesi ask no credit for the numberand i almost sit with you while you read them not exactly watching for a glow of rapture on your face but still on the whole seeing you take them without a frown for a good intention and a stopgap for something better you tell me almost nothing of yourself but all my sympathy and fidelity wait on you sympathy always can come in somewhere and i am yours my dear grace always all faithfully   henry james      to mrs henry white   dictated   21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw feb 23rd 1913    my dear old friend   let this mechanic form and vulgar legibility notify you a little at the start that i am in rather a hampered and hindered state and that that must plead both for my delay in acknowledging your dear faithful letter of the new year time and for my at last having to make the best of this too impersonal art i wont go into the history of my woesall the more that i really hope i have shuffled the worst of them off even in this most recent form they have been part and parcel of the grave illness that overtook me as long ago as at the new year 1910 and with a very imperfect recovery from which i was struggling during those weary american months of winterbeforelast when we planned so in vain that i should come to you in washington i have deeply regretted ever since my failure of that pleasureall the more that i dont see it now as conceivably again within my reach i am restored to this soil for whatever may remain to me of my mortal career the grand swing across the globe which you and harry will again nobly accomplishagain and yet againnow simply mocks at my weakness and my reduced resources besides i am but too thankful to have a refuge in which continuously to crouch please fix well in your mind that continuityas making it easy for you some day to find me here the continuity is broken simply by my reverting to the country for the summer and autumna mere change from the blue bed to the brown and then from the brown back again to this thamesside perch which i call the blue i hang here for six months straight over the river and find it delightful and interesting at once ever so quiet and ever so animated the river has a quantity of picturesque and dramatic life and motion that one had never appreciated till one had thrown oneself on it de confiance but its another london this old chelsea of simplifications and sacrifices from the world in which i so like to feel that i for so long lived more or less with you i feel somehow as much away from that now as you and harry must feel amid your new washington horizonsand it has of itself for that matter gone to pieces under the sweep of the big broom of time which has scattered it without ceremony a few vague and altered relics of it occasionally dangle for a moment before me i was going to say cross my pathbut i havent now such a thing as a path or it goes such a very few steps i try meanwhile to project myself in imagination into your washington existenceand besides your own allusions to it a passing visit a few days since from walter berry helped me a little to fix the shining vision w b had been i gathered but a day or two near you and wasnt in possession of many particulars beyond this too though you shine to me you shine a bit fearfullyfor i cant rid myself in a world of chelsea limits and fashions of a sense of the formidable the somehowat least for the likes of medifficult and bristling and glaring side of the american conditions however you of course lightly ride the whirlwindor at any rate have only as much or as little of the storms as you will and can pick out of it only such musical thunderrolls and most purely playful forked lightnings as suit you best what i mean is that here after a fashion a certain part of the work of discrimination and selection and primary clearing of the ground is already done for one in a manner that enables one to begin for ones self further on or higher up whereas over there i seemed to see myself speaking only from my own experience often beginning so low down just in that way of sifting and selecting that all ones time went to it and one was spent before arriving at any very charming altitude this you will find obscure but study it wellthough strictly in private so as not to give me away as a sniffy critic heaven knows i indulge in the most remorseless habits of criticism hereeven if i make no great public use of them through the increasing privacy and antiquity of my life i kind of wonder about the bearing of the queer democratic régime that seems as yet so obscurely to loom upon any latent possibilities that might have been on harrys and your careerjust as i wonder what unutterable queerness may not as a feature of the whole conundrum representatively speaking before long cause us all here to sit up and stare one or two such startling rumours about the matter i trust groundless having already had something of that effect but we must all wait mustnt we and i do indeed envy you both your so interesting opportunity for doing so in a front box at the comedy or tragedy the fine old american show that is whatever turn it takes it will all give you these next months so much to look at and talk about and expertly appreciate lord how i wish i were in a state or situation to be dining with you tonight i am dying really to see your housewhich means alas that i shall die without doing so no glimmer of a view of the new presidential family as a white house group has come my wayso that i sit in darkness there as all around and feel you can but say that it serves me right not to have managed my life betterespecially with your grand example amen amen  i rejoice to hear of your having had your grandchildren with you though you speak bewilderingly as if they had leaped across the globe in happy exemption from parentsor a parent however nothing does surprise me nowalmost any kind of globeleaping affects me in my trou as natural possible nay probable i pat harry ever so affectionately on the back i hold you both in the most affectionate remembrance and am yours all faithfully   henry james      to mrs william james   dictated   21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw march 5th 1913    dearest alice   an extreme blessing to me is your dear letter from montreal i had lately much longed to hear from youand when do i notand had sent you a message to that effect in writing to harry a week ago really to have some of your facts and your current picture straight from yourself is better than anything else  i write you this in conditions that give me for the hour this morninghour toward noon such a sense of the possible beneficence of climate relenting ethereal mildness so long and so far as one can at all come by it we have been having as i believe you have a blessedly mild winter and the climax at this moment is a kind of all uncannily premature mayday of softness and beauty i sit here with my big south window open to the river open wide and a sort of healing balm of sunshine flooding the place truly i feel i did well for myself in perchingeven thus modestly for a real homejust on this spot my beginnings of going out again have consisted up to today in four successive excursions in a bathchairevery command of which resource is installed but little more than round the corner from me and the bathchair habit or vice is i fear only too capable now of marking me for its own this of course not reallymy excellent legs are thank heaven still too cherished a dependence and resource and remedy to me in the long run or rather in the long or even the short crawl only if youve never tried it the bc has a sweet appeal of its own for contemplative ventilation and i builded better than i knew when i happened to settle here just where in all london the long long smooth and really charming and beguiling thamesside embankment offers it a quite ideal course for combined publicity in the sense of variety and tranquillity in the sense of jostling against nobody and nothing and not having to pick ones steps add to this that just at hand straight across the river by the ample and also very quiet albert bridge lies the large convenient and in its way also very beguiling battersea park which you may but too unspeakably remember our making something of the circuit of with william on that day of the so troubled fortnight in london after our return from nauheim when theodate pope called for us in her great car and we came first to just round the corner here where he and i sat waiting together outside while you and she went into carlyles house every moment of that day has again and again pressed back upon me hereand how rather suddenly we had in the park where we went afterwards to pull up that is to turn and get back to the sinister little symondss as soon as possible however i dont know why i should stir that dismal memory the way the general location seems propitious to me ought to succeed in soothing the nerves of association this last i keep sayingi mean in the sense that especially on such a morning as this i quite adore this form of residence this particular perch i mean in order to make fully sure of what i have of soothing and reassuring to tell you lamb house hangs before me from this simplified standpoint here as a rather complicated haze but i tend i truly feel to overdo that view of itand shant settle to any view at all for another year it is the mere worriment of draggedout unwellness that makes me see things in wrong dimensions they right themselves perfectly at better periods but i mustnt yet discourse too long i am still under restriction as to uttering too much vocal sound and i feel how guarding and nursing the vocal resource is beneficial and helpful i dont speak to you of harrythere would be too much to say and he must shine upon you even from ny with so big a light of his own i take him and i take you all to have been much moved by woodrow wilsons fine and clearly so sincere even if so partial and provisional address yesterday it isnt he but it is the so long and so deeply provincialised and diseducated and i fearin respect to individual activity and operative that is administrative valuevery belowthemark personalities of the democratic party that one is pretty dismally anxious about an administration that has to take on bryan looks from the overhere point of view like the queerest and crudest of all things but of course i may not know what im talking about save when i thus embrace you all almost principally pegand your motheragain and am your ever affectionate   henry james      to bruce porter        the beginning and end of this letter are accidentally missing     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw march 1913   a better one than for a long long while and it enables this poor scrawl thus to try to hang itself for the hour however awkwardly round your neck what was wonderful and beautiful in your letter of last november 9th now so handsomely and liveably before mei adore your hand is that it was prompted to the last perfection by a sublime sense of what was just exactly my case at that hour so that when i think of this and of how i felt it when the letter came and of how exquisite and interesting that essential fact made it over and above its essential charm i dont know whether i am most amazed or ashamed at my not having as nearly as possible just then and there acclaimed the touching marvel but in truth this very fact of the justesse of your globespanning divination is the real answer to that you wrote because you so beautifully and suddenly saw from afar and so admirably wanted to lay your hand on me in consequence saw i mean that i was in some acute trouble and had the heavenly wish to signal to me your sympathetic sense of it so as i say your admirable page itself tells me and so at the hour i hailed the sweet phenomenon i had had a very bad summer but hoped and supposed i was more or less throwing it off but the points i make are 1st that your psychic sense of the situation had absolutely coincided in time and in california with what was going on at lamb house on the other side of the globe and 2nd after all that precisely the condition so revealed to you was what made it too difficult for me to vibrate back to you with any proportionate punctuality or grace only this you see is my longdelayed and comparatively dull vibration here i am at any rate dearest bruce taking you as straight again to my aged heart as these poor clumsy methods will allow thank god meanwhile i have no supernatural fears about you nor vain dreams that you are not in the living equilibrium now as ever that becomes you best and of which you have the brave secret i am incapable of doubting of thisthough after all i now feel how exceedingly i should like you to tell me so even if but on one side of a sheet like this so handsome i come back to that example that i have before me you can do so much with one side of a sheet but oh for a better approach to a real personal jaw it is indeed most strange this intimate relation of ours that has been doomed to consist of a grain of contact et encore to a ton of separation its to the honour of us anyhow that we can and do keep touching without the more platitudinous kind of demonstration of it stilldemonstrate as i say for three minutes feel a little to help you to it how tenderly i lay my hands on you this address will find me till the end of junebut lamb house of course always i have taken three or four or five years lease of a small flat on this pleasant old chelsea riverside to hibernate in for the future i return to the country for five or six months of summer and autumn but cant stand the utter solitude and confinement of it from december to the springs end ah had we only a climateyours or fanny stevensons if she is still the exploiter of climatesi believe i should be all right then tell me of herand tell me of your mother i am sending you by the scribners a volume of reminiscential twaddle     to lady ritchie        lady ritchie had at this time thoughts afterwards abandoned of      going to america she was the princess royal of course as the      daughter of thackeray     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw march 25th 1913    dearest old friend   i am deeply interested and touched by your letter from the islandso much so that i shall indeed rush to you this dayaftertomorrow thursday at 515 your idea is as regards your sainted self of the bravest and most ingenious but needing no end of things to be said about itand i think i shall be able to say them all the furore you would excite there the glory in which you would swim or sink would be of an ineffable resonance and effulgence but i fear it would simply be a fatal apotheosis a prostrating exaltation the devil of the thing for yourself would be that that terrific country is in every pulse of its being and on every inch of its surface a roaring repudiation and negation of anything like privacy and of the blinding and deafening publicity you might come near to perish but we will jaw about itthere is so much to sayand for hester it would be another matter she could ride the whirlwind and enjoy in a manner the storm besides she isnt the princess royalbut only a remove of the blood again however nous en causeronson thursday i shall so hug the chance i am impatient for it and am yours and the childs all so faithfully   henry james      to mrs william james        the offering to henry james from his friends in england on his      seventieth birthday april 15 1913 took the form of a letter a      piece of plate described in the following and a request that he      would sit for his portrait     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw april 1st 1913    dearest alice   today comes blessedly your letter of the 18th written after the receipt of my cable to you in answer to your preceding one of the 6th after you had heard from robert allerton of my illness you will have been reassured furtheri mean beyond my cableby a letter i lately despatched to bill and alice conjointly in which i told them of my good and continued improvement i am going on very well increasingly soin spite of my having to reckon with so much chronic pectoral pain now so seated and settled of the queer falsely anginal but none the less when it is bad distressing order moreover too it is astonishing with how much pain one can with long practice learn constantly and not too defeatedly to live therefore dearest alice dont think of this as too black a picture of my situation it is so much brighter a one than i have thought at certain bad moments and seasons of the past that i should probably ever be able to paint the mere power to work in such measure as i can is an infinite help to a better consciousnessand though so impaired compared to what it used to be it tends to grow distinctlywhich by itself proves that i have some firm ground under my feet and i repeat to satiety that my conditions here are admirably helpful and favouring  you can see cant you how strange and desperate it would be to chuck everything up lamb house servants miss bosanquet this newly acquired and prized resource to come over by a formidable and expensive journey to spend a summer in the at best to me torrid and the inmost inside of 95 apart utterly arid and vacuous cambridge dearest alice i could come back to america could be carried back on a stretcher to diebut never never to live to say how the question affects me is dreadfully difficult because of its appearing so to make light of you and the childrenbut when i think of how little boston and cambridge were of old ever my affair or anything but an accident for me of the parental life there to which i occasionally and painfully and losingly sacrificed i have a superstitious terror of seeing them at the end of time again stretch out strange inevitable tentacles to draw me back and destroy me and then i could never either make or afford the journey i have no margin at all for that degree of effort but you will have understood too wellwithout my saying morehow little i can dream of any déplacement nowespecially for the sake of a milieu in which you and peg and bill and alice and aleck would be burdened with the charge of making up all my life you see my capitalyielding all my income intellectual social associational on the old investment of so many yearsmy capital is here and to let it all slide would be simply to become bankrupt oh if you only on the other hand you and peg and aleck could walk beside my bathchair down this brave thamesside i would get back into it again it was some three weeks ago dismissed and half live there for the sake of your company i have a kind of sense that you would be able to live rather pleasantly near me hereif you could once get planted but of course i on my side understand all your present complications  april 16th its really too dismal dearest alice that breaking off the above at the hour i had to i have been unable to go on with it for so many days its now more than a fortnight old still though my check was owing to my having of a sudden just as i rested my pen to drop perversely into a less decent phase than i reported to you at the moment of writing and from which i have had with some difficulty to wriggle up again i am now none the less able to send you no too bad news i have wriggled up a good deal and still keep believing in my capacity to wriggle up in general suffice if for the moment that i just couldnt for the time drive the pen myselfwhen i am bad i feel too demoralised too debilitated for this and it doesnt at all do for me then to push against the grain dont feel all the same that if i resort this morning to the present help it is because i am not feeling differentlyfor i really am in an easier way again i mean of course specifically and anginally speaking and the circumstances of the hour a good deal explain my proceeding thus i had yesterday a birthday an extraordinary prodigious portentous quite public birthday of all things in the world and it has piled up acknowledgments and supposedly delightful complications and arrears at such a rate all round me that in short miss bosanquet being here i today at least throw myself upon her aid for getting on correspondentiallyinstead of attending to my proper work which has however kept going none so badly in spite of my last poor fortnight i will tell you in a moment of my signal honours but want to mention first that your good note written on receipt of a small boy has meanwhile come to me and by the perfect fulness of its appreciation gave me the greatest joy there are several things i want to say to you about the shape and substance of the bookand i will yet only now i want to get this off absolutely by todays american post and tell you about the honours a little before you wonder in comparative darkness over whatever there may have been in the american papers that you will perhaps have seen though in two or three of the new york ones more possibly than in the boston i send you by this post a copy of yesterdays times and one of the pall mall gazettethe two or three passages in which together i suppose to have been more probably than not reproduced in n y but i send you above all a copy of the really very beautiful letter  ushering in the quite wonderful array of signatures as i cant but feel of my testifying and presenting friends a list of which you perhaps cant quite measure the very charming and distinguished and brilliant character without knowing your london better what i wish i could send you is the huge harvest of exquisite of splendid sheaves of flowers that converted a goodly table in this room by the time yesterday was waning into such a blooming garden of complimentary colour as i never dreamed i should on my own modest premises almost bewilderedly stare at sniff at all but quite cry at i think i must and shall in fact compass sending you a photograph of the still more glittering tribute dropped upon mea really splendid golden bowl of the highest interest and most perfect taste which would in the extremity of its elegance be too proudly false a note amid my small belongings here if it didnt happen to fit or to sit rather with perfect grace and comfort on the middle of my chimneypiece where the rather good glass and some other happy accidents of tone most fortunately consort with it it is a very brave and artistic exact reproduction of a piece of old charles ii plate the bowl or cup having handles and a particularly charming lid or cover and standing on an ample round tray or salver the whole being wrought in solid silvergilt and covered over with quaint incised little figures of a in the taste of the time chinese intention in short its a very beautiful and honourable thing indeed against the giving to me of the portrait presumably by sargent if i do succeed in being able to sit for it i have absolutely and successfully protested the possession the attribution or ownership of it i have insisted shall be only their matter that of the subscribing friends i am sending harry a copy of the letter toobut do send him on this as well you see there must be good life in me still when i can gabble so hard the book appears to be really most handsomely received hereabouts it is being treated in fact with the very highest consideration i hope it is viewed a little in some such mannerly light roundabout yourselves but i really call for no notices whatever i dont in the least want em what i do want is to personally and firmly and intimately encircle peg and aleck and their mother and squeeze them as hard together as is compatible with squeezing them so tenderly with this tide of gabble you will surely feel that i shall soon be at you again and so i shall yours dearest alice and dearest all ever so and ever so   henry james      to percy lubbock        a copy of h js letter of thanks was sent to each of the      subscribers to the birthday present he eventually preferred that      their names should be given in a postscript to his letter which      follows in its final form    dictated   21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw april 21st 1913    my dear blest percy   i enclose you herewith a sort of provisional apology for a form of thanks read it and tell me on wednesday when i count on you at 145 whether you think it will doas being on the one hand not too pompous or important and on the other not too free and easy i have tried to steer a middle way between hysterical emotion and marble immortality to any emendation you suggest i will give the eagerest ear though i have really considered and pondered my expression not a little studying the pros and cons as to each tour however we will earnestly speak of it the question of exactly where and how my addresses had best figure when the thing is reduced to print you will perhaps have your idea about for it must seem to you as it certainly does to me that their names must in common decency be all drawn out again but you will pronounce when we meetheaven speed the hour  yours my dear percy more than ever constantly   henry james   ps it seems to me that the little arrangement that really almost imposes itself would be that the printed thing should begin with my date and address and my dear friends all and that the full list taking even three complete pages or whatever should then and there draw itself out after which as a fresh paragraph the body of my little text should begin anything else affects me as more awkward and i seem to see you in full agreement with me as to the absolute necessity that every signer without exception shall be addressed     to two hundred and seventy friends    21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw  april 21st 1913    dear friends all   let me acknowledge with boundless pleasure the singularly generous and beautiful letter signed by your great and dazzling array and reinforced by a correspondingly bright material gage which reached me on my recent birthday april 15th it has moved me as brave gifts and benedictions can only do when they come as signal surprises i seem to wake up to an air of breathing good will the full sweetness of which i had never yet tasted though i ask myself now as a second thought how the large kindness and hospitality in which i have so long and so consciously lived among you could fail to act itself out according to its genial nature and by some inspired application the perfect grace with which it has embraced the justpast occasion for its happy thought affects me i ask you to believe with an emotion too deep for stammering words i was drawn to london long years ago as by the sense felt from still earlier of all the interest and association i should find here and i now see how my faith was to sink deeper foundations than i could presume ever to measurehow my justification was both stoutly to grow and wisely to wait it is so wonderful indeed to me as i count up your numerous and various your dear and distinguished friendly names taking in all they recall and represent that i permit myself to feel at once highly successful and extremely proud i had never in the least understood that i was the one or signified that i was the other but you have made a great difference you tell me together making one rich tone of your many voices almost the whole story of my social experience which i have reached the right point for living over again with all manner of old times and places renewed old wonderments and pleasures reappeased and recapturedso that there is scarce one of your ranged company but makes good the particular connection quickens the excellent relation lights some happy train and flushes with some individual colour i pay you my very best respects while i receive from your two hundred and fifty pair of hands and more the admirable the inestimable bowl and while i engage to sit with every accommodation to the so markedly indicated one of you my illustrious friend sargent with every accommodation i say but with this one condition that you yourselves in your strength and goodness remain guardians of the result of his laboureven as i remain all faithfully and gratefully yours   henry james   ps and let me say over your names  there follows the list of the two hundred and seventy subscribers to the birthday gift     to mrs g w prothero        mr and mrs prothero already at rye had suggested that h j      should go to lamb house for whitsuntide    dictated   21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw  april 30th 1913    best of friends both   oh it is a dream of delight but i should have to climb a perpendicular mountain first your accents are all but irresistible and your company divinely desirable but if you knew how thoroughly and for such innumerable good reasons i am seated here till i am able to leave for a real and workable absence you would do my poor plea of impossibility justice i have just conversed with joan and kidd conversed so affably not to say lovingly in the luminous kitchen which somehow let in a derisive glare upon every cranny and crevice of the infatuated scheme with this fierce light there mingled the respectful jeers of the two ladies themselves which rose to a mocking though still deeply deferential climax for the picture of their polishing off or dragging violently out of bed the so dormant and tuckedin house in the ideal couple of hours before their attitude i lowered my lanceeasily understanding moreover that their round of london gaieties is still so fresh and spiced a cup to them that to feel it removed from their lips even for a moment is almost more than they can bear and then the coarse and brutal truth is further that i am oh so utterly well fixed here for the moment and so void of physical agility for any kind of somersault a little while back while the birthday raged i did just look about me for an offcorner but now there has been a drop and the best calm of whitsuntide descending on the scene here i feel it would be a kind of lapse of logic to hurry off to where the social wave hurrying ahead of me would be breaking on a holiday strand i am so abjectly so ignobly fond of not travelling to keep up not doing it is in itself for me the most thrilling of adventures and i am working so well unberufen with my admirable secretary i shouldnt really dare to ask her to join our little caravan raising it to the number of five for a fresh tuningup again and on the other hand i maynt now abandon what i am fatuously pleased to call my work for a single precious hour forgive my beastly rudeness i will write more in a day or two do loll in the garden yourselves to your very fill do cultivate georges geniality do steal any volume or set of volumes out of the house that you may like and do still think gently of your poor ponderous and thereby dont you see so permanent old friend   henry james      to william james junior   dictated   21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw  june 18th 1913    dearest bill   i suppose myself to be trying today to get off a brief response both to harry and to dear peg whom i owe much rather volumes of acknowledgment to but i put in first these few words to you and alicefor the quite wrong reason that the couple of notes just received from you are those that have last come this is because i feel as if i had worried you a good bit more than helped over the so interesting namequestion of the babe it wasnt so much an attempted solution at all that i the other week hastily rushed into but only a word or two that i felt i absolutely had to utter for my own relief by way of warning against our reembarking any of us on a fresh and possibly interminable career of the tiresome and graceless junior you see i myself suffered from that tag to help out my identity for forty years greatly disliking it all the while and with my dislike never in the least understood or my state pitied and i felt i couldnt be dumb if there was any danger of your boys being started unguardedly and de gaieté de coeur on a like long course so probably and desirably very very long in his case given your youth and prominence in short your immortal duration it seemed to me i ought to do something to conjure away the danger though i couldnt go into the matter of exactly what at all as if we were only and most delightfully talking it over at our leisure and face to faceface to face with the babe i mean as i wish to goodness we were the different modes of evasion or attenuation in that american world where designations are so bare and variations of the accruing or social kind so few are difficult to go into this distance and in short all that i meant at all by my attack was just a hint i feel so for poor dear harrys carrying of his tagand as if i myself were directly responsible for it however no more of that  to this machinery the complications arising from the socially so fierce london june inevitably and in fact mercifully drive me for i feel the assault the attack on ones time and ones strength even in my so simplified and disqualified state which it is my one great effort not to allow to be knocked about however i of course do succeed in simplifying and in guarding myself enormously one cant but succeed when the question is so vital as it has now become with me which is really but a preface to telling you how much the most interesting thing in the matter has been during the last three weeks my regular sittings for my portrait to sargent which have numbered now some seven or eight i forget which and with but a couple more to come so the thing is i make out very nearly finished and the head apparently as i much hope to have almost nothing more done to it it is i infer a very great success a number of the competent and intelligent have seen it and so pronounce it in the strongest terms in short it seems likely to be one of ss very fine things one is almost fullface with ones left arm over the corner of ones chairback and the hand brought round so that the thumb is caught in the armhole of ones waistcoat and said hand therefore with the fingers a bit folded entirely visible and treated of course im sitting a little askance in the chair the canvas comes down to just where my watchchain such as it is poor thing is hung across the waistcoat which latter in itself is found to be splendidly poor thing though it also be and most interestingly treated sargent can make such things so interestingsuch things as my coatlappet and shoulder and sleeve too but what is most interesting every one is agreed is the mouththan which even he has never painted a more living and as i am told expressive in fact i can quite see that myself and really i seem to feel the thing will be all that can at the best the best with such a subject have been expected of it i only wish you and alice had assisted at some of the sittingsas sargent likes animated sympathetic beautiful talkative friends to do in order to correct by their presence too lugubrious expressions i take for granted i shall before long have a photograph to send you and then you will be able partially to judge for yourselves  i grieve over your somewhat sorry account of your own winter record of work though i allow in it for your habitual extravagance of blackness evidently the real meaning of it is that you are getting so fort all the while that you kick every rung of your ladder away from under you by mere uncontrollable force as you mount and mount but the rungs i trust are all the while being carefully picked up far below and treasured this being alices to say nothing of anybody elses natural care and duty give all my love to her and to the beautiful nursing scrap i want to say thirty things more to her but my saying power is too finite a quantity i gather that this will find you happily and i trust very conveniently and workably settled at chocoruawhere may the summer be blest to you and the thermometer low and the motorruns many now i really have to get at harry but do send this in any case on to irving street for the sake of the report of the picture i want them to have the good news of it without delay   yours both all affectionately  henry james      to miss rhoda broughton   dictated   21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw june 25th 1913    my dear rhoda   i reply to your quite acclaimed letterif there can be an acclamation of oneby this mechanic aid for the simple reason that much handicapped as to the free brandish of arm and hand nowadays i find that the letters thus helped out do get written whereas those i am too shy or too fearsome or too ceremonious to think anything but my poor scratch of a pen good enough for simply dont come into existence at all it greatly touches me at any rate to get news of you by your own undiscouraged hand and it kind of cheers me up about you generally during your exile from this blest town which you see i continue to bless that you appear to be in some degree on the go and capable of the brave exploit of a country visit with a brother to offer you a gardenriot of roses however i dont wonder but the more rejoice that you were inspired and have been sustained  yes thank you dear f prothero was veracious about the portrait as she is about everything it is now finished parachevé i sat for the last time a couple of days ago and is nothing less evidently than a very fine thing indeed sargent at his very best and poor h j not at his worst in short a living breathing likeness and a masterpiece of painting i am really quite ashamed to admire it so much and so loudlyits so much as if i were calling attention to my own fine points i dont alas exhibit a point in it but am all large and luscious rotundityby which you may see how true a thing it is and i am sorry to have ceased to sit in spite of the repeated big holes it made in my precious mornings j s s being so genial and delightful a nature de grand maître to have to do with and his beautiful high cool studio opening upon a balcony that overhangs a charming chelsea green garden adding a charm to everything he liked always a friend or two to be in to break the spell of a settled gloom in my countenance by their prattle though you will doubtless think this effect but little achieved when i tell you that having myself found the thing as it grew more and more like sir joshuas dr johnson and said so a perceptive friend reinforced me a couple of sittings later by breaking out irrepressibly with the same judgment  i am sticking on in london you see and have got distinctly better with the lapse of the weeks in fact dear old town taken on the absolutely simplified and restricted terms in which i insist on taking it as compared with all the ancient storm and stress is distinctly good for me and the weather keeping coolabsit omeni am not in a hurry to flee i shall go to rye none the less within a fortnight i have just heard with distress that dear norris has come and gone without making me a sign i learn by telephone from his club that he left yesterday this has of course been consideration but damn such consideration my imagination soaring over the interval hangs fondly about the time next autumn when you will be dv restored to cadogan gardens i am impatient for my return hither before i have so much as really prepared to go may the months meanwhile lie light on you yours my dear rhoda all faithfully   henry james      to mrs alfred sutro        h j had been with mrs sutro to a performance of henry      bernsteins play le secret with mme simone in the principal      part    dictated   21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw june 25th 1913    dear mrs sutro   yes what a sad history of struggles against fate the recital of our whole failure to achieve yesterday in tite street does make it was a sorry business my not having been able to wire you on saturday but it wasnt till the sunday sitting that the change to the tuesday from the probable wednesday through the latters having become impossible unexpectedly to sargent was settled and yesterday was the last the real last timeit terminated even at 1230 any touch more would be simply detrimental and the hand to my sense is now all admirably there but you must see it some day when you are naturally in towni can easily arrange for that i shall be there i seem to make out for a considerable number of days yet mrs wharton comes over from paris on the 30th for a week however and i apprehend will catch me up in her relentless car pardon any apparent invidious comparison for most of the time she is here that at least is her present programme but souvent femme varie and that lady not least i am addressing you you see after this mechanic fashion without apology for the excellent reason that during these forenoon hours it is my so much the most expéditif way  almost more than missing the séance to which by the way hedworth williamson came in just at the last with mrs hunter do i miss talking with you of le secret last night and of the wondrous demoniac little simone though of the play and of bernsteins extraordinary theatric art themselves more than anything else i think our friend the critic said beautifully right things about them in yesterdays timesbut it would be so interesting to have the matter out in more of its aspects too what most remains with one in brief is that the play somehow represents a case merely as distinguished so to speak from a situation the case being always a thing rather void of connections with and into life at large and the situation dramatically speaking being largely of interest just by having those thereby it is that le secret leaves one nothing to apply by reflection and by way of illustration to ones sense of life in general but is just a barren little instance little limited monstrosity as curious and vivid as you like but with no moral or morality good old word at all involved in it or projected out of it as an interest hence the so unfertilised state in which the mutual relations are left thereby its only theatrically as distinguished from dramatically interesting i think even if it be after that fashion more so more just theatrically valuable than anything else of bernsteins for him it may count as almost superior and beautifully done all round yessave in the matter of the fat blonde whose after all pretty recent lapse one has to take so comfortably and sympathetically for granted however if she had been more sylphlike and more pleasing she wouldnt seem to have been paying for her past at the rate demanded and if she had been any way different in short would have appeared to know and to have previously known too much what she was about to be pathetic enough victim enough what a pull the french do get for their dramaform their straight swift course by being able to postulate such ladies for interest sympathy edification even with such a fine absence of what we call explaining but this is all now i must post it on the jump do try to put in a few hours in town at some time or other before i go and believe me yours all faithfully   henry james      to hugh walpole    lamb house rye aug 21 13   beautiful must be your cornish land and your cornish sea idyllic your cornish setting like this flattering this wonderful summer and ours here doubtless may claim but a modest place beside it all yet as you have with you your mother and sister which i am delighted to hear and whom i gratefully bless so i can match them with my nephew and niece the former with me alas indeed but for these 10 or 12 days who are an extreme benediction to me my niece a charming and interesting young person and most conversable stays i hope through the greater part of september and i even curse that necessary limitwhen she returns to america i like exceedingly to hear that your work has got so bravely on and envy you that sovereign consciousness when its finishedwell when its finished let some of those sweet young people the bons amis yours come to me for the small change of remark that i gathered from you the other day you were adorable about it they have more than once chinked in your ear as from my poor old pocket and they will see you will in what coin i shall have paid them i too am working with a certain shrunken regularitywhen not made to lapse and stumble by circumstances damnably physical beyond my control these circumstances tend to come on the whole thanks to a great power of patience in my ancient organism rather more within my management than for a good while back but to live with a bad and chronic anginal demon preying on ones vitals takes a great deal of doing however i didnt mean to write you of that side of the picture save that its a large part of that same and only glance that way to make sure of your tenderness even when i may seem to you backward and blank it isnt to exploit your compassionits only to be able to feel that i am not without your fond understanding so far as your blooming youth theres the crack in the fiddlecase can fondly understand my so otherwiseconditioned age my desire is to stay on here as late into the autumn as may consort with my conditioni dream of sticking on through november even if possible cheyne walk and the blackbarged yellow river will be the more agreeable to me when i get back to them i make out that you will then be in london againi mean by november though such a black gulf of time intervenes and then of course i may look to you to come down to me for a couple of days it will be the lowest kind of jinksso halting is my pace yet we shall somehow make it serve dont say to me by the way à propos of jinksthe high kind that you speak of having so wallowed in previous to leaving townthat i ever challenge you as to why you wallow or splash or plunge or dizzily and sublimely soar into the jinks element or whatever you may call it as if i ever remarked on anything but the absolute inevitability of it for you at your age and with your natural curiosities as it were and passions its good healthy exercise when it comes but in bouts and brief convulsions and its always a kind of thing that its good and considerably final to have done we must know as much as possible in our beautiful art yours and mine what we are talking aboutand the only way to know is to have lived and loved and cursed and floundered and enjoyed and suffered i think i dont regret a single excess of my responsive youthi only regret in my chilled age certain occasions and possibilities i didnt embrace bad doctrine to impart to a young idiot or duffer but in place for a young friend pressed to my heart with a fund of nobler passion the preserving the defying the dedicating and which always has the last word the young friend who can dip and shake off and go his straight way again when its time but well talk of all thisits absolutely late who is d h lawrence who you think would interest me send him and his book alongby which i simply mean inoculate me at your convenience dont address me the volume so far as i can be inoculated i always try to let anything of the kind take last year you remember a couple of improbabilities as to taking did worm a little into the fortress gilbert cannan was one i have been reading over tolstois interminable peace and war and am struck with the fact that i now protest as much as i admire he doesnt do to read over and that exactly is the answer to those who idiotically proclaim the impunity of such formless shape such flopping looseness and such a denial of composition selection and style he has a mighty fund of life but the waste and the ugliness and vice of waste the vice of a not finer doing are sickening for me he makes composition throne by contrast in effulgent lustre   ever your fondest of the fond h j      to mrs archibald grove    lamb house rye  august 22nd 1913    my dear kate grove   please dont measure by my nottobeavoided delay of three or fouror five days to acknowledge it the degree of pleasure and blest relief your most kind letter represents for me i have fallen these last years on evil days physically speaking and have to do things only when and as i rather difficultly can and not after a prompter fashion but you give me a blest occasion and i heartily thank you for it ever since that so pleasant meeting of ours in piccadilly toward the end of 1909nearly four long years agohave i been haunted with the dreadful sense of a debt to your benevolence that has remained woefully undischarged i came back to this place that same dayof our happy encounterto be taken on the morrow with the preliminaries of a wretched illness that dismally developed that lasted actively in short for two long years and that has left me for the rest of my ancient days much compromised and disqualified though i should be better of some of it all nowi mean bettererif i werent so much olderor olderer however the point is that just as i had begun on that now faroff occasion to take the measure of what was darkly before methat is had been clapped into bed by my doctor here and a nurse clapped down beside me the first of a perfect processioni heard from you in very kind terms asking me to come and see you and archibald in the countryprobably at the pollards inscribed upon your present letter well i couldnt so much as make you a signmy correspondence had so utterly gone to pieces on the spot little by little in the aftertime i picked up some of those piecesothers are forever scattered to the windsand this particular piece you see i am picking up now with a slight painful contortion only after this lapse of the years it is too strange and too gracelessor would be so if you hadnt just put into it a grace for which as i say i can scarce sufficiently thank you the worst of such disasters and derelictions is that they take such terrific retrospective explanations and that ones courage collapses at all there is to tell and so the wretched appearance continues however i repeat you have transformed it by your generous condonationyou have helped me to tell you a small scrap of my story it was on your part a most beautiful inspiration and i bless my ponderous volume for its communication to you of the impulse quite apart from this balm to my stricken conscience i do rejoice that the fatuous book has beguiled and interested you i had pleasure in writing it but i delight in the liberality of your appreciation but i wish you had told me too something more of yourself and of grove more i mean than that you are thus ideally amiablewhich i already knew your we has a comprehensive looseness and i should have welcomed more dots on the is almost your only detail is that you were here at some comparatively recent hour i infer and that you only gave my little house a beautiful dumb glare and went your way again why do you do such thingsthey give you almost an air of exulting in them afterwards if i only had a magic car of my own i would jump into it tomorrow and come over to see you at crowboroughi was there in that fashion by an afternoon lift from a friend exactly a year ago my brother williams only daughter a delightful young woman and her eldest brother a most able and eminent young man are with me at this time though he too briefly and demand of me or receive from me all the attention my reduced energies are capable of in a social so to speak and adventurous way but if anything is possible later on i will do my best toward it i wish you were both conceivable at luncheon here do ask yourselves candidly if you arentand make me the affirmative sign i should so like to see you i recall myself affectionately to archibaldi think of the ancient wonders images scenesall fantasmagoric now yours and his all faithfully   henry james      to william roughead w s        mr roughead at this time a stranger had sent h j some      literature of a kind in which he always took a keen interestthe      literature of crime the following refers to the gift of a      publication of the juridical society of edinburgh dealing with      trials of witches in the time of james i other volumes of the same      nature followed and the correspondence led to a valued friendship      with the giver     lamb house rye  august 24th 1913    dear mr roughead   i succumbed to your witchery that is i read your brave pages the very day they swam into my kenwhat a pleasure by the way to hang over a periodical page so materially handsome as that of which the scots members of your great profession disposethose at least who are worthy but face to face with my correspondence and with my age a certain a very certain age and some of its drawbacks i am aware of the shrunken nature of my poor old shrunken energies of response in general once fairly considerable and hence in short this little delay of a horrible interest and a most ingenious vividness of presentation is all that hideous business in your handswith the unspeakable kings figure looming through the caldronsmoke he kicks up to more abominable effect than the worst witch images into which he so fondly seeks to convert other people he was truly a precious case and quite the sort of one that makes us most ask how the time and place concerned with him could at all stagger under him or successfully stomach him but the whole the collective state of mind and tissue of horrors somehow fall outside of our measure and sense and exceed our comprehension the amenability of the victims the wonder of what their types and characters would at all rhyme with among ourselves today takes more setting forth than it can easily geteven as you figure it or touch on it and there are too many things in the amenability as to which one vainly asks ones self what they can too miserably have meant that is the flaw in respect to interestthat the psychology of the matter fails for want of more intimate light in the given in any instance it doesnt seem enough to say that the wretched people were amenable just to torture or their torturers just to a hideous sincerity of fear for the selectability of the former must have rested on some aspects or qualities that elude us and the question of what could pass for the latter as valid appearances as verifications of the imputed thing is too abysmal and the psychology of the loathsome james oh the fortunes of nigel which andrew lang admired is of no use in mere glimpses of his cruelty which explains nothing or unless we get it all and really enter the horrid sphere however i dont want to do that in truth for the wretched aspects of the creature do a disservice somehow to the so interesting and on the whole so sympathetic appearance of his wondrous mother that she should have had but one issue of her body and that he should have had to be that particular mixture of all the contemptibilities bar none is too odious to swallow of course he had a horrid papabut he has always been retroactively compromising and my poor point is simply that he is the more so the more one looks at him as your rich page makes one do but i insist too much and all i really wanted to say is do very generously send me the sequel to your present studymy appetite has opened to it too but then go back to the dear old human and sociable murders and adulteries and forgeries in which we are so agreeably at home and dont tell me for charitys sake that your supply runs short i am greatly obliged to you for that good information as to the accessibility of those modern casesof which i am on the point of availing myself its a kind of relief to me to gather that the sinister arrani may take such visions too hard but it has been made sinister to mehasnt quite answered for you here we have been having a wondrous benignant augustmay you therefore have had some benignity and may you not feel the least bit pressingly the pull of this letter   yours most truly henry james   p s only send me the next juridicaland then a wee word     to mrs william james    lamb house rye  august 28th 1913    dearest alice   your irving st letter of the 16th has blessedly come and harry alas not so auspiciously leaves me tomorrow on his way to sail from southampton on saturday but though its very very late in the evening i wont tell you how late i want this hurried word to go along with him to express both my joy of hearing from you and my joy of him little as that is expressible for how can i tell you what it is for me in all this latter time that williams children and your children should be such an interest such a support and such a benediction peggy and harry between them will have crowned this summer with ease and comfort to me and i know how it will be something of the same to you that they have done so it makes me think all the while as it must forever you will feel i well know make you of what williams joy of him would have beensomething so bitter rises at every turn from everything that is good for us and that he is out of i have shared nothing happy with the children these weeks and there have been thank heaven many such things without finding that particular shadow always of a sudden leap out of its lair but why do i speak to you of this as if i needed to and it werent with you all the while far more than it can be even with me the only thing is that to feel it and say it unspeakable though ones tenderness be is a sort of dim propitiation of his ghost that hovers yearningly for usdoesnt itat once so partakingly near and yet so far off in darkness however i throw myself into the imagination that he may blessedly pity us far more than we can ever pity him and the great thing is that even our sense of him as sacrificed only keeps him the more intensely with us goodnight dearest alice   h j      to howard sturgis    lamb house rye  sept 2nd 1913    my dearest of all howards   i long so for news of you that nothing but this act of aggression will serve and that even though i know none better what a heavy not to say intolerable overburdening of illness is the request that those even too afflicted to feed themselves shall feed the post with vivid accounts of themselves but though i dont in the least imagine that you are not feeding yourself i hope very regularly and daintily this is all the same an irresistible surrender to sentiments of which you are the loved objectdownright crude affection fond interest uncontrollable yearning look you it isnt a request for anything even though i languish in the vagueits just a renewed declarationof dispositions long i trust familiar to you and which my uncertainty itself makes me want for my relief to reiterate a vagueish which looks like agueish but let the connection particularly forbid echo of you came to me shortly since from rhoda broughtonmore or less to the effect that she believed you to be still in scotland and still nurseridden which is my rude way of putting it and this she took for not altogether significant of your complete recovery of ease however she is on occasion a rich dark pessimistwhich is always the more picturesque complexion and she may that day but have added a more artful touch to her cheek i decline to believe that you are not rising by gentle stages to a fine equilibrium unless some monstrous evidence crowds upon me i have myself little by little left such a weight of misery behind mereally quite shaken off though ever so slowly the worst of it that slowness is to me no unfavouring argument at all nor is the fact of fluctuations a thing to dismay one goes unutterably roundabout but still one goesand so it is i have come to where i am i mean which is doubtless where i shall more or less stay i can do with it for want of anything granderand its comparative peace and ease it isnt what i wish youfor i wish and invoke upon you the superlative of these benedictions and indeed it would give me a good shove on to the positive myself to know that your comparative creeps quietly forward dont resent creepingtheres an inward joy in it at its best that leaping and bounding dont know and im sure you are having iteven if you still only creepat its best i live snaillike here and its from my modest brown shell that i reach oh dearest howard ever so tenderly forth to you i am havingabsit omena very decent little summer my quite admirable niece peggy has been with me for some weeks she is to be so some three more and her presence is most soothing and supporting i cant stand stiff solitude in the large black doses i once could   but goodnight and take all my blessingall but a scrap for william yours dearest howard so very fondly   h j      to mrs g w prothero        the young man from texas was mr stark young who had appealed to      mrs prothero for guidance in the study of h js books h j was      amused by the request of which mrs prothero told him and      immediately wrote the following     rye sept 14th 1913   this please for the delightful young man from texas who shews such excellent dispositions i only want to meet him half way and i hope very much he wont think i dont when i tell him that the following indications as to five of my productions splendid numberi glory in the tribute of his appetite are all on the basis of the scribners or macmillans collective and revised and prefaced edition of my things and that if he is not minded somehow to obtain access to that form of them ignoring any others he forfeits half or much more than half my confidence so i thus amicably beseech him i suggest to give him as alternatives these two slightly different lists   1 roderick hudson 2 the portrait of a lady 3 the princess casamassima 4 the wings of the dove 5 the golden bowl    1 the american 2 the tragic muse 3 the wings of the dove 4 the ambassadors 5 the golden bowl   the second list is as it were the more advanced and when it comes to the shorter tales the question is more difficult for characteristic selection and demands separate treatment come to me about that dear young man from texas later onyou shall have your little tarts when you have eaten your beef and potatoes meanwhile receive this from your admirable friend mrs prothero   henry james      to h g wells        the following refers to mr wellss novel the passionate      friends     lamb house rye  september 21st 1913    my dear wells   i wont take time to tell you how touched i freshly am by the constancy with which you send me these wonderful books of yoursi am too impatient to let you know how wonderful i find the last i bare my head before the immense ability of itbefore the high intensity with which your talent keeps itself interesting and which has made me absorb the so fullbodied thing in deep and prolonged gustatory draughts i am of my nature and by the effect of my own preoccupations a critical a nonnaïf a questioning worrying readerand more than ever so at this end of time when i jib altogether and utterly at the fiction of the day and find no company but yours and that in a degree of one or two others possible to read a novel at all i perform afresh to my sense the act of writing it that is of rehandling the subject according to my own lights and overscoring the authors form and pressure with my own vision and understanding of the waythis of course i mean when i see a subject in what he has done and feel its appeal to me as one which i fear i very often dont this produces reflections and reservesits the very measure of my attention and my interest but theres nobody who makes these particular reactions less matter for me than you do as they occurwho makes the whole applecart so run away that i dont care if i dont upset it and only want to stand out of its path and see it go this is because you have so positive a process and method of your own rare and almost sole performer to this tune roundabout usin fact absolutely sole by the force of your exhibition that theres an anxious joy in seeing what it does for you and with you i find you perverse and i find you on a whole side unconscious as i can only call it but my point is that with this heartbreaking leak even sometimes so nearly playing the devil with the boat your talent remains so savoury and what you do so substantial i adore a rounded objectivity a completely and patiently achieved one and what i mean by your perversity and your leak is that your attachment to the autobiographic form for the kind of thing undertaken the whole expression of actuality up to date affects me as sacrificing what i hold most dear a precious effect of perspective indispensable by my fond measure to beauty and authenticity where there neednt so much be question of that as in your heros rich and roaring impressionism his expression of his own experience intensity and avidity as a whole you are magnificent there your ability prodigiously triumphs and i grovel before you this is the way to take your book i thinkwith strattons own picture i mean of himself and his immediate world felt and seen with such exasperated and oh such simplified impatiences as its subject exclusively so taken its admirably sustained and the life and force and wit and humour the imagination and arrogance and genius with which you keep it up are tremendous and all your own i think this projection of strattons rage of reflections and observations and worldvisions is in its vividness and humour and general bigness of attack a most masterly thing to have done his south africa etc i think really sublime and i can do beautifully with him and his ideas altogetherhe is and they are an immense success where i find myself doubting is where i gather that you yourself see your subject more particularlyand where i rather feel it escape me that is to put it simplyfor i didnt mean to draw this out so much and its 2 oclock amthe heros prodigiously clever foreshortened impressionising report of the heroine and the relation which last is i take it for you the subject doesnt affect me as the real vessel of truth about them in short with all the beauty you have put into itand much of it especially at the last is admirably beautifuli dont care a fig for the heros report as an account of the matter you didnt mean a sentimental love story i take ityou meant ever so much moreand your way strikes me as not the way to give the truth about the woman of our hour i dont think you get her or at any rate give her and all through one hears your remarkableyour wonderfulreporting manner and voice up to last week up to last night and not by my persuasion hers in those letters she writes at the last its for me all stratton all masculinity and intellectual superiority of the most real all a more dazzling journalistic talent than i observe any woman anywhere with all respect to the cleverness they exhibit putting on record it isnt in these terms of immediatethat is of her pretended own immediate irony and own comprehensive consciousness that i see the woman made real at all and by so much it is that i should be moved to take as i say such liberties of reconstruction but i dont in the least want to take them as i still more emphatically sayfor what you have done has held me deliciously intent and made me feel anew with thanks to the great author of all things what an invaluable form and inestimable art it is go on go on and do it as you like so long as you keep doing it your faculty is of the highest price your temper and your hand form one of the choicest treasures of the time my effusive remarks are but the sign of my helpless subjection and impotent envy and i am yours my dear wells all gratefully and faithfully   henry james      to logan pearsall smith        mr pearsall smith had sent h j the poems of digby mackworth      dolben the young writer whose rare promise was cut short by his      accidental death in 1867 his poems were edited in 1918 with a      biographical introduction by mr robert bridges a friend and      contemporary of dolben at eton     lamb house rye october 27th 1913    my dear logan   i thank you very kindly for the other bounties which have followed the bounty of your visitbeginning with your vivid and charming letter a chronicle of such happy homeward adventure i greatly enjoyed our so long delayed opportunity for free discourse and hold that any less freedom would have done it no due honour at all i like to think on the contrary that we have planted the very standard of freedom very firmly in my little oak parlour and that it will hang with but comparative heaviness till you come back at some favouring hour and help me to give its folds again to the air the munificence of your two little books i greatly appreciate and have promptly appropriated the very interesting contents of bridges volume the small accompanying guide gives me more or less the key to his proper possessive the disclosure and picture of the wondrous young dolben have made the liveliest impression on me and i find his personal report of him very beautifully and tenderly in fact just perfectly done immensely must one envy him the possession of such a memoryrecovered and restated sharply rescued from the tooth of time after so many piledup years extraordinarily interesting i think the young genius himself by virtue of his rare special gift and even though the particular preoccupations out of which it flowers their whole note and aspect have in them for me something positively antipathetic uncannily i mean does the so precocious and direct avidity for all the paraphernalia of a complicated ecclesiasticism affect meas if he couldnt possibly have come to it or as we say gone for it by experience at that ageso that there is in it a kind of implication of the insincere and the merely imitational the cheaply romantic however he was clearly born with that spoon in his mouth even if he might have spewed it out afterwardsas one wonders immensely whether he wouldnt in fact thats the interest of himthat its the privilege of such a rare young case to make one infinitely wonder how it might or mightnt have been for himand bridges seems to me right in claiming that no equally young case has ever given us ground for so much wonder in the personal and aesthetic connection would his ritualism have yielded to more life and longer days and his quite prodigious but so closely associated gift have yielded with that as though indissolubly mixed with it or would a big development of inspiration and form have come impossible to say of courseand evidently he could have been but most fine and distinguished whatever should have happened moreover it is just as we have him and as bridges has so scrupulously given him that he so touches and charms the imaginationand how instinctive poetic mastery was of the essence was the most rooted of all things in him a faculty or mechanism almost abnormal seems to me shown by the thinness of his letters compared with the thickness and maturity of his verse but how can one talk and how can he be anything but wrapped for our delightful uncertainty in the silver mists of morningwhich one mustnt so much as want to breathe upon too hard much less clear away they are an immense felicity to him and leave him a most particular little figure in the great english roll i sometimes go to windsor and the very next one i shall peregrinate over to eton on the chance of a sight of his portrait   yours all faithfully  henry james      to c hagberg wright    lamb house rye oct 31st 1913    very dear hagbergdont be alarmedits only me   i have for a long time had it at heart to write to youas to which i hear you comment why the hell then didnt you well because my poor old initiative it isnt anything indecent though it looks so has become in these days through physical conditions extremely impaired and inaptand when once some weeks ago i had let a certain very right and proper moment pass the very burden i should have to lift in the effort to attenuate that delinquency seemed more formidable every time i looked at it this burden or rather to begin with this delinquency lay in the fact of my neither having signed the appeal about the russian prisoners which you had sent me for the purpose with so noble and touching a confidence nor had the decency to write you a word of attenuation or explanation i should i feel now have signed it for you and without question and simply because you asked itagainst my own private judgment in fact for thats exactly the sort of thing i should like to do for youpublicly and consciously make a fool of myself as even though i grovel before you generally speaking i feel that signing would have amounted to my doing i felt that at the timebut also wanted just to oblige youif oblige you it might then why the hell didnt you i hear you again ask well again very dear hagberg because i was troubled and unwellvery and uncertainvery and doomed for the time to drift to bend quite helplessly letting the occasion get so out of hand for me that i seemed unable to recover it or get back to it the more shame to me i allow since it wasnt a question then of my initiative but just of the responsive and the accommodating at any rate the question worried me and i weakly temporised meaning at the same time independently to write to youand then my disgrace had so accumulated that there was more to say about it than i could tackle which constituted the deterrent burden above alluded to you will do justice to the impeccable chain of my logic and when i get back to town as i now very soon shall by the 15thabouti hope you will perhaps do even me justicefar from impeccable though i personally am i mean when we can talk again at our ease in that dear old gorgeous gallerya pleasure that i shall at once seek to bring about one reason further of my graceless failure to try and tell you why why i was distraught about signing was that when i did write i wanted awfully to be able to propose to you all hopefully to come down to me here for a couple of days perhaps you admirably would have done so but was in fact so inapt in my then condition for any decent or graceful discharge of the office of hostthanks as i say to my beastly physical consciousnessthat it took all the heart out of me i am comparatively better nowbut straining toward carlyle mansions and pall mall it was above all when i read your so interesting notice of tolstoys letters in the times that i wanted to make you a signbut even that initiative failed please understand that nothing will induce me to allow you to make the least acknowledgment of this i shall be horrified mind you if you take for me a grain of your so drained and despoiled letterenergy keep whatever mercy i may look to you for till we meet i dont despair of melting you a little toward your faithfullest   henry james      to robert bridges        this continues the subject dealt with in the letter to mr logan      pearsall smith of oct 27 1913     lamb house rye nov 7 1913    my dear bridges   how delightful to hear from you in this generously appreciative wayit makes me very grateful to logan for having reported to you of my pleasure in your beautiful disclosure of young dolbenwhich seems to me such a happy chance for you to have had in so effective conditions after so many yearsi mean as by the production of cards from up your sleeve my impression of your volume was indeed a very lively oneit gave me a really acute emotion to thank you for which is a luxury of the spirit quite rare and refreshing at my time of day your picture of your extraordinary young friend suggests so much beauty such a fine young individual and yet both suggests it in such a judging and as one feels truthkeeping a way that the effect is quite different from that of the posthumous tribute to the earlygathered in generalit inspires a peculiar confidence and respect difficult to do i can well imagine the thing to have beenkeeping the course between the too great claim and the too timid and this but among other complicated matters i feel however that there is need in respect to the poor boys note of inspiration of no shade of timidity at allof so absolutely distinguished a reality is that note given the age at which it sounded such fineness of impulse and such fineness of artone doesnt really at all know where such another instance lurksin the like condition what an interesting and beautiful one to have had such a near view ofin the golden age and to have been able to recover and reconstruct with such tendernessof the measured and responsible sort how could you not have had the emotion which as you rightly say can be such an extraordinary on occasion such a miracleworking quickener of memoryand yet how could you not also i see feel shy of some of the divagations in that line to which your subject is somehow formed rather to lend itself your tone and tact seem to me perfectand the rare little image is embedded in them so safely and cleanly for durationwhich is a real service from you to literature and to our sum of intelligent life and you make one ask ones self just enough i think what he would have meant had he livedwithout making us do so too much i dont quite see myself what he would have meant and the result is an odd kind of concurrence in his charming flashing catastrophe which is different from what most such accidents in the case of the young of high promise make one feel however i do envy you the young experience of your own and the abiding sense of him in his actuality just as you had and have them and your having been able to intervene with such a light and final authority of taste and tenderness i say final because the little clear medallion will hang there exactly as you have framed it and your volume is the very condition of its hanging there should be absolutely no issue of the poems without your introduction this is odd or anomalous considering what the best of them are bless thembut it is exactly the best of them that most want it i hear the poor young spirit call on you out of the vague to stick to him but you always willi find myself so glad to be writing to you however that i only now become aware that the small hours of the am are getting larger    yours all faithfully  henry james      to andré raffalovich        this refers to the gift of the last letters of aubrey beardsley      edited by father gray 1904     lamb house rye november 7th 1913    dear andré raffalovich   i thank you again for your letter and i thank you very kindly indeed for the volume of beardsleys letters by which i have been greatly touched i knew him a little and he was himself to my vision touching and extremely individual but i hated his productions and thought them extraordinarily baseand couldnt find perhaps didnt try enough to find the formula that reconciled this baseness aesthetically with his being so perfect a case of the artistic spirit but now the personal spirit in him the beauty of nature is disclosed to me by your letter as wonderful and in the conditions and circumstances deeply pathetic and interesting the amenity the intelligence the patience and grace and play of mind and of temperhow charming and individual an exhibitionand very right have you been to publish the letters for which father grays claim is indeed supported the poor boy remains quite one of the few distinguished images on the roll of young english genius brutally clipped a victim of victims given the vivacity of his endowment i am glad i have three or four very definitethough one of them rather disconcertingrecollections of him  very curious and interesting your little history of your migration to edinburghon the social aspect and intimate identity of which you must i imagine have much gathered light to throw  and you are still young enough to find la province meets your case too it is because i am now so very far from that condition that london again to which i return on the 20th has become possible to me for longer periods i am so old that i have shamelessly to simplify and the simplified london that in the hustled and distracted years i vainly invoked has come round to me easily now and fortunately meets my case i shall be glad to see you there but i wontthank you nocome to meat with you at claridges one doesnt go to claridges if one simplifies i am obliged now absolutely never to dine or lunch out a bad physical ailment wholly imposes this but i hope you will come to luncheon with me since you have free rangeon very different vittles from the claridge however if you can stand that i count on your having still more then to tell me and am yours most truly   henry james      to henry james junior        in quoting some early letters of william jamess in notes of a son      and brother hj had not thought it necessary to reproduce them      with absolutely literal fidelity the following interesting account      of his procedure was written in answer to some queries from his      nephew on the subject     lamb house rye november 15th18th 1913    dearest harry   it is very difficult and even pretty painful to try to put forward after the fact the considerations and emotions that have been intense for one in the long ferment of an artistic process but i must nevertheless do something toward making you see a little perhaps how  the editing of those earliest things other than rigidly had for me a sort of exquisite inevitability from the moment of those of my weeks in cambridge of 1911 during which i began by a sudden turn of talk with your mother to dally with the idea of a family book this idea took on for me a particular light the light which hasnt varied through all sorts of discomfitures and difficultiesand disillusionments and in which in fact i have put the thing through that turn of talk was the germ it dropped the seed once when i had been reminiscing over some matters of your dads and my old life of the time previous far previous to her knowing us over some memories of our father and mother and the rest of us i had moved her to exclaim with the most generous appreciation and response oh henry why dont you write these thingswith such an effect that after a bit i found myself wondering vaguely whether i mightnt do something of the sort but it dated from those words of your mothers which gave me the impulse and determined the spirit of my visiona spirit and a vision as far removed as possible from my mere isolated documentation of your fathers record we talked again and still again of the family book and by the time i came away i felt i had somehow found my inspiration though the idea could only be most experimental and all at the mercy of my putting it perhaps defeatedly to the proof it was such a very special and delicate and discriminated thing to do and only governable by proprieties and considerations all of its own as i should evidently in the struggle with it more and more find this is what i did find above all in coming at last to work these cambridge letters into the whole harmony of my textthe general purpose of which was to be a reflection of all the amenity and felicity of our young life of that time at the highest pitch that was consistent with perfect truthto show us all at our best for characteristic expression and colour and variety and everything that would be charming and when i laid hands upon the letters to use as so many touches and tones in the picture i frankly confess i seemed to see them in a better or at all events in another light here and there than those rough and rather illiterate copies i had from you showed at their face value i found myself again in such close relation with your father such a revival of relation as i hadnt known since his death and which was a passion of tenderness for doing the best thing by him that the material allowed and which i seemed to feel him in the room and at my elbow asking me for as i worked and as he listened it was as if he had said to me on seeing me lay my hands on the weak little relics of our common youth oh but youre not going to give me away to hand me over in my raggedness and my poor accidents quite unhelped unfriendly youre going to do the very best for me you can arent you and since you appear to be making such claims for me youre going to let me seem to justify them as much as i possibly may and it was as if i kept spiritually replying to this that he might indeed trust me to handle him with the last tact and devotionthat is do with him everything i seemed to feel him like for being kept up to the amenity pitch these were small things the very smallest they appeared to me all along to be tiny amendments in order of words degrees of emphasis c to the end that he should be more easily and engagingly readable and thereby more tasted and likedfrom the moment there was no excess of these soins and no violence done to his real identity everything the letters meant affected me so in all the business as of our old world only mine and his alone together with every item of it intimately known and remembered by me that i daresay i did instinctively regard it at last as all my truth to do what i would with i have to the last point the instinct and the sense for fusions and interrelations for framing and encircling as i think i have already called it every part of my stuff in every otherand that makes a danger when the frame and circle play over too much upon the image never again shall i stray from my proper workthe one in which that danger is the reverse of one and becomes a rightness and a beauty  i may mention however that your exception that particularly caught my eyeto poor old abraham for poor old abewas a case for change that i remember feeling wholly irresistible never never under our fathers roof did we talk of abe either tout court or as abe lincolnit wasnt conceivable abraham lincoln he was for us when he wasnt either lincoln or mr lincoln the western note and the popularization of abe were quite away from us then and the form of the name in your dads letter made me reflect how off how far off in his queer other company than ours i must at the time have felt him to be you will say that this was just a reason for leaving it soand so in a sense it was but i could hear him say abraham and couldnt hear him say abe and the former came back to me as sincere also graver and tenderer and more like ourselves among whom i couldnt imagine any abe ejaculation under the shock of his death as possible however i am not pretending to pick up any particular challenge to my appearance of wantonnessi should be able to justify myself when able only out of such abysses of association and the stirring up of these for vindication is simply a strain that stirs up tears   yours dearest harry all affectionately  henry james      to edmund gosse        the portrait of h j together with the bust by mr derwent wood      had been on exhibition to the subscribers in mr sargents studio      in tite street the slight flaw in the title had been the      accidental omission of the subscribers names in the printed      announcement sent to them whereby the letter opened familiarly      with dearwithout further formality it was partly to repair the      oversight that h j had put himself on exhibition each day      beside the portrait     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw december 18th 1913    my dear gosse   the exquisite incident in tite street having happily closed i have breathing time to thank you for the goodly flaubert volume which safely arrived yesterday and which helps me happily out of my difficulty you shall receive it again as soon as i have made my respectful use of it  the exhibition of the portrait came to a most brilliant end today with a very great affluence of people there have been during the three days an immense number it has been a great and charming successi mean the view has been and the work itself acclaimed with an unanimity of admiration and literally of intelligence that i can intimately testify to for i really put myself on exhibition beside it each of the days morning and afternoon and the translation a perfect omar khayyam quoi visibly left the original nowhere i attendedmost assiduously and can really assure you that it has been a most beautiful and flawless episode the slight original flaw in the title i sought to bury under a mountain of flowers till i found that it didnt in the least do to explain it away as every one like the dear ranee said they exclaimed too ruefully ah dont tell me you didnt mean it after which i let it alone and speedily recognised that it was really the flowereven if but a little wayward wild flowerof our success i am pectorally much spent with affability and emissions of voice but as soon as the tract heals a little i shall come and ask to be heard in your circle be meanwhile at great peace and ease at perfect rest about everything   yours all faithfully  henry james      to bruce l richmond        the projected article on the new novel afterwards appeared in two      numbers of the times literary supplement and was reprinted in      notes on novelists    dictated   21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw december 19th 1913    dear bruce richmond   your good letter of a day or two ago is most interesting and suggestive and puts to me as lucidly as possible the questions with which the appearance of my so copious george sand is involved i have been turning the matter earnestly over and rather think i had best tell you now at once in what form it presses on myself this forces me to consider it in a particular light it has come up for me that i shall be well advised from my own obscure point of view to collect into a volume and publish at an early date a number of ungathered papers that have appeared here and there during the last fifteen years these being mainly concerned with the tribe of the novelists this involves my asking your leave to include in the book the article on balzac of a few months ago and my original idea was that if the gs should appear in the supplement at once you would probably authorize my reprinting it also after a decent little interval as the case stands and as i so well understand it on your showingthe case for the supplement i meani am afraid that i shall really need the gs paper for the volume before you will have had time to put it forth at your entire conveniencethe only thing i would have wished you to consider what should you say to my withdrawing the paper in question from your indulgent hands andas the possibility glimmers before memaking you a compensation in the way of something addressed with greater actuality and more of a certain current significance to the spring fiction number that you mention the words you know if you can forgive my irreverencei divine in fact that you share itsomehow suggest competition with a vast case of plateglass windowdressing at selfridges the gs isnt really a very fit or near thing for the purpose of such a number that lady is as a fictionist too superannuated and rococo at the present time to have much bearing on any of those questions pure and simple my article really deals with her on quite a different sideas you would see on coming to look into it should you kindly surrender it to me again i would restore to it four or five pages that i excised in sending it to youso monstrously had it rounded itselfand make it thereby a still properer thing for my book where it would add itself to two other earlier studies of the same subject as the balzac of the supplement will likewise do and if you ask me what you then gain by your charming generosity i just make bold to say that there looms to me though i have just called it glimmering the conception of a paper really related to our own present ground and airwhich shall gather in several of the better of the younger generation about us some half dozen of whom i think i can make out as treatable and try to do under their suggestion something that may be of real reference to our conditions and of some interest about them or help for them do you mind my going so far as to say even as a battered old practitioner that i have sometimes yearningly wished i might intervene a little on the subject of the supplements notices of novelsin which frankly i seem to have seen often so many occasions missed of course the trouble is that all the books in question or most of them at least are such wretchedly poor occasions in themselves if it hadnt been for this i think i should have two or three times quite said to you wont you let me have a try but when it came to considering i couldnt alas probably either have read the books or pretended to give time and thought to them it is in truth only because i half persuade myself that there are as i say some half a dozen selectable cases that the possibility hovers before me will you consider at your leisure the plea thus put i shouldnt want my paper back absolutely at once though in the event of your kindly gratifying me i should like it before very long  i am really working out a plan of approach to your domicile in the conditions most favourable to my seeing you as well as elena and it will in due course break upon you if it doesnt rather take the form of my trying to drag you both hither   believe me all faithfully yours  henry james      to hugh walpole    21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw jan 2 1914   i have just despatched your inclosure to p l at i dorotheergasse 6 vienna an address that i recommend your taking a note of and i have also made the reflection that the fury or whatever that edinburgh inspires you with ought you know to do the very opposite of drying up the founts of your genius in writing to mesince you say your letter would have been other as it truly might have been longer didnt you suffer so from all that surrounds you thats the very most juvenile logic possibleand the juvenility of it which yet in a manner touches me is why i call you retrogressiveby way of a long stroke of endearment there was exactly an admirable matter for you to write me abouta matter as to which you are strongly and abundantly feeling and in a relation which lives on communication as ours surely should and would save for starving such occasions fertilise however of course the terms are easy on which you extract communication from me and always have been and always will beso that theres doubtless a point of view from which your reservations another fine word are quite right im glad at any rate that youve been reading balzac whose romantic side is rot and a great contemporary of your own even in his unconsidered trifles ive just been reading compton mackenzies sinister street and finding in it an unexpected amount of talent and life really a very interesting and remarkable performance i think in spite of a considerable or large element of waste and irresponsibilityselection isnt in himand at one and the same time so extremely young he too and so confoundingly mature it has the feature of improving so as it goes on and disposes me much to read if i can its immediate predecessor you must tell me again what you know of him ive forgotten what you did tell me more or less but in your own good time i thinki mean i blindly feeli should be with you about auld reekiewhich somehow hasnt a right to be so handsome but i long for illustrationsat your own good time we have emerged from a very clear and quiet xmasquiet for me save for rather a large assault of correspondence it weighs on me still so this is what i calland you will toovery brief i wish you the very decentest new year that ever was yours dearest boy all affectionately   h j      to compton mackenzie         it will be recalled that edward compton mr mackenzies father      had played the part of christopher newman in hjs play the      american produced in 1891     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw jan 21 1914    my dear monty compton   for that was i think as i first heard you namedby a worthy old actress of your fathers company who when we were rehearsing the american in some touring town to which i had gone for the purpose showed me with touching elation a storybook she had provided for you on the occasion of your birthday that storybook weighted with my blessing on it evidently sealed your vocationfor the sharpness of my sense that you are really a prey to the vocation was what after reading you i was moved to emphasise to pinker i am glad he let you know of this and it gives me great pleasure that you have written to methe only abatement of which is learning from you that you are in such prolonged exile on grounds of health may that dizzying sun of capri cook every peccant humour out of you as to this untowardness i mean frankly to inquire of your motherwhom i am already in communication with on the subject of going to see her to talk about you for that my dear young man i feel as a need with the force that i find and so much admire in your talent your genesis becomes like the rest of it interesting and remarkable to me you are so rare a case of the kind of reaction from the theatreand from so much theatreand the reaction in itself is rareas seldom taking place and when it does it is mostly i think away from the arts altogetherit is violent and utter but your pushing straight through the door into literature and then closing it so tight behind you and putting the key in your pocket as it werethat strikes me as unusual and brilliant however it isnt to go into all that that i snatch these too few minutes but to thank you for having so much arrested my attention as by the effect of carnival and sinister street on what i confess i am for the most part as a consequence of some thankless experiments none too easily beguiled by a striking exhibition by a member of the generation to which you belong when i wrote to pinker i had only read ss but i have now taken down carnival in persistent short draughtswhich is how i took ss and is how i take anything i take at all and i have given myself still further up to the pleasure quite to the emotion of intercourse with a young talent that really moves one to hold it to an account yours strikes me as very living and real and sincere making me care for itto anxietycare above all for what shall become of it you ought you know to do only some very fine and ripe things really solid and serious and charming ones but your dangers are almost as many as your aspects and as i am a mere monster of appreciation when i readby which i mean of the critical passioni would fain lay an earnest and communicative hand on you and hypnotize or otherwise bedevil you into proceeding as i feel you most ought to you know the great point is that i would so fain personally see youthat we may talk and i do very much wish that you had given me a chance at one of those moments when you tell me you inclined to it and then held off you are so intelligent and its a blessingwhereby i prefigure it as a luxury to have a go at you i am to be in town till the end of junei hibernate no more at rye and if you were only to turn up a little before that it would be excellent otherwise you must indeed come to me there i wish you all profit of all your experience some of it lately i fear rather harsh and all experience of your geniuswhich i also wish myself i think of sinister street ii and am yours most truly   henry james      to william roughead ws        mr roughead had sent h j his edition of the trial of mary      blandy the notable murderess who was hung in 1752 for poisoning      her father     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw january 29th 1914    dear mr roughead   i devoured the tender blandy in a single feast i thank you most kindly for having anticipated so handsomely my appetite and i highly appreciate the terms in general and the concluding ones in particular in which you serve her up you tell the story with excellent art and animation and its quite a gem of a story in its way history herself having put it together as with the best compositional method a strong sense for sequences and the proper march order and time the only thing is that as always one wants to know more more than the mere evidence suppliesand wants it even when as in this case one feels that the people concerned were after all of so dire a simplicity so primitive a state of soul and sense that the exhibition they make tells or expresses about all there was of them dear mary must have consisted but of two or three pieces one of which was a strong and simple carnal affinity as it were with the stinking little cranstoun yet also one would like to get a glimpse of how an apparently normal young woman of her class at that period could have viewed such a creature in such a light the light would throw itself on the taste the sense of proportion of the time however dear mary was a clear barbarian simply enfinas one must always wind up these matters by exhaling i continue to have escaped a further sense of  and as i think i have told you i cultivate the exquisite art of ignorance yet not of blandy pritchard and cothere perversely i am all for knowledge do continue to feed in me that languishing need and believe me all faithfully yours   henry james      to mrs wharton        the two novels referred to in the following are m marcel prousts      du côté de chez swann and m abel bonnards la vie et lamour     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw february 25th 1914    dearest edith   the nearest i have come to receipt or possession of the interesting volumes you have so generously in mind is to have had bernsteins assurance when i met him here some time since that he would give himself the delight of sending me the proust production which he learned from me that i hadnt seen i tried to dissuade him from this excess but nothing would servehe was too yearningly bent upon it and we parted with his asseveration that i might absolutely count on this tribute both to poor prousts charms and to my own but depuis lors he has evidently been less en train than he was so good as to find me so that i shall indeed be very pleased to receive the swann and the vie et lamour from you at your entire convenience it is indeed beautiful of you to think of these little deeds of kindness little words of love or is it the other way round what i want above all to thank you for however is your so brave backing in the matter of my disgarnished gums that i am doing right is already unmistakeable it wont make me well nothing will do that nor do i complain of the muffled miracle but it will make me mind less being illin short it will make me better as i say it has already done so even with my sacrifice for the present imperfectfor i am keeping on no less than eight pure pearls in front seats till i can deal with them in some less exposed and exposing conditions meanwhile tons of implanted and domesticated gold c ones caps and crowns and bridges being most anathema to des voeux who regards them as so much installed metallic poison have with everything they fondly clung to been less visibly eradicated and it is enough as i say to have made a marked difference in my felt state that is the point for the timeand i spare you further details   yours de coeur  henry james      to dr j william white   dictated   21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw march 2nd 1914    my dear j william   i wont pretend it isnt an aid and comfort to me to be able to thank you for your so brilliant and interesting overflow from sumatra in this mean waysince from the point of view of such a life as you are leading nothing i could possibly do in my poor sphere and state would seem less mean than anything else and i therefore might as well get the good of being legible i am such a votary and victim of the single impression and the imperceptible adventure picked up by accident and cherished as it were in secret that your scale of operation and sensation would be for me the most choking the most fatal of programmes and i should simply go ashore at sumatra and refuse ever to fall into line again but that is simply my contemptible capacity which doesnt want a little of five million things but only requires much of three or four as to which then i confess my requirements are inordinate but i am so glad for the world and for themselves above all for you and letitia that many great persons and especially you two are constructed on nobler lines with stouter organs and longer breaths to say nothing of purses that i dont in the least mind your doing such things if you dont and most positively and richly enjoy sitting under the warm and fragrant spray of the enumeration of them keep it up therefore and dont let me hear of your daring to skip a single page or dodge a single prescription of the programme and the dose  i am signing with j s s three hundred very fine photographs of the portrait ever so much finer still that he did of me last summer and which i think you know aboutin order that they be sent to my friends of whom you are not the least so that you will find one in rittenhouse square on your return thither if with the extraordinarily dissipated life you lead you do really get back with it will wait on you probably this which i hope wont be sent either to meet or to follow you i really cant even to the extent of a letter personally participate in your dissipation while its at its worst how embarrassed poor letitia must truly be if she but dared to confess it at finding herself so associated for that is not her nature my life here had she but consented to share it would be so much more congruous with that i dont quite gather when you expect to reach these shoressince my brain reels at the thought of your reembarking for them after you reach your own at the climax of your orgy i realise all that these passions are capable of leading you on to and therefore shall not be surprised if you do pursue them without a breakshall in fact even be delighted to think i may see you gloriously approach by just sitting right here at this window which commands so the prospect but goodbye dear good friends gather your roses while ye may and dont neglect this blighted modest old bud your affectionate friend   henry james      to henry adams        the book sent to mr adams was notes of a son and brother now      just published     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw march 21 1914    my dear henry   i have your melancholy outpouring of the 7th and i know not how better to acknowledge it than by the full recognition of its unmitigated blackness of course we are lone survivors of course the past that was our lives is at the bottom of an abyssif the abyss has any bottom of course too theres no use talking unless one particularly wants to but the purpose almost of my printed divagations was to show you that one can strange to say still want toor at least can behave as if one did behold me therefore so behavingand apparently capable of continuing to do so i still find my consciousness interestingunder cultivation of the interest cultivate it with me dear henrythats what i hoped to make you doto cultivate yours for all that it has in common with mine why mine yields an interest i dont know that i can tell you but i dont challenge or quarrel with iti encourage it with a ghastly grin you see i still in presence of life or of what you deny to be such have reactionsas many as possibleand the book i sent you is a proof of them its i suppose because i am that queer monster the artist an obstinate finality an inexhaustible sensibility hence the reactionsappearances memories many things go on playing upon it with consequences that i note and enjoy grim word noting it all takes doingand i do i believe i shall do yet againit is still an act of life but you perform them still yourselfand i dont know what keeps me from calling your letter a charming one there we are and its a blessing that you understandi admit indeed aloneyour allfaithful   henry james      to mrs william james        minnie is of course mary temple the young cousin of old days      commemorated in the last chapter of notes of a son and brother     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw march 29th 1914    dearest alice   this is a saturday am but several days have come and gone since there came to me your dear and beautiful letter of march 14th considerably about my notes and though the american post closes early i must get off some word of recognition to you however brief i have scramblingly to make it i hoped of course you would find in the book something of what i difficultly tried to put thereand you have indeed you have found all and i rejoice because it was in talk with you in that terrible winter of 191011 that the impulse to the whole attempt came to me glad you will be to know that the thing appears to be quite extraordinarily appreciated absolutely acclaimed herescarcely any difficulties being felt as to parts that are best unless it be that the early passage and the final chapter about dear minnie seem the great the beautiful success of the whole what i have been able to do for her after all the long yearsjudged by this test of expressed admirationstrikes me as a wondrous stroke of fate and beneficence of time i seem really to have her letters and  s and your admirable committal of them to me aiding made her emerge and live on endowed her with a kind dim sweet immortality that places and keeps herand i couldnt be at all sure that i was doing it i was so anxious and worried as to my really getting the effect in the right waywith tact and taste and without overstrain  i am counting the weeks till peg swims into view againso delightful will it be to have her near and easily to commune with her and above all to get from her all that detail of the state of the case about you all that i so constantly yearn for and that only talk can give the one shade on the picture is my fear that she will find the poor old uncle much more handicapped about socially ministering to them two young women with large social appetites than she is perhaps prepared to find me and yet after all she probably does take in that i have had to cut my connections with society entirely complications and efforts with people floor me anginally on the spot and my state is that of living every hour and at every minute on my guard so i am anything but the centre of an attractive circlei am cut down to the barest inevitabilities and occupied really more than in any other way now in simply saving my life however the blest child was witness of my condition last summer my letters have probably sufficiently reflected it sinceand i am really on a better plane than when she was last with me to have her with me is a true support and joy and i somehow feel that with her admirable capacity to be interested in the near and the characteristic whatever these may be she will have lots of pleasant and informing experience and contact in spite of my inability to take her out or to entertain company for her at home she knows this and she comes in all her indulgence and charity and generosityfor the sake of the sweet good she can herself do me and i rejoice that she has margaret p with herwho will help and solidify and enrich the whole scene no 3 will be all satisfactorily ready for them and i have no real fear but that they will find it a true bower of ease the omens and auspices seem to me all of the best  the political atmosphere here is charged to explosion as it has never beenwhat is to happen no man knows but this only makes it a more thrilling and spectacular world the tension has never been so greatbut it will for the time at least ease down the dread of violence is shared all round i am finishing this rather tiredly by nighti couldnt get it off and have alas missed a post but all love   your affectionate  h j      to arthur christopher benson    21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw  april 21st 1914    my dear arthur   what a delightful thing this still more interesting extension of our fortunate talk i cant help being glad that you had second thoughts though your first affected me as good enough quite to need no better ones since the result has been your rich and genial letter the only thing is that if your first thoughts were to torment or whatever yourself these supersessive rather torment meby their suggestion that theres still more to say yetthan you do say as when you remark that you ought either to have told me nothing about  or to have told me all all is precisely what i should have liked to have from youall in fact about everythingand what a pity we cant appoint another teahour for my making up that loss you clearly live in these years so much more in the current of life than i do that no one of your impressions would have failed of a lively interest for meand the more we had been able to talk of  and his current and even of  and his the more i should have felt your basis of friendship in everything and the generosity of your relation to them i dont think we see anything about our friends unless we see allso far as in us lies and there is surely no care we can so take for them as to turn our mind upon them liberally dont turn yours too much upon yourself for having done so the virtue of that ruder jostle that you speak of so happily is exactly that it shakes out more aspects and involves more impressions and that in fine you young people are together in a way that makes vivid realities spring from iti having cognisance in my ancient isolation i well know but of the more or less edited revised not to say expurgated creature its inevitablethat isfor ancient isolation but youre in the thick of history and the air of it was all about you and the records of it in the precious casket that i saw you give in charge to the porter so with that oh man of action perpetually breaking out and bristling with performances and seeing and feeling things on the field i dont know what you mean by the image of the toys given you to play with in a cornercharming as the image is its the corner i contestyoure in the middle of the marketplace and i alter the figure to that of the brilliant juggler acquitting himself to the admiration of the widest circle amid a whirl of objects projected so fast that they can scarce be recognised but that

academy by a militant      suffragette who had apparently selected it for attack as being      the most notable and valuable canvas in the exhibition   dictated   21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw  may 6th 1914    dear and illustrious friend   i blush to acknowledge by this rude method the kindness that has expressed itself on your part in your admirable heroic hand but figure me as a poor thing additionally impaired by the tomahawk of the savage and then further see me as breasting a wondrous high tide of postal condolence in this doublydamaged state i am fairly driven to machinery for expeditions sake and let me say at once that i gather the sense of the experts to be that my wounds are really curablesuch rare secrets for restoration can now be brought to bear they are to be tried at any rate upon sargents admirable work and i am taking the view that they must be effective as for our discomfort from ces dames that is another affairand which leaves me much at a loss surely indeed the good ladies who claim as a virtue for their sex that they can look an artistic possession of that quality and rarity well in the face only to be moved bloodily to smash it make a strange appeal to the confidence of the country in the kind of character they shall bring to the transaction of our affairs valuable to us that species of intelligence precious to us that degree of sensibility but i have just made these reflections in very much these terms in a note to dear anne ritchie postal pressure induces conversational thrift however i do indeed hope to come to see you on thursday either a bit early or a bit late and shall then throw all thrift to the winds and be splendidly extravagant i dare say i shall make bold to bring with me my young niece my brother williams only daughter who is spending a couple of months near me here and possibly too a young relative of her own who is with her till very soon then at the worst   yours all faithfully henry james      to thomas sergeant perry  dictated   21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw  may 17th 1914    my dear thomas   as usual i groan gratefully under the multiplication of your bounties the last of these in particular heaping that measure up pardon the use of this form to tell you so there are times when i faint by the wayside and can then only scramble to my feet by the aid of the firm secretarial crutch i fall physically physiologically speaking into holes of no inconsiderable depth and though experience shows me that i can pretty well always count on scrambling out again my case while at the bottom is difficult and it is from such a depth as happens that i now address you not wanting to wait till i am above ground again for my arrears on those emergences are too discouraging to face lilla wrote me gentle words on the receipt of the photograph of sargents portrait and now you have poured upon the wounds it was so deplorably to receive the oil of your compassion and sympathy i gather up duly and gratefully those rich drops but even while i stow them away in my best reliquary am able to tell you that quite extraordinarily the consummate restorer has been able to make the injuries good desperate though they at first seemed and that i am assured this by sargent himself that one would never guess what the canvas has been through it goes back at once to the academy to hang upon its nail again and as soon as its in place i shall go and sneak a glance at it i have feared equally till now seeing it either wounded or doctoredthat is in course of treatment tell lilla please for her interest that the job will owe its success apparently very much to the newness of the paint the whole surface more plastic to the manipulators subtle craft than if it had hardened with time after the manner of the celebrated old things that are really superior i think by their age alone as i didnt paint the picture myself i feel just as free to admire it inordinately as any other admirer may be and those are the terms in which i express myself i wont say my dear thomas much more today dont worry about me on any of these counts i am on a distinctly better footing than this time a year ago and have worried through upwards of a twelvemonth without the convenience by which i mean the deathly complication of having to see a doctor if i can but go on with that separation there will be hope for me yet i take you to be now in villeggiatura and preparing for the irruption of your nurserywhich however with your vast safe countryside to spread it over wont probably press on you to smotheration i remember getting the sense that hancock would bear much peopling plant it here and there with my affectionate thought ground fine and scattered freely and believe me yours both all faithfully   henry

criticism of fiction     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw  june 2nd 1914    dearest edith   yes i have been even to my own sense too long and too hideously silentsmall wonder that i should have learned from dear mary cadwal therefore here since saturday night that i have seemed to you not less miserably so yet there has been all the while a certain sublime inevitability in itover and above those general reactions in favour of a simplifying and softening mutisme that increase with my increasing age and infirmity i am able to go on only always plus doucement and when you are off on different phases of your great worldswing the mere sidewind of it from afar across continents and seas stirs me to wonderments and admirations sympathies curiosities intensities of envy and eke thereby of humility which i have to check and guard against for their strain on my damaged organism the relation thus escapes meand i feel it must so escape you drunk with draughts of every description and immersed in visions which so utterly and inevitably turn their backor turn yourson what one might ones self have de mieux to vous offrir the idea of tugging at you to make you look round thereforelook round at these small sordidries and poornesses and thereby lose the very finest flash of the revelation then and there organised for you or the great thing by you perchance that affects me ever as really consonant with no minimum even of modesty or discretion on ones own accountso that in fine i have simply lain stretched a faithful old veteran slave upon the doormat of your palace of adventure sufficiently proud to give the alarm of any irruption should i catch it but otherwise waiting till you should emerge again stepping over my prostrate form to do so that gracious act now performed by yousince i gather you to be back in paris by this speakingi get up as you see to wish you the most affectionate and devoted welcome home and tell you that i believe myself to have kept in quite a sound and decent way in the domestic icechest of your absence i mix my metaphors a little comme toujours or rather comme jamais but the great thing is to feel you really within hail again and in this air of my own poor little world which isnt for me the nonconductor thats the real hitch when youre off of that of your great globelife i wont try to ask you of this last glory nowfor though the temperature of the icechest itself has naturally risen with your nearer approximation i still shall keep long enough i trust to sit at your knee in some peaceful nook here and gather in the wondrous tale i have had echoeseven in very faint and vague form that of the burglarious attempt upon you in the anonymous oriental city vagueness does possess mebut by the time my sound of indignant participation would have reached you i took up my lit supp to find you in such force over the subject you there treated on that so happy occasion that the beautiful firmness and clarity even if not charity of your nerves and tone clearly gave the lie to any fear i should entertain for the effect of your annoyance i greatly admired by the same token the fine strain of that critical voice from out the path of shade projected upon the desert sand as i suppose by the silhouette of your camel beautifully said thought felt inimitably jeté the paper has excited great attention and admiration hereand is probably doing an amount of missionary work in savage breasts that we shall yet have some comparatively rude or ingenuous betrayal of i do notice that the flow of the little impayables reviews

mansions cheyne walk sw  june 10th 1914    my dear roughead   let me take a flying leap across the formal barrier you are the most munificent of men as well as the most ingenious of writers and my modest library will have been extremely enriched by you in a department in which it has been weak out of all proportion to the yearning curiosity of its owner i greatly appreciate your gift to me of the so complete and pictorial blandy volumedreadfully informing as it is in the whole contemporary connectionthe documents are such good reporting that they make the manners and the tone the human and social note live after a fashion beside which our own general exhibition becomes more soothing to my soul your summary of the blandy trial strikes me afresh as an admirable piece of foreshortening of the larger quantitiesnow that these are presented but how very good the reporting of cases appears to have been capable of being all the same in those preshorthand days i find your braxfield a fine vivid thingand the pleasure of sense over the parklike page of the juridical is a satisfaction by itself but i confess your hero most interests by the fact that he so interested r l s incurable yearning scot that louis was i am rather easily sated in the direct way with the mainly broad and monotonously massive characters of that type uncouth of sound and with their tendency to be almost stupidly sane history never does themnever has i thinkinadequate justice you must help her to that blandness here and its all right and there they numerously and soundly and heavily were and are but they but renew ever when reproduced my personal appetiteby reactionfor the handlers of the fiddlestring and the fumblers for the essence such are my more natural sneaking affinities but keep on with them all pleaseand continue to beckon me along the gallery that i cant tread alone and where by your leave i link my arm confraternally in yours the gallery of sinister perspective just stretches in this manner straight away i am delighted the photograph is to receive such honourthe original i dont mean me but sargents improvement on me is really magnificent and i unimproved am yours all truly   henry james      to william roughead w s        miss madeleine hamilton smith to whom the following refers was      tried on a charge of poisoning in 1857     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw june 16th 1914    my dear roughead   your offering is a precious thing and i am touched by it but i am also alarmed for the effect on your fortunes your future on those and that who and which may as it were depend on you of these gorgeous generosities of munificence the admirable report is as i conceive a high rarity and treasure and i feel as if in accepting it i were snatching the bread perhaps from the lips of unknown generations well i gratefully bow my head but only on condition that it shall revert the important object and alienated heirloom to the estate of my benefactor on my demise a strange and fortunate thing has happenedyour packet and letter found me this am in the grip of an attack of gout the first for three or four years and apparently not destined to be very bad with an admirable remedy that i possess at once resorted to so i have been reclining at peace for most of the day with my foot up and my eyes attached to the prodigious madeleine i have read your volume straight through with the extremity of interest and wonder it represents indeed the type perfect case with nothing to be taken from it or added and with the beauty that she precisely didnt squalidly suffer but lived on to admire with the rest of us for so many years the rare work of art with which she had been the means of enriching humanity with what complacency must she not have regarded it through the long backward vista during the time now twenty years ago when i used to hear of her as married and considered after a long period in australia the near neighbour in onslow gardens of my old friends the lyon playfairs they didnt know or see her beyond the fact of her being there but they tantalized me because if it then made me very very old it now piles ossa upon pelion for me that i remember perfectly her trial during its actuality and how it used to come to us every day in the times at boulogne where i was then with my parents and how they followed and discussed it in suspense and how i can still see the queer look of the not proven seen for the first time on the printed page of the newspaper i stand again with it on the summer afternoona boy of 14in the open window over the rue neuve chaussée where i read it only i didnt know then of itsthe casesperfect beauty and distinction as you say a singularly fine thing is this report indeedand a very magnificent the defence she was truly a portentous young person with the conditions of the whole thing throwing it into such extraordinary relief and yet i wonder all the same at the verdict in the face of the so vividly attested and so fully and so horribly sufferings of her victim its astonishing that the evidence of what he went through that last night didnt do for her and what a pity she was almost of the prephotographic agei would give so much for a veracious portrait of her then face to all of which absolutely inevitable acknowledgment you are not to dream please of responding by a single word i shall take i foresee the liveliest interest in the literary forgerman how can we be sufficiently thankful for these charming breaks in the sinister perspective i rest my telescope on your shoulder and am yours all faithfully   henry james      to mrs alfred sutro        lhistoire is george sands histoire de ma vie sent by h j      to mrs sutro in preparation for her proposed visit to nohant     lamb house rye july 28th 1914    dear mrs sutro   i rejoice to hear by your liberal letter that the pile of books held together and have appeared on reaching you to make a decent show also im very glad that its come in your way to have a look at nohantthough i confess that i ask myself what effect the vulgarization of places scientifically speaking by free and easy and incessant motor approach may be having on their once comparatively sequestered genius well that is exactly what you will tell me after you have constaté the phenomenon in this almost best of all cases for observing it for nohant was so shy and remoteand nohant must be now handed over to the state and the public as their property so very much to the fore do read lhistoire at any rate firstthat is indispensable and the lecture of a facility yes i am liking it very much here in these beautiful midsummer coolnessesthough wishing we werent so losing our bloom of mystery by the multitudinous assault however i hug whatever provincial privacy we may still pretend to at this hour of public uproarso very horrible is the beargarden of the outer world to my sense under these threatened convulsions i cravenly avert my eyes and stop my earsscarcely turning round even for a look at the caillaux family what a family and what a trialand what a suggestion for us of complacent selfcomparisons i clutch at these hungrilyin the great deficiency of other sources of any sort of assurance for us may we muddle through even now though i almost wonder if we deserve to that doubt is why i bury my nose in my rosetrees and my inkpot what a judge of the play you will be becoming with the rate at which alfred and his typist keep you supplied be sure to see the little nohant domestic theatre by the wayand judge what a part it played in that discomfortable house i long for the autumn run when you will tell me all your impressions and am yours all faithfully   henry james      to sir claude phillips    lamb house rye july 31st 1914    my dear claude   i cant not thank you on the spot for your so interesting and moving letter which reflects to me relievingly in a manner all the horror and dismay in which i sit here alone i mean that it eases off the appalled sense a little to share that sickness with a fellowvictim and be able to say a little of what presses on one what one first feels ones self uttering no doubt is but the intense unthinkability of anything so blank and so infamous in an age that we have been living in and taking for our own as if it were of a high refinement of civilisationin spite of all conscious incongruities finding it after all carrying this abomination in its blood finding this to have been what it meant all the while is like suddenly having to recognise in ones family circle or group of best friends a band of murderers swindlers and villainsits just a similar shock it makes us wonder whom in the world we are now to live with thenand even if with everything publicly and internationally so given away we can live or want to live at all very hideous to me is the behaviour of that forsworn old pastor of his people the austrian emperor of whom so éprouvé and so venerable one had supposed better things than so interested and so cynical a chucking to the winds of all moral responsibility infamous seem to me in such a light all the active great ones of the earth active for evil in our time to speak only of that from the monstrous bismarck down but il sagit bien to protest in face of such a worldone can only possess ones soul in such dignity as may be precariously achievable almost the worst thing is that the dreadfulness all of it may become interestingto the blight and ruin of our poor dear old cherished source of interest and in spite of ones resentment at having to live in such a way with it all too is indeed the terrible sense that the people of this country may wellby some awful brutal justicebe going to get something bad for the exhibition that has gone on so long of their huge materialized stupidity and vulgarity i mean the enormous national sacrifice to insensate amusement without a redeeming idea or a generous passion that has kept making one ask ones self from so far back how such grossness and folly and blatancy could possibly not be in the long run to be paid for the rate at which we may witness the paying may be prodigiousand then no doubt one will pityingly and wretchedly feel that the intention after all was never so badonly the stupidity constitutional and fatal that is truly the dismal reflection and on which you touch that if anything very bad does happen to the country there isnt anything like the french intelligence to reactwith the flannelled fool at the wicket the muddied oaf and tutti quanti representing so much of our preferred intelligence however let me pull up with the thought that when i am reduced toor have come toquoting kipling for argument there may be something the matter with my conclusion one can but so distressfully wait and so wonderingly watch  i am sorry to hear that the great london revelry and devilry even if you have had more of the sidewind than of the current itself has left you so consciously spent and sore you can do with so much more of the current at any rate than i have ever been able to that it affects me as sad and wrong that that of itself shouldnt be something of a guarantee but if there must be more drawing together perhaps we shall blessedly find that we can all more help each other i quite see your point in taking either the grand or the petty tour just now not at all for granted and greatly hope that if you circulate in this country some fitful tide will bear you to this quarterthough i confess that when i think of the comparative public entertainment on which you would so have to throw yourself i blush to beckon you on i find myself quite offensively complacent in the conditions about the established simplicity of my own lifeive not done anything for so long and have been given over to such spareness and bareness that i look privation in the face as a very familiar friend   yours all faithfully and fearfully  henry james      viii  the war  19141916   the letters that follow tell the story of henry jamess life during the first year of the war in words that make all others superfluous the tide of emotion on which he was lifted up and carried forward was such as he only could describe and week by week in scores of letters to friends in england and france and america he uttered himself on behalf of those who felt as he did but who had no language worthy of the time to all who listened to him in those days it must have seemed that he gave us what we lackeda voice there was a trumpet note in it that was heard nowhere else and that alone rose to the height of the truth for a while it was as though the burden of age had slipped from him he lived in the lives of all who were acting and sufferingespecially of the young who acted and suffered most his spiritual vigour bore a strain that was the greater by the whole weight of his towering imagination but the time came at last when his bodily endurance failed he died resolutely confident of the victory that was still so far off  he was at rye when the war broke out but he very soon found the peace of the country intolerable he came to london to be within the current of events and remained there almost uninterruptedly till the end his days were filled with many interests chief of which was the opportunity of talk with wounded soldiersin hospital at the houses of friends in the streets as he walked wherever he met them the sight irresistibly drew forth his sympathy and understanding and admiration close at hand in chelsea there was a centre for the entertainment of refugees from belgium and for these he was active in charity another cause in which he was much engaged and to which he contributed help of more kinds than one was that of the american volunteer motorambulance corps in france organised by the son of his old friend charles eliot norton every contact with the meaning of war which no hour could fail to bring gave an almost overpowering surge of impressions some of which passed into a series of essays written for different charitable purposes and now collected in within the rim 1919 even beyond all this he was able to give a certain amount of energy to other literary work and indeed he found it essential to cling so far as might be to the steadying continuity of creation the ivory tower had to be laid asideit was impossible to believe any longer in a modern fiction supposed to represent the life of the day which the great catastrophe had so belied but he took up the sense of the past again the fantasmal story he had abandoned for its difficulty in 1900finding its unreality now remote enough to be beyond the reach of the war he also began a third volume of reminiscences the middle years work of one kind or another was pushed forward with increasing effort through the summer of 1915 the last of his writing being the introduction to the letters from america of rupert brooke he finished this and spent the eve of his last illness december 1st in turning over the pages of the sense of the past intending to go on with it the next morning  meanwhile as everyone knows his passionate loyalty to the cause of the allies had brought him to take a step which in all but forty years of life in england he had never before contemplated on july 26th 1915 he became naturalised as a british subject the letters now published give the fullest expression to his motives it has seemed right to let them do so mingled as his motives were with many strains some of them reactions of disappointment over the official attitude of his native country at that time if he had lived to see america join the allies he would have had the deepest joy of his life and perhaps it is worth mentioning that his relations with the american embassy in london had never been so close and friendly as they became during those last months  on the morning of december 2nd he had a stroke presently followed by another from which he rallied at first but which bore him down after not many days his sisterinlaw with her eldest son and daughter came at once from america to be with him and he was able to enjoy their company he was pleased too by a sign of welcome offered to him in his new citizenship among the new year honours there was announced the award to him of the order of merit and the insignia were brought to his bedside by lord bryce a friend of many years through the following weeks he gradually sank he died on february 28th 1916 within two months of his seventythird birthday his body was cremated and the funeral service held at chelsea old church on march 3rd a few yards from his own door on the quiet riverside     to howard sturgis    lamb house rye august 4th 1914    dearly beloved howard   i think one of the reasons is that i have so allowed silence and separation to accumulatethe effort of breaking through the mass becomes in that case so formidable the mass being thus the monstrous mountain that blocks up the fair scene and that one has to explain away i am engaged in that effort at the present moment howeveri am breaking through the mass boring through the mountain i feel as i put pen to paperand this too though i dont though i shant though i cant particularly explain and why should i treat you at this time of dayor to speak literally of nightas if you had begun suddenly not to be able to understand without a vulgar demonstration on the blackboard as i should never dream of resorting to that mode of public proof that i tenderly and unabatedly love you so why should i think it necessary to chalk it up there that there was all those strange weeks and months during which i made you no sign an absolute inevitability in the graceless appearance i call them strange because of the unnatural face that they wear to me nowbut they had at the time the deadliest familiar look the look of all the other parts of life that one was giving up and doing withouteven if it didnt resemble them in their comparative dismissability from them i learned perforce at last to avert my head whereas there wasnt a moment of the long stretch during which i never either wrote or wired you for generous leave to come down to tea or dinner or both there wasnt a moment when i hadnt from chelsea to windsor my eyes fondly fixed on you you seemed rather to go out of their reach when i was placed in some pretended assurance that you had left quacre for scotland but now that i hear by some equally vague voice of the air that you are still at homeand this appears more confirmed to mei have you intensely before me again yes and so vividly that i even make you out as sometimes looking at me i think in fact its a good deal the magnanimous sadness i so catch from you that makes me feel tonight how little longer i can bear my own black air of having fallen away while i yet really and intensely stick and therefore get on the way to you again so far as this will take me  it will soon be three weeks since i came back here from chelseawhich i was capable of leaving yes without having made you a sign it was a case dearest howard of the essential inevitabilitythe mark you yourself must in these days so recognise in all your omissions and frustrations all your lapses from the mortal act even you must have to know them so on your own partand you must feel them just to have to be as they are and as you are that was the way the like things had to be with meas i was and its to insult our long and perfect understanding not to feel that you have treasures of the truest interpretation of everything whatever in our common condition oh how i so want at last all the same to have a direct word or two from your blest self on your own share of that community i have questioned whomsoever i could in any faint degree suppose worth questioning on this score of the show you are makingbut of course i admit elicited no word of any real value five words of your own articulationby which i mean scratches of your own penwill go further with me than any amount of roundabout twaddle i hear of predatory loose women quartered upon you againand i groan in my faroff pain especially when i reflect that their fatuous account would be that you were in health and joy quite exactly by reason of them i think the great public blackness most of all makes me send out this signal to youas if i were lighting the twinkle of a taper to set over against you in my window  august 5th the taper went out last night and i am afraid i now kindle it again to a very feeble rayfor its vain to try to talk as if one werent living in a nightmare of the deepest dye how can what is going on not be to one as a huge horror of blackness of course that is what it is to you dearest howard even as it is to your infinitely sickened inditer of these lines the plunge of civilization into this abyss of blood and darkness by the wanton feat of those two infamous autocrats is a thing that so gives away the whole long age during which we have supposed the world to be with whatever abatement gradually bettering that to have to take it all now for what the treacherous years were all the while really making for and meaning is too tragic for any words but ones reflections dont really bear being utteredat least we each make them enough for our individual selves and i didnt mean to smother you under mine in addition to your own  but goodnight againmy lamp now is snuffed out have i mentioned to you that i am not here alonehaving with me my niece peggy and her younger brotherboth caught for the time in a manner though willing even glad as well as able to bear their poor old appalled uncle the kindest companyvery much the same sort as william bears you i embrace you and him too and am ever your faithfullest old   h j      to henry james junior   dictated   lamb house rye august 6th 1914    dearest harry   everything is of the last abnormalism now and no convulsion no historic event of any such immensity can ever have taken place in such a turnover of a few hours and with such a measureless rushthe whole thing being in other words such an unprecedented combination of size and suddenness there has never surely since the world began been any suddenness so big so instantly mobilised any more than there has been an equal enormity so sudden if after all that can be called sudden or more than comparatively so which it is now clearly visible had been brewing in the councils of the two awful kaisers from a good while back the entrance of this country into the fray has been supremely inevitablenever doubt for an instant of that up to a few short days ago she was still multiplying herself over europe in the magnificent energy and pertinacity of edward grey for peace and nothing but peace in any way in which he could by any effort or any service help to preserve it and has now only been beaten by what one can only call the huge immorality the deep conspiracy for violence for violence and wrong of the austrian and the german emperors till the solemnly guaranteed neutrality of belgium was three or four days ago deliberately violated by germany in defiance of every right in her ferocious push to get at france by that least fortified way we still hung in the balance here but with that no balance was any longer possible and the impulse to participate to the utmost in resistance and redress became as unanimous and as sweeping a thing in the house of commons and throughout the land as it is possible to conceive that is the one light as one may call it in so much sickening blacknessthat in an hour here all breaches instantly healed all divisions dropped the irish dissension on which germany had so clearly counted dried up in a nightso that there is at once the most striking and interesting spectacle of united purpose for myself i draw a long breath that we are not to have failed france or shirked any shadow of a single one of the implications of the entente for the reason that we go in only under the last compulsion and with cleaner hands than we have ever had i think in any such matter since such matters were you see how i talk of we and ourwhich is so absolutely instinctive and irresistible with me that i should feel quite abject if i didnt however i dont want for today to disquisitionise on this great public trouble but only to give you our personal news in the midst of itfor its astonishing in how few days we have jumped into the sense of being in the midst of it england and the continent are at the present hour full of hungup and stranded americansthose unable to get home and waiting for some reestablishment of violently interrupted traffic but goodbye dearest harry now its a great blessing to be able to write you under this aid to lucidityits in fact everything so i shall keep at it i hope the american receipt of news is getting organised on the strong and sound lines it should be send this of course please as soon as you can to your mother and believe me your devotedest old uncle   henry james      to mrs alfred sutro    lamb house rye august 8th 1914    dear mrs sutro   i have your good letter but how impossible it seems to speak of anything before one speaks of the tremendous public matterand then how impossible to speak of anything after but here goes for poor dear old george sand and her ancient prattle heaven forgive me to the extent that of course that autobiography it is a nice old set does in a manner notify one that its going to be frank and copious veracious and vivid only during all its earlier part and in respect to the nonintimate things of the later prime of its author and to stand off as soon as her personal plot began to thicken you see it was a book written in middle life not in old age and the thick things the thickest of her remarkable past were still then very close behind her but as an autobiography of the beginnings and earlier maturities of life its indeed finer and jollier than anything there is  yes how your loss for the present of nohant is swept away on the awful tide of the great interruption this last is as mild a name for the hideous matter as one can consent to giveand i confess i live under the blackness of it as under a funeral pall of our murdered civilization i say for the present about nohant and you being young and buoyant will doubtless pick up lost opportunities in some incalculable future but that time looks to me as the past already looksi mean the recent past of happy motorruns on may and june afternoons down to the st albans and the witleys disconnected and fabulous fatuous fantastic belonging to another life and another planet i find it such a mistake on my own part to have lived onwhen like other saner and safer persons i might perfectly have notinto this unspeakable giveaway of the whole fools paradise of our past it throws back so livid a lightthis was what we were so fondly working for my aged nerves can scarcely stand it and i bear up but as i can i dip my nose or try to into the inkpot as often as i can but its as if there were no ink there and i take it out smelling gunpowder smelling blood as hard as it did before and yet i keep at itor mean to for tell alfred for his own encouragementand pretty a one as i am to encourage that i hold we can still he and i make a little civilization the inkpot aiding even when vast chunks of it around us go down into the abyssand that the preservation of it depends upon our going on making it in spite of everything and sitting tight and not chucking upwherefore after all vive the old delusion and fill again the flowing stylographfor i am sure alfred writes with one the afternoons and the aspects here are most incongruously lovelyand so must be yours but its goodnight now and i am most truly yours dear mrs sutro   henry james      to miss rhoda broughton   lamb house rye august 10th 1914    dearest rhoda   it is not a figure of speech but an absolute truth that even if i had not received your very welcome and sympathetic script i should be writing to you this day i have been on the very edge of it for the last weekso had my desire to make you a sign of remembrance and participation come to a head and verily i mustor mayalmost claim that this all but crosses with your own the only blot on our unanimity is that its such an unanimity of woe black and hideous to me is the tragedy that gathers and im sick beyond cure to have lived on to see it you and i the ornaments of our generation should have been spared this wreck of our belief that through the long years we had seen civilization grow and the worst become impossible the tide that bore us along was then all the while moving to this as its grand niagarayet what a blessing we didnt know it it seems to me to undo everything everything that was ours in the most horrible retroactive waybut i avert my face from the monstrous sceneyou can hate it and blush for it without my help we can each do enough of that by ourselves the country and the season here are of a beauty of peace and loveliness of light and summer grace that make it inconceivable that just across the channel blue as paint today the fields of france and belgium are being or about to be given up to unthinkable massacre and misery one is ashamed to admire to enjoy to take any of the normal pleasure and the huge shining indifference of nature strikes a chill to the heart and makes me wonder of what abysmal mystery or villainy indeed such a cruel smile is the expression in the midst of it all at any rate we walked this strange sunday afternoon 9th my niece peggy her youngest brother and i about a mile out across the blessed grass mostly to see and have tea with a genial old irish friend lady mathew who has a house here for the summer and came away an hour later bearing with us a substantial green volume by an admirable eminent hand which our hostess had just read with such a glow of satisfaction that she overflowed into easy lending i congratulate you on having securely put it forth before this great distraction was upon usfor i am utterly pulled up in the midst of a rival effort by finding that my job wont at all consent to be done in the face of it the picture of little private adventures simply fades away before the great public i take great comfort in the presence of my two young companions and above all in having caught my nephew by the coattail only just as he was blandly starting for the continent on aug 1st poor margaret payson is trapped somewhere in franceshe having then started though not for germany blessedly and we remain wholly without news of her peggy and aleck have four or five near maternal relatives lost in germanythough as americans they may fare a little less dreadfully there than if they were english and i have numerous friendswe all have havent weinaccessible and unimaginable there its becoming an anguish to think of them nevertheless i do believe that we shall be again gathered into a blessed little chelsea drawingroomit will be like the reopening of the salons so irrepressibly after the french revolution so only sit tight and invoke your heroic soul dear rhoda and believe me more than ever allfaithfully yours   henry james      to mrs wharton    lamb house rye august 19th 1914    dearest edith   your letter of the 15th has comeand may this reach you as directly though it probably wont no i wont make it longthe less that the irrelevance of all remark the utter extinction of everything in the face of these immensities leaves me as all silent and all damned as you express that it leaves you i find it the strangest state to have lived on and on forand yet with its wholesale annihilation it is somehow life mary cadwal is admirably hereinteresting and vivid and helpful to the last degree and bessie lodge and her boy had the heavenly beauty this afternoon to come down from town by train sentend rien que for teashe even sneakingly went first to the inn for luncheonand was off again by 530 nobly kind and beautiful and good she sails in the olympic with her aunt on saturday mary c gives me a sense of the interest of your paris which makes me understand how it must attach youhow it would attach me in your place infinitely thrilling and touching such a community with the so allround incomparable nation i feel on my side an immense community here where the tension is proportionate to the degree to which we feel engagedin other words up to the chin up to the eyes if necessary life goes on after a fashion but i find it a nightmare from which there is no waking save by sleep i go to sleep as if i were dogtired with actionyet feel like the chilled vieillards in the old epics infirm and helpless at home with the women while the plains are ringing with battle the season here is monotonously magnificentand we look inconceivably off across the blue channel the lovely rim toward the nearness of the horrors that are in perpetration just beyond i manage myself to try to workeven if i had after experiment to give up trying to make certain little fantoches and their private adventure tenir debout they are laid by on the shelfthe private adventure so utterly blighted by the public but i have got hold of something else and i find the effort of concentration to some extent an antidote apropos of which i thank you immensely for dannunzios frenchified odea wondrous and magnificent thing in its kind even if running too muchfor my tasteto the vituperative and the execrational the latin renascence mustnt be too much for and by thatfor which its facile resources are so great whats magnificent to me in the french themselves at this moment is their lapse of expression may this not fail of you i am your allfaithfully tender and true old   h j      to mrs w k clifford    lamb house rye august 22nd 1914    dearest lucy   i have i know been quite portentously silentyour brief card of distress tonight saturday pm makes me feel itbut you on your side will also have felt the inevitability of this absence of mere vain and vague remark in the presence of such prodigious realities my overwhelmed sense of them has simply left me nothing to saythe rupture with all the blest old proportion of things has been so complete and utter and ive felt as if most of my friends from very few of whom i have heard at all were so wrapped in gravities and dignities of silence that it wasnt fair to write to them simply to make them write and so it has gonethe whole thing defying expression so that one has just stared at the horror and watched it grow but i am not writing now dearest old friend to express either alarm or despairand this mainly by reason of there being so high a decency in not doing so i hate not to possess my souland oh i should like while i am about that to possess yours for you too one doesnt possess ones soul unless one squares oneself a good deal in fact very hard indeed for the purpose but in proportion as one succeeds that means preparation and preparation means confidence and confidence means force and that is as far as we need go for the moment your few words express a bad apprehension which i dont shareand which even our straight outlook here over the blue channel of all these amazing days toward the unthinkable horrors of its almost other edge doesnt make me share i dont in the least believe that the germans will be herewith us generallybecause i dont believei dont admitthat anything so abject as the allowance of it by our overwhelming fleet in conditions making it so tremendously difficult for them the gs is in the least conceivable things are not going to be so easy for them as thathowever uneasy they may be for ourselves i insist on a great confidencei cultivate it as resolutely as i can and if we were only nearer together i think i should be able to help you to some of the benefit of it i have been very thankful to be on this spot all these daysi mean in this sympathetic little old house which has somehow assuaged in a manner the nightmare one invents arts for assuaging itof which some work better than others the great sore sense i find the futility of talkabout the cataclysm this is so impossible that i can really almost talk about other things i am supposing you see a goodish many peoplesince one hears that there are so many in town and i am glad for you of that solitude in these conditions being grim even if society is bleak i try to read and i rather succeed and also even to write and find the effort of it greatly pays lift up your heart dearest friendi believe we shall meet to embrace and look back and tell each other how appallingly interesting the whole thing was i gather in all of you right affectionately and am yours in particular dearest lucy so stoutly and tenderly   henry james      to william james junior   dictated   lamb house rye august 31st 1914    dearest bill   very blest to me this morning and very blest to peggy and aleck and me your momentous and delightful cable i dont know that we are either of us much versed in the weight of babies but we have strong and i find unanimous views about their sex which your little adventurer into this world of woe has been so good as gracefully to meet we are all three thoroughly glad of the nephew in him if only because of being glad of the little brother we are convinced that thats the way his parents feel and i hope the feeling is so happy a one for alice as to be doing her all sorts of good admirable the all well of your cable may it go straight on toward better and better  our joy in your good news is the only gleam of anything of the sort with which we have been for a long time visited as an admirable letter from you to aleck which he read me last night seemed to indicate more than anything we have yet had from home some definite impression of yes indeed we are steeped in the very air of anxieties and horrorsand they all seem where we are situated so little far away i have written two or three times to harry and also to your mother since leaving london and peggy and aleck in particular have had liberal responses from each but those received up to now rather suggest a failure quite to grasp the big black realities of the whole case roundabout us far and near the war blocks out of coursefor that you have realisedevery other object and question every other thinkability in life and i neednt tell you what a strain it all is on the nerves and the faith of a poor old damaged septuagenarian uncle the extraordinary thing is the way that every interest and every connection that seemed still to exist up to exactly a month ago has been as annihilated as if it had never lifted a head in the world at all that isnt with reflection so far as one can calmly reflect all that i see on the contrary there is a way of looking at what is taking place that is positively helpful or almost when one can concentrate on it at allwhich is difficult i mean the view that the old systematic organisation and consecration of such forces as are now let loose of their unspeakable infamy and insanity is undergoing such a triumphant exhibition in respect to the loathsomeness and madness of the same that it is what we must all together be most face to face with when the actual blackness of the smoke shall have cleared away but i cant go into that now any more than i can make this letter long dearest bill and dearest alice or can say anything just now in particular reference to what is happening you get in boston probably about as much news as we do for this is enormously and quite justly under control of the authorities and nothing reaches us but what is in the interest of operations precautions every kind of public disposition and consideration for the day and hour this country is making an enormous effortso far as its fleet is concerned a triumphantly powerful and successful one and there is a great deal more of the effort to come roughly speaking germany immensely prepared and with the biggest fightingpower ever known on earth has staked her all on a colossal onslaught and yet is far even yet from having done with it what she believed she would in the time or on having done it as she first designed the horrors of the crucifixion of belgium the general atrocity of the kaisers methods havent even yet entirely availed and there are chances not inconsiderable even while i write that they wont entirely avail that is that certain things may still happen to prevent them but it is all for the moment tremendously dark and awful we kind of huddle together here and try to lead our lives in such small dignity and piety as we may more and more is it a big fact in the colossal public situation that germany is absolutely locked up at last in a maritime way with all the seas swept of her every vessel of commerce she appears now absolutely corked her commerce and communications dead as a doornail and the british activity in undisturbed possession of the seas this by itself is an enormous service an immeasurable and finally determinant one surely rendered by this country to the allies but after hanging over dearest alice ever so blessingly again and tickling the new little infant phenomenon with a now quite practised old affectionate nose i must pull off and be just dearest bill your own allfondest old uncle   h j      to mrs w k clifford   dictated   lamb house rye august 31st 1914    dearest l c   i am reduced again you see to this aid to correspondence which i feel myself indeed fortunate to possess under the great oppression of the atmosphere in which we live it makes recuperation doubly difficult in case of recurrence of old ailments and i have been several days in bed with a renewed kick of the virus of my dismal long illness of 191011 and am on my feet today for the first time fortunately i know better how to deal with it now and with a little time i come round but it leaves me heavyfingered one is heavyeverything for that matter amid these horrorsover which i wont and cant expatiate and hang and pore that way madness lies and one must try to economise and not disseminate ones forces of resistanceto the prodigious public total of which i think we can each of us in his or her own way individually and however obscurely contribute to this end very kindly dont send me on newspapersi very particularly beseech you it seems so to suggest that you imagine us living in privation of or indifference to them which is somehow such a sorry image we are drenched with them and live up to our neck in them all the london morning ones by 8 am and every scrap of an evening one by about 640 pm we see the former thus at exactly the same hour we should in town and the last forms in which the latter appear very little more belatedly they are not just now very exhilaratingbut i can only take things in in waiting silencebracing myself unutterably and holding on somehow though to god knows what in presence of perpetrations so gratuitously and infamously hideous as the destruction of louvain and its accompaniments for which i cant believe there wont be a tremendous day of reckoning frederic harrisons letter in todays times will have been as much a relief to my nerves and yours and to those of millions of others as to his own splendidly fine old inflamed ones meaning by nerves everything that shall most formidably clamour within us for the recorded execration of history i find this more or less helpless assisting at the so longdrawnout martyrdom of the admirable little belgium the very intensest part of ones anguish and my one support in it is to lose myself in dreams and visions of what must be done eventually with real imagination and magnanimity and above all with real material generosity to help her unimaginable lacerations to heal the same inscrutable irony of ethereal peace and serenity goes on shedding itself here from the face of nature who has turned out for us such a summer of blandness and beauty as would have been worthy of a better cause it still goes on though of course we should be glad of more rain but occasional downfalls even of that heavenly dew havent quite failed us and more of it will very presumably now come there is no one here in particular for me to tell you of and if it werent that peggy is with me i should be pretty high and dry in the matter of human converse and contact she intensely prefers to remain with me for the presentand if she should have to leave i think i on my side should soon after have to return to my london perch finding as i do that almost absolute solitude under the assault of all the horrors isnt at all a good thing for me however that is not a practical question yet i think of you all faithfully and fondly   ever your old devotedest  h j      to mrs wharton        this moment was that of the height of the russian legend and      like everyone else h j was eagerly welcoming the multitudinous      evidence of the passage of a vast russian army through england to      france    dictated   lamb house rye september 1st 1914    dear e w   cast your intelligent eye on the picture from this ams daily mail that i send you and which you may not otherwise happen to see let it rest with all its fine analytic power on the types the dress the caps and the boots of the socalled belgians disembarkeddisembarked from where juste cielat ostend and be struck as i have been as soon as the thing was shown to me this am by the noticetaking skinner my brave dr so much more noticetaking than so many of the persons around us if they are not straight out of the historic or even fictive page of tolstoy i will eat the biggest pair of moujik boots in the collection with which skinner told me of speech either this morning or last evening on his part with a man whose friend or brother i forget which had just written him from sheffield train after train of russians have been passing through here today sunday they are a rumlooking lot but an enormous quantity of this apparently corroborative testimony from seen trains with their contents stared at and wondered at has within two or three days kept coming in from various quarters quantum valeat i consider the reproduced snapshot enclosed however a regular gem of evidence what a blessing after all is ourourrefined visual sense  this isnt really by way of answer to your own most valuable letter this morning receivedbut that is none the less gratefully noted and shall have its independent acknowledgment i am better thank you distinctly the recovery of power to eat again means everything to me i greatly appreciated your kind little letter to my most interesting and admirable peggy whom you left under the charm  my own small domestic plot here rocks beneath my feet since yesterday afternoon with the decision at once to volunteer of my invaluable and irreplaceable little burgess i had been much expecting and even hoping for it but definitely shrinking from the responsibility of administering the push with my own hand i wanted the impulse to play up of itself it now appears that it had played up from the first inwardlywith the departure of the little rye contingent for dover a fortnight ago the awfully decent little chap had then felt the pang of patriotism and martial ardour rentrés and had kept silent for fear of too much incommoding me by doing otherwise but now the clearance has taken place in the best way in the world and i part with him in a day or two  this is all now save that i am always yours too much for typists   henry james      to mrs richard watson gilder   dictated   lamb house rye september 2nd 1914    my dear helena   we are passing here as you may well suppose through the regular fiery furnace the sharpest ordeal and the most tremendous even on these shores that the generations have been through since any keeping of accounts and yet mild as one keeps reminding oneself in comparison with the lacerations of france and the martyrdoms of belgium it leaves one small freedom of mind for general talk it presses all the while with every throb of consciousness and if during the first days i felt in the air the recall of our civil war shocks and anxieties and hurryings and doings of 1861 etc the pressure in question has already become a much nearer and bigger thing and a more formidable and tragic one than anything we of the north in those years had to face it lights up for me rather what the tension was what it must have been in the souththough with difference even in that correspondence the south was more destitute than these rich countries are likely even at the worst to find themselves but on the other hand the german hordes to speak only of them are immeasurably more formidable and merciless than our comparatively benign northern armies ever approached being however i didnt mean to go into these historical parallelsany more than i feel able dear helena to go into many points of any kind one of the effects of this colossal convulsion is that all connection with everything of every kind that has gone before seems to have broken short off in a night and nothing ever to have happened of the least consequence or relevance beside what is happening now therefore when you express to me so beautifully and touchingly your interest in my notes ofanother life and planet as one now can but feel i have to make an enormous effort to hitch the allusion to my present consciousness i knew you would enter deeply into the chapter about minnie temple and had your young your younger intimacy with her at the back of my consciousness even while i wrote i had in mind a small a very small number of persons who would be peculiarly reached by what i was doing and would really know what i was talking about as the mass of others couldnt and you were of course in that distinguished little group i could but leave you to be as deeply moved as i was sure you would be and surely i can but be glad to have given you the occasion i remember your telling me long ago that you were not allowed during that last year to have access to her but i myself for most of it was still further away and yet the vividness of her while it went on seems none the less to have been preserved for us all alike only waiting for a right pressure of the spring to bring it out what is most pathetic in the light of today has seemed to me the so tragically little real care she got the little there was real knowledge enough or presence of mind enough to do for her so that she was probably sacrificed in a degree and a way that would be impossible today i thank you at any rate for letting me know that you have as you say relievingly wept for the rest your new england summer life amid your abounding hills and woods and waters to say nothing of the more intimate strong savour your children must impart to it shines upon me here from far across the sea as a land of brighter dream than its easy to think of mankind anywhere as dreaming i am delighted to hear that these things are thus comfortable and auspicious with you the interest of your work on richards life wouldnt be interesting to you if it were not tormenting and wouldnt be tormenting if it were not so considerably worth doing but as i say one sees everything without exception that has been a part of past history through the annihilation of battle smoke if of nothing else and all questions again swoon away into the obscure if you have got something to do stick to it tight and do it with faith and force some things will no doubt eventually be redeemed i dont speak of the actualities of the public situation here at this momentbecause i cant say things in the air about them but this country is making the most enormous the most invaluable and the most inspired effort she has ever had to put her hand to and though the devastating huns are thundering but just across the channelwhich looks so strangely serene in a present magnificence of summershe wont have failed i am convinced of a prodigious saving achievement   yours my dear helena all affectionately  henry james      to mrs wharton        it should be mentioned that mrs wharton had come to england but      was planning an early return to paris    dictated   lamb house rye september 3rd 1914    my dear e w   its a great luxury to be able to go on in this way i wired you at once this morning how very glad indeed i shall be to take over your superfluous young man as a substitute for burgess if he will come in the regular way my servant entirely not borrowed from you otherwise than in the sense of his going back to you whenever you shall want him again and remaining with me on a wage basis settled by me with him and about the same as burgesss if possible so long as the latter is away  i am afraid indeed now after this lapse of days that the russian legend doesnt very particularly hold watersome information i have this morning in the way of a positive denial of the war office points that way unless the sharp denial is conceivable quand même the only thing is that there remains an extraordinary residuum of fact to be accounted for it being indisputable by too much convergence of testimony that trains upon trains of troops seen in the light of day and not recognised by innumerable watchers and wonderers as english were pouring down from the north and to the east during the end of last week and the beginning of this it seems difficult that there should have been that amount of variously scattered hallucination misconception fantastication or whateveryet i chuck up the sponge  far from brilliant the news today of course and likely i am afraid to act on your disposition to go back to paris which i think a very gallant and magnificent and ideal one but which at the same time i well understand within you the urgent force of i feel i cannot take upon myself to utter any relevant remark about it at allany plea against it which you wouldnt in the least mind once the thing determined for you or any in favour of it which you so intensely dont require i understand too wellthats the devil of such a state of mind about everything whatever resolution you take and apply you will put it through to your very highest honour and accomplishment of service sur quoi i take off my hat to you down to the ground and only desire not to worry you with vain words i kind of hanker for any scrap of really domestic fact about you all that i may be able to extract from frederick if he comes but i shall get at you again quickly in this way and am your allfaithfullest   henry james      to mrs wharton        it will be remembered that the first news of the bombardment of      rheims cathedral suggested greater destruction than was the fact at      that time the wreckage was of course carried much further before      the end of the war     lamb house rye september 21st 1914    dearest edith   rheims is the most unspeakable and immeasurable horror and infamyand what is appalling and heartbreaking is that its for ever and ever but no words fill the abyss of itnor touch it nor relieve ones heart nor light by a spark the blackness the ache of ones howl and the anguish of ones execration arent mitigated by a shade even as one brands it as the most hideous crime ever perpetrated against the mind of man there it wasand now all the tears of rage of all the bereft millions and all the crowding curses of all the wondering ages will never bring a stone of it back yet one trieseven nowtries to get something from saying that the measure is so full as to overflow at last in a sort of vindictive deluge though for all the stones that that will replace and that the arm of final retributive justice becomes by it an engine really in some degree proportionate to the act i positively do think it helps me a little to think of how they can be made to wear the shame in the pitiless glare of history forever and everand not even to get rid of it when they are maddened literally by the weight and for that the preparations must have already at this hour begun how cant they be as a tremendous force fighting on the side fighting in the very fibres of france i think too somehowthough i dont know why practicallyof how nothing conceivable could have so damned and dished them forever in our great artloving country  if you go on thursday i cant hope to see you again for the present but all my blessings on all your splendid resolution your courage and charity right must you be not to take back with you any of your englishryits no place for them yet frederick will hang on your first signal to him againand meanwhile is a very great boon to me i wish i could do something for white if as i take it he stays behind put him up at the athenaeum or something all homage and affection to you dearest edith from your desolate and devoted old   h j      to mrs t s perry   dictated   lamb house rye september 22nd 1914    my dear lilla   forgive my use of this fierce legibility to speak to you in my now at best faltering accents we eat and drink and talk and walk and think we sleep and wake and live and breathe only the war and it is a bitter regimen enough and such as frankly i hoped i shouldnt live on disillusioned and horrorridden to see the like of not however that there isnt an uplifting and thrilling side to it as far as this country is concerned which makes unspeakably for interest makes one at hours forget all the dreadfulness and cling to what it means in another way what it above all means and has meant for me all summer is that looking almost straight over hence from the edge of the channel toward the horizonrim just beyond the curve of which the infamous violation of belgium has been all these weeks kept up i havent had to face the shame of our not having drawn the sword for the massacred and tortured flemings and not having left our inestimable france after vows exchanged to shift for herself england all but grovelled in the dust to the kaiser for peace up to the very latest hour but when his last reply was simply to let loose his hordes on belgium in silence with no account of the act to this country or to france beyond the most fatuously arrogant because i choose to damn you in all recorded history there began for us here a process of pulling ourselves together of which the end is so far from being yet that i feel it as only the most rudimentary beginning however i said i couldnt talkand here i am talking and i mustnt go on it all takes me too far i must only feel that all your intelligence and all your sympathy yours and dear thomass and those of every one of you is intensely with usand that the appalling and crowning horror of the persistent destruction of rheims which we just learn isnt even wanted to give the measure of the insanity of ferocity and presumption against which europe is making a stand do ask thomas to write me a participating word and think of me meanwhile as very achingly and shakily but still all confidently and faithfully yours   henry james      to miss rhoda broughton    21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw october 1st 1914    my dear rhoda   for myself with peggys necessary departure from my side some three weeks ago i could no longer endure the solitudinous and platitudinous side of my rural retreat i found i simply ate my heart out in the state of privation of converse any converse that counted and of remoteness from the source of informationas our information goes so having very blessedly this perch to come to here i am while the air of superficial summer still reigns london is agitating but interestingin certain aspects i find it even quite upliftingand the mere feeling that the huge burden of ones tension is shared is something of a relief even if it does show the strain as so much reflected back to one immensely do i understand the need of younger men to take refuge from it in doing for all they are worthto be old and doddering now is for a male person not at all glorious but if to feel with consuming passion under the call of the great cause is any sort of attestation of use then i contribute my fond vibration during these few days in town i have seen almost no one and this london which is to the eye immensely full of people i mean of the sort who are not here usually at this season is also a strange rather sinister london in the sense that social intercourse seems and most naturally scarcely to exist im afraid that even your salon were you here would inevitably become more or less aware of the shrinkage let that console you a little for not yet setting it up dear little  i shall try to seei grieve deeply over her complication of horrors we all have the latter but some people and those the most amiable and most innocent seem to have them with an extra devilish twist not sweets to the sweet now but a double dose of bitterness its all a huge strain and a huge nightmare and a huge unspeakabilitybut that isnt my last word or my last sense this great country has found and is still more finding certain parts of herself again that had seemed for long a good deal lost but here they are nowmagnificent and we havent yet seen a quarter of them the whole will press down the scale of fortune what we all are together in our so unequal ways out for we shall do through thick and thin and whatever enormity of opposition we sufficiently want to and we sufficiently canboth by material and volition therefore if we dont achieve it will only be because we have lost our essential our admirable our soundest and roundest identityand that is simply inconceivable to your faithful and affectionate old   henry james      to edmund gosse        the allusions in the following are to an article of mr gosses on      the effect of the war of 1870 upon french literature and to the      publication at this moment of h js notes on novelists    dictated   21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw october 15th 1914    my dear gosse   your article for the edinburgh is of an admirable interest beautifully done for the number of things so happily and vividly expressed in it and attaching altogether from its emotion and its truth how much alas to say on the whole portentous issue i mean the particular one you deal with must one feel there isand the more the further about one looks and thinks it makes me much want to see you again and we must speedily arrange for that i am probably doing on saturday something very long out of order for megoing to spend sunday with a friend near town but as quickly as possible next week shall i appeal to you to come and lunch with me in fact why not now ask you to let it be either on tuesday or wednesday 20th or 21st as suits you best here at 130 a word as to this at any time up to tuesday am and by telephone as well as any otherhow will be all sufficient  momentous indeed your recall with such exactitude and authority of the effect in france of the 187071 cataclysm and interesting to me as bringing back what i seem to myself to have been then almost closely present at so that the sense of it all again flushes for me i remember how the death of the immense old dumas didnt in the least emerge to the naked eye and how one vaguely heard that poor gautier librarian to the empress had in a day found everything give way beneath him and let him go down and down what analogies verily i fear with some of our present aspects and prospects i didnt so much as know till your page told me that jules lemaître was killed by that stroke awfully tragic and pathetic fact gautier but just survived the whole other convulsionit had led to his death early in 73 felicitous saintebeuve who had got out of the way with his incomparable penetration just the preceding year had i been at your elbow i should have suggested a touch or two about dear old george sand holding out through the darkness at nohant but even there giving out some lights that are caught up in her letters of the moment beautiful that you put the case as you do for the newer and younger belgians and affirm it with such emphasis for verhaerenat present i have been told in this country immense my respect for those who succeed in going on as you tell of gaston pariss having done during that dreadful winter and created life and force by doing i myself find concentration of an extreme difficulty the proportions of things have so changed and ones poor old values received such a shock i say to myself that this is all the more reason why one should recover as many of them as possible and keep hold of them in the very interest of civilisation and of the honour of our race as to which i am certainly rightbut it takes some doing tremendous the little fact you mention though indeed i had taken it for granted about the absolute cessation of  s last big sale after aug 1st very considerable his haul fortunatelyand if gathered inup to the eve of the fell hour all i myself hear from paris is an occasional word from mrs wharton who is full of ardent activity and ingenious devotion therea really heroic plunge into the breach but this is all now save that i am sending you a volume of gatheredin for the first time old critical papers the publication of which was arranged for in the spring and the book then printed and seen through the press so that there has been for me a kind of painful inevitability in its so grotesquely and falsenotedly coming out now but noi also say to myselfnothing serious and felt and sincere nothing good is anything but essentially in order today whether economically and attractively so or not put my volume at any rate away on a high shelfto be taken down again only in the better and straighter light that i invincibly believe in the dawning of let me hear however sparely about tuesday or wednesday and believe me all faithfully

october 16th 1914    very dear old friend   how can i thank you enough for the deep intelligence and sympathy of your beautiful and touching little letter this morning received or sufficiently bless the impulse that made you write it for really the strain and stress of the whole horribly huge case over here is such that the hand of understanding and sympathy reached out across the sea causes a grateful vibration and among all our vibrations those of gratitude dont seem appointed to be on the whole the most numerous though indeed i mustnt speak as if within our very own huge scope we have not plenty of those too that we can feel or that the individual poor resistingashecan creature may on such a scale feel and so intensely and potently with the endlessly multitudinous others who are subject to the same assault and such hundreds of thousands of them to so much greaterthis is verily his main great spiritual harbourage since so many of those that need more or less to serve have become now but the waste of waters happy are those of your and my generation in very truth who have been able or may still be to do as dear w e d so enviably did and close their eyes without the sense of deserting their post or dodging their duty we feel dont we that we have stuck to and done ours long enough to have a right to say oh this wasnt in the bargain its the claim of fate only in the form of a ruffian or a swindler and with such ill have no dealingthe perfection of which felicity i have but just heard so long after the event was that of poor dear fine jules lemaître who unwell at the end of july and having gone down to his own little native pays on the loire to be soigné read in the newspaper of the morrow that war upon france had been declared and fell back on the instant into a swoon from which he never awoke the happiest almost the enviable except those who may emulate william are the younger doers of things and engagers in action like our admirable richard for i find him so admirable whom i cant sufficiently commend and admire for having thrown himself into paris where he can most serve but i wont say much more now save that i think of you with something that i should call the liveliest renewal of affection if my affection for you had ever been less than lively i rejoice in whatever peggy has been able to tell you of me but dont you on your side fall into the error of regretting that she came back i have done nothing so much since her departure as bless the day of it so wrong a place does this more and more become for those whose life isnt definitely fixed here and so little could i have borne the anxiety and responsibility of having her on my mind in addition to having myself have me on yours dearest grace as much as you like for it is exquisitely sensible to me that you so faithfully and tenderly do and that does nothing but goodreal helpful good to yours all affectionately   henry james      to mrs wharton        a passage translated by m alfred de saint andré from h js      letter to mrs wharton of september 3rd see above had been read      at a meeting of the académie française and published in the      journal des débats the hôtel diéna was at this time the      headquarters of the british red cross society in paris     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw october 17th 1914    very dear old friend   yesterday came your brave letter with its two so remarkable enclosures and also the interesting one lent me to read by dorothy ward the sense they give me of your heroic tension and valour is something i cant expressany more than i need to for your perfect assurance of it posted here in london your letter was by the walter gays whom i hunger and thirst for though without having as yet got more into touch than through a telephone message on their behalf an hour ago by the manager or whoever of their south kensington hotel i most unfortunately cant see them this pm as they proposed as i am booked for the long unprecedented adventure of going down for a couple of nights to quacre in response to a most touching and nottoberesisted letter from its master g l and p l are both to be there apparently and i really rather welcome the break for a few hours with the otherwise unbroken pitch of london however let me not so much as name that in presence of your tremendous pitch of paris which however is all mixed in my consciousness with yours so that the intensity of yours drums through all the while as the big note with all my heart do i bless the booming work though not the booming anything else which makes for you from day to day the valid carapace the invincible if not perhaps strictly invulnerable armour so goldenplated you shine straight over at meand at us all  of the liveliest interest to me of course the débats version of the poor old rheims passage of my letter to you at the time of the horrorin respect to which i feel so greatly honoured by such grand courtesy shown it and by the generous translation for which i shall at the first possible moment write and thank saint andré from whom i have also had an immensely revealing small photograph of one of the aspects of the outraged cathedral the vividest picture of the irreparable ravage splendid indeed and truly precious your report of the address of that admirable man to the rheims tribunal at the hour of supreme trial i echo with all my soul your lively homage to it and ask myself if anything on earth can ever have been so blackly grotesque or grotesquely black as the sublimely smug proposal of the germans to wipe off the face of the world as a living forcesubstituting for it apparently their portentous their cumbrous and complicated idiomthe race that has for its native incomparable tone such form such speech such reach such an expressional consciousness as humanity was on that occasion honoured and so to speak transfigured by being able to find m louis bossu aiding in its chords what a splendid creation of life on the excellent mans part just by play of the resource most familiar and most indispensable to him  this is all at this moment i have still five pounds of your cheque in handwanting only to bestow it where i practically see it used i havent sent more to rye but conferred three a couple of days since on an apparently most meritorious and most intelligentlyworked refuge for some 60 or 70 that is being carried on in the most fraternal spirit by a real workingclass circle at hammersmith i shall distil your balance with equal care and i accompany each of your donations with a like sum of my own we are sending off hence now every day regularly some 7 or 8 london papers to the hôtel diéna   yours all faithfully  henry james      to thomas sergeant perry   dictated   21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk s w 25th oct 1914    my dear thomas   i have had a couple of letters from you of late for which i thank you but the contents of which reach me you will understand but through all the obstruction and oppression and obsession of all our conditions herethe strain and stress of which seem at times scarcely to be borne nevertheless we do bear themto my sense magnificently so that if during the very first weeks the sense of the huge public horror which seemed to have been appointed to poison the final dregs of my consciousness was nothing but sickening and overwhelming so now i have lived on as we all have into much of another vision i at least feel and take such an interest in the present splendid activity and position and office of this country and in all the fine importance of it that beats upon one from all round that the whole effect is uplifting and thrilling and consoling enough to carry one through whatever darkness whatever dismals as i think i said in a few words some weeks ago to lilla dear old england is not a whit less sound less fundamentally sane than she ever was but in fact ever so much finer and inwardly wiser and has been appointed by the gods to find herself again without more delay in some of those aspects and on some of those sides that she had allowed to get too much overlaid and encrusted she is doing this in the grand manner and i can only say that i find the spectacle really splendid to assist at after three months in the country i came back to london early sequestration there not at all answering for nerves or spirits and find myself in this place comparatively nearer to information and to supporting and suggestive contact i dont say it doesnt all at the best even remain much of the nightmare that it instantly began by being but gleams and rifts come through as from high and bedimmed yet farlooking and as it were promising and portending windows in fine i should feel i had lost something that ministers to life and knowledge if our collective experience for all its big black streaks hadnt been imposed on us let me not express myself none the less as if i could really thus talk about it all i cantits all too close and too horrific and too unspeakable and too immeasureable the facts or the falsities of news reach you doubtless as much as they reach us hereor rather with much more licence and really what i have wanted most to say is how deeply i rejoice in the sympathetic sense of your words few of these as your couple of notes have devoted to it you speak of some other thingsthat is of the glorious institute and of the fond severance of your connection with it and other matters but i suppose you will understand when i say that we are so shut in roundabout and so pressed upon by our single huge consciousness of the public situation that all other sounds than those that immediately belong to it pierce the thick medium but with a muffled effect and that in fine nothing really draws breath among us but the multitudinous realities of the war think what it must be when even the interest of the institute becomes dim and faint but i wont attempt to write you a word of really current historyancient history by the time it reaches you i throw myself back through all our anxieties and fluctuations which i do my best not to be at the momentary mercy of one way or the other to certain deep fundamentals which i cant go into either but which become vivid and sustaining here in the light of all one sees and feels and gratefully takes in i find the general community the whole scene of energy immensely sustaining and inspiringso great a thing every way to be present at that it almost salves over the haunting sense of all the horrors though indeed nothing can mitigate the huge belgian one the fact not seen for centuries of virtually a whole nation harmless and innocent driven forth into ruin and misery suffering of the most hideous sort and on the most unprecedented scaleunless it be the way that england is making a tremendous pair of the tenderest arms to gather them into her ample but so crowded lap that is the most haunting thing but the oppression and obsession are all heavy enough and the waking up to them again each morning after the nights oblivion if one has at all got it is a really bad moment to pass all life indeed resolves itself into the most ferocious practice in passing bad moments stand all of you to your guns and think and believe how you can really and measurably and morally help us yours dear thomas all faithfully   henry james      to henry james junior   dictated   21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw october 30th 1914    dearest harry   any news of the from day to day kind would be stale and flat by the time this reaches youand you know in new york at the moment of my writing very much what we know of our grounds of anxiety and of hope grounds of proceeding and production moral and material in every sort and shape if we only had at this moment the extra million of men that the now so more or less incredible optimism and amiability of our spirit toward germany during these last abysmal years kept knocking the bottom out of our having or preparing the benefit and the effect would be heavenly to think of and yet on the other hand i partly console myself for the comparatively awkward and clumsy fact that we are only growing and gathering in that amount of reinforcement now by the shining light it throws on englands moral position and attitude her predominantly incurable goodnature the sublimity or the egregious folly one scarcely knows which to call it of her innocence in face of the most prodigiously massed and workedout intentions of aggression of which history furnishes an example so it is that though the country has become at a bound the hugest workshop of every sort of preparation conceivable the men have in the matter of numbers to be wrought into armies after instead of beforewhich has always been englands sweet old way and has in the past managed to suffice the stuff and the material fortunately however are admirablehaving had already time to show to what tune they are and as i think i wrote your mother the other day one feels the resources alike of character and of material in the way of men and of every other sort of substance immense and so not consenting to be heaved to and fro by the short view or the news of the moment one rests ones mind on one or two big general convictionsprimarily perhaps that of the certainty that germanys last apprehension was that of a prolonged war that it never entered for a moment into the arrogance of her programme that she has every reason to find such a case ultragrinding and such a prospect ultradismal whereas nothing else was taken for granted here as an absolute grim necessity from the first but i am writing you remarks quite as i didnt mean to you have had plenty of theseat least irving street has hadbefore and what i would a thousand times rather have is some remarks from there be they only of an ardent sympathy and participationas of course whatever else in the world could they be i am so utterly and passionately enlisted up to my eyes and over my aged head in the greatness of our cause that it fairly sickens me not to find every imagination rise to it the casethe case of the failure to risethen seems to me so base and abject an exhibition and yet i remind myself even as i say it that the case has never really once happened to mei have personally not encountered any low likeness of it and therefore should rather have said that it would so horrifically affect me if it were supposable england seems to me at the present time in so magnificent a position before the world in respect to the history and logic of her action that i dont see a grain in the scale of her rightness that doesnt count for attestation of it and in short it really makes up almost for some of the huge horrors that constantly assault our vision to find one can be on a side with all ones weight that one never supposed likely to be offered one in such perfection and that has only to be exposed to more and more light to make one more glory so to speak for ones attachment for ones association  saturday oct 31st i had to break this off yesterday and now cant do much for fear of missing todays a saturdays american post only everything i tried yesterday to say is more and more before meall feelings and impressions intensifying by their very nature as they do from day to day under the general outward pressure literally the pressure of experience they from hour to hour receive such experience and such pressure for instance as my having pulled up for a few minutes as i was beginning this again to watch from my windows a great swinging body of the london scottish as one supposes marching past at the briskest possible step with its long line of freshly enlisted men behind it these are now in london of course impressions of every hour or of every moment but there is always a particular big thrill in the collective passage of the stridingly and just a bit flappingly kilted and bonneted when it isnt a question of mere parade or exercise as we have been used to seeing it but a suggestion everything in the air so aiding of a real piece of action a charge or an irresistible press forward on the field itself of a like suggestion in a general way was it to me yesterday afternoon to have gone again to see myalready mypoor belgian wounded at st bartholomews with whom its quite a balm to ones feelings to have established something of a helpful relation thanks to the power of freedom of speech by which i mean use of idiom between usand thanks again to ones so penetrating impression of their stricken and bereft patience and mild fatalism not one of those with whom i talked the last time had yet come by the shadow of a clue or trace of any creature belonging to him young wife or child or parent or brother in all the thick obscurity of their scatterment and once more i felt the tremendous force of such convulsions as the nowgoingon in wrenching and dislocating the presupposable and rendering the actual monstrous of the hour whatever it is all the suffering creature can feel even more interesting and in a different way naturally was a further hour at st bs with a couple of wardsful of british wounded just straight back by extraordinary good fortune from the terrific fighting round about ypres which is still going on but from which they had been got away in their condition at once via saintnazaire and southampton three or four of whom all of the grenadier guards who seemed genuinely glad of ones approach not being for the time at all otherwise visited struck me as quite ideal and natural soldierstuff of the easy the bright and instinctive and above all the in this country probably quite inexhaustible kind those i mention were intelligent specimens of courseone picked them out rather for their intelligent faces but the ease as i say the goodhumour the gaiety and simplicity without the ghost of swagger of their individual adaptability to their job made an impression of them about as satisfactory so to speak as one could possibly desire it but this is all nowand youll say its enough ever your affectionate old uncle   henry james      to hugh walpole        mr walpole was at this time in russia     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw november 21st 1914    dearest hugh   this is a great joyyour letter of november 12th has just come to my extreme delight and i answer it you see within a very few hours it is by far the best letter you have ever written me and i am touched and interested by it more than i can say let me tell you at once that i sent you that last thing in typecopy because of an anxious calculation that such a form would help to secure its safe arrival your own scrap was a signal of the probable nonarrival of anything that seemed in the least to defy legibility therefore i said to myself that what was flagrantly and blatantly legible would presumably reach you i had better make use of this chance however to give you an inkling of our affairs such as they are rather than indulge in mere surmises and desires fond and faithful though these be about your own eventualities london is of course under all our stress very interesting to me deeply and infinitely movingbut on a basis and in ways that make the life we have known here fade into grey mists of insignificance people meet a little but very little every social habit and convention has broken down save with a few vulgarians and utter mistakers mistakers i mean about the decency of things and for myself i confess i find there are very few persons i care to seeonly those to whom and to whose state of feeling i am really attached promiscuous chatter on the public situation and the gossip thereanent of more or less wailing women in particular give unspeakably on my nerves depths of sacred silence seem to me to prescribe themselves in presence of the sanctities of action of those who in unthinkable conditions almost are magnificently doing the thing then right and left are all the figures of mourningthough such proud erect onesover the blow that has come to them there the women are admirablethe mothers and wives and sisters the mothers in particular since its so much the younger lives the fine seed of the future that are offered and taken the rate at which they are taken is appallingbut then i think of france and russia and even of germany herself and the vision simply overwhelms and breaks the heart the german dead the german dead i above all say to myselfin such hecatombs have they been ruthlessly piled up by those who have driven them from behind to their fate and it for the moment almost makes me forget belgiumthough when i remember that disembowelled country my heart is at once hardened to every son of a hun belgium we have hugely and portentously with us if never in the world was a nation so driven forth so on the other hand was one never so taken to anothers arms and the dutch have been nobly hospitableimmensely interesting what you say of the sublime newness of spirit of the great russian peopleof whom we are thinking here with the most confident admiration i met a striking specimen the other day who was oddly enough in the canadian contingent he had been living two or three years in canada and had volunteered there and who was of a stature complexion expression and above all of a shining candour which made him a kind of armycorps in himself but goodnight dearest hugh i sit here writing late in the now extraordinary london blackness of darkness and almost tension of stillness the alarms we have had here as yet come to nothing please believe in the fond fidelity with which i think of you oh for the day of reparation and reunion i hope for you that you may have the great and terrible experience of ambulance service at the front ah how i pray you also may receive this benediction from your affectionate old   h j      to mrs wharton        mr walter berry had just passed through london on his way back to      paris from a brief expedition to berlin the revived work which h      j was now carrying forward was the sense of the past     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw december 1st 1914    dearest edith   walter offers me kindly to carry you my word and i dont want him to go emptyhanded though verily only the poor shrunken sediment of me is practically left after the overwhelming and écrasant effect of listening to him on the subject of the transcendent high pitch of berlin i kick myself for being so flattened out by it and ask myself moreover why i should feel it in any degree as a revelation when it consists really of nothing but what one has been constantly saying to ones selfones minds eye perpetually blinking at it as presumably the caseall these weeks and weeks its the personal note of testimony that has caused it to knock me upwhat has permitted this being the nature and degree of my unspeakable and abysmal sensibility where our cause is concerned and the fantastic force the prodigious passion with which my affections are engaged in it they grow more and more soand my soul is in the whole connection one huge sore ache that makes me dodge lurid lights when i ought doubtless but personally to glare back at themas under the effect of many of my impressions here i frequently door almost for the moment i am quite flooredbut i suppose i shall after a while pick myself up i dare say for that matter that i am down pretty oftenfor i find i am constantly picking myself up so even this time i dont really despair about belgium walter was so admirably and unspeakably interestingif the word be not mean for the scale of such tragedywhich youll have from him all for yourself if i dont call his berlin simply interesting and have done with it thats because the very faculty of attention is so overstrained by it as to hurt this takes you all my love i have got back to trying to workon one of three books begun and abandonedat the end of some 30000 words15 years ago and fished out of the depths of an old drawer at lamb house i sent miss bosanquet down to hunt it up as perhaps offering a certain defiance of subject to the law by which most things now perish in the public blight this does seem to kind of intrinsically resistand i have hopes but i must rally now before getting back to it so pray for me that i do and invite dear walter to kneel by my side and believe me your faithfully fond   henry james      to mrs t s perry   dictated   21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw december 11th 1914    dear and so sympathetic lilla   i have been these many by which i mean too many days in receipt of your brave letter and impassioned sonneta combination that has done me i assure you no end of good i so ache and yearn here more or less on the spot with the force of my interest in our public situation i feel myself in short such a glowing and flaring firebrand that i cant have enough of the blest article you supply my standard of what constitutes enough being so high your sonnet strikes me as very well madewhich all sonnets from female pens are not and since you invoke american association with us you do the fine thing in invoking it up to the hilt of course you can all do us most good by simply feeling and uttering as the best of you dothere having come in my way several copious pronouncements by the american press than which it has seemed to me there could have been nothing better in the way of perfect understanding and happy expression i have said to myself in presence of some of them oh blest and wondrous the miracle the force of events the light of our cause is absolutely inspiring the newspaper tone over there with the last thing one ever expected it to have style and the weight of style so that all the good things are literally on our side at once  its delightful to me to hear of your local knitting and sewing circleit quite goes to my heart in fact to catch your echo of the brave click of the needles at gentle hancock they click under my own mild roof from morning to night so that i cant quite say why i dont find my soup flavoured with khaki wool or my napkin inadvertently replaced by a large grey sock but the great thing is that its really a pity you are not here for participation in the fine old english thrill and throb of all that goes forward simply from day to day and that makes the common texture of our life you would generously abound in the sense of it i feel and be grateful for it as a kind of invaluable a really cherishable race experience one wouldnt have to explain anything to youyou would take it all down in a gulp the kind of gulp in which one has to indulge to keep from breaking down under the positive pang of comprehension and emotion two afternoons ago i caught that gulp twice over in the very actwhile listening to that dear and affable emile boutroux make an exquisite philosophic address to the british academy which he had come over for the purpose of and then hearing the less consummate yet sturdily sensitive and expressive lord chancellor haldane utter to him in return the thanks of the select and intense auditory and their sense of the beautiful and wonderful and unprecedented unison of nations that the occasion symbolised and celebrated in the quietest way in the world boutroux just escaped breaking down in his preliminary reference to what this meant and how he felt and just so the good haldane grazed the same almost inevitable accident in speaking for us all us present and the whole public consciousness when he addressed the lecturer afterwards what was so moving was its being so utterly unrehearsed and immediateits coming on one side and the other so of itself and being a sort of thing that hasnt since god knows when if ever found itself taking place between nation and nation i kind of wish that the usa were not though of necessity i admit so absent from this feast of friendship it figures for me as such an extraordinary luxury that the whirligig of time has turned up for us such an intimacy of association with france and that france so exquisitely responds to it i quite tasted of the quality of this last fact two nights ago when an english officer a most sane and acute middleaged colonel dined with me and another friend and gave us a real vision of what the presence of the british forces in the field now means for the so extraordinarily intelligent and responsive french and what a really unprecedented relation i do wish to goodness we were in it between a pair of fraternising and reciprocating people it represents the truth is of course that the british participation has been extraordinarily quite miraculously effective and sustaining has had in it a quality of reinforcement out of proportion to its numbers though these are steadily growing and that all the intelligence of the wonderful france simply floods the case with appreciation and fraternity these things shown in the charming way in which the french most of all can show the like under full inspiration yes its an association that i do permit myself at wanton moments to wish that we in our high worthiness to be of it werent so out of but i mustnt my dear lilla go maundering on intercede with thomas to the effect of his writing me some thoroughly some intensely and immensely participating word for the further refreshment of my soul it is refreshed here as well as ravaged oh at times so ravaged by the general sense of what is maturing and multiplying steadily multiplying on behalf of the alliesout of the immediate circle of whose effectively stored and steadily expanding energies we reach over to a slightly bedimmed but inexpressible russia with a deepfelt sense that before we have all done with it together she is going somehow to emerge as the most interesting the most original and the most potent of us all let thomas take to himself from me that so i engage on behalf of his chosen people yours and his and the daughters all intimately and faithfully   henry james      to edmund gosse    21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw december 17th 1914    my dear gosse   this is a scratch of postscript to my note this evening posted to youprompted by the consciousness of not having therein made a word of reply to your question as to what i think of things the recovered pressure of that question makes me somehow positively want to say that i think i dont think of them at allthough i try to that i only feel and feel and toujours feel about them unspeakably and about nothing else whateverfeeling so in wordsworths terms of exaltations agonies and loves and our unconquerable mind yes i kind of make out withal that through our insistence an increasing purpose runs and that ones vision of its final effect though only with the aid of time grows less and less dim so that one seems to find at moments its almost sharp and meanwhile what a purely suicidal record for themselves the business of yesterdaythe women and children and babes in arms slaughtered at scarborough and whitby with their turning and fleeing as soon as ever they had killed enough for the moment oh i do think enough to believe in retribution for that so ive kind of answered you   ever yours  henry james      to miss grace norton        this follows on the letter to miss norton of oct 16 1914 dealing      with the work in france of her nephew richard norton    dictated   21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw january 1st 1915    dearest grace   i waste no time in explaining again how reduced i am to the use of this machinery by the absolute physical effect on my poor old organism of the huge tension and oppression of our conditions hereto say nothing of the moral effect with which the other is of course intensely mixed i can tell you better thus moreover than by any weaker art what huge satisfaction i had yesterday in an hour or two of richards company he having generously found time to lunch with me during two or three days that he is snatching away from the front under urgency of business i gathered from him that you hear from him with a certain frequency and perhaps some fulnessi know its always his desire that you shall but even so you perhaps scarce take in how perfectly splendid he isthough even if you in a manner do i want to put it on record to you for myself that i find him unmitigatedly magnificent its impossible for me to overstate my impression of his intelligent force his energy and lucidity his gallantry and resolution or of the success the unswerving application of these things is making for him and for his enterprise not that i should speak as if he and that were different mattershe is the enterprise and that on its side is his very self and in fine it is a tremendous tonicamong a good many tonics that we have indeed thank goodnessto get the sense of his richly beneficent activity he seemed extremely well and fit and suffered me to ply him with all the questions that ones constant longing here for a nearer view combined with a kind of shrinking terror of it given all the misery the greatest nearness seems to reveal makes one restlessly keep up what he has probably told you with emphasis by letter is the generalisation most sadly forced upon himthe comparative supportability of the fact of the wounded and the sick beside the desolating view of the ravaged refugees he can help the former much more than the latter and the ability to do his special job with success is more or less sustaining and rewarding but the sight of the wretched people with their villages and homes and resources utterly annihilated and they simply staring at the blackness of their ruin with the very clothes on their backs scarce left to them is clearly something that would quite break the heart if one could afford to let it if he isnt able to give you the detail of much of that tragedy so much the better for yousave indeed for your thereby losing too some examples of how he succeeds in occasional mitigations quand même thanks to the positive the quite blest ferocity of his passion not to fail of any service he can with the least conceivability render he was most interesting he was altogether admirable as to his attitude in the matter of going outside of the strict job of carrying the military sick and wounded and them only as the ancient geneva conventions confine a red cross ambulance to doing there has been some perfunctory protest not long since on the part of some blank agent of that red cross body in relation to his picking up stricken and helpless civilians and seeing them as far as possible on their way to some desperate refuge or relief whereupon he had given this critic full in the face the whole philosophy of his proceedings and intentions letting the personage know that when the germans ruthlessly broke every geneva convention by attempting to shell him and his cars and his wounded whenever they could spy a chance he was absolutely for doing in mercy and assistance what they do in their dire brutality and might be depended upon to convey not only every suffering civilian but any armed and trudging soldiers whom a blest chance might offer him his remonstrant visitor remained blank and speechless but at the same time duly impressed or even floored and dick will have i think so far as any further or more serious protest is concerned an absolutely free hand the germans have violated with the last cynicism both the letter and the spirit of every agreement they ever signed and its little enough that the poor retaliation left us not that in kind which i think we may describe ourselves as despising but that in mere reparation of their ravage and mere scrappy aid to ourselves should be compassed by us when we can compass it richard told me yesterday that the aspect of london struck him as having undergone a great change since his last rush overin the sense of the greater flagrancy of the pressure of the war and one feels that perfectly on the spot and without having to go away and come back for it there corresponds with it doubtless a much tighter screwup of the whole public consciousness worked upon by all kinds of phenomena that are very penetrating here but that doubtless are reduced to some vagueness as reported to you across the seawhen reported at all as most of them cant be goodbye at any rate for this hour what i most wanted to give you was the strong sidewind and conveyed virtue of dicks visit i hope you are seeing rather more than less of alice and peggy to whom i succeed in writing pretty oftenand perhaps things that if repeated to you as i trust they sometimes are help you to some patient allowance for your tremendously attached old friend   henry james      to mrs dacre vincent        this refers to the loss of a fine old mulberrytree that had stood      on the lawn at lamb house     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw january 6th 1915    my dear margaret   it has been delightful to me to hear from you even on so sorry a subject as my poor old prostrated tree which it was most kind of you to go and take a pitying look at he might have gone on for some time i think in the absence of an inordinate galebut once the fury of the tempest really descended he was bound to give way because his poor old heart was dead his immense old trunk hollow he had no power to resist left when the southwester caught him by his vast crinière and simply twisted his head round and round its very sad for he was the making of the gardenhe was it in person and now i feel for the time as if i didnt care what becomes of itmy interest wholly collapses but what a folly to talk of that prostration among all the prostrations that surround us one hears of them here on every sideand they represent of course i am speaking of the innumerable splendid young men fallen in their flower the crushingly black side of all the horrible business the irreparable dead loss of what is most precious the inestimable seed of the future the air is full of the sense of all that dreadfulnessthe echoes forever in ones ears still i havent wanted to wail to youand dont write you for that london isnt cheerful but vast and dark and damp and very visibly depleted as well may be and yet is also in a sense uplifting and reassuring such an impression does one get here after all of the enormous resources of this empire i mean that the reminders at every turn are so great i see a few peoplequite as many as i can do with for i find i cant do with miscellaneous chatter or make a single new acquaintancelook at a solitary new face save that of the wounded soldiers in hospital whom i see something of and find of a great and touching interest yet the general conditions of town i find the only ones i can do with now and i am more glad than i can say to think of mrs lloyd and her daughters supplanting me at their ease at dear old lh i rejoice to hear from you of beaus fine outlook and i send him my aged blessingas i do to his father who must take good comfort of him i am afraid on the other hand that all these diluvian and otherwise devastated days havent contributed to the gaiety i wont say of nationswhat will have become forever of that but of golfers pure and simple i wonder about you much and very tenderly and wish you werent so far or my agility so extinct i find i think with dismaypositive terrorof a station or a trainmore than once or twice a year bitter moreover the thought to me that you never seem now in the way of coming up  goodnight dear margaret yours all faithfully   henry james      to the hon evan charteris    21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw jan 22 1915    my dear evan   i am more deeply moved than i can say by the receipt of your so admirably vivid and interesting letter i envy you intensely your opportunity to apply that spirit of observation in these immense historic conditions and thus to have had a hand of your own in the most prodigious affirmation of the energy and ingenuity of man however misplaced that surely can ever have been in the world for gods sake go on taking as many notes of it as you possibly can and believe with what grateful piety i shall want to go over your treasure with you when you finally bring it home such impressions as you must get such incalculable things as you must see such unutterable ones as you must feel well keep it all up and above all keep up that same blest confidence in my fond appreciation wonderful your account of that night visit to the trenches and giving me more of the sense and the smell and the fantastic grimness the general ordered and methodised horror than anything else whatever that has pretended to enlighten us with infinite interest do i take in what you say of the rapidity with which the insideoutness of your conditions becomes the matter of course and the platitudinouswhich i take partly to result from the tremendous collectivity of the case doesnt it the fact of the wholeness of the stress and strain or intimate fusion as in a common pot of all exposures all resistances all the queerness and all the muchness but i mustnt seem to put too interrogatively my poor groping speculations only wait to correct my mistakes in some better future and i shall understand you down to the ground we add day to day here as consciously or labouringly as you are doing no doubt on your sideits in fact like lifting every 24 hours just now a very dismally dead weight and setting it on top of a pile of such others already stacked which promises endlessly to growso that the mere reaching up adds all the while to the beastly effort london is greyin moral tone and even the zeppelin bombs of last night at yarmouth do little to make it flush what a pitiful horror indeed must that ypres desolation and desecration bea baseness of demonism i find thank god that under your image of that i at least can flush it so happens that i dine tomorrow 23d with john sargent or rather i mean lunch and i shall take for granted your leave to read him your letter i bless you again for it and am yours all faithfully   henry james      to compton mackenzie   dictated   21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw january 23rd 1915    my dear monty   i am acknowledging your so interesting letter at once because i find that under the effect of all our conditions here i cant answer for any postal fluency however reduced in quality or quantity at an indefinite future time my fluency of the moment even such as it is has to take the present mechanic form but here goes at any rate to the extent of my having rejoiced to hear from you not of much brightness though your news may be i tenderly condole and participate with you on your having been again flung into bed truly the haul on your courage has to keep on being enormousand i applaud to the echo the wonderful way that virtue in you appears to meet it you strike me as leading verily the heroic life at a pitch nowhere and by nobody surpassedeven though our whole scene bristles all over with such grand examples of it since you are up and at work again may that at least go bravely onwhile i marvel again according to my wont at your still finding it possible in conditions that i fear would be for me dismally inhibitive i bless your new book even if you didnt in our last talk leave me with much grasp of what it is to be about in presence of any suchlike intention i find i want a subject to be able quite definitely to state and declare itselfas a subject and when the thing is communicated to me in advance in the form of soandsos doing this that or the other or somethingelses happening and so on i kind of yearn for the expressible idea or motive what the thing is to be done for to have been presented to me which you may say perhaps is asking a good deal i dont think so if any cognisance at all is vouchsafed one it is the only thing i in the least care to ask what the author shall do with his idea i am quite ready to wait for but am meanwhile in no relation to the work at all unless that basis has been provided console yourself however dear great george meredith once began to express to me what a novel he had just started one of our conquerors was to be about by no other art than by simply naming to me the halfdozen occurrences such as they were that occupied the pages he had already written so that i remained i felt quite without an answer to my respectful inquirywhich he had all the time the very attitude of kindly encouraging and rewarding  but why do i make these restrictive and invidious observations i bless your book and the authors fine hand and brain whatever it may consist of and i bend with interest over your remarks about poor speculating and squirming italys desperate dilemma the infusion of that further horror of local devastation and anguish is too sickening for wordsi have been able only to avert my face from it as if i were nearer i fear i should but wrap my head in my mantle and give up altogether the truth is however that the italian case affects me as on the whole rather uglyfailing to see as one does their casus belli and having to see as one also does that they must hunt up one to give them any sort of countenance at all i should   january 25th  i had alas to break off two days ago having been at that very moment flung into bed as i am occasionally liable to be somewhat like yourself though happily not in the prolonged way i am up this morning againthough still in rather semisickly fashion but trying to collect my wits afresh as to what i was going to say about italy however i had perhaps better not say itas i take i rather fear a more detached view of her attitude than i see that on the spot you can easily do by which i mean that i dont much make out how as regards the two nations with whom she is in alliance originally so unnatural alas in the matter of austria she can act in a fashion any fashion regardable as straight i always hated her patching up a friendly relation with austria and thereby with germany as against france and this country and now what she publishes is that it was good enough for her so long as there was nothing to be got otherwise if theres anything to be got by any other alliance she will go in for that but she thus gives herself away as to all her recent past a bit painfully doesnt one feeland will do so especially if what she has in mind is to cut in on turkey and so get ahead for benefit or booty or whatever of her very own allies however i mustnt speak as if we and ours shouldnt be glad of her help whatever that help is susceptible of amounting to the situation is one for not looking a gifthorse in the mouthwhich only proves alas how many hideous and horrible aspects such situations have personally i dont see how she can make up her mind not in spite of all temptations to remain as still as a mouse isnt it rather luridly borne in upon her that the germans have only to make up their minds ruthlessly to violate switzerland in order as they say to be at milan by the simplon the st gotthard or whatever in just ten hours ughlet me not talk of such abominations i dont know why i pretend to it or attempt it i too am trying i dont know whether i told you to bury my nose in the doing of something daily and am finding that however little i manage on any given occasion even that little sustains and inflames and rewards me i lose myself thus in the mystery of what art can do for one even with every blest thing against it and why it should and how it does and what it meansthat is the funny thing however as i just said one mustnt look a gifthorse etc so dont yourself so scrutinise this poor animal but believe me yours all faithfully   henry james      to miss elizabeth norton        the pamphlet was his appeal on behalf of the american volunteer      motorambulance included in within the rim     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw jan 25th 1915    dearest lily   it has been of the greatest interest it has been delightful to me to receive tonight your so generous and informing letter the poor little pamphlet for which you thank me is a helpless and empty thingfor which i should blush were not the condition of its production so legibly stamped upon it you cant say things unless you have been out there to learn them and if you have been out there to learn them you can say them less than ever with all but utterly nothing to go upon i had to make my remarks practically of nothing and that the effect of them can only be nil on a subscribing public which wants constant and particular news of the undertakings it has been asked to believe in once for all i can but too readily believe the case seems different herei mean on this side of the seawhere scores and scores of such like corps are in operation in francethe number of ambulancecars is many many thousand on all the long linewithout its becoming necessary for them that their work should be publicly chronicled i think the greater nearnessherethe strange and sinister nearnessmakes much of the difference various facts are conveyed by personalunpublishedreport and these sufficiently serve the purpose what seems clear at all events is that there is no devisable means for keeping the enterprise in touch with american sympathy and i sadly note therefore what you tell me of the inevitable and not distant end the aid rendered strikes me as having been of the handsomestas is splendidly the case with all the aid america is rendering in her own largehanded and fullhanded way of which you tell me such fine interesting things from your own experience it makes you all seem one vast and prodigious workshop with usfor the resources and the energy of production and creation and devotion here are of course beyond estimation i imagine indeed that given your more limited relation to the war your resources in money are more remarkableeven though here by which i mean in england for the whole case is i believe more hampered in france the way the myriad calls and demands are endlessly met and met is prodigious enough it does my heart good that you should express yourself as you dothough how could you do anything elseon behalf of the simply sacred cause as i feel it of the allies for here at least one needs to feel it so to bear up under the close pressure of all that is so hideous and horrible in what has been let loose upon us much of the time one feels that one simply cantthe heartbreaking aspect the destruction of such masses on such a scale of the magnificent young life that was to have been productive and prolific bears down any faith any patience all argument and all hope i can look at the woe of the bereft the parents the mothers and wives and take it comparatively for grantedthat is not care for what they individually suffer as they seem indifferent themselves both here and in france in an extraordinarily noble way but the dead loss of such ranks upon ranks of the finest young human materialof lifethat is an abyss into which one can simply gaze appalled and as if that were not enough i find myself sickened to the very soul by the apparent sense of the louche and sinister figure of mr woodrow wilson who seems to be aware of nothing but the various ingenious ways in which it is open to him to make difficulties for us i may not read him right but most of my correspondents at home appear to and they minister to my dread of him and the meanness of his note as it breaks into all this heroic air  but i am writing you in the key of mere lamentationwhich i didnt mean to do strange as it may seem there are times when i am much upliftedwhen what may come out of it all seems almost worth it and then the black nightmare holds the field againand in fact one proceeds almost wholly by those restless alternations they consume ones vital substance but one will perhaps wear them out first it touches me deeply that you should speak tenderly of dear old london for which my own affection in these months sest accrue a thousandfoldjust as the same has taken place in my attachment for all these so very preponderantly decent and solid people the race is worth fighting for immenselyin fact i dont know any other for whom it can so much be said well go on working and feeling and believing for me dear lily and god uphold your right arm and carry far your voice think of me too as your poor old aching and yet not altogether collapsing your in fact quite clinging   henry james      to hugh walpole        mr walpole was now serving with the red cross on the russian      front     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw february 14th 1915    dearest hugh   when you write you say and when do i write but just exactly an hour after your letter of this evening that of february 1st a fortnight ago to a day has come to hand i delight in having got it and find it no less interesting than genialbristling with fine realities much as it tells me indeed i could have done with still more but that is of course always the case at such a time as this and amid such wonderments and yearnings and i make gratefully the most of what there is the basis the connection the mode of employment on and in and under which you go off for instance are matters that leave me scratching my head and exhaling long and sad sighsbut as those two things are what i am at in these days most of my time i dont bring them home most criminally to you only i am moved to beseech you this time not to throw yourself into the thick of military operations amid which your want of even the minimum of proper eyesight apparently may devote you to destruction more or lessafter the manner of the blind quart dheure described to me in your letter previous to this one i am sorry the black homesickness so feeds upon you amid your terrific paradoxical friends the sport alike of their bodies and their souls of whom your account is admirably vivid but i well conceive your state which has my tenderest sympathythat nostalgic ache at its worst being the invocation of the very devil of devils dont let it break the spell of your purpose of learning russian of really mastering itthough even while i say this i rather wince at your telling me that you incline not to return to england till september next i dont put that regret on the score of my loss of the sight of you till thenthat gives the sort of personal turn to the matter that we are all ashamed together of giving to any matter now but the being and the having been in englandor in france which is now so much the same thingduring at least a part of this unspeakable year affects me as something you are not unlikely to be sorry to have missed there attaches to itto the being heresomething so sovereign and so initiatory in the way of a british experience i mean that its as if you wouldnt have had the full general british experience without it and that this may be a pity for you as a painter of british phenomenafor i dont suppose you think of reproducing only russian for the rest of your shining days however i hasten to add that i feel the very greatest aversion to intermeddlingly advising youyour completing your year in russia all depends on what you do with the precious time you may bring home fruits by which you will be wholly justified address yourself indeed to doing that and putting it absolutely throughand i will for my part back you up unlimitedly only bring your sheaves with you and gather in a golden bundle of the same i detest myself the fine old british horroras it has flourished at least up to now when in respect to the great matter thats upon us the fashion has so much changedof doing anything consistently and seriously so if you should draw out your absence i shall believe in your reasons meanwhile i am myself of the most flaming british complexionthe whole thing is to me an unspeakably intimate experienceif it isnt abject to apply such a term when one hasnt had ones precious person straight up against the facts i have only had my poor old mind and imaginationbut as one can have them here and i live partly in dark abysses and partly in high and i think noble elations but how at my age and in my conditions i could have beautifully done without it i resist more or lesssince you ask me to tell you how i am i resist and go on from day to day because i want to and the horrible interest is too great not to but that same is adding the years in great shovelfulls to our poor old lives those at least of my generation so dont be too long away after all if you want ever to see me again i have in a manner got back to workafter a black interregnum and find it a refuge and a propbut the conditions make it difficult exceedingly almost insuperably i find in a sense far other than the mere distressing and depressing the subjectmatter of ones effort has become itself utterly treacherous and falseits relation to reality utterly given away and smashed reality is a world that was to be capable of thisand how represent that horrific capability historically latent historically ahead of it how on the other hand not represent it eitherwithout putting into play mere fiddlesticks  i had to break off my letter last night from excess of lateness and now i see i misdated it tonight is the 15th the pm of a cold grey sunday such as we find wintry here in our innocence of your ferocities of climate to which in your place i should speedily succumb that buried beneath the polar blizzard and the howling homesick snowdrift you dont utterly give way is i think a proof of very superior resources and of your being reserved for a big future goodnight however now really dearest hugh i follow your adventure with all the affectionate solicitude of your allfaithful old   h j      to mrs henry cabot lodge    21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw february 16th 1915    my dear mrs lodge   it is indeed very horrible that having had the kindest of little letters from you ever so long ago i wont remind you how longyou may have magnanimously forgotten it a little i am thanking you for it only at this late day explanations are vain things and yet if i throw myself on the biggest explanation that ever was in the world there may be something in it fortunately the interest and the sympathy grow if things that start at the superlative degree can grow and i never am sick with all the monstrosity of it but i become after a bit almost well with all the virtue and the decency i try to live in the admiring contemplation of that as much as possibleand i thought i already knew how deeply attached i am to this remarkable country and to the character of its people i find i havent known until now the real degree of my attachmentwhich i try to showthat is to applythe intensity of in small and futile ways today for instance i have been taking to my dentist a convalesced soldiera mere sapper of the rewhom i fished out of a hospital yesterday i went to the stores to send foodchocolate to my cooks nephew at the front driver bisset of the artillery and at the moment i write i am putting up for the night a young expostman from rye who has come up to pass the doctor tomorrow for the naval brigade these things as i write them make me almost feel that i do push before you the inevitability of my silence but they dont mean please that i am not living very intensively at the same time with you all at washingtonwhere i fondly suppose you all to entertain sentiments the senator and yourself constance and that admirable gussy into which i may enter with the last freedom i wont go into the particulars of my sympathyor at least into the particulars of what it imputes to you but i have a general sweet confidence a kind of wealth of divination  london is of course not gay thank the lord but i wouldnt for the world not be herethere are impressions under which i feel it a kind of uplifting privilege the situation doesnt make me gregariousbut on the contrary very fastidious about the people i care to see i know exactly those i dont but never have i taken more kindly to those i doand with them intercourse has a fine intimacy that is beyond anything of the past but we are very matureand that is part of the harmonythe young and the youngish are all away getting killed so far as they are males and so far as they are females wives and fiancées and sisters they are occupied with being simply beyond praise the mothers are pure roman and its all tremendously becoming to every one there are really no fiancées by the waythe young men get home for three days and are marriedthen off into the absolute hell of it again but goodnight now it was truly exquisite of you to write to me do feel and tell cabot that i take the liberty of asking him to feel how thoroughly i count on all your house its a luxury for me to know how i can on constance yours dear mrs lodge ever and ever so faithfully   henry james      to mrs william james        h js eldest nephew was at this time occupied with relief work in      belgium     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw feb 20th 1915    dearest alice   of course our great family public fact is harrys continuously inscrutable and unseizable activity here here i say without knowing in the least where he now isand the torment of his spending all this time on this side of the sea and of ones utter loss of him in consequence is really quite dreadful england is splendid undisturbed and undismayed by the savage fury and the roaring madbull policy of germanys mineandtorpedo practice against all the nations of the earth or rather of the seathough of course there will be a certain number of disasters and it will probably be on neutrals that most of these will fall  feb 22nd pm i had to break this off two nights ago and since then that remark has been signally confirmedthree neutral ships have been sunk by mines and torpedoes and one of these we learn this am is an american cargoboat i dont suppose anything particular will happen for you all with germany because of this incident alone the crew were saved yet it can hardly improve relations and she is sure to repeat the injury in some form promptly and then the fat will be on the fire mr roosevelt is far from being dear to me but i cant not agree with his contention that the uss sitting down in meekness and silence under the german repudiation of every engagement she solemnly took with us as the initiatory power in the hague convention constitutes an unspeakable precedent and makes us a deplorable figure  meanwhile i find it a real uplifting privilege to live in an air so unterrorized as that of this country and to feel what confidence we insuperably feel in the big seagenius let alone the huge searesources of this people it is a great experience i mean the whole process of life here is noweven if it does so abound in tragedy and pity such as one can often scarcely face but there is too much of all that to sayand all i intended was to remark that while germany roars and runs amuck the new armies now at last ready are being oh so quietly transported across the diabolised channel the quiet and the steady going here amid the german vociferation is of itself an enormousi was going to say pleasure we have just heard from burgess of the arrival of his regiment at havrethey left the tower of london but a few days ago i go tomorrow to the protheros to help them with teaing a party of convalescent soldiers from hospitalmrs j g butcher like thousands or at least hundreds of other people sends her car on certain afternoons of the week to different hospitals for four of the bettering patientsor as many as will go into itand they are conveyed either to her house or to some other arranged with i have met sets of them thus several timesthe right people are wanted for them and nothing can be more interesting and admirable and verily charming than i mostly find them the last time the protheros had by mrs butchers car wounded belgiansbut tomorrow it is to be british whom i on the whole prefer though the belgians are more gravely pathetic the difficulty about them is that they are so apt to know only flemish and understand almost no frenchsave as one of them always included for the purpose can interpret i had today to luncheon a most decent and appreciative little sapper in the engineers whom i originally found in hospital and whose teeth i have been having done up for himat very reduced military rates there is nothing one isnt eager to do for them and their gratitude for small mercies excellent stuff as they are almost wrings the heart this obscure hero a great athlete in the running line is completely well again and goes in a day or two back to the front but oh how they dont like the hellishness of it that is beyond all conception and oh how they dont let this make any difference tremendously will the people by this wari mean by their patience of it and in ithave made good their place in the sun though even as one says that one recognizes still more how the upper classes in this country and the others have poured themselves unstintedly out the way society at large in england has magnificently played up will have given it i think it will be found a new lease of life however society in wars always does play upand it is by them and for them that the same are mostly made  feb 23rd again i had to go to bed but its all right and my letter wouldnt in any case have gone to you till tomorrows new york post meanwhile not much has happened thank heaven save that i went to tea with little fanny p and her five convalescents and that it was a very successful affair we plied them with edibles and torrents of the drinkable and they expanded as always and became interesting and moving in the warmth of civilization and sympathy those i had on either side of me at table were men of the old armyi mean who had been through the boer war and were therefore nigh upon forty and proportionately more soldatesques but there is nothing ever that one wouldnt do for any one of them they become at once such children of history such creatures of distinction   ever your affectionate  henry      to mrs wharton        mrs wharton writing to describe a journey she had made along part      of the french front had mentioned that a staffofficer at ste      menehould had read some of her books and had shown his      appreciation by facilitating her visit to verdun     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw march 5th 1915    dearest edith   how can i welcome and applaud enough your splendid thrilling letterin which though it gives me your whole spectacle and impression as unspeakably portentous i find you somehow of the very same heroic taille of whatever it was that gave the rest at the monstrous maximum i unutterably envy you these sights and suffered assaults of the maximacondemned as i am by doddering age and mean infirmity to the poor mesquins minima when really to find myself in closer touch would so fearfully interest and inspire and overwhelm me as one wants to be overwhelmed however since my ignoble portion is what it is the next best thing is to heap you on the altar of sacrifice and gloat over your overwhelmedness and demand of you to serve me still more and more of it on this i even insist now that i have tasted of your state and your substancefor your impression is rendered in a degree so vivid and touching that it all especially those vespers in the church with the tragic beds in the aisles wrings tears from my aged eyes what a hungry luxury to be able to come back with things and give them then and there straight into the aching voids do it do it my blest edith for all youre worth rather rathersauvez sauvez la france ah je la sauverais bien moi if i hadnt been ruined myself too soon ce que cest for you evidently to find yourself in these adventures like ouida the favourite reading of the military well as i say do keep in touch with your public i stupidly forgot to tell frederick to tell you not to dream of returning me those £6 0 0 all he would take but to regard them as the contribution i was really then in the very nick of sending to your belges so i wired you a day or two ago to that effect after too much woolgathering and to anticipate absolutely any restitution it made it so easy a sending well then à bientôtoliver shamelessly not asks but howls for more yours all devotedlier than ever   henry james      to the hon evan charteris    21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw march 13th 1915    my dear evan   your letter is of such interest and beauty that i must thank you for it at once little idea can you have of how the sense of your whereabouts your visions impressions and contacts thrills me and makes me wonder enriches and excites my poor little private life in short you affect me as gulping down great mugfuls of experience while i am sipping that compound out of a liqueurglass not a quarter full the only thing i can say to myself is that i can live too thank god by my friends experience when i hang about them in imagination as you must take it from me that i do about you you help me greatly to do so with your account of the soupless return of hospitality to your kind french harbourers that you had been bringingoffand this in particular by your mention of the admirable aspects they and all who around you are like them present to your intelligent english eyes i rejoice in all expressions and testimonies about the french wonderful and genial race all generous appreciation of the way they are carrying themselves now seems to me of the highest international value and importance and frankly i wish more of that found its way into our newspapers here so prodigiously even if erratically copious about our own doings we ought to commend and commemorate and celebrate themour allies doingsmore publicly and explicitlybut the want of imagination hereabouts save as to that ofto the report ofgrand things that havent happened is often almost a painful impression i find myself really wondering whether people can do without it succeed without it as much as that one meets constant examples of a sort of unpenetrated state which disconcert and rather alarm however these remarks are but the fruit of the fact that something stirs in me ever so deeply and gratefully almost to the point of a pang at all rendering of justice and homage to the children of france go on being charming and responsive to themit will do us good as well as do them i am sure their your particular guests enjoyment of your agitated dinner was exquisite  very interesting not less your picture of the blest irreflection and absence of morbid analysis in which you are livingin face of all the possibilities and wondrous enough surely must be all the changes and lapses of importance and value of sensibility itself the difference of your relation to things and the drop out of some relations altogether but i catch in your remarks the silver thread of optimism not bulging out but subtly gleaming and it gives me no end of satisfaction a few gleams have lately been coming to me otherwise and the action of neuve chapelle if i may rashly name it which we have reports of in the papers is i suppose the one you speak of as cheering the great thing we do in london however is to strain our ears for the thunder of the dardanelles which we even feel that we get pretty straight and pretty strong and in which we see consequences the most tremendous verily beyond all present utterance nothing in all the war has made me hang on it in such suspensethough we venture even almost to presume i see few peopleand try to see only those i positively want to whom par exemple i value the exchange of earnest remarks with more than ever but i am illconditioned for telling you thingsand indeed i should think meanly of london if there was very much to tell a few nights ago i dined with mervyn ogorman my rather near neighbour here and met a youngish and exceedingly interesting in fact charming colonel brancker just back from the frontboth of which high aeronautic experts you probably know i mention them because i extracted from them so intense a thrilldrawing them outfor they let meon the subject of the so more and more revealed affinity of the british temperament with that of the conquering airmanand thereby of the extent to which the military or the energetic future of this country may be in the air they put it so splendidly that i went home unspeakably rejoicing it may mean so much and as if myself ponderously soaring but what am i ridiculously remarking to you the great point i wish to make is the lively welcome i shall give you in aprilthank you for that knowledge and that i am allfaithfully yours   henry james      to mrs wharton   dictated   21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw  march 23rd 1915    chère madame et confrère   dont imagine for a moment that i dont feel the full horror of my having had to wait till now when i can avail myself of this aid to acknowledge as the poor pale pettifogging term has it the receipt from you of inexpressibly splendid bounties i wont attempt to explain or expatiateabout this abject failure of utterance the idea of explaining anything to you in these days or of any expatiation that isnt exclusively that of your own genius upon your own adventures and impressions i think the reason why i have been so baffled in a word is that all my powers of being anything else have gone to living upon your two magnificent letters the one from verdun and the one after your second visit there which gave me matter of experience and appropriation to which i have done the fullest honour your whole record is sublime and the interest and the beauty and the terror of it all have again and again called me back to it i have ventured to share it for the good of the cause and the glory of the connection mine with two or three select othersthis i candidly confess to youone of whom was dear howard absolutely as dear as ever through everything and whom i all but reduced to floods of tears tears of understanding and sympathy i know them at last your incomparable pages by heartand thus it is really that i feel qualified to speak to you of them with the two sublimities in question or between them came of course also the couple of other favours enclosing me pressing back upon me my attempted contribution to your paris labour to which perversity i have had to bow my head i was very sorry to be so forced but even while cursing and gnashing my teeth i got your postoffice order cashed and the money is god knows assistingly spendable here another pang was your mention of jean du breuils death i didnt know him had never seen him but your account of the admirable manner of his end makes one feel that one would like even to have just beheld him we are in the midst the very midst of histories of that sort miserable and terrible here too the neuve chapelle business from a strange in the sense of being a pretty false glamour at first flung about which we are gradually recovering seems to have taken a hideous toll of officers and other distressing legends legends of mistake and confusion are somehow overgrowing it too but painful particulars are not what i want to give youof anything you are up to your neck in your own and i had much rather pick my steps to the clear places so far as there be any such i continue to try and keep my own existence one so far as i maya place clear of the last accablement i mean apparently what it comes to is that its full up with the last but one  wednesday 24th i had to break this off yesterdayand it was time apparently with the rather dreary note i was sounding though i dont know that i have a very larky one to go on with todaysave so far as the taking of the big austrian fortress which i can neither write nor pronounce makes one a little soar and sing this seems really to represent something but how much i put forth not the slightest pretension to measure in fact i think i am not measuring anything whatever just now and not pretending toi find myself much more quite consentingly dumb in the presence of the boundless enormity and when i wish to give myself the best possible account of this state of mind i call it the pious attitude of waiting verily there is much to wait forbut there i am at it again and should blush to offer you in the midst of what i believe to be your more grandly attuned state such a pale apology for a living faith probably all thats the matter with one is ones vicious propensity to go on feeling more and more instead of less and lesswhich would be so infinitely more convenient for the former course puts one really quite out of relation to almost everybody else and causes one to circle helplessly round outer social edges like a kind of prowling pariah however i try to be as stupid as i can  all the while with this i am not expressing my deep appreciation of your generous remarks about again placing frederick at my disposition i am doing perfectly well in these conditions without a servant my life is so simplified that all acuteness of need has been abated in short i manageand it is of course fortunate inasmuch as the question would otherwise not be at all practically soluble no young man of military age would i for a moment considerand in fact there are none about putting aside the physically inapt for the armyand these are kept tight hold of by those who can use them small boys and aged men are alone availablebut the matter has in short not the least importance the thing that most assuages me continues to be dealing with the wounded in such scant measure as i may such eg as my having turned into victoria station yesterday afternoon to buy an evening paper and there been so struck with the bad lameness of a poor hobbling khaki convalescent that i inquired of him to such sympathetic effect that by what i can make out i must have committed myself to the support of him for the remainder of his daysa trifle on account having sealed the compact on the spot it all helps howeverhelps me which is so much what i do it for let it help you by ricochet even a little too  goodbye for now and believe me less gracelessly and faithlessly than you might well your wouldbe so decent old   henry james      to thomas sergeant perry   dictated   21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw march 27th 1915    my dear thomas and my dear lilla   dont resent please the economic form of this address the frugal attempt to make one grateful acknowledgment serve for both of you for i think that if you were just now on this scene itself there isnt a shade of anxious simplification that you wouldnt at once perfectly grasp the effect of the biggest and most appalling complication the world has ever known is somehow paradoxically as we used to say at newport an effect of simplification tooproducing that is a desperate need for the same in all sorts of ways lest one be submerged by the monster of a myriad bristles in short you do understand of course and how it is that i should be invidiously writing to you lilla in response to your refreshing favour of some little time since the good one about your having shrieked rule britannia at somebodys lecture or at least done something quite as vociferous and to the point and quite as helpful to our sacred cause this exclusive benefit should you be enjoying i say hadnt a most beneficial letter from thomas come to me but yesterday crowning the edifice of a series of suchlike bounties which he has been so patient over my poor old inevitable silence about  you inflame me so scarcely less thomas with your wonderful statistics of the american theatre of my infancy à propos of my printed prattle about it that i could almost find it in me to inquire from what published source it is you recover the ghostly little facts are they presented in some procurable volume that would be possible to send me i ask with a queer dim feeling that they might or the fingered volume might operate as a blest little diversion from our eternal obsession here i have reached the point now after eight months of that oppression of cultivating small arts of escape small plunges into oblivion and dissimulation in fact i am able to read againfor ever so long this power was almost blightedand to want to become as dissociated as possible from the present  however i didnt mean to be blackbut only pearly grey as your letter so benevolently incites yours too lilla for i keep you together in all this and i dont you see pretend to treat you to any scrap of information whateveryou have more of the public of a hundred sorts than we i guess and the private mostly turns out in these parts to go but on one leg after the first fond glimpse of it i lunched yesterday with the prime minister on the chance of catching some gleam between the chinkswhich was idiotic of me because its mostly in those circles that the chinks are well puttied over the nearest i came to any such was through my being told by a member of the pms family whom i wouldnt enable you to identify for the world that she had heard him just before luncheon say to three or four members of the government and even cabinet gathered at the house that somethingorother was the most awkward situation he had ever found himself up against with the comment that she my informant was in liveliest suspense to know what it was he had alluded to in those portentous terms which i give however but as a specimen of the bouché chink not of the gaping the admirable as i think him quite affectionately think him master of the situation having presently joined us in the most unmistakeable serenity of strength and cheer and the riddle remaining at any rate without the least pretence of or for that matter need of a key it will be a hundred years old by the time my small anecdote reaches you and not have le moindre rapport to anything that in the least concerns us then but i must tear myself from you and try withal to close on some sublime notea large choice of which sort i feel we are for that matter perfectly possessed of well then a friend of much veracity told me a couple of days since that a friend of his i admit that its always a friend of somebody elses an officer of the upper command just over for a couple of days from the front had spoken to him of the now enormous mass of the french and british troops fronting the enemy as covering in dense gatheredness together 40 miles of the land of francei dont mean in length of front of course which would be nothing but in rearward extent and just standing so to speak in closepacked available spatial presence but there i am at an itemand i abjure items they defy all dealing with and am your affectionate old   henry james      to edward marsh        a copy of this letter was sent by mr marsh to rupert brooke then      with the dardanelles expeditionary force it reached him two days      before his death the letter refers of course to his 1914      sonnets the line criticised in the first sonnet is and the worst      friend and enemy is but death     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw march 28th 1915    dear admirable eddie   i take it very kindly indeed of you to have found thought and time to send me the publication with the five brave sonnets the circumstances so to call the unspeakable matter that have conduced to them and that taken together seem to make a sort of huge brazen lap for their congruous beauty have caused me to read them with an emotion that somehow precludes the critical measure deprecates the detachment involved in that and makes me just wantoh so exceedingly muchto be moved by them and to like and admire them so i do greet them gladly and am right consentingly struck with their happy force and truth they seem to me to have come in a fine high beauty and sincerity though not in every line with an equal degree of thosewhich indeed is a rare case anywhere and this evening alone by my lamp i have been reading them over and over to myself aloud as if fondly to test and truly to try them almost in fact as if to reach the faroff author in whatever unimaginable conditions by some miraculous some telepathic intimation that i am in quavering communion with him well they have borne the test with almost all the firm perfection or straight inevitability that one must find in a sonnet and beside their poetic strength they draw a wondrous weight from his having had the right to produce them as it were and their rising out of such rare realities of experience splendid rupertto be the soldier that could beget them on the muse and lucky muse not less who could have an affair with a soldier and yet feel herself not guilty of the least deviation in order of felicity i think sonnet i comes first save for a small matter that perhaps superfluously troubles me and that i will presently speak of i place next iii with its splendid first line and then v in that rich earth a richer dust concealed and then ii i dont speak of no ivi think it the least fortunate in spite of touched flowers and furs and cheeks but the four happy ones are very noble and sound and round to my sense and i take off my hat to them and to their author in the most marked manner there are many things one likes simply and then there are things one likes to like or at least that i do and these are of that order my reserve on no i bears on the last lineto the extent i mean of not feeling happy about that but before the last word it may be fatuous but i am wondering if this line mightnt have acquitted itself better as and the worst friend and foe is only death there is an only in the preceding line but the repetition isor would beto me not only not objectionable but would have positive merit my only other wince is over the given and heaven rhyme at the end of v it has been so inordinately vulgarized that i dont think it good enough company for the rest of the sonnet which without it i think i would have put second in order instead of the iii the kind of idea it embodies is one that always so fetches this poor old anglomaniac but that is alland this my dear eddie is all dont dream of acknowledging these remarks in all your strain and stressthat you should think i could bear that would fill me with horror the only sign i want is that if you should be able to write to rupert which i dont doubt you on occasion manage you would tell him of my pleasure and my pride if he should be at all touched by this it would infinitely touch me in fact should you care to send him on this sprawl that would save you other trouble and i would risk his impatience i think of him quite inordinately and not less so of you my dear eddie and am yours all faithfully and gratefully   henry james   ps i have been again reading out v to myself i read them very well and find i dont so much mind that blighted balance     to edward marsh    21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw march 30th 1915    my dear eddie   after my acknowledgment of the beautiful things had gone to you came in your note and now your quite blessed letter so i call it because it testified to my having so happily given you that particular pleasure which is the finest i think one can feelthe joy in short that you allude to and that i myself rejoice in your taking splendid rupert indeedand splendid you in the generosity of your emotion  i had stupidly overlooked that preliminary lyric with its so charming climax of an image but i thinkif you wont feel me overcontentious for itthat your reasoning à propos of heaven given c rather halts as to the matter of rhyme and sense or in other words sense and poetic expression note well that poetically speaking its not the sense thats the expression the rhyme or whatever but those things that are the sense and that they so far betray it when they find for the only words any but the ideally right or the so to speak quietly proud however i didnt mean to plunge into these depthsthere are too many other depths now i only meant to tell you how i participate and to be yours in this all faithfully   henry james      to mrs wharton        lieut jean du breuil de st germain distinguished cavalry      officer sociologist traveller was killed in action near arras      february 22 1915     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw april 3rd 1915    dearest edith   bounties unacknowledged and unmeasured continue to flow in from you for this am after your beautiful letter enclosing your copy of m séguiers so extraordinarily fine and touching one arrive your two livraisons of the revue containing the dixmude of which you wrote me it is quite heartbreakingly noble of you to find initiative for the rendering and the remembering of such services and such assurances for i myself gaze at almost any display of initiative as i should stare at a passing charge of cavalry down the brompton roadwhere we havent come to that yet though we may for one reason and another indeed soon have to one is surrounded in fact here with more affirmations of energy than you might gather from some of the accounts of matters that appear in the times and yet the paralysis of my own power to do anything but increasingly and inordinately feel feel in a way to make communication with almost all others impossible they living and thinking in such different termsand yet that paralysis disje more and more swallows up everything but the sore and sterile unresting imagination i cant proceed upon it after your sublime fashionand in fact its aching life is a practical destruction of every other sort which is why i call it sterile but the extent all the same to which one will have inwardly and darkly and drearily and dreadfully livedwith those victims of nervous horror in the ambulancechurch the little chanting country church of the deadly serried beds of your verdun letter and those others the lacerated and untended in the fetid stableheat of the other place and the second letterall of whom live with me and haunt and inhibit me and so does your friend du breuil and his friend your admirable correspondent in what a nobleness and blest adequacy of expression their feeling finds reliefand this in spite of my having neither known nor seen either of them séguier creating in one to positive sickness the personal pang about your friend and his and his letter making me feel the horror it does himself even as if my affection had something at stake in that but i dont know why i treat you thus to the detail of ones perpetuallyrenewed waste you will have plenty of detail of your own little waste as i see you allowing yourself  i havent yet had the hour of reading your dixmudes which i am momentarily reserving under some other pressure but they shall not miss my fond careso little has any face of the nightmare been reflected for me in any form of beauty as yet your verdun letter excepted this keeps making mere bluebooks and yellowbooks and rapports the only reading that isnt or that hasnt been below the level through their not pretending to express but only giving one the material as it happens when your revues came i was reading georges ohnet and in one of the three fascicules of his bourgeois de paris that have alone as yet turned up here and reading him ma foi with deep submission to his spell funny enough to be redevable at this time of day to that genius who has come down from the cross where poor vanquished jules lemaître long ago nailed him up as if to work fresh miracles dancing for it on juless very grave but he is in fact extraordinarily vivid and candid and amusing with the force of an angry little hunchback and a perfect and quite gratifying vulgarity of passion also probably with a perfect enormity of ventein which one takes pleasure  easter has operated to clear london in something like the fine old waywe would really seem to stick so much to our fine old ways i dont truly know what to make of some of themand yet dont let yourself suppose from some of such appearances that the stiffness and toughness of the country isnt on the whole deeper than anything else such at least is my own indefeasible convictionor impression its the queerest of peopleswith its merits and defects so extraordinarily parts of each other its wantonness of refusalsin some of these present wayssuch a part of its attachment to freedom of the individualism which makes its force that of a collection of individuals and its voluntaryism of such a strong quality but it wont be the defects it will be the merits i believe that will have the last word strange that the country should need a still bigger convulsionfor itself it does however and it will get itand will act under it france has had hers in the form of invasionand i dont know of what form ours will yet have to be but it will comeand then we shalldamp and dense but not vicious not vicious enough and immensely capable if we can once get dry voilà that i am however yet with it so yours   h j      to edward marsh        rupert brooke died on a french hospitalship in the aegean sea      april 28 1915 while serving with the royal naval division     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw april 24th 1915    my dear dear eddie   this is too horrible and heartbreaking if there was a stupid and hideous disfigurement of life and outrage to beauty left for our awful conditions to perpetrate those things have been now supremely achieved and no other brutal blow in the private sphere can better them for making one just stare through ones tears one had thought of ones self as advised and stiffened as to what was possible but one sees or at least i feel how sneakingly one had clung to the idea of the happy the favouring hazard the dream of what still might be for the days to come but why do i speak of my pang as if it had a right to breathe in presence of yourswhich makes me think of you with the last tenderness of understanding i value extraordinarily having seen him here in the happiest way in downing st c two or three times before he left england and i measure by that the treasure of your own memories and the dead weight of your own loss what a price and a refinement of beauty and poetry it gives to those splendid sonnetswhich will enrich our whole collective consciousness we must speak further and better but meanwhile all my impulse is to tell you to entertain the pang and taste the bitterness for all they are worthto know to the fullest extent what has happened to you and not miss one of the hard ways in which it will come home you wont have again any relation of that beauty wont know again that mixture of the elements that made him and he was the breathing beneficent manand now turned to this but theres something to keep toohis legend and his image will hold believe by how much i am my dear eddie more than ever yours   henry james      to g w prothero    21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw april 24th 1915    dear george   i cant not thank you for your interesting remittances the one about the salubrity of the soldier perhaps in particular that paper is indeed an admirable statement of what one is mainly struck withthe only at all consoling thing in all the actual horror namely the splendid personal condition of the khakiclad as they overflow the town it represents a kind of physical redemptionand that is something is much so long as the individual case of it lasts  as for the president he is really looking up i feel as if it kind of made everything else do so it does at any rate your allfaithful old   henry james      to wilfred sheridan    21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw may 31st 1915    my dear dear wilfred   i have been hearing from clare and margaret and writing to themwith the effect on my feelings so great that even if i hadnt got their leave to address you thus directly and their impression that you would probably have patience with me i should still be perpetrating this act from the simple force ofwell let me say of fond affection and have done with it i really take as much interest in your movements and doings in all your conditions as if i were margaret herselfsuch great analogies prevail between the heavy uncle and the infant daughter when following their object up is concerned i havent kept my thoughts off you at allnot indeed that i have triedsince those days early in the winter in that little london house where you were so admirably interesting and vivid about your first initiations and impressions and i pressed you so hard over the whole ground and didnt know whether most to feel your acute intelligence at play or your kindness to your poor old gaping visitor ive neglected no opportunity of news of you since then though ive picked the article up in every and any way save by writing to youwhich my respect for your worried attention and general overstrain forbade me to regard as a decent act at the same time when i heard of your having at crowborough or wherever a sharp illness of some duration i turned really sick myself for sympathyi couldnt see the faintest propriety in that and now my sentiments hover about you with the closest fidelity and when i think of the stiff experience and all the strange initiations so to express my sense of them that must have crowded upon you i am lost in awe at the vision for youre the kind of defender of his country to whom i take off my hat most abjectly and utterlythe thinking feeling refining hero who knows and compares and winces and overcomes and on whose lips i promise myself one of these days to hang again with a gape even beyond that of last winter i wish to goodness i could do something more and better for you than merely address you these vain words however they wont hurt you at least for they carry with them an intensity of good will i wont pretend to give you any news for its you who make all oursand we are now really in the way i think of doing everything conceivable to back you up in that and thereby become worthy of you america my huge queer country is being flouted by germany in a manner that looks more and more like a malignant design and if this should very soon truly appear and that weight of consequent prodigious resentment should be able to do nothing else than throw itself into the scale then we should be backing you up to some purpose the weight would in one way and another be overwhelming but these are vast issues and i have only wanted to give you for the moment my devotedest personal blessing think of me as in the closest sustaining communion with clare and dont for a moment dream that i proposei mean presumeto lay upon you the smallest burden of notice of the present beyond just letting it remind you of the fond faith of yours my dear wilfred all affectionately   henry james      to edward marsh        the volume sent by mr marsh was rupert brookes 1914 and other      poems     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw june 6th 1915    dearest eddie   i thank you ever so kindly for this advance copy of ruperts volume which you were right and blest in feeling that i should intensely prize i have been spending unspeakable hours over itheartbreaking ones under the sense of the stupid extinction of so exquisite an instrument and so exquisite a being immense the generosity of his response to life and the beauty and variety of the forms in which it broke out and of which these further things are such an enriching exhibition his place is now very high and very safeeven though one walks round and round it with the aching soreness of having to take the monument for the man its so wretched talking really of any place but his place with us and in our eyes and affection most of all the other being such as could wait and grow with all confidence and power while waiting he has something at any rate one feels in this volume that puts him singularly apart even in his eminencethe fact that member of the true high company as he is and poet of the strong wings for he seems to me extraordinarily strong he has charm in a way of a kind that belong to none of the others who have their beauty and abundance their distinction and force and grace whatever it may be but havent that particular thing as he has it and as he was going to keep on having it since it was of his very natureby which i mean that of his genius the point is that i think he would still have had it even if he had grown bigger and bigger and stronger and stronger for this is what he would have done and thereby been almost alone in this idiosyncrasy even of keats i dont feel myself saying that he had charmits all lost in the degree of beauty which somehow allows it no chance but in rupert not that i match them there is the beauty so great and then the charm different and playing beside it and savouring of the very quality of the man what it comes to i suppose is that he touches me most when he is whimsical and personal even at the poetic pitch or in the poetic purity as he perpetually is and he penetrates me most when he is most hauntingly or hauntedly englishhe draws such a real magic from his conscious reference to it he is extraordinarily so even in the war sonnetsnot that that isnt highly natural too and the reading of these higher things over now which one had first read while he was still there to be exquisitely at stake in them so to speak is a sort of refinement both of admiration and of anguish the present gives them such sincerityas if they had wanted it i adore the ironic and familiar things the most intimately englishthe chilterns and the great lover towards the close of which i recognise the misprint you speak of but fortunately so obvious a onethe more flagrant the betterthat you neednt worry and the funeral of youth awfully charming and of course grantchester which is booked for immortality i revel in grantchesterand how it would have made one love him if one hadnt known him as it is it wrings the heart and yet after all what do they do all of them together but again express how life had been wonderful and crowded and fortunate and exquisite for himwith his sensibilities all so exposed really exposed and yet never taking the least real harm he seems to me to have had in his short life so much that one may almost call it everything and he isnt tragic nowhe has only stopped its we who are tragicyou and his mother especially and whatever others for we cant stop and we wish we could the portrait has extreme beauty but is somehow disconnected however great beauty does disconnect but goodnightwith the lively sense that i must see you again before i leave townwhich wont be though before early in july i hope you are having less particular strain and stress and am yours all faithfully   henry james      to edward marsh        this refers to a photograph of rupert brooke sent by mr marsh      and to the death of his friend denis browne who was with r b      when he died a letter from browne describing rupert brookes      burial on the island of scyros had been read to h j by mr marsh      the day before the following was written     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw june 13th 1915    dearest eddie   the photograph is wonderful and beautifuland a mockery i mean encompassed with such an ache and such a pang that it sets up for ones vision a regularly accepted unabated pain and now you have another of like sort the fruit of this horrible timewhich i presume almost to share with you as a sign of the tenderness i bear you i wish indeed that for this i might once have seen d b kind brothering d b the reading by you of whose letter last night under the pang of his extinction the ghost telling of the ghost moved me more than i could find words for he brothered you almost as much as he had brothered rupertand i could almost feel that he practically a little brothered poor old me for which i so thank his spirit and this now the end of his brothering of anything more in his later letter that had any relation you will perhaps still some day tell me   yours all faithfully  henry james      to compton mackenzie        mr mackenzie was at this time attached to sir ian hamiltons      headquarters with the dardanelles expeditionary force     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw june 18th 1915    my dear monty   all this while have i remained shamefully in your debt for interesting news and i am plunged deeper into that condition by your admirable report from the dardanelles in this ams times i am a backward being alas in these days when so much is forward our public anxieties somehow strike for me at the roots of letterwriting and i remain too often dumb not because i am not thinking and feeling a thousand things but exactly because i am doing so to such intensity you wrote me weeks ago that you had finished your new novelwhich information took my breath away i mean by its windlike rushand now has come thus much of the remainder of the adventure for which that so grandly liberated you and which i follow with the liveliest participation in all your splendid sense of it and profit of it i confess i take an enormous pleasure in the fact of the exposure of the sensitive plate of your imagination your tremendous attention to all these wonderful and terrible things what impressions you are getting verilyand what a breach must it all not make with the course of history you are practising up to the very eve i rejoice that you finished and snipped off or tucked in and wound up something selfcontained therefor how could you ever go back to it if you hadntunder that violence of rupture with the past which makes me ask myself what will have become of all that material we were taking for granted and which now lies there behind us like some vast damaged cargo dumped upon a dock and unfit for human purchase or consumption i seem to fear that i shall find myself seeing your recently concluded novel as through a glass darklywhich however will not prevent my immediately falling upon it when it appears as i assume however that it is not now likely to do before the summers endby which time god knows what other monstrous chapters of history wont have been perpetrated what i most want to say to you i think is that i rejoice for you with all my heart in that assurance of health which has enabled you so to gird yourself and go forth if the torrid south has always been good for you there must be no amount of it that you are now not gettingthough i am naturally reduced you see to quite abjectly helpless and incompetent supposition i hang about you at any rate with all sorts of vows and benedictions i feel that i mustnt make remarks about the colossal undertaking you are engaged in beyond saying that i believe with all my heart in the final power of your push as for our news here the gist of that is that we are living with our eyes on you and more and more materially backing you my comment on you is feeble but my faith absolute and i am my dear monty your more than ever faithful old   henry james   ps i have your address of many integuments from your mother but feel rather that my mountain of envelopes should give birth to a livelier mouse     to henry james junior   dictated   21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw june 24th 1915    dearest harry   i am writing to you in this fashion even although i am writing you intimately because i am not at the present moment in very good form for any free play of hand and this machinery helps me so much when there is any question of pressure and promptitude or above all of particular clearness that is the case at presentat least i feel i ought to lose no more time  you will wonder what these rather portentous words refer tobut dont be too much alarmed it is only that my feeling about my situation here has under the stress of events come so much to a head that certain particular matters further contributing i have arranged to seek technical legal advice no longer hence than this afternoon as to the exact modus operandi of my becoming naturalised in this country this state of mind probably wont at all surprise you however and i think i can assure you that it certainly wouldnt if you were now on the scene here with me and had the near vision of all the circumstances my sense of how everything more and more makes for it has been gathering force ever since the war broke out and i have thus waited nearly a whole year but my feeling has become acute with the information that i can only go down to lamb house now on the footing of an alien under police supervisionan alien friend of course which is a very different thing from an alien enemy but still a definite technical outsider to the whole situation here in which my affections and my loyalty are so intensely engaged i feel that if i take this step i shall simply rectify a position that has become inconveniently and uncomfortably false making my civil status merely agree not only with my moral but with my material as well in every kind of way hadnt it been for the war i should certainly have gone on as i was taking it as the simplest and easiest and even friendliest thing but the circumstances are utterly altered now and to feel with the country and the cause as absolutely and ardently as i feel and not offer them my moral support with a perfect consistency my material is too small a matter affects me as standing off or wandering loose in a detachment of no great dignity i have spent here all the best years of my lifethey practically have been my life about a twelvemonth hence i shall have been domiciled uninterruptedly in england for forty years and there is not the least possibility at my age and in my state of health of my ever returning to the us or taking up any relation with it as a country my practical relation has been to this one for ever so long and now my spiritual or sentimental quite ideally matches it i am telling you all this because i cant not want exceedingly to take you into my confidence about itbut again i feel pretty certain that you will understand me too well for any great number of words more to be needed the real truth is that in a matter of this kind under such extraordinarily special circumstances ones own intimate feeling must speak and determine the case well without haste and without rest mine has done so and with the prospect of what i have called the rectification a sense of great relief a great lapse of awkwardness supervenes  i think that even if by chance your so judicious mind should be disposed to suggest any reservesi think i say that i should then still ask you not to launch them at me unless they should seem to you so important as to balance against my own argument and frankly speaking my own absolute need and passion here which the whole experience of the past year has made quite unspeakably final i cant imagine at all what these objections should be howevermy whole long relation to the country having been what it is regard my proceeding as a simple act and offering of allegiance and devotion recognition and gratitude for long years of innumerable relations that have meant so much to me and it remains perfectly simple let me repeat that i feel sure i shouldnt in the least have come to it without this convulsion but one is in the convulsion i wouldnt be out of it either and one must act accordingly i feel all the while too that the tide of american identity of consciousness with our own about the whole matter rises and rises and will rise still more before it rests againso that every day the difference of situation diminishes and the immense fund of common sentiment increases however i havent really meant so much to expatiate what i am doing this afternoon is i think simply to get exact informationthough i am already sufficiently aware of the question to know that after my long existence here the process of naturalisation is very simple and short my last word about the matter at any rate has to be that my decision is absolutely tied up with my innermost personal feeling i think that will only make you glad however and i add nothing more now but that i am your allaffectionate old uncle   henry james      to edmund gosse        h js four sponsors at his naturalisation were mr asquith mr      gosse mr j b pinker and mr g w prothero     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw june 25th 1915    my dear gosse   remarkably enough i should be writing you this evening even if i hadnt received your interesting information about  concerning whom nothing perversely base and publicly pernicious at all surprises me he is the cleverest idiot and the most pernicious talent imaginable and i await to see if he wont somehow swing  but il ne sagit pas de ça il sagit of the fact that there is a matter i should have liked to speak to you of the other day when you lunched here yet hung fire about through its not having then absolutely come to a head it has within these days done so and in brief it is this the force of the public situation now at last determines me to testify to my attachment to this country my fond domicile for nearly forty years forty next year by applying for naturalisation here the throwing of my imponderable moral weight into the scale of her fortune is the geste that will best express my devotionabsolutely nothing else will therefore my mind is made up and you are the first person save my solicitor whom i have had to consult to whom the fact has been imparted kindly respect for the moment the privacy of it i learned with horror just lately that if i go down into sussex for two or three months of rye i have at once to register myself there as an alien and place myself under the observation of the police but that is only the occasion of my decisionits not in the least the cause the disposition itself has haunted me as wordsworths sounding cataract haunted himlike a passionever since the beginning of the war but the point please is this that the process for me is really of the simplest and may be very rapid if i can obtain four honourable householders to testify to their knowledge of me as a respectable person speaking and writing english decently etc will you give me the great pleasure of being one of themsigning a paper to that effect i should take it ever so kindly and i should further take kindly your giving me if possible your sense on this delicate point should you say that our admirable friend the prime minister would perhaps be approachable by me as another of the signatory fourto whom you see great historic honour not to say immortality as my sponsors will accrue i dont like to approach him without your so qualified sense of the matter firstand he has always been so beautifully kind and charming to me i will do nothing till i hear from youbut his signature which my solicitors representative if not himself would simply wait upon him for would enormously accelerate the putting through of the application and the disburdening me of the sussex restricted area alienshipwhich it distresses me to carry on my back a day longer than i need i have in mind my other two sponsors but if i could have from you in addition to your own personal response on which my hopes are so founded your ingenious prefiguration fed by your intimacy with him as to how the pm would take my appeal you would increase the obligations of yours all faithfully   henry james      to j b pinker        the two articles here referred to the long wards and within the      rim were both eventually devoted to charitable purposes     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw june 29th 1915    my dear pinker   i am glad to hear from you of the conditions in which the new york tribune representative thinks there will be no difficulty over the fee for the article i have in point of fact during the last three or four days considerably written oneconcerning which a question comes up which i hope you wont think too tiresome making up my mind that something as concrete and human as possible would be my best card to play i have done something about the british soldier his aspect temper and tone and the considerations he suggests as i have seen him since the beginning of the war in hospital where i have in fact largely and constantly seen him the theme lends itself by my sense much and i dare say i should have it rather to myselfthough of course there is no telling but what i have been feeling in the connectionhaving now done upwards of 3000 wordsis that i should be very grateful for leave to make them 4000 without of course extension of fee i have never been good for the mere snippet and there is so much to say and to feel would you mind asking her in reporting to her of what my subject is whether this extra thousand would incommode them if she really objects to it i think i shall be then disposed to ask you to make some other application of my little paper on the 4000 basis in which case i should propose to the tribune another idea keeping it down absolutely to the 3000 im afraid i cant do less than that my motive would probably in that case be a quite different and less concrete thing namely the expression of my sense of the way the briton in general feels about his insulation and his being in it and of it even through all this unprecedented stress it would amount to a statement or picture of his sense of the way his seagenius has always encircled and protected him striking deep into his blood and his bones so that any reconsideration of his position in a new light inevitably comes hard to him and yet makes the process the effective development of which it is interesting to watch i should call this thing something like the new vision or better still simply insulation though i dont say exactly that at all events i should be able to make something interesting of it and it would of course inevitably take the sympathetic turn but i would rather keep to the thing i have been trying if i may have the small extra space   believe me yours ever  henry james      to frederic harrison    21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw july 3rd 1915    my dear frederic harrison   i think your so interesting letter of the other day most kind and generousit has greatly touched me mrs harrison had written me a short time before even more movingly and with equal liberality and i feel my belated remembrance of you magnificently recognised this has been a most healing fact for me in a lacerated world how splendid your courage and activity and power so continued of production and attention i am sorry to say i find any such power in myself much impaired and diminishedreduced to the shadow of what it once was all relations are dislocated and harmonies falsified and one asks ones self of what use in such a general condition is any direction of the mind save straight to the thing that most and only matters however it all comes back to that and one does what one can because its a part of virtue also i find one is the better for every successful effort to bring ones attention home i have just read your english review of lord eversleys book on poland which you have made me desire at once to get and readeven though your vivid summary makes me also falter before the hideous old tragedy over which the actual horrors are being reembroidered i thank you further for letting me know of your paper in the aberdeen magazinethough on reflection i can wait for it if its to be included in your volume now so soon to appeari shall so straightly possess myself of that as to the usa i am afraid i suffer almost more than i can endure from the terms of precautionary friendship on which my country is content to remain with the author of such systematic abominationsi cover my head with my mantle in presence of so much wordy amicable discussing and conversing and reassuring and postponing all the while that such hideous evil and cruelty rages to drag into our european miseries any nation that is so fortunate as to be out of them and able to remain out with common selfrespect would be a deplorable wishbut that holds true but up to a certain line of compromise i cant help feeling that for the us this line has been crossed and that they have themselves great dangers from the source of all ours to reckon with however one fortunately hasnt to decide the case or appoint the hourthe relation between the two countries affects me as being on a stiff downward slope at the bottom of which is rupture and everything that takes place between them renders that incline more rapid and shoves the position further down the material and moral weight that america would be able to throw into the scale by her productive and financial power strikes me as enormous there would be no question of munitions then what i mean is that i believe the truculence of germany may be trusted from one month or one week to another now to force the american hand it must indeed be helpful to both of you to breathe your fine air of the heights the atmosphere of london just now is not positively tonic but one must find a tone and i am with more faithful thought of mrs harrison than i can express your and her affectionate old friend   henry james      to h g wells        h j was always inclined to be impatient of the art of parody the      following refers to an example of it in mr wellss volume boon     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw july 6th 1915    my dear wells   i was given yesterday at a club your volume boon etc from a loose leaf in which i learn that you kindly sent it me and which yet appears to have lurked there for a considerable time undelivered i have just been reading to acknowledge it intelligently a considerable number of its pagesthough not all for to be perfectly frank i have been in that respect beaten for the first timeor rather for the first time but oneby a book of yours i havent found the current of it draw me on and on this timeas unfailingly and irresistibly before which i have repeatedly let you know however i shall try againi hate to lose any scrap of you that may make for light or pleasure and meanwhile i have more or less mastered your appreciation of h j which i have found very curious and interesting after a fashionthough it has naturally not filled me with a fond elation it is difficult of course for a writer to put himself fully in the place of another writer who finds him extraordinarily futile and void and who is moved to publish that to the worldand i think the case isnt easier when he happens to have enjoyed the other writer enormously from far back because there has then grown up the habit of taking some common meetingground between them for granted and the falling away of this is like the collapse of a bridge which made communication possible but i am by nature more in dread of any fools paradise or at least of any bad misguidedness than in love with the idea of a security proved and the fact that a mind as brilliant as yours can resolve me into such an unmitigated mistake cant enjoy me in anything like the degree in which i like to think i may be enjoyed makes me greatly want to fix myself for as long as my nerves will stand it with such a pair of eyes i am aware of certain things i have and not less conscious i believe of various others that i am simply reduced to wish i did or could have so i try for possible light to enter into the feelings of a critic for whom the deficiencies so preponderate the difficulty about that effort however is that one cant keep it upone has to fall back on ones sense of ones good partsones own sense and i at least should have to do that i think even if your picture were painted with a more searching brush for i should otherwise seem to forget what it is that my poetic and my appeal to experience rest upon they rest upon my measure of fulnessfulness of life and of the projection of it which seems to you such an emptiness of both i dont mean to say i dont wish i could do twenty things i cantmany of which you do so livingly but i confess i ask myself what would become in that case of some of those to which i am most addicted and by which interest seems to me most beautifully producible i hold that interest may be must be exquisitely made and created and that if we dont make it we who undertake to nobody and nothing will make it for us though nothing is more possible nothing may even be more certain than that my quest of it my constant wish to run it to earth may entail the sacrifice of certain things that are not on the straight line of it however there are too many things to say and i dont think your chapter is really inquiring enough to entitle you to expect all of them the fine thing about the fictional form to me is that it opens such widely different windows of attention but that is just why i like the window so to frame the play and the process   faithfully yours  henry james      to h g wells        with reference to the following letter mr wells kindly allows me      to quote a passage from his answer dated july 8 1915 to the      preceding  there is of course a real and very fundamental      difference in our innate and developed attitudes towards life and      literature to you literature like painting is an end to me      literature like architecture is a means it has a use your view      was i felt altogether too prominent in the world of criticism and      i assailed it in lines of harsh antagonism and writing that stuff      about you was the first escape i had from the obsession of this      war boon is just a wastepaper basket some of it was written      before i left my home at sandgate 1911 and it was while i was      turning over some old papers that i came upon it found it      expressive and went on with it last december i had rather be      called a journalist than an artist that is the essence of it and      there was no other antagonist possible than yourself but since it      was printed i have regretted a hundred times that i did not express      our profound and incurable difference and contrast with a better      grace in a further letter to henry james dated july 13 mr      wells adds i dont clearly understand your concluding      phraseswhich shews no doubt how completely they define our      difference when you say it is art that makes life makes      interest makes importance i can only read sense into it by      assuming that you are using art for every conscious human      activity i use the word for a research and attainment that is      technical and special    dictated   21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw july 10th 1915    my dear wells   i am bound to tell you that i dont think your letter makes out any sort of case for the bad manners of boon as far as your indulgence in them at the expense of your poor old h j is concernedi say your simply because he has been yours in the most liberal continual sacrificial the most admiring and abounding critical way ever since he began to know your writings as to which you have had copious testimony your comparison of the book to a wastebasket strikes me as the reverse of felicitous for what one throws into that receptacle is exactly what one doesnt commit to publicity and make the affirmation of ones estimate of ones contemporaries by i should liken it much rather to the preservative portfolio or drawer in which what is withheld from the basket is savingly laid away nor do i feel it anywhere evident that my view of life and literature or what you impute to me as such is carrying everything before it and becoming a public menaceso unaware do i seem on the contrary that my products constitute an example in any measurable degree followed or a cause in any degree successfully pleaded i cant but think that if this were the case i should find it somewhat attested in their circulationwhich alas i have reached a very advanced age in the entirely defeated hope of but i have no view of life and literature i maintain other than that our form of the latter in especial is admirable exactly by its range and variety its plasticity and liberality its fairly living on the sincere and shifting experience of the individual practitioner that is why i have always so admired your so free and strong application of it the particular rich receptacle of intelligences and impressions emptied out with an energy of its own that your genius constitutes and that is in particular why in my letter of two or three days since i pronounced it curious and interesting that you should find the case i constitute myself only ridiculous and vacuous to the extent of your having to proclaim your sense of it the curiosity and the interest however in this latter connection are of course for my mind those of the break of perception perception of the veracity of my variety on the part of a talent so generally inquiring and apprehensive as yours of course for myself i live live intensely and am fed by life and my value whatever it be is in my own kind of expression of that therefore i am pulled up to wonder by the fact that for you my kind my sort of sense of expression and sort of sense of life alike doesnt exist and that wonder is i admit a disconcerting comment on my idea of the various appreciability of our addiction to the novel and of all the personal and intellectual history sympathy and curiosity behind the given example of it it is when that history and curiosity have been determined in the way most different from my own that i want to get at themprecisely for the extension of life which is the novels best gift but that is another matter meanwhile i absolutely dissent from the claim that there are any differences whatever in the amenability to art of forms of literature aesthetically determined and hold your distinction between a form that is like painting and a form that is like architecture for wholly null and void there is no sense in which architecture is aesthetically for use that doesnt leave any other art whatever exactly as much so and so far from that of literature being irrelevant to the literary report upon life and to its being made as interesting as possible i regard it as relevant in a degree that leaves everything else behind it is art that makes life makes interest makes importance for our consideration and application of these things and i know of no substitute whatever for the force and beauty of its process if i were boon i should say that any pretence of such a substitute is helpless and hopeless humbug but i wouldnt be boon for the world and am only yours faithfully   henry james      to henry james junior    21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw july 20th 1915    dearest harry   how can i sufficiently tell you how moved to gratitude and appreciation i am by your good letter of july 9th just received and the ready understanding and sympathy expressed in which are such a blessing to me i did proceed after writing to you in the sense i then explainedthe impulse and the current were simply irresistible and the business has so happily developed that i this morning received with your letter the kindest possible one from the home secretary sir john simon i mean in the personal and private way telling me that he has just decreed the issue of my certificate of naturalisation which will at once take effect it will have thus been beautifully expedited have gone through in five or six days from the time my papers were sent in instead of the usual month or two he gives me his blessing on the matter and all is well it will probably interest you to know that the indispensability of my step to myself has done nothing but grow since i made my application like martin luther at wittenberg i could no other and the relief of feeling corrected an essential falsity in my position as determined by the war and what has happened since also more particularly what has not happened is greater than i can say i have testified to my long attachment here in the only way i couldthough i certainly shouldnt have done it under the inspiration of our cause if the usa had done it a little more for me then i should have thrown myself back on that and been content with it but as this at the end of a year hasnt taken place i have had to act for myself and i go so far as quite to think i hope not fatuously that i shall have set an example and shown a little something of the way but enoughthere it is   ever your affectionate old british uncle  henry james      to edmund gosse    21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw july 26th 1915    my dear gosse   your good letter makes me feel that you will be interested to know that since 430 this afternoon i have been able to say civis britannicus sum my certificate of naturalisation was received by my solicitor this am and a few hours ago i took the oath of allegiance in his office before a commissioner the odd thing is that nothing seems to have happened and that i dont feel a bit different so that i see not at all how associated i have become but that i was really too associated before for any nominal change to matter the process has only shown me what i virtually wasso that its rather disappointing in respect to acute sensation i havent any i blush to confess  i thank you enormously for your confidential passage which is most interesting and heartening and let me mention in exchange for your confidence that a friend told me this afternoon that he had been within a few days talking with  one of the american naval attachés whose competence he ranks high and to whom he had put some question relative to the naval sense of the condition of these islands to which the reply had been you may take it from me that england is absolutely impregnable and invincibleand  repeated overimpregnable and invincible which kind of did me good  let me come up and sit on your terrace some near august afternooni can always be rung up you know i like itand believe me yours and your wifes all faithfully   henry james      to john s sargent    21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw july 30th 1915    my dear john   i am delighted to hear from you that you are writing and sending to mrs wharton in the good sense you mention it will give her the greatest pleasure and count enormously for her undertaking  yes i daresay many americans will be shocked at my step so many of them appear in these days to be shocked at everything that is not a reiterated blandishment and slobberation of germany with recalls of ancient amity and that sort of thing by our government i waited long months watch in hand for the latter to show some sign of intermitting these amiabilities to such an enemythe very smallest would have sufficed for me to throw myself back upon it but it seemed never to come and the misrepresentation of my attitude becoming at last to me a thing no longer to be borne i took action myself it would really have been so easy for the us to have kept if they had cared to yours all faithfully   henry james      to wilfred sheridan    21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw aug 7th 1915    dearest wilfred   i have a brave letter from you which is too many days oldand the reason of that is that i became some fortnight ago a british subject you may perhaps not have been aware that i wasnt oneit showed i believe so little but i had in fact to do things of no great elaboration to take on the character and testify to my fond passion for the cause for which you are making so very much grander still a demonstration so that now at any rate civis britannicus sum and theres no mistake about it well the point is that this absolutely natural and inevitable offer of my allegiancea poor thing but my ownand the amiable acceptance of it by the powers to which i applied have drawn down on my devoted head an avalanche of letters the friendliest and most welcoming beneath which i still lie gasping they have unspeakably touched and justified me but i brush them all aside tonight few of them as i have in proportion been able yet to answer in order to tell you that their effect upon me all together isnt a patch on the pride and pleasure i have in hearing from you and that i find your ability to write to me and your sweet care to do so in your fantastic conditions the most wonderful and beautiful thing that has ever happened dear and delightful to me is the gallant good humour of your letter which makes me take what you tell me as if i were quite monstrously near you one doesnt know what to say or do in presence of the general and particular irish perversity and unspeakability as your vivid page reflects it that is rather nobody knows to any good effect but yourselfit makes me so often ask if it isnt when alls said and done and it has extorted the tribute of our grin much more trouble than its worth or ever can be and in short too quite too finally damning and discouraging however i am willing it should display its grace while you are there to give them roundabout you your exquisite care and i can fall back on my sense of your rare psychologic intelligence your do write to me goes to my heart and your i dont think the russian affair as bad as it seems goes to my headeven if it now be seeming pretty bad to us here but theres comfort in its having apparently cost the enemy damn his soul to hell enormously and still being able to do so and to keep on leaving him not at all at his ease i believe in that vast sturdy people quand mêmethough heaven save us all from cheap optimism i scarce know what to say to you about things here unless it be that i hold we are not really in the least such fools as we mostly seem bent on appearing to the world and that on the day when we cease giving the most fantastic account of ourselves possible by tongue and pen on that day there will be fairly something the matter with us and we shall be false to our remarkably queer genius our genius is and ever has been to insist urbi et orbi that we live by muddle and by muddle onlywhile all the while our native character is never really abjuring its stoutness or its capacity for action we have been stout from the most ancient days and are not a bit less so than everonly we should do better if we didnt give so much time to writing to the papers that we are impossible and inexcusable that is or seems to be queerly connected with our genius for being at allso that at times i hope i shall never see it foregone its the mantle over which the country truly forges its confidence and acts out its faith but the night wanes and the small hours are literally upon metheir smallness even diminishes i am sticking to town as you seei find i dont yearn to eat my heart out so to speak all alone in the sussex sequestration so i keep lending my little house at rye to friends and finding company in the mild hum of waterside chelsea the hum of london is mild altogether and the drop of the profane life absolutefor i dont call the ceaseless and ubiquitous military footfall not football profane and all this quarter of the town simply bristles with soldiers and for the most part extremely goodlooking ones i really think we must be roping them in in much greater numbers than we allow when we write to the timesotherwise i dont know what we mean by so many goodnight my dear dear boy i hope you have harmonious news of clareher father has just welcomed me in the most genial way to the national fold i havent lately written to her because in the conditions i have absolutely nothing to say to her but that i feel her to be in perfection the warriors brideand she knows that   yours and hers dearest wilfred all devotedly  henry james      to edmund gosse    21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw august 25th 1915    my dear gosse   i have had a bad sick week mostly in bedwith putting pen to paper quite out of my power otherwise i should sooner have thanked you for the so generous spirit of that letter and told you with emotion how much it has touched me i am really more overcome than i can say by your having been able to indulge in such freedom of mind and grace of speculation during these dark days on behalf of my poor old rather truncated edition in fact entirely frustrated onewhich has the grotesque likeness for me of a sort of miniature ozymandias of egypt look on my works ye mighty and despairround which the lone and level sands stretch further away than ever it is indeed consenting to be waved aside a little into what was once blest literature to so much as answer the question you are so handsomely impelled to makebut my very statement about the matter can only be alas a melancholy a blighted confusion that edition has been from the point of view of profit either to the publishers or to myself practically a complete failure vaguely speaking it doesnt sellthat is my annual report of what it doesthe whole 24 volsin this country amounts to about £25 from the macmillans and the ditto from the scribners in the us to very little more i am past all praying for anywhere i remain at my age which you know and after my long career utterly insurmountably unsaleable and the original preparation of that collective and selective series involved really the extremity of labourall my earlier thingsof which the bostonians would have been if included onewere so intimately and interestingly revised the edition is from that point of view really a monument like ozymandias which has never had the least intelligent critical justice done itor any sort of critical attention at all paid itand the artistic problem involved in my scheme was a deep and exquisite one and moreover was as i held very effectively solved only it took such timeand such tastein other words such aesthetic light no more commercially thankless job of the literary order was prefaces and allthey of a thanklessness accordingly ever achieved the immediate inclusion of the bostonians was rather deprecated by the publishers the scribners who were very generally and in a high degree appreciative i make no complaint of them at alland there were reasons for which i also wanted to wait we always meant that that work should eventually come in revision of it loomed peculiarly formidable and timeconsuming for intrinsic reasons and as other things were more pressing and more promptly feasible i allowed it to stand overwith the best intentions and also in company with a small number more of provisional omissions but by this time it had stood over disappointment had set in the undertaking had begun to announce itself as a virtual failure and we stopped short where we werethat is when a couple of dozen volumes were out from that moment some seven or eight years ago nothing whatever has been added to the seriesand there is little enough appearance now that there will ever your good impression of the bostonians greatly moves methe thing was no success whatever on publication in the century where it came out and the late r w gilder of that periodical wrote me at the time that they had never published anything that appeared so little to interest their readers i felt about it myself then that it was probably rather a remarkable feat of objectivitybut i never was very thoroughly happy about it and seem to recall that i found the subject and the material after i had got launched in it under some illusion less interesting and repaying than i had assumed it to be all the same i should have liked to review it for the editionit would have come out a much truer and more curious thing it was meant to be curious from the first but there can be no question of that or of the proportionate preface to have been written with it at presentor probably ever within my span of life apropos of which matters i at this moment hear from heinemann that four or five of my books that he has have quite entirely ceased to sell and that he must break up the plates of course he must i have nothing to say against it and the things in question are mostly all in the edition but such is success i should have liked to write that preface to the bostonianswhich will never be written now but think of noting now that that is a thing that has perished  i am doing my best to feel better and hope to go out this afternoon the first for several i am exceedingly with you

sheridan rifle brigade fell in action at loos      september 25 1915     21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw october 4th 1915    dearest dearest clare   i have heard twice from your kindest of fathers and yet this goes to you for poor baffling personal reasons with a dreadful belatedness the thought of coming into your presence and into mrs sheridans with such wretched empty and helpless hands is in itself paralysing and yet even as i say that the sense of how my whole soul is full even to its being racked and torn of wilfreds belovedest image and the splendour and devotion in which he is all radiantly wrapped and enshrined makes me ask myself if i dont really bring you something of a sort in thus giving you the assurance of how absolutely i adored him yet who can give you anything that approaches your incomparable sense that he was yours and you his to the last possessed and possessing radiance of him i cant pretend to utter to you words of consolationvainest of dreams for what is your suffering but the measure of his virtue his charm and his beautyeverything we so loved him for but i see you marked with his glory too and so intimately associated with his noble legend with the light of it about you and about his children always and the precious privilege of making him live again whenever one approaches you convinced as i am that you will rise in spite of the unspeakable laceration to the greatness of all this and feel it carry you in a state of sublime privilege i had sight and some sound of him during an hour of that last leave just before he went off again and what he made me then feel and what his face seemed to say amid that cluster of relatives in which i was the sole outsider of which too i was extraordinarily proud is beyond all expression i dont know why i presume to say such thingsi mean poor things only of mine to you all stricken and shaken as you areand then again i know how any touch of his noble humanity must be unspeakably dear to you and that youll go on getting the fragrance of them wherever he passed i think with unutterable tenderness of those days of late last autumn when you were in the little house off the edgware road and the humour and gaiety and vivid sympathy of his talk about his then beginnings and conditions made me hang spellbound on his lips but what memories are these not to you and how can one speak to you at all without stirring up the deeps well we are all in them with you and with his motherand may i speak of his fatherand with his children and we cling to you and cherish you as never before i live with you in thought every step of the long way and am yours dearest clare all devotedly and sharingly   henry james      to hugh walpole   21 carlyle mansions cheyne walk sw nov 13th 1915   i take to my heart these blest cornish words from you and thank you for them as articulately as my poor old impaired state permits it will be an immense thing to see you when your own conditions permit of it and in that fond vision i hang on i have been having a regular hell of a summer and autumn that is more particularly from the end of july through the effect of a badan aggravatedheartcrisis during the first weeks of which i lost valuable time by attributing under wrong advice my condition to mistaken causes but i am in the best hands now and apparently responding very well to very helpful treatment but the past year has made me feel twenty years older and frankly as if my knell had rung still i cultivate i at least attempt a brazen front i shall not let that mask drop till i have heard your thrilling story do intensely believe that i respond clutchingly to your every grasp of me every touch and would so gratefully be a reconnecting link with you herewhere i dont wonder that youre bewildered it will be indeed as far as i am concerned the bewildered leading the bewildered i have seen very few peoplei see as few as possible i cant stand them and all their promiscuous prattle mostly so that those who have reported of me to you must have been peculiarly vociferous i deplore with all my heart your plague of boils and of insomnia i havent known the former but the latter alas is my own
