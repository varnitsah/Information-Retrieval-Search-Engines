15097384	a peoples man  by e phillips oppenheim    chapter i  maraton has come maraton maraton is here  across soho threading his way with devilish ingenuity through mazes of narrow streets scattering with his hooter little groups of gibbering swarthy foreigners aaron thurnbrein bent double over his ancient bicycle sped on his way towards the commercial road and eastwards with narrow cheeks smeared with dust yellow teeth showing behind his parted lips through which the muttered words came with uneven vehemence ragged clothes a ragged handkerchief around his neck a greasy cap upon his headthis messenger charged with great tidings proclaimed himself by his visible existence one of the submerged clinging to his last spar fighting still with hands which beat the air yet carrying the undaunted light of battle in his blazing eyes deepsunken almost cavernous the last refuge perhaps of that ebbing life drops of perspiration were upon his forehead his breath came hard and painfully before he had reached his destination one could almost hear the rattle in his throat he even staggered as at last he dropped from his bicycle and wheeling it across a broad pavement left it reclining against a box of apples exposed in front of a small greengrocers shop  the neighbourhood was ugly and dirty the shop was ugly and dirty the interior into which he passed was dark odoriferous bare of stock povertysmitten a woman lean hardfeatured with thin grey hair disordered and unkempt looked up quickly at his coming and as quickly down again her face was perhaps too lifeless to express any emotion whatsoever but there might have been a shade of disappointment in the swift withdrawal of her gaze a customer would have been next door to a miracle but hope dies hard  you she muttered what are you bothering about  i want david aaron thurnbrein panted i have news is he behind  the woman moved away to let him pass  he is behind she answered in a dull lifeless tone since you took him with you to bermondsey he does no work what does it matter we starve a little sooner take him to another meeting if you will id rather you taught him how to steal theres rest in the prisons at least  aaron thurnbrein brushed past her inattentive unlistening she was not amongst those who counted he pushed open an illfitting door whose broken glass top was stuffed with brown paper the room within was almost horrible in its meagreness the floor was uncarpeted the wall unpapered in a threelegged chair drawn up to the table with paper before him and a pencil in his hand sat david ross he looked up at the panting intruder only to glower  what do you want boy he asked pettishly i am at work i need these figures i am to speak tonight at poplar  put them away aaron thurnbrein cried soon you and i will be needed no more a greater than we have known is herehere in london  the older man looked up for a moment as though puzzled then a light broke suddenly across his face a light which seemed somehow to become reflected in the face of the starveling youth  maraton he almost shrieked  maraton the other echoed he is here in london  the face of the older man twitched with excitement  but they will arrest him  if they dared aaron thurnbrein declared harshly a million of us would tear him out of prison but they will not maraton is too clever america has not even asked for extradition for our sakes he keeps within the law he is here in london he is stripped for the fight  david ross rose heavily to his feet one saw then that he was not really old starvation and illhealth had branded him with premature age he was not thin but the flesh hung about him in folds his cheeks were puffy his long hairy eyebrows drooped down from his massive forehead there was the look about him of a strong man gone to seed  they will be all around him like flies over a carcass he muttered  mr foleyfoleythe prime ministersent for him directly he arrived aaron thurnbrein announced he is to see him tonight at his own house in downing street it makes no difference  who can tell the other remarked despondently the pages of history are littered with the bodies of strong men who have opened their lips to the poisoned spoon  aaron thurnbrein spat upon the floor  there is but one maraton he cried fervently there has been but one since the world was shaped he is come and the first step towards our deliverance is at hand  the older man whose trembling fingers still rested upon the sheets of paper looked at his visitor curiously  you are a jew he muttered why do you worship maraton he is not of your race  the young mans gesture was almost sublime  jew or christianwhat does it matter he demanded i am a jew what has my religion done for me nothing i am a free man in my thoughts i am one of the oppressed men or women jews or christians infidels or believerswhat does it matter we are those who have been broken upon the wheel deliverance for us will come too late we fight for those who will follow it is maraton who points towards the light it is maraton whose hand shall press the levers which shall set the kingdoms rocking i tell you that our own country even may bite the dusta conquerors hand lay heavy upon her throat and yet no matter through the valley of fire and blood and pestilenceone must pass through these to the great white land  amen david ross cried fervently the gift is upon you today aaron amen  the two stood together for a moment speechless carried away out of themselves then the door was suddenly opened the woman stood there sour and withered behind her a hardfeatured man official malevolent  we are for the streets the woman exclaimed harshly hes got the order  three pounds thirteen or out you go the man announced pushing his way forward heres the paper  david ross looked at him as one awakened from a dream  evicted  and dd well time too the newcomer continued youve had all the chance in the world how do you expect to make a living fiddling about here all day with pencil and paper and talking socialist rot at night leave that chair alone and be off both of you  they glanced despairingly towards aaron thurnbrein he thrust his hands into his pockets and exposed them with a little helpless gesture the coins he produced were of copper the official looked at them and around the place with a grin of contempt  cut it short he ordered clear out  theres my bicycle aaron thurnbrein said slowly  they all looked at himthe woman and the man with nervous anxiety the official with a flicker of interest aaron thurnbrein drew a little sigh the bicycle bad been earned by years of strenuous toil it was almost a necessity of his existence  aarons bicycle david ross muttered no no that must not be let us go to the streets  but the woman did not move already the young man had wheeled it into the shop  take it he insisted what does it matter maraton is here  away again this time on foot along the sunbaked pavements through courts and alleys into a narrow busy street in the neighbourhood of shoreditch he stopped at last before a factory and looked tentatively up at the windows through the opened panes came the constant click of sewing machines the smell of cloth the vision of many heads bent over their work he stood where he was for a time and watched the place was like a hive of industry row after row of girls were there seated side by side roundshouldered bending over their machines looking neither to the right nor to the left struggling to keep up to time to make sure of the wage which was life or death to them it was nothing to them that above the halo of smoke the sky was blue or that away beyond the murky horizon the sun which here in the narrow street seemed to have drawn all life from the air was shining on yellow cornfields bending before the west wind here there was simply an intolerable heat a smell of fish and a smell of cloth  aaron thurnbrein crossed the street entered the unimposing doorway and knocked at the door which led into the busy but unassuming offices a small boy threw open a little glass window and looked at him doubtfully  i dont know that you can see miss thurnbrein even for a minute he declared in answer to aarons confident enquiry its our busiest time what do you want  i am her brother aaron announced it is most important  the boy slipped from a worn stool and disappeared presently the door of the little waitingroom was suddenly opened and a girl entered  aaron she exclaimed has anything happened  once more he raised his head once more the light that flickered in his face transformed him into some semblance of a virile man  maraton is here maraton has arrived  the light flashed too for a moment in her face only she even before it came was beautiful  at last she cried at last have you seen him aaron tell me quickly what is he like  not yet aaron replied tonight they say that he goes first to visit the prime minister he will come to us afterwards  it is great news she murmured if only one could see him  the office boy reappeared  guvnor says why arent you at your work miss thurnbrein he remarked as he climbed on to his stool you wont get through before closing time as it is  she turned reluctantly away there was something in her face from which even aaron could scarcely remove his eyes  i must go she declared we are busy here and so many of the girls are awaydown with the heat i suppose thank you for coming aaron  i would like he answered to walk the streets of london one by one and stand at the corners and shout to the passersby that maraton has come only i wonder if they would understand i wonder  he passed out into the street and the girl returned to her work after a few yards he felt suddenly giddy there was a little enclosure across the road called by courtesy a playgrounda few benches a dusty space and some swings he threw himself into a corner of one of the benches and closed his eyes he was worn out physically exhausted yet all the time the sense of something wonderful kept him from collapse maraton had come    chapter ii  westward the late june twilight deepened into a violet and moonless darkness the lights in st jamess park glittered like motionless fireflies a faint wind rustled amongst the drooping leaves of the trees up here the atmosphere was different it seemed a long way from shoreditch  outside the principal of the official residences in downing street there was a tented passageway and a strip of drugget across the pavement within the large reception rooms were crowded with men and women there was music and many forms of entertainment were in progress the popping of champagne corks the constant murmur of cheerful conversation the prime minister was giving a great political reception and men and women of every degree and almost every nationality were talking and mingling together the gathering was necessarily not select but it was composed of people who counted the countess of grenside who was the prime ministers sister and the head of his household saw to that  they stood together at the head of the staircase a couple curiously unlike not only in appearance but in disposition and tastes lady grenside was tall and fair almost florid in complexion remarkably wellpreserved with a splendid presence and figure she had been one of the beauties of her day and even now in the sixth year of her widowhood was accounted a remarkably handsome woman mr foley her brother was also tall but gaunt and thin with a pronounced stoop his grey imperial gave him an almost foreign appearance he had the forehead of a philosopher but the mouth of a humourist his eyes shrewd and penetratinghe wore no glasses although he was nearly sixty years of agewere perhaps his best feature  tell me my dear stephen she asked as the tide of incoming guests finally ceased and they found themselves at liberty why are you looking so disturbed it seems to me that every one has arrived who ought to come and judging by the noise they are making every one is thoroughly enjoying themselves why are people so noisy nowadays i wonder  mr foley smiled  what an observant person you are to tell you the truth there was just one guest whom i was particularly anxious to see here tonight he promised to come but so far i am afraid that he has not arrived  not that awful man maraton  he nodded  no use calling him names catharine he continued grimly maraton is one of the most important problems we have to face within the next few weeks i suppose there is no chance of his having slipped in without our having noticed him  lady grenside shook her head  i should imagine not i am quite sure that i havent shaken hands tonight with any one who reminded me in the least of what this man must be very likely elisabeth will discover him if he is here she has just gone off on one of her tours of inspection  mr foley shrugged his shoulders he was after all a philosopher  i am afraid elisabeth wont get very far he remarked carton was in her train and ellison and aubrey werent far behind she is really quite wonderful i never in all my life saw any one look so beautiful as she does tonight  lady grenside made a little grimace as she laid her fingers upon her brothers arm and pointed towards an empty settee close at hand  beautiful yes she sighed but oh so difficult   almost at that moment elisabeth had paused on her way through the furthest of the three crowded roomsand maraton happening simultaneously to glance in her direction their eyes met they were both above the average height so they looked at one another over the heads of many people and in both their faces was something of the same expressionthe faint interest born of a relieved monotony the girl deliberately turned towards him he was an unknown guest and alone there were times when her duties came quite easily  i am afraid that you are not amusing yourself she remarked with some faint yet kindly note of condescension in her tone  you are very kind he answered his eyebrows slightly lifted i certainly am not but then i did not come here to amuse myself  indeed a sense of duty brought you perhaps  a sense of duty beyond a doubt the man assented politely  she felt like passing onbut she also felt like staying so she stayed  cannot i help you towards the further accomplishment of your duty then she enquired  he looked at her and the grim severity of his face was lightened by a smile  you could help me more easily to forget it he replied  she opened her lips hesitated and closed them again already she had recognised the fact that this was not a man to be snubbed neither had she notwithstanding her momentary irritation any real desire to do so  you do not know many people here  i know no one he confessed  i am elisabeth landon she told him mr foley is my uncle my mother and i live with him and always help him to entertain  hence your interest in a lonely stranger he remarked please have no qualms about me i am always interested when i am permitted to watch my fellow creatures especially when the types are novel to me  she looked at him searchingly for a moment as yet she had not succeeded in placing him his features were large but wellshaped his cheekbones a little high his forehead massive his deepset eyes bright and marvellously penetrating he had a mouth long and firm with a slightly humorous twist at the corners his hair was black and plentiful he might have been of any age between thirtyfive and forty his limbs and body were powerful his head was set with the poise of an emperor his clothes were correct and well worn he was entirely at his ease yet elisabeth who was an observant person looked at him and wondered he would have been more at home she thought out in the storms of life than in her uncles drawingrooms yet what was he he lacked the trimness of the soldier of the debonair smartness of the modern fighting man there was no trace whatsoever in his speech or appearance the politicians who were likely to be present she knew what was there left an explorer perhaps or a colonial her curiosity became imperious  you have not told me your name she reminded him  my name is maraton he replied a little grimly  youmaraton  there was a brief silencenot without a certain dramatic significance to the girl who stood there with slightly parted lips the smooth serenity of her forehead was broken by a frown her beautiful blue eyes were troubled she seemed somehow to have dilated to have drawn herself up her air of politeness half gracious half condescending had vanished it was as though in spirit she were preparing for battle  you seem to have heard of me he remarked drily  who has not heard of you she answered in a low tone i am sorry you have made me break my word  i  she was recovering herself now a certain icy aloofness seemed to have crept into her manner her head was held at a different angle even the words seemed to leave her lips differently her tone was one of measured indignation  yes you when mr foley told me that he had asked you to come here tonight i vowed that i would not speak to you  a perfectly reasonable decision he agreed without the slightest change of expression but am i really to be blamed for this unfortunate incident you cannot say that i thrust myself upon your notice  his eyebrows were ever so slightly uplifted she was not absolutely sure that there was not something very suggestive of amusement in his deepset eyes she bit her lip naturally he was not a gentleman  i thought that you were a neglected guest she explained coldly i do not understand how it is that you have managed to remain undiscovered  he shook his head doubtfully  i made my entrance with the others i saw a very charming lady at the head of the stairsyour mother i believewho gave me her fingers and called me mr martin your uncle shook hands with me looking over my head to welcome some one behind i passed on with the rest the fault remains beyond a doubt with your majordomo and my uncommon name  since i have discovered you then she declared you had better let me take you to my uncle he has been looking everywhere for you for the last hour we will go this way  she laid the extreme tips of her fingers upon his coat sleeve he glanced down at them for a moment her reluctance was evident  perhaps he suggested coolly we should make faster progress if i were to follow you  she took no further notice of him for some time then very suddenly she drew him to one side out of the throng into an almost empty anterooma dismal little apartment lined with shelves full of blue books and parliamentary records  i am content to obey my guide he remarked but why this abrupt flight  she hesitated then she raised her eyes and looked at him perhaps some instinct told her that the truth was best  because mr culvain was in that crowd she told him mr culvain has been looking for you everywhere it is only to see you that he came here this evening my uncle is anxious to talk with you first  i am flattered he murmured smiling  i think that you should be she asserted personally i do not understand my uncles attitude  with regard to me  with regard to you  you think perhaps that i should not be permitted here at all as a guest  i do think that she replied looking steadily into his eyes i think more than that i think that your place is in sing sing prison  the corners of his mouth twitched his amusement maddened her her eyes flashed underneath her white satin gown her bosom was rising and falling quickly  he became suddenly grave  do you take life seriously lady elisabeth he asked  certainly she answered firmly i do not think that human life is a thing to be trifled with i agree with the times  in what it said about me  yes  and what was that it is neglectful of me i know but i never see the times  it held you entirely responsible for the death of those poor men in chicago she told him it named you as their murderer  a very sensible paper the times he agreed the responsibility was entirely mine  she looked at him for a moment in horror  you can dare to admit that hereto me  why not he answered calmly so long as it is my conviction why not proclaim it i love the truth it is the one virtue which has never been denied me  her eyes flashed she made no effort whatever to conceal her detestation  and they let you gothose americans she cried i do not understand  there are probably many other considerations in connection with the affair which you do not understand he observed howeverthey had their opportunity i walked the streets openly i travelled to new york openly i took my steamer ticket to england under my own name the papers i believe chronicled every stage of my journey  it was disgraceful she declared the people in office over there are cowards  not at all he objected they were very well advised they acted with shrewd common sense america is no better prepared for a revolution than england is  do you imagine she demanded her voice trembling that you will be permitted to repeat in this country your american exploits  maraton smiled a little sadly  need we discuss these things lady elisabeth  yes we need she replied promptly this is my one opportunity you and i will probably never exchange another word so long as we live i have read your bookevery word of it i have read it several times in that book you have shown just as much of yourself as you chose and no more although i have hated the idea that i might ever have to speak to you now that you are here now that it has come to pass i am going to ask you a question  he sighed  people ask me so many questions  tell me this she continued without heeding his interruption do you in your heart believe that you are justified in going about the world preaching your hateful doctrines seeking out the toilers only to fill them with discontent and to set them against their employers preaching everywhere bloodshed and anarchy inflaming the minds of people who in ordinary times are contented even happy you have made yourself feared and hated in every country of the world you have brought america almost to the verge of revolution and now just when england needs peace most when affairs on the continent are so threatening and every one connected with the government of the country is passing through a time of the gravest anxiety you intend they say to start a campaign here you say that you love the truth answer me this question truthfully then do you believe that you are justified  he had listened to her at first with a slight tolerant smile upon his lips a smile which faded gradually away he was sombre almost stern when she had finished he seemed in some curious way to have assumed a larger shape to have become more imposing his attitude had a strange and indefinable influence upon her  she was suddenly conscious of her youth and inexperiencebitterly and rebelliously conscious of thembefore he had even opened his lips her own words sounded crude and unconvincing  i am not one of the flamboyant orators of the socialist party lady elisabeth he said nor am i one of those who are able to see much joy or very much hopefulness in life under present conditions for every word i have spoken and every line i have written i accept the full and complete responsibility  those men who were murdered in chicago murdered at your instigation because they tried to break the strikewhat of them  he looked at her as one might have looked at a child  their lives were a necessary sacrifice in a good cause he declared does one think now of the sea of blood through which france once purged herself believe me young lady there is nothing in the world more to be avoided than this sentimental and exaggerated reverence for life it is born of a false ideal artistically and actually life is a sacrifice to be offered in a just cause when necessary  i imagine that this is your uncle  mr foley was standing upon the threshold of the room his hand outstretched his thin long face full of conviction  my niece has succeeded in discovering you then mr maraton he said i am glad  maraton smiled as he shook hands  i have certainly had the pleasure of making your nieces acquaintance he admitted we have had quite an interesting discussion  elisabeth turned away without looking towards him  i will leave mr maraton to you uncle she said he will tell you that i have been very candid indeed we were coming face to face with mr culvain so i brought him in here  she did not glance again in maratons direction nor did she offer him any form of farewell salutation mr foley frowned slightly as he glanced after her maraton too watched her leave the room she paused for a moment on the threshold to gather up her train a graceful but at the same time imperious gesture she left them without a backward look mr foley turned quickly towards his companion and was relieved at the expression which he found in his face  my niece is a little earnest in her views he remarked too much so i am afraid for a practical politician she is quite wellinformed and a great help to me at times  i found her altogether charming maraton said quietly she has too the unusual gift of honesty  mr foley was once more a little uneasy it was impossible for him to forget elisabeths outspoken verdict upon this man and all his works  the young are never tolerant he murmured  and quite rightly maraton observed there is nothing more to be envied in youth than its magnificent certainty it knows    i am flattered mr foley that you should have received me in your house tonight your nieces attitude towards me even if a trifle crude is i am afraid the general one amongst your class in this country  to be frank with you i agree mr foley assented i personally mr maraton am trying to be a dissenter it is for that reason that i begged you to come here tonight and discuss the matter with me before you committed yourself to any definite plan of action in this country  your message was a surprise to me maraton admitted calmly at the same time it was a summons which i could not disregard as you see i am here  mr foley drew a key from his pocket and led the way across the room towards a closed door  i want to make sure that we are not disturbed i am going to take you through to my study if i may  they passed into a small inner room plainly but comfortably furnished  my own den mr foley explained closing the door behind him with an air of relief will you smoke mr maraton or drink anything  neither thank you maraton answered i am here to listen i am curious to hear what there is that you can have to say to me    chapter iii  mr foley pointed to an easychair maraton however did not at once respond to his gesture of invitation he was standing tense and silent with head upraised listening from the street outside came a strange rumbling sound  you permit he asked stepping to the window and drawing the curtain a few inches on one side there is something familiar about that sound i heard it last in chicago  mr foley rose slowly from the easychair into which he had thrown himself and stood by his visitors side outside the pavements were lined by policemen standing like sentries about halfadozen yards apart the tented entrance to the house was guarded by a solid phalanx of men in uniform a mounted inspector was riding slowly up and down in the middle of the road at the entrance to the street barely fifty yards away a moving mass of people whitefaced almost spectral were passing slowly beneath the pale gaslamps  the people maraton murmured with a curious note in his tone half of reverence half of pity  the mob mr foley echoed bitterly they brawl before the houses of those who do their best to serve them they bark always at our heels perhaps tonight it is you whom they have come to honour your bodyguard eh mr maraton  if they have discovered that i am here it is not unlikely maraton admitted calmly  mr foley dropped the curtain which he had taken from his companions fingers moving back into the room he turned on more light then he resumed his seat  mr maraton he began we met only once before i think that was four years ago this summer answer me honestlydo you see any change in me  maraton leaned a little forward his face showed some concern as he answered  you are not in the best of health just now i fear mr foley  i am as well as i shall ever be was the quiet reply what you see in my face is just the record of these last four years the outward evidence of four years of ceaseless trouble and anxiety i will not call myself yet a broken man but the time is not far off  maraton remained silent his attitude was still sympathetic but he seemed determined to carry out his role of listener  if the political history of these four years is ever truthfully written mr foley continued the world will be amazed at the calm indifference of the people threatened day by day with national disaster we who have been behind the scenes have kept a stiff upper lip before the world but i tell you frankly mr maraton that no cabinet who ever undertook the government of this country has gone through what we have gone through three times we have been on the brink of wartwice on our own account and once on account of those whom we are bound to consider our allies the other national disaster we have had to face you know of still here we are safe up to tonight there is nothing in the whole world we need now so much as restjust a few months freedom from anxiety until last week we had dared to hope for it now breathless still from our last escape we are face to face suddenly with all the possibilities of your coming  you fear the people maraton remarked quietly  mr foleys pale worn face suddenly lit up  fear the people he repeated with a note of passion in his tone i fear the people for their own sake i fear the ruin and destruction they may by illadvised action bring upon themselves and their country mr maraton grant will you not that i am a man of some experience believe i pray you that i am honest let me assure you of this if the people be not wisely led now the empire which i and my ministers have striven so hard to keep intact must fall there are troubles pressing upon us still from every side if the people are wrongly advised today the british empire must fall even as those other great dynasties of the past have fallen  maraton turned once more to the window raised the curtain and gazed out into the darkness there was a little movement at the end of the street the police had driven back the crowd to allow a carriage to pass through a hoarse murmur of voices came floating into the room the people gave way slowly and unwillinglystill they gave way law and order strenuous though the task of preserving them was becoming prevailed  mr foley maraton said dropping the curtain and returning once more to his place i am honoured by your confidence you force me however to remind you that you have spoken to me as a politician i am not a politician the cause of the people is above politics  i am for the people mr foley declared with a sudden passion in his tone it is their own fault the blind prejudice of their ignorant leaders if they fail to recognise it  for the people maraton repeated softly  havent my government done their best to prove it the prime minister demanded almost fiercely we have passed at least six measures which a dozen years ago would have been reckoned rank socialism what we do need today is a peoples man in our government i admit our weakness i admit that with every desire to do the right thing we may sometimes err through lack of knowledge our great trouble is this there is not today a single man amongst the labour party a single man who has come into parliament on the mandate of the people whose assistance would be of the slightest service to us i make you an offer which you yourself must consider a wonderful one you come to this country as an enemy and i offer you my hand as a friend i offer you not only a seat in parliament but a share in the counsels of my party i ask you to teach us how to legislate for the people of the future  maraton remained for a moment silent his face betrayed no exultation his tone when at last he spoke was almost sad  mr foley he said if you are not a great man you have in you at least the elements of greatness you have imagination you know how to meet a crisis i only wish that what you suggest were possible twenty years ago perhaps yes today i fear that the time for any legislation in which you would concur is past  what have you to hope for but legislation mr foley asked what else is there but civil war  maraton smiled a little grimly  there is what in your heart you are fearing all the time he replied there is the slow paralysis of all your manufactures the stoppage of your railways the dislocation of every industry and undertaking built upon the slavery of the people what about your british empire then  mr foley regarded his visitor with quiet dignity  i have understood that you were an englishman mr maraton he said am i to look upon you as a traitor  not to the cause which is my one religion maraton retorted swiftly empires may come and go but the people remain what changes may happen to this country before the great and final one is a matter in which i am not deeply concerned  the telephone bell upon the table between them rang mr foley frowned slightly as he raised the receiver to his ear  you will forgive me he begged this is doubtless a matter of some importance it is not often that my secretary allows me to be disturbed at this hour  maraton wandered back to the window raised the curtain and once more looked out upon the scene which seemed to him that night so pregnant with meaning his mind remained fixed upon the symbolism of the streets he heard only the echoes of a somewhat prolonged exchange of questions and answers finally mr foley replaced the receiver and announced the conclusion of the conversation when maraton turned round it seemed to him that his hosts face was grey  you come like the stormy petrel the latter remarked bitterly there is bad news tonight from the north we are threatened with militant labour troubles all over the country  it is the inevitable maraton declared  mr foley struck the table with his fist  i deny it he cried these troubles can and shall be stopped legislation shall do itamicable if possible brutal if not but the man who is content to see his country ruined see it presented a helpless prey to our enemies for the mere trouble of landing upon our shoresthat man is a traitor and deserves to be treated as such tell me on behalf of the people mr maraton what is it that you want name your terms  maraton shook his head doubtfully  you are a brave man mr foley he said but remember that you do not stand alone there are your fellow ministers  they are my men mr foley insisted besides there is the thunder in the air we cannot disregard it we are not ostriches better to meet the trouble bravely than to be crushed by it  there was a tap at the door and lady elisabeth appeared upon the threshold maraton was conscious of realising for the first time that this was the most beautiful woman whom he had ever seen in his life she avoided looking at him as she addressed her uncle  uncle she said deprecatingly i am so sorry but every one is asking for you you have been in here for nearly twenty minutes there is a rumour that you are ill  mr foley rose to his feet reluctantly  i will come he promised  she closed the door and departed silently at no time had she glanced towards or taken any notice of maraton  we discuss the fate of an empire mr foley sighed and necessity demands that i must return to my guests this conversation between us must be finished you are a reasonable man you cannot deny the right of an enemy to demand your terms before you declare war  maraton too had risen to his feet he had turned slightly and his eyes were fixed upon the door through which elisabeth had passed for a moment or two he seemed deep in thought the immobility of his features was at last disturbed his eyes were wonderfully bright his lips were a little parted  on saturday mr foley continued we leave for our country home for two days we shall be alone it is not far awayan hour by rail will you come mr maraton  maraton withdrew his eyes from the door it seems a little useless he said quietly will you give me until tomorrow to think it over    chapter iv  maraton made his way from downing street on foot curiously enough altogether escaping recognition from the crowds who were still hanging about on the chance of catching a glimpse of him he was somehow conscious as he turned northwards of a peculiar sense of exhilaration a savour in life unexpected not altogether analysable as a rule the streets themselves supplied him with illimitable food for thought the passing multitudes the ceaseless flow of the human stream justification absolute and most complete for the new faith of which he was the prophet for the cause of the people had only been recognised during recent days as something entirely distinct from the socialism and syndicalism which had been its precursors it was maraton himself who had raised it to the level of a religion  tonight however there was a curious background to his thoughts some part of his earlier life seemed stirred up in the man the one selfishness permitted to rank as a virtue in his sex was alive his heart had ceased to throb with the loiterers the flotsam and jetsam of the gutters for the moment he was cast loose from the absorbed and serious side of his career a curious wave of sentiment had enveloped him a wave of sentiment unanalysable and as yet impersonal he walked as a man in a dream for the first time he had seen and recognised the imperishable thing in a womans face  he reached at last one of the large somewhat gloomy squares in the district between st pancras and new oxford street and paused before one of the most remote houses situated at the extreme northeast corner he opened the front door with a latchkey and passed across a large but simply furnished hall into his study he entered a little abstractedly and it was not until he had closed the door behind him that he realised the presence of another person in the room at his entrance she had risen to her feet  at last she exclaimed at last you have come  there was a silence prolonged curious in a sense thrilling a girl of wonderful appearance had risen to her feet and was looking eagerly towards him she was wearing the plain black dress of a working woman whose clumsy folds inadequately concealed a figure of singular beauty and strength her cheeks were colourless her eyes large and deep and of a soft shade of grey filled just now with the half wondering half worshipping expression of a pilgrim who has reached the mecca of her desires her hairher shabby hat lay upon the tablewas dark and glossy her arms were a little outstretched her lips unusually scarlet against the pallor of her face were parted her whole attitude was one of quivering eagerness maraton stood and looked at her in wonder the little cloud of sentiment in which he had been moving perhaps made him more than ever receptive to the impressions which she seemed to create both the girl herself and her pose were splendidly allegorical she stood there for the great things of life  i would not go away she cried softly they forbade me to stay but i came back i am julia thurnbrein i have waited so long  maraton stepped towards her and took her hands  i am glad he said it is fitting that you should be one of the first to welcome me you have done a great work julia thurnbrein  and you she murmured passionately still clasping his hands you a far greater one ever since i understood i have longed for this meeting it is you who will become the worlds deliverer  maraton led her gently back to the chair in which she had been sitting  now we must talk he declared sit opposite to me there  he struck a match and lit the lamp of a little coffee machine which stood upon the table she sprang eagerly to her feet  let me please she begged i understand those things please let me make the coffee  he laughed and going to the cabinet brought another of the old blue china cups and saucers with very deft fingers she manipulated the machine presently when her task was finished she sat back in her chair her coffee cup in her hand her great eyes fixed upon him she had the air of a person entirely content  so you are julia thurnbrein  and you she replied still with that note of suppressed yet passionate reverence in her tone are maraton  he smiled  the women workers of the world owe you a great deal he said  but it is so little that one can do she answered quivering with pleasure at his words one needs inspiration direction now that you have come it will be different it will be wonderful  she leaned towards him and once more maraton was conscious of the splendid mobility of her trembling body she was a revelation to hima modern joan of arc  remember that i am no magician he warned her  ah but your very presence alters everything she cried it makes everything possibleeverything my brother too is mad with excitement he hoped that you might have been at the clarion hall tonight before you went to downing street you have seen mr foley and talked with him  i have come straight from there he told her foley is a shrewd man he sees the writing upon the wall he is afraid  she looked at him and laughed  they will try to buy you she remarked scornfully they will try to deal with you as they did with blake and others like himyoumaraton oh i wonder if england knows what it means your comingif she really feels the breaking dawn  tell me about yourself maraton asked a little abruptlyyour work i know you only by name rememberyour articles in the reviews and your evidence before the woman labour commission  i am a tailoress she replied it is horrible work but i have the good fortune to be quick i can make a livingthere are many who cannot  he was leaning back in his chair his head supported by his hand his eyes fixed curiously upon her her pallor was not wholly the pallor of illhealth in her beautiful eyes shone the fire of life she laughed at him softly and held out her hands for his inspection they were shapely enough but her fingertips were scotched and pricked  here are the hallmarks of my trade others who work by my side have fallen away it is of their sufferings i have written i myself am physically very strong it is the average person who counts  he looked at her thoughtfully  you have written and worked a great deal for your age are you still in employment  of course i left off at seven this evening i have nothing else in my life she added simply but my work our work the breaking of these vile bonds i need no pleasures i have never thought of any  her eyes suddenly dropped before his a confusion of thought seemed to have seized upon her maraton too conscious of the nature of his imaginings although innocent of any personal application was not wholly free from embarrassment  perhaps you will think he observed that i am asking too many personal questions for a new acquaintance but after all i must know you must i not we are fellow workers in a great cause the small things do not matter  she looked at him once more frankly the blush had passed from her cheeks her eyes were untroubled  i dont know what came over me she confessed i was suddenly afraid that you might misunderstand my coming to you like this without invitation so late somehow with you it didnt seem to count  it must not  more at her ease now she glanced around the room and back at him he smiled  confess he said that there are some things about me and my surroundings which have surprised you  she nodded  willingly i was surprised at your house at being received by a man servantat everything she added with a glance at his attire yet what does that matter it is because i do not understand  the little lines about his eyes deepened he laughed softly  i only hope that the others will adopt your attitude i hear that many of them have very decided views about evening dress and small luxuries of any description  graveling and peter daleespecially daleare terrible she declared dale is very narrow indeed you must bear with them if they are foolish at first they are uncultured and rough they do not quite understand sometimes they do not see far enough but tomorrow you will meet them you will be at the clarion tomorrow  i am not sure he answered thoughtfully i am thinking matters over tomorrow i shall meet the men of whom you have spoken and a few others whose names i have on my list and consult with them personally i am not sure as to the wisdom of opening my lips until after our meeting at manchester  oh dont say that she begged what we all need so much is encouragement inspiration our greatest danger is lethargy there are millions who stare into the darkness who long for a single word of hope their eyes are almost tired come and speak to us tomorrow as you spoke to the men and women of chicago  he smiled a little grimly  you forget that this is england until the time comes one must choose ones words it is just what would please our smug enemies best to have me break their laws before i have been here long enough to become dangerous  you broke the laws of america she protested eagerly  i had a million men and women primed for battle at my back he reminded her the warrant was signed for my arrest but no one dared to serve it all the same i had to leave the country with some work half finished  it was a glorious commencement she cried enthusiastically  one must not forget though he sighed that england is different to attain the same ends here one may have to use somewhat different methods  for the moment perhaps she was stirred by some prophetic misgiving the hard common sense of his words fell like a cold douche upon the furnace of her enthusiasms she had imagined him a prophet touched by the great and unmistakable fire ready to drive his chariot through all the hosts of iniquity irresistible unassailable cleaving his way through the bending masses of their oppressors to the goal of their desires his words seemed to proclaim him a disciple of other methods there were to be compromises his attire his dwelling this luxuriously furnished room so different from anything which she had expected proclaimed it she herself held it part of the creed of her life to be free from all ornaments free from even the shadow of luxury her throat was bare her hair simply arranged her fingers and wrists innocent of even the simplest article of jewellery he on the other hand the elijah of her dreams appeared in the guise of a man of fashion wearing as though he were used to them the attire of the hated class obviously qualified by breeding and use to hold his place amongst them was this indeed to be the disappointment of her life then she remembered and her courage rose after all he was the master  i will go now she said i am glad to have been the first to have welcomed you  he held out his hands then for a moment they both listened and turned towards the door there was the sound of an angry voicea visitor apparently trying to force his way in maraton strode towards the door and opened it a young man was in the hall expostulating angrily with a resolute man servant his hat had rolled on to the floor his face was flushed with anger the servant on recognising his master stepped back at once  the gentleman insisted upon forcing his way in sir he explained softly i wished him to wait while i brought you his name  maraton smiled and made a little gesture of dismissal the young man picked up his hat he was still hot with anger maraton pointed to the room on the threshold of which the girl was still standing  if you wish to speak to me he said i am quite at your service only it is a little late for a visit isnt it and yours seems to be a rather unceremonious way of insisting upon it who are you  the young man stood and stared at his questioner he was wearing a blue serge suit obviously readymade thick boots a doubtful collar a machineknitted silk tie of vivid colour he had curly fair hair a sharp face with narrow eyes thick lips and an indifferent complexion  are you maraton he demanded  i am maraton admitted and you  i am richard graveling mp the young man announced with a certain emphasis on those last two lettersmp for poplar east we expected you at the clarion tonight  i had other business maraton remarked calmly  the young man appeared a trifle disconcerted  i dont see what business you can have here till weve talked things out and laid our plans he declared i am secretary of the committee appointed to meet and confer with you peter dale is chairman of course there are five of us we expected you round tonight you got our telegram at liverpool  certainly maraton admitted it did not however suit my plans to accept your invitation i had a message from mr foley begging me to see him tonight i have been to his house  the young man distinctly scowled  so foleys been getting at you has he  maratons face was inscrutable but there was for a moment a dangerous flash in his eyes  i had some conversation with him this evening  what did he want graveling asked bluntly  maraton raised his eyebrows he turned to the girl  do you know mr graveling  the young man scowled julia smiled but there was a shadow of trouble in her face  naturally she replied mr graveling and i are fellow workers  yes we are that the young man declared pointedly that and a little more i hope to tell you the truth i followed miss thurnbrein here and i think shed have done better to have asked for my escortthe escort of the man shes going to marrybefore she came here alone at this time of night mr gravelings illhumour was explained he was of the order of those to whom the ability to conceal their feelings is not given and he was obviously in a temper maratons face remained impassive the girl however stood suddenly erect there was a vivid spot of colour in her cheeks  you had better keep to the truth richard graveling she cried fearlessly i have never promised to marry you or if i have it was under certain conditions you had no right to follow me here  the young man opened his lips and closed them again he was scarcely capable of speech the very intensity of his anger seemed to invest the little scene with a peculiar significance the girl had the air of one who has proclaimed her freedom the face of the man who glared at her was distorted with unchained passions in the background maraton stood with tired but expressionless countenance and the air of one who listens to a quarrel between children a quarrel in which he has no concern  it is not fair julia continued to discuss a purely personal matter here you can walk home with me if you care to richard graveling but all that i have to say to you i prefer to say here i never promised to marry you you have always chosen to take it for granted and i have let you speak of it because i was indifferent because i have never chosen to think of such matters because my thoughts have been wholly wholly dedicated to the greatest cause in the world tonight you have forced yourself upon me you have done yourself harm not good you have surprised the truth in my heart it is clear to me that icannot marry you i never could i shall not change now let us go back to our work hand in hand if you will but that other matter is closed between us forever  she turned to say farewell to maraton but graveling interposed himself between them his voice shook and there were evil things in his distorted face  tonight for the first time he exclaimed hoarsely you speak in this fashion before even if you were indifferent marriage at least seemed possible to you tonight you say that the truth has come to you you look at me with different eyes you draw back you begin to feel to understand you are a woman tonight why answer me that why why tonight why not before why is it that tonight you have awakened i will know look at me  she was taken unawares assailed suddenly not only by his words but by those curious new sensations her own yet unfamiliar to her it was civil war a part of herself was in league with her accuser she felt the blushes stain her cheeks she looked imploringly at maraton for help he smiled at her reassuringly delightfully  children he expostulated this is absurd off with you to your homes these are small matters of which you speak  his hands were courteously laid upon both of them he led them to the door and pointed eastwards through the darkness  think of the morning think of the human beings who wake in a few hours only to bend their bodies once more to the yoke the other things are but trifles  she looked back at him from the corner of the square a straight impassive figure in a little halo of soft light there was a catch in her heart her companions words were surely spoken in some foreign tongue  we have got to have this out julia he was saying if anybody or anything has come between us theres going to be trouble if thats the great maraton with his swagger evening clothes and big house well hes not the man for our job and i shant mind being the first to tell him so  she glanced at him for a moment almost in wonder was he indeed so small so insignificant  there are many paths she said softly which lead to the light ours may be best suited to ourselves but it may not be the only one it is not for you or for me to judge  richard graveling talked on doing his cause harm with every word he uttered julia relapsed into silence soon she did not even hear his words they rode for some distance on an omnibus through the city now shrouded and silent at the corner of the street where she had her humble lodgings he left her  well i have had my say he declared think it over ill meet you out of work tomorrow if i can we shall have had a talk with mr maraton by that time  she left him with a smile upon her lips his absence seemed like an immense a wonderful relief once more her thoughts were free    chapter v  but were they free after all these thoughts of hers  julia rose at daybreak and fully dressed stood watching the red light eastwards staining the smokehung city her little room with its plain deal furniture its uncarpeted floor was the perfection of neatness her bed already made her little pots of flowers upon the windowsill jealously watered in the still smaller sittingroom visible through the open door she could hear the hissing of her kettle upon the little spirit lamp her hat and gloves were already out everything was in readiness for her early start  she had slept very much as usual and had got up only a little earlier than she was accustomed to yet there was a difference only so short a time ago the incidents of her own daily life even the possibilities connected with it had seemed utterly insignificant so little worthy of notice morning and night her heart had been full of the sufferings of those amongst whom she worked the flagrant hateful injustice of this illarranged world had throbbed in her pulses absorbed her interests had occupied the whole horizon of her life to marry richard graveling might sometime be advisable in the interests of their joint labours and suddenly it had become impossible it had become utterly impossible why  the red light in the sky had faded the sun was now fully risen julia looked out of her window and was dimly conscious of the change the heart which had throbbed for the sorrows of others was to thrill now on its own account it was something mysterious which had happened to her something against which she was later on to fight passionately which was creeping like poison through her veins with her splendid womanhood her intense consciousness of life how was it possible for her to escape  there was an impatient tap at the door and aaron came in she recognised him with a little cry of surprise he was paler than ever and grim with his nights vigil the lines under his eyes were deeper his skin seemed sallower he had the dishevelled look of one who is still in his attire of the preceding day  you have heard he exclaimed we stayed at the clarion till three maraton never even sent us a message yet they say that he is in london they even declare that he was at downing street last night  i know that he was there julia said quietly  you know you but they were all sure of it  he dashed his cap into a corner  maraton is our man he continued passionately no one shall rob us of him he should have come to us downing streetblast downing street  there is no one in this world she told him gently who will move maraton from his will i know i have seen him  he stared at her holloweyed amazed  you you have seen him  she nodded  i heard by accident of the house he had taken the house where he means to live i went there and i waited later richard graveling came there too  the youth struck the table before him his eyes were filled with tears  all night i waited he cried i could not sit still i could scarcely breathe tell me what he is like julia tell me what he looks like is he strong does he look strong enough for the work  she smiled at him reassuringly  yes he looks strong and he looks kind for the rest  there is something tell me what it isat once  foolish well he is unlike richard graveling and the others unlike us why not he is cultivated educated welldressed  the youth for a moment was aghast  you dont meanthat he is a gentleman  not in the sense you fear she assured him remember that his work is more farreaching than ours it takes him everywhere he must be fit for everything sit down now dear aaron you are tired see my morning tea is ready and there is bread and butter you must eat and drink maraton you will surely see later in the day i do not think that he will disappoint you  aaron sat down at the table he ate and drank ravenously he was in fact half starved but barely conscious of it  he spoke of the great things  julia shook her head she was busy cutting bread and butter  scarcely at all what chance was there and then richard graveling came  they were friends they took to one another the young man asked eagerly  she hesitated  i am not sure about that graveling was in one of his tempers he was rude and he said things to me which i felt obliged to contradict  they did not quarrel  she laughed softly  imagine maraton quarrelling i think that he is above such pettiness aaron  graveling is a good fellow and a hard worker aaron declared the one thing which he lacks is enthusiasm he doesnt really feel he does his work well because it is his work not because of what it leads to  you are right julia admitted he has no enthusiasm that is why he never moves people when he speaks i must go soon aaron will you lie down and rest for a time here  rest he looked at her scornfully how can one rest tell me where this house of his is i shall go and wait outside i must see him  she glanced at the clock and paused for a moment to think  aaron she decided i will be late for once come with me and i will take you to him he was kind to me last night we will go together to his house and wait till he is down then i will tell him how you have longed for his coming and perhaps  perhaps what aaron interrupted you cant escape from it you have promised you shall take me i am ready to go perhaps what  i was only thinking she went on you find it i know impossible to settle down to work anywhere but with him if he could find something  aaron sprang to his feet  i would work my fingers to the bone he cried it is a glorious idea julia i have to give up the collectingmy bicycle has gone let us start  they went out together into the streets thinly peopled as yet for it was barely six oclock julia would have loitered but her brother forced her always onward she laughed as they arrived at the square where maraton lived every house they passed was shuttered and silent  how absurd we are she murmured he will not be up for hours very likely even the servants will not be astir  servants  aaron repeated the word frowning she only smiled  you mustnt be foolish dear dont have prejudices remember that we are walking along a very narrow way we have climbed only a few steps of the hill he is more than halfway to the top things are different with him dont judge only wait  she rang the bell of the house a little timidly the door was opened without any delay by a man servant in sombre everyday clothes  we wish to see mr maraton julia announced he is not up yet of course but might we come in and wait  mr maraton is in his study madam the man answered  he disappeared and beckoned them a moment or so later to follow him they were shown into a much smaller apartment at the rear of the house maraton was sitting before a desk covered with papers with a breakfast tray by his side he looked up at their entrance but his face was inexpressive he did not even smile the sunlight died out of julias face and her heart sank  i am sorry she began haltingly i ought not to have come again i know but it is my brother night and day he has thought of nothing else but your coming  aaron seemed to have forgotten his timidity he crossed the room and stood before maratons desk his face seemed to have caught some of the freshness of the early morning he was no longer the sallow pinched starveling he was like a young prophet whose eyes are burning with enthusiasm  you have come to help us he asserted you are maraton  i have come to help you maraton replied i have come to do what i can it isnt an easy task in this country you know to do anything but i think in the end we shall succeed if you are julia thurnbreins brother you should know something of the work  i am only one of the multitude aaron sighed i havent the brains to organise i talk sometimes but i get too excited there are othersmany otherswho speak more convincingly but no one feels more than i feel no one prays for the better times more fervently than i it isnt for myselfit isnt for ourselves even its for the children its for the next generation  maraton held out his hand suddenly  my young friend he said you have spoken the words i like to hear some of my helpers i have found at times selfish they are satisfied with the small things that lie close at hand some material benefit which really is of no account at all that isnt the work for us to engage in sit down sit down miss julia you have breakfasted  before we left julia assured him  never mind you shall breakfast again maraton declared it is a good augury that the first words i have heard from one of ourselves have been words such as your brother has spoken to tell you the truth i came over here in fear and trembling some of your leaders have frightened me a little  you mean aaron began  that they dont hold their heads high enough i am not for strikes that finish with a shilling a week more for the men or for acts of parliament which dole out tardy charity i am for the bigger things last night i lay awake thinkingyour friend richard graveling set me thinking we must aim high i am here for no mans individual good i am here to plan not pinpricks but destruction  the servant brought in more breakfast they sat and talked maraton asking many questions concerning the men whom he would meet later in the day then he looked regretfully at the great pile of letters still before him  i shall need a secretary he said slowly  aaron sprang to his feet  take me he begged i have been in a newspaper office i am slow at shorthand but i can type like lightning i will work morning and night i want nothing but a little food if i may go about with you and hear you speak oh take me  maraton smiled  you are engaged he declared go out and hire a typewriter and bring it here in a cab you can start at once i hope  this minute aaron agreed his voice breaking with excitement  maraton passed him money and took them both to the door  tell me about tonight julia asked will you go to the clarion shall you speak  maraton shook his head  no i have written to the men whom i am anxious to meet here and asked them to come to me i should prefer not to speak at all until i go to manchester i have plans but i must not speak of them for the moment  i had hoped so to hear you speak tonight she murmured and her face fell  they stood together at the door and looked out across the green treetops towards the city  the time has gone by for speeches he said quietly perhaps before very long you may hear greater things than words  they hurried offjulia to the factory aaron to a typewriting depot in new oxford street at the corner of the square they parted  are you satisfied she asked  his face was all aglow  satisfied julia you told me nothing he is wonderfulsplendid  she climbed on to a bus with a little smile upon her lips the long days work before her seemed like a holiday task then she laughed softly as she found herself repeating her brothers fervid words  maraton has come    chapter vi  maraton spent three hours and a half that morning in conclave with the committee appointed for his reception and for that three hours and a half he was profoundly bored every one had a good deal to say except richard graveling who sat at the end of the table with folded arms and a scowl upon his face the only other man who scarcely opened his lips during the entire time was maraton himself peter dale labour member for newcastle was the first to make a direct appeal he was a stalwart grimlooking man with heavy grey eyebrows and grey beard he had been a member of parliament for some years and was looked upon as the practical leader of his party  weve heard a lot of you mr maraton he declared of your fine fighting methods and of your gift of speech well hear more of that i hope at manchester we are so to speak strangers as yet but theres one thing i will say for you and that is that youre a good listener youve heard all that weve got to say and youve scarcely made a remark you wont object to my saying that were expecting something from you in the way of initiative not to say leadership  maraton glanced down the table there were five men seated there and a little apart from all of them david ross who had refused to be shaken off excepting him only they were wellfed and substantial looking men maraton had studied them carefully through halfclosed eyes during all the time of their meeting and the more he had studied them the more disappointed he had become there was not one of them with the eyes of a dreamer there was not one of them who appeared capable of dealing with any subject save from his own absolutely material and practical point of view  maraton from the first had felt a seal laid upon his lips now when the time had come for him to speak he did so with hesitation almost with reluctance  as yet he began there is very little for me to talk about you are i understand you five a committee appointed by the labour party to confer with me as to the best means of promulgating our beliefs you have each told me your views you would each apparently like me to devote myself to your particular district for the purpose of propagating a strike which shall result in a trifling increase of wages  and a coal strike i say peter dale interrupted is the logical first course weve been threatening it for two years and its time we brought it off i can answer for the miners of the north country we have two hundred and seventy thousand pounds laid by and the unions are spoiling for a fight another eighteenpence would make life a different thing for some of our pitmen and the masters can afford it too sixteen and a half per cent is the average dividend on the largest collieries around us  a small man with gimletlike black eyes and a heavy moustache at which he had been tugging nervously during peter dales remarks plunged into the discussion his name was abraham weavel and he came from sheffield  coals all very well he declared but i speak for the ironfounders theres orders enough in leeds and sheffield to keep the furnaces ablaze for two years and the masters minting money at it our wages aint to be compared with the miners weve twenty thousand in sheffield that arent drawing twentyfive shillings a week and theyre about fed up with it weve our unions too and money to spare and i tell you theyre beginning to ask whats the use of sending a labour member to parliament and having nothing come of it  a greywhiskered man who had the look of a preacher struck the table before him with a sudden vigour  you remember who i am mr maraton my names bordensamuel bordenand i am from the potteries its all very well for weavel and dale there to talk but theres no labour on gods earth so underpaid as the china and glass worker we may not have the money savedthats simply because it takes my people all they can do to keep from starvation ive figures here thatll prove what i say ill go so far as thisthere isnt a worse paid industry than mine in the united kingdom  there was a moments silence abraham weavel leaned back in his chair and yawned peter dale made a grimace of dissent maraton turned to one of the little company who as yet had scarcely opened his lipsa thin asceticlooking middleaged man who wore gold spectacles and who had an air of refinement which was certainly not shared by any of the others  and you mr culvain he enquired you represent no particular industry i believe you were a journalist were you not before you entered parliament  i was and am a journalist culvain assented since you have asked my opinion i must confess that i am all for more peaceful methods these labour troubles which inconvenience and bring loss upon the community do harm to our cause i am in favour of a vigorous course of platform education through all the country districts of england i think that the principles of socialism are not properly understood by the working classes  if one might make a comment upon all that you have said maraton remarked i might point out to you that there is a certain selfishness in your individual suggestions three of you are in favour of a gigantic strike each in his own constituency mr culvain who is a writer and an orator prefers the methods which appeal most to him yet even these strikes which you propose are puny affairs you want to wage war for the sake of a few shillings we ought to fight if at all for a greater and more splendid principle it isnt a shilling or two more a week that the people want its a sharea share to which they are without the shadow of a doubt entitledin the direct product of their labour  thats sound enough peter dale admitted how are you going to get it  you ask for too much weavel observed and you get nothing  it is never wise culvain suggested quietly to have the public against one  maraton rose a little abruptly to his feet he had the air of one eager to dismiss the subject  gentlemen he announced ive heard your views in a few days time you shall hear mine only let me tell you this to me you all seem to be working and thinking on very narrow lines your object seems to be the securing of small individual benefits for your individual constituents i think that if we get to work together in this country there must be something more national in our aspirations that is all i have to say for the present as i think you know i intend to make a pronouncement of my own views at manchester  they all took their leave a little later maraton himself saw them out and watched them across the square somehow or other his depression had visibly increased as he turned away he had come into contact lately on the other side of the world with a different order of personmen and women too passionately strenuously in earnest they were wellfed prosperous individuals these whom he had just dismissed their politics were their business their position as members of parliament a source of unmixed joy to all of them hardheaded men very likely good each in his own department beyond that nothing  he returned presently to his study where aaron was already at work typing letters  so that is your committee of labour members maraton remarked throwing himself into an easy chair  aaron looked up  they are all sound men he declared peter dale too is a fine speaker  maraton sighed  yet it isnt from them he said quietly that i can take a mandate i must go to the people i couldnt even talk to them today i couldnt take them into my confidence i couldnt show them the things i have seen perhaps only in my dreams i dont suppose they would have listened    how many more letters aaron  thirtyseven sir  maraton rose to his feet  i shall walk for an hour or so he announced get them ready for me to sign when i come in have you a home young man  none sir aaron admitted  excellent maraton declared cheerfully these people with homes lose sight of the real thing what do you think of your labour members honestly aaron ah i can see that they have been little gods to you little tin gods i am afraid aaron do they know what it is to go hungry i wonder not often    get on with your letters i am going out  maraton walked to the park and sat down underneath the trees there were a fair number of people about notwithstanding the hot weather and very soon he recognised lady elisabeth she was walking back and forth along one of the sidewalks with a little fussy woman goldenhaired and wearing a gown of the brightest blue maraton watched them at first idly and then with interest lady elisabeth in her cool muslin gown and simple hat seemed to be moving in a world of her own into which her companions chatter but rarely penetrated she walked with a slow and delicate grace not without a characteristic touch of languor once or twice she looked around herone might almost have imagined that she was seeking escape from her companionand on one of these occasions her eyes met maratons she stopped short they were within a few feet of one another and maraton rose to his feet she lowered her parasol and held out her hand  only a very short time ago she told him i was wondering what you were doing you know that my uncle is expecting to see or hear from you this afternoon  i know he admitted to tell you the truth i came out here to think i could not quite make up my mind what to say to him  it is strange that we should meet here she continued when mr foley was talking to me about you for so long this morning he wished that he had laid more emphasis upon the fact that your coming to us at lyndwood committed you to nothing no one is the worse off for hearing every point of view is he my uncle will feel so much happier if he really has had the opportunity of having a long uninterrupted talk with you  maraton smiled pleasantly they were standing in a crowded part of the walk and almost unconsciously they commenced to move slowly along together lady elisabeth turned to her companion  you must let me introduce mr maraton to you she said this is mr maratonmrs bollingtonwatts  the little woman leaned forward and looked at maraton with undisguised curiosity  forgive my starting at your name wont you mr maraton she began it is uncommon isnt it and im only just over from the states i dare say you read about all those awful doings in chicago  maraton without direct reply inclined his head mrs bollingtonwatts continued volubly  my brother is a judge out in chicago it was he who signed the warrant for maratons arrest im afraid our people are getting much too scared nowadays about that sort of thing we dont seem to be able to enforce our laws like you do over here they are all saying now that it ought to have been served and the man shot if there had been any resistance  in which case maraton remarked i should not have had the pleasure of making your acquaintance mrs bollingtonwatts  she stared at him for a moment speechless through sheer lack of comprehension then she glanced at lady elisabeth and the truth dawned upon her it was more than she could grapple with at first however  you but lady elisabeth but you mr maratonare you really the man who murwho was associated with all that trouble in chicago  i am without a doubt the man maraton assented cheerfully i am an enemy of your class mrs bollingtonwatts your husband is the steel millionaire isnt he and i am also a socialist of the most militant and modern type nevertheless i can assure you for these few moments you are perfectly safe  mrs bollingtonwatts drew a little breath the remarkable adaptability of her race came to her rescue her point of view swung round  why she declared i have never been so interested in my life this is perfectly thrilling mr maraton i am having a few friends come in tomorrow evening i should dearly love to give them a surprise couldnt you just drop in for an hour or better still if you could dine i have taken lenchester house for a year my it would be good to see their faces  maraton shook his head  thank you very much mrs bollingtonwatts he said but my visit to england is one of business only to be frank with you i have no social existence nor any desire to cultivate one  but you know lady elisabeth the little woman protested  i have the honour of knowing lady elisabeth incidentally maraton replied if you will excuse me now  mrs bollingtonwatts turned aside to talk vigorously to a passerby lady elisabeth laid her hand upon his arm  mr maraton she said softly do make up your mind please come to lyndwood  her blue eyes were raised to his fearlessly appealingly maraton was more than ever conscious of the delicate perfection of her person her clear skin her silky brown hair she was something new to him in her sex he knew quite well that a request from her was an unusual thing  i will come lady elisabeth he promised gravely beyond that of course i can say nothing but i will come to lyndwood  the slight anxiety passed from her face like a cloud her smile was positively brilliant  it is charming of you she whispered  mrs bollingtonwatts was once more free and by their side they moved on to the corner and maraton was on the point of taking his leave just at that moment mrs bollingtonwatts gave a little cry of amazement a coach was drawn up by the side of the path and a young man who was driving it was looking down at them mrs bollingtonwatts stopped and waved her hand at him almost frantically  why its freddy lawes she exclaimed why freddy what on earth are you doing here if this isnt a surprise they told me you never moved from paris and i thought id have to come right over there to see you    well i declare freddywhy freddy whats the matter  the words of mrs bollingtonwatts seemed as though they had been spoken into empty air the young man was leaning forward in his place the reins loosely held in his hand and a groom was already upon the path recovering the whip which had slipped from his fingers his eyes were fixed not upon mrs bollingtonwatts nor upon lady elisabeth but upon maraton he was a young man of harmless and commonplace appearance but his features were at that moment transformed his mouth was strained and quivering his eyes were lit with something very much like horror some words certainly left his lips but they did not carry to the hearing of any one of those three people he looked at maraton with the fierce terrified intentness of one who looks upon a spectre    chapter vii  mrs bollingtonwatts shrill voice once more broke the silence which although it was a matter of seconds only was not without a certain peculiar dramatic quality  say whats wrong with you freddy you dont think im a ghost do you cant you come down and talk  the spell whatever it may have been had passed the young man lifted his hat and leaned over the side of the coach  i wont get down just now amy he said tell me where you are and ill come and see you hows richard  maraton obeying a gesture from lady elisabeth moved away with her leaving mrs bollingtonwatts absorbed in a flood of family questions and answers  come back with me now wont you she asked a little abruptly my uncle is restless and unwell this afternoon and it will perhaps relieve him to have your decision  what about mrs bollingtonwatts  lady elisabeth glanced at him for a moment her eyebrows were slightly lifted  if you can bear to lose her im sure i can she is really rather a dear person but she is very intense she will meet a crowd of people she knows directly and quite forget that we have slipped away shall we go down birdcage walk or if you are in a hurry perhaps you would prefer a taxi  he shook his head  i prefer to walk  he did not at first prove a very entertaining companion they proceeded for some distance almost in silence  if i were a curious person lady elisabeth remarked i should certainly be puzzling my brain as to what there could have been about that very frivolous young man to call such an expression into your face and how terrified he was to see you  maraton smiled grimly  you have observation i perceive lady elisabeth  powers of observation but no curiosity thank goodness lady elisabeth declared perhaps that is just as well for i can see that you are going to turn out to be a very mysterious person  in some respects i believe that i am he assented equably my peculiar beliefs are responsible for a good deal you seeand certain circumstances    but tell mewe have both agreed to be frankwhy have you changed your attitude towards me so completely i scarcely dared to hope even for your recognition this morning  she was suddenly thoughtful  that was the very question i was asking myself when we crossed the street just now she remarked with a faint smile  maraton was conscious of a curious and undefined sense of pleasure in her words in the act of crossing he had held her arm for a few moments and though her assent to his physical guidance had been purely negative there was yet something about it which had given him a vague pleasure instinctively he knew that she was of the order of women to whom the merest touch from a man whom they disliked would have been torture  i think she went on that it is because i am trying to adopt my uncles point of view towards you  and what is your uncles point of view  he believes you she declared to be a very dangerous person a rabid enthusiast with brains and also stabilitythe most difficult order of person in the world to deal with  anything else  he believes you she continued to be harmless enough at a wholesome period of our countrys history just now he told me yesterday that he considered it was within your power to bring something very much like ruin upon the country  maraton was silent he felt singularly indisposed for argument every condition of life just then seemed too pleasant they were walking in the shade and a soft west wind was rustling in the trees above their heads  there are after all she said so many happy people in the world is it worth while to drag down the pillars to bring so much misery into the world for the sake of a dream  i am no dreamer he insisted quietly it is possible to make absolute laws for the future with the same precision as one can extract examples from the history of the past  but human nature she objected is always a shifting quality  only in detail the heart and lungs of it are the same in all ages  they crossed the road and turned into st jamess park he paused for a moment to look at the front of buckingham palace  a hateful sight to you of course she murmured  not in the least he assured her on the contrary i think that the actual government of this country is wonderful i suppose my creed of life would command a halter from any one who heard it but i raise my hat always to your king  it is going to take me ages she sighed to understand you  i will supply you with the necessary signposts he promised perhaps you will find then that the task will become almost too easy for me i am afraid it will prove too short  she turned her head and looked at him curiously there was something provocative in the curl of her lips and in her monosyllabic question  why  because when you have arrived at a complete understanding he declared i fear we shall have reached the parting of our ways  she looked steadfastly ahead  wouldnt that rather rest with you she asked  they passed a flowerbarrow wonderfully laden and she half stopped with a little exclamation  oh i must have some of those white roses she begged they fit in at this moment with one of my only superstitions  he bought her a great handful she held them in both hands and gave him her parasol to carry  mine is an inherited superstition so i will not be ashamed of it she told him we have always believed that white roses bring happiness especially if they come accidentally at a critical moment  he glanced behind at the retreating figure of the flower woman  if happiness is so easily purchased he said what a pity it is that i did not buy the barrowful  it isnt a matter of quantity at all she assured him one blossom would have been enough and you were really frightfully extravagant  she drifted into silence they were walking eastwards now and before them was the great yellow haze which hung over the sunenveloped city a haze which stretched across the whole arc of the heavens and underneath which were toiling the millions to whom his life was consecrated for a moment the grim inappropriateness of these hours struck him with a pang of remorse he felt almost like a traitor to be walking with this slim beautiful girl whose face was hidden from him now in the mass of white blossoms and then his sense of proportion came to the rescue he knew that he had but one desireto work out his ends by the most effective means it did not even disturb him to reflect that for the first time for many years he had found pleasure in what was merely an interlude  we turn here she directed you see we are close to home now my uncle will be so glad to see you mr maraton and i cannot tell you how delighted i am that you are coming to lyndwood  i only hope he said a little gravely that your uncle will not expect too much from my coming it seems churlish to refuse and even though our views are as far apart as the poles i know that your uncle means well  she smiled at him delightfully  i refuse to be depressed even by your solemn looks she declared it is my twentyfourth birthday today and i am still young enough to cling to my optimism  your birthday he remarked i should have brought you an offering  she held up the roses  nothing in the world she assured him softly could have given me more pleasure than these now i am going to take you first into a little den where you will not be disturbed and then fetch my uncle she added as they passed into the house i shall pray for your mutual conversion you wont mind a very feminine room will you just now there are certain to be callers at any moment and my uncles rooms are liable to all manner of intrusions  she threw open the door and ushered him into what seemed indeed to be a little fairy chamber a chamber with yellow walls and yellow rug white furniture oddments of china and photographs silvergrey etchings watercolour landscapes piles of books and magazines on a small table stood a yellow sèvres vase full of roses  its a horrible place for a man to sit in she said looking around her you must take that wicker chair and throw away as many cushions as you like now i am going to fetch my uncle and remember please she concluded looking back at him from the door if i have seemed frivolous this morning i am not always so more than anything i am looking forward down at lyndwood to have you if you will talk to me seriously  shall i dare to argue with you i wonder he asked  she smiled at him  why not a matter of courage  the bravest person in the world he declared remembers always that little proverb about discretion    chapter viii  the conference between mr foley and maraton was brief enough the former arrived a few moments after his nieces departure  i have come maraton announced as they shook hands to accept your invitation to lyndwood you understand i am sure that that commits me to nothing  mr foleys expression was one of intense relief  naturally he replied i quite understand that i am delighted to think that you are coming at all may i ask whether you have conferred with your friends about the matter  maraton shook his head  i have not even mentioned it to them i met what i understand to be a committee of the labour party this morninga mr dale abraham weavel culvain samuel borden and david ross those were the names so far as i can remember i did not mention my proposed visit to you at all there seemed to me to be no necessity i am subject to no one here  mr foley smiled  they wont like it he declared frankly  their liking or disliking it will not affect the situation in the least maraton assured him i shall come without a doubt it will interest me to hear what you have to say although unfortunately i cannot hold out the slightest hope  that is entirely understood mr foley interrupted now how will you come lyndwood park is just sixty miles from london today is friday isnt it i shall motor down there sometime tomorrow why wont you come down with me  maraton shook his head  if you will excuse me he said i will not fix any time definitely i have a good deal of correspondence still to attend to and there is one little matter which might keep me in town till the afternoon  let me send a car up for you mr foley suggested  thank you maraton replied i have already hired one for a time  then come just at what time suits you mr foley beggedthe sooner the better of course apart from that i shall be about the place all day  in buckingham gate maraton came slowly to a standstill the coach which he had seen in the park an hour ago was drawn up in front of a large hotel the young man who was driving it had just come down the steps and was drawing on his gloves they met almost face to face  am i to speak to you the young man asked  you had better maraton assented tell me what you are doing here  i was bored with paris the young man answered my friends were all coming here i had no idea that we were likely to meet  maraton looked at him thoughtfully as they stood face to face at that moment there was a certain strange likeness between them a likeness of the husk only  i do not wish to interfere with your movements maraton said calmly where you are is nothing to me i proposed that you should remain away from london simply because i fancied that it would be easier for you to observe the conditions which exist between us so long as you remember them however your whereabouts are indifferent to me  the young man laughed a little nervously  youre not overcordial  maraton shrugged his shoulders  the world in which you live he remarked is a training school i suppose for false sentiment the slight kinship that there is between us is of no account to me i simply remind you once more that it is to your advantage to neither know me or to know of me remember that and it may be london or paris or new yorkwherever you choose  the young man remounted his coach and maraton passed on he walked without a pause to the square in which his house was situated here he found aaron hard at work and sitting down at once he began to sign his letters  no end of people have been here aaron announced i have got rid of them all  good maraton said shortly bythebye aaron isnt there a meeting tonight at the clarion  aaron nodded  david ross is going to speak he can move them when he starts my sister is going to call here for me and i thought if you didnt want me id like to go  we will all go together maraton decided we can creep in somewhere at the back i suppose i want to hear how they do it  the young mans face lit up with joy  theres sure to be lots of people there he declared but we can find a seat at the back quite easily  whats it all about maraton asked  the proposed boilermakers strike aaron replied eagerly the meeting is really a meeting of the workpeople at bouldings but are you sure you wont go on the platform sir  maraton shook his head  that is just what i dont want to do i want to see what these meetings are like what sort of arguments are used what the spirit of the people is if i can that is what i would really like to find out aaronthe spirit of the people  the young man looked up from his work he was greatly changed during the last few hours he was wearing a new suit of clothes and clean linen his hair had been cut his face shaved yet in some respects he was unaltered his eyes still burned in their sockets his lips still quivered  i will tell you what the people are like he said they are like dumb animals like sheep they have suffered so long and so much that their nerve power is numbed they lack will they lack initiative they are narrowed down to a daily life which makes of them something little different from an animal yet they can be roused david ross himself has done it done it like none of those other mps i have seen him carried out of himself he is like some of these welshmen and salvation army people when theyre half drunk with religionthe words seem to come to them in a stream thats how david ross is sometimes but it isnt often any one can get at them  that is what they say over on the other side he remarked softly  theyve got to be in such a state aaron continued that nothing appeals to them except some material benefit a pipe of tobacco or a mug of beer will stir them more than any dream of freedom oh its sad to see them often i used to go to the gates at the shipbuilding yard and watch them come out ten years about does for a man there its a short spell  maraton sighed yet they endure he muttered to himself  yet they endure aaron echoed cant you see why dont you know that it is because they havent heard the wordthe one great word thats what theyre waiting forfor the prophet to open their eyes and lead them out of the wilderness only just at first it may be that even his voice will sound in vain you are sure you wont mind my sister coming with us sir she is so interested and they all know her down there  it will be an advantage to have your sister maraton replied there are many things i should like to ask her    chapter ix  at twenty minutes past eight maraton with his two companions reached the building in which the meeting was to take placea plain unimposinglooking edifice built for a chapel whitewashed inside but with plastered walls and bare floors the room was almost packed and it was with some difficulty that they found seats in the back row david ross peter dale and graveling occupied chairs on the platform between them julia and aaron kept maraton informed as to the identity of each newcomer  thats mr docker who is going to speak now the latter declared in an excited whisper he is a fighting man its he who has manoeuvred this strike they say now hes off  mr docker has risen to his feet amidst a little hoarse cheering for a quarter of an hour or more he spoke fluently and convincingly it appeared from his statements that boilermakers were the worst paid mechanics in the universe that it was he who had discovered this that it was he who had drawn up the ultimatum which had been presented to the masters and refused his peroration was friendly but appealing  there are some amongst bouldings people he wound up who they tell me are satisfied if so i hope they are not here they havent any place here to them i would sayif you are satisfied with twentyfour shillings a week well dont waste a penny in subscribing to the unions but go and spend your twentyfour shillings a week and live on it and enjoy it and get fat on it if you can but to those others i want to say that its just as easy to get twentyeight the masters dont want you to strike just now you only have to be firm and you can get whats fair and right  a man rose up in the hall  is it true he asked that bouldings wont pay the advancethat they are going to close the doors tomorrow if we insist upon it  it is true mr docker answered are you afraid of that  the man hesitated  i dont know as afraid is exactly the word he said but i dont fancy being out of work for a month or so and perhaps losing my job at the end of it fifteen bob a week from the union wont keep my little lot  there was a murmur of applause docker pointed with threatening forefinger to the man who had just sat down  its the likes of him he declared who keep down wages who make slaves of us the likes of him who havent the pluck to ask for what they might get at any time  he plunged into facts and figures and maraton more than once yawned he seemed to find more interest in watching the faces of the audience than in listening to the stock arguments which were being thrown at their heads a little cloud of tobacco smoke hung about the room there were few women present and most of the men were smoking on the whole they were a very earnest gathering there were very few there who were not deeply interested julia was listening to every word her head resting upon her hand her lips a little parted her eyes full of smouldering fires at the end of dockers speech one of the union officials got up on his feet it was for the men themselves to decide he said they had subscribed the money it was for them to say whether it should be used was the moment propitious for a blow on behalf of their rights if they thought so then let it be war if they asked for his advice they were welcome to it his advice was to fight the masters had refused their reasonable ultimatum let the masters try and carry out their contracts without work people that was his way of looking at it  there was a rumble of applause the militants were certainly in the majority a man got up from one of the front rows  i propose he said that we strike tomorrow they are working us as hard as they can in shifts on special jobs now in case they should get left every hour we work makes it better for them i say strike  there was a thunder of applause a ballot box was brought and placed on a table in front of the platform  they will strike aaron mutteredthree thousand of them splendid  maraton shook his head  it is piecemeal work this they do not understand  they do not understand what julia asked him turning her head swiftly  he shrugged his shoulders  they will ask for five shillings a week more and get halfacrown he said halfacrown a week what difference can it make do you know what bouldings put on one side for distribution to their shareholders last yearwhat they put to their reserve fund why it was a fortune  a man from somewhere at the back of the hall climbed on to a seat to get a better view and suddenly pointed out maraton to his neighbours a little murmur arose from the vicinity some one mentioned his name the cry was taken up from the other side of the hall  maraton  maraton  maraton sat back frowning the cries however became more insistent the occupants of the platform were leaning forward towards him the chairman rose in his feet and beckoned with obvious reluctance maraton moved a few steps to the front from the far corners of the illlit hall whitefaced men climbed on to the benches peering through the cloud of smoke which hung almost like fog about the place they saluted him in all manner of wayswith catcalls hurrahs stamping of feet clapping of hands maraton who had climbed up on to the platform was soon surrounded  dale held out his hand  thought you werent going to honour us here mr maraton he remarked gruffly  i had not meant to maraton replied i came as one of the audience i wanted to hear to understand if i could  dale stretched out his hand  this is mr docker he said performing the introduction mr dockermr maraton  come to support us sir i hope the former remarked  i came to listen maraton answered to tell you the truth its against my views this an individual strike  they were calling to him now from the front mr dockers reply was inaudible  youll have to say a few words dale insisted theyll never leave off until you do  maraton nodded and turned towards the audience he stood looking down at them for a moment or two without speech even after silence had been established he seemed to be at a loss as to exactly what to say when at last he did speak it was in an easy and conversational manner there was no sign of the fire or the frenzy with which he had kindled the enthusiasms of the people of the united states  i find it rather hard to know exactly what to say to you he began i am glad to be here and i have come to this country to work for you if i may but you know i have views of my own and it isnt a very auspicious occasion for me to stand for the first time upon an english platform i came as one of the audience tonight and i have listened to all that has been said i dont think that i am in favour of your strike  there was a murmur of wonder mingled with discontent  why not some one shouted from the back  aye why not a dozen voices echoed  ill try and tell you if you like maraton continued i didnt mean to say anything until after manchester but ill tell you roughly what my scheme is these individual strikes such as youre planning are just like pinpricks on the hide of an elephant how many are there of you a thousand say well you thousand may get a shilling or two a week more it wont alter your condition of life it wont do much for you any way you will have spent your money and in a year or two the masters will be taking it out of you some other way a strike such as you are proposing causes inconvenienceno more id bigger things in my mind for you  he hesitated for a moment as though uncertain even now whether to go on glancing around the hall his eyes for a moment met julias something in her still face the almost passionate enquiry of her wonderful eyes seemed to decide him he lifted up his hands his voice grew in volume  let me tell you what i want then let me tell you the dream which others have had before me which is laughed to scorn by the enemies of the people but which grows in substance and shape year by year i want to teach you how to smash the individual capitalist i want to teach you how to frame laws which will bring the wealth of this country into a new and saner distribution i want to teach you the folly of the old ideas that because of the wretched conditions in which you live the better educated man the man better equipped mentally and physically for his job must gather to himself the wealth and you must become his slaves what do you suppose in the course of three or four generations produces men of different mental and physical calibre i will tell you the circumstances of their bringingup the life they have to lead their education their environment what chance have you under present conditions none for very shame as the years pass on you operatives will be better paid what will it amount to a few shillings a week more the same life the same anxieties the same daily grinding toil brainless machinelike leading you nowhere because there isnt a way out there will still remain your masters there will still remain you the men cant you see what it is that i am aiming at i want to make a great machine of all the industries of this country the man with the gift for figures will find himself in the office and the man with lesser brain power will find himself before a machine but the two will be working for one aim and one end they will both be parts of the machine and for their livelihood they will take what that machine produces distributed in a scientific and exact ratio its cooperation over again you say very well call it that only i tell you why cooperation has failed up till now its because youve been in too much of a hurry i am going to appeal to you presently not for your own interests but in the interests of your children and your childrens children because the better days that are to come for you wont dawn yet awhile it may be even that you will be called upon to make sacrifices instead of finding yourselves better off there are some great changes which time alone can govern  what about this strike some one shouted from the bottom of the hall  you are quite right sir maraton replied swiftly ive wandered a little from my point i think that the first thing i said to you was that this strike if it took place would be like the pinprick on an elephants hide i want to teach you how to stab  there was a murmur of voicesapproving this time at any rate  cant you see maraton continued that society can easily deal with one strike at a time that isnt the way to make yourself felt what i want to see in this country is a simultaneous strike of wharfingers dock labourers railways and all the means of communication a strike which will stop the pulses of the nation a strike which will cost hundreds of millions a strike which may cost this country its place amongst the nations but which will mark the dawn of new conditions id put out your forge fires from glasgow to sheffield and sheffield to london id take the big risksthe rioting the revolutions the starvation the misery that will surely come id do that for the sake of the new nation which would start again where the old one perished  there was a sudden burst of applause a little thrill seemed to have found its way like zigzag lightning here and there amongst them but there were many who sat and smoked in stolid silence maraton looked into their faces and sighed to himself there were too many hungry people for his mission  we are half starved a man called from the back of the ball my wage is a pound a week and four children to keep its fine talk yours but it wont feed em  there was a murmur of sullen approval maratons hand shot out his finger quivered as it pointed to the man  i dont blame you he said but its the cry youve just raised which keeps you and a few other millions exactly in the places you occupy there are many generations as yet unborn to come from your children and your childrens children are they then to suffer as you have suffered  there was a little stir at the back of the platform a tall broadshouldered man pushed his way through to the front his face was pitted with smallpox he had black wiry hair small narrow eyes a large brutal mouth he took up his position in the middle of the platform ignoring maraton altogether  listen lads he began you are here tonight to decide whether or not you want another halfcrown on to your wages this man who has been talking to you has done big things in america i know nothing about him and im not rightly sure that i know whats at the back of his head if he is your friend hes our friend and we shall soon fall into line but tonight youre here to meet about that halfcrown its for you to say whether or no youll have it weve saved the money for the fight saved it from your wages got it with your sweat youve given up your beer for itaye and maybe your baccy weve saved the money and the times come to fight all that he saysjerking his elbow towards maratonsounds good enough thatll come in later are you for the strike  there was no doubt about the replya roar of approving voices maraton smiled at them and stepped down from the platform for the moment he was forgotten only julia whispered passionately in his ear as they moved out of the place  you should have gone on they didnt understand they have waited so long they could have waited a little longer  maraton did not answer until they reached the street then he stood a few steps in the background watching the people as they came out  i couldnt he said simply i felt as though i were offering stones for bread the stones were better perhaps but the cruelty was the same    chapter x  maraton walked alone with elisabeth on the following afternoon in the flower garden at lyndwood she was apologising for some unexpected additions to the number of their guests  mother always forgets whom she has asked down for the weekend she said and my uncle is far too sweet about it i know that he wanted to have as much time as possible alone with you before monday it is on monday you go to manchester isnt it  on monday he answered a little absently i have to make my bow to the democracy of your country in the evening  i wish i could make up my mind mr maraton she continued whether you have come over here for good or for evil  for evil that good may come of it i am afraid he rejoined would be the kindest interpretation you could put upon my enterprise here  the spectator calls you the missionary of unrest  the spectator i am afraid will become more violent later on  let us sit down here for a moment she suggested pointing to a seat you see we are just at the top of this long pathway and we get a view of the roses all the way down  it is very beautiful he admittedfar too beautiful  she raised her eyebrows  too beautiful is that possible  without a doubt he declared too much beauty is as bad as too little  and why is that surely it must be good for one to be surrounded by inspiring things  i am not sure that beauty does inspire anything except content he answered smiling i call this garden of yours for instance a most vicious place a perfect lotuseaters paradise positively i feel the energy slipping out of my bones as i sit here  then you shall be chained to that seat she threatened you will not be able to go to manchester and make trouble and my uncle will be able to sleep at nights  i feel that everything in life is slipping away from me he protested i ought to be thinking over what lam going to say to your country people and instead of that i am wondering whether there is anything more beautiful in the world than the blue haze over your meadows  she laughed and moved her parasol a little so that she could see him better  you know she said my uncle declares that if only you could be taught to imbibe a little more of the real philosophy of living you would become quite a desirable person  and what is the real philosophy of living  just now with him it is the laissez faire the noninterference with the essential forces of life especially the forces that concern other people she explained  he looked at her a little startled what instinct he wondered had led her to place her finger upon the one poison spot in his thoughts  i can see he remarked that i have found my way into a dangerous neighbourhood  she changed her position a little so as to face him her blue eyes were lit with laughter her lips mocked him usually reserved she seemed at that moment to be inspired with an instinct which was something almost more than coquetry she leaned a little towards him the aloofness of her carriage and manner had suddenly disappeared he was conscious of the perfection of her white muslin gown of the shape of her neck the delicate lines and grace of her slim young body  you shall be chained here she repeated my uncle has a new theory of individualism he thinks that if no one tried to improve anybody the world would be so much more livable a place shall we sit at his feet  he shook his head  i am not brave he said but i am at least discreet  do you think that you are she asked him quietly do you think that you are discreet in the sense of being wise are you sure that you are using your gifts for the best purpose for yourselfand other people  no one can be sure he replied i only follow my star  then are you sure that it is your star  no one can ever mistake that he declared sometimes one may lose ones way and one may even falter if the path is rugged but the star remains  she sighed her eyes seemed to have wandered away he felt that it was a trick to avoid looking at him for the moment  i do not want you to go to manchester on monday in your present mood she said i hate to think of you up there the stormy petrel the apostle of unrest and sedition if i were a roman woman i think that i would poison you tonight at dinnertime  quite an idea he remarked i am not at all sure that our having become too civilised for crime is a healthy sign of the times  i do wish she persisted that you would try and see things a little more humanly my uncle is full of enthusiasms about you you have had some conversation already havent you  we talked for an hour after luncheon maraton admitted your uncles is a very sane point of view i know just how he regards mea sort of dangerous enthusiast a firebrand with the knack of commanding attention the worst of it is that when i am with him he almost makes me feel like that myself  she laughed  all men of genius she declared must be impressionable we ought to set ourselves to discover your weak point  he smiled at her with upraised eyebrows there were times when he seemed to her like a boy  havent you discovered it  she made a little face and swung her parasol around when she spoke again she was very grave  mr maraton she begged please will you promise that before you go away you will talk to me again for a few minutes  it is a promise easily made he replied  but i mean seriously  i will talk to you at any time anyhow you wish he promised  she rose to her feet then  for the present you have promised to play tennis she reminded him please go and change your things  i must have a yellow rosebud for my buttonhole he begged  she arranged it herself in his coat he laughed as she swept aside a wisp of her hair which brushed his cheek  what a picture for the photographic press of america he exclaimed the anarchist of chicago and the prime ministers niece  what is an anarchist she asked him abruptly he opened the little iron gate which led out of the garden  a sower of fire and destruction he answered a highly unpleasant person to meet when hes in earnest  she looked into his face for a moment with a wistfulness which was almost passionate  please tell me at once that you arent  he pointed back to the garden  we have come out of the land of confessions on this side of the gate i am your uncles guest and i mustnt be teased with questions  before you go she threatened i shall take you back into the rosegarden  from their wicker chairs drawn under a great cedar tree mr foley and lord armley perhaps the most distinguished of his colleagues watched the slow approach of the two from the flower gardens lord armley who had only arrived during the last half hour was recovering from a fit of astonishment he had just been told of his fellow guest  granted even that the man is as dangerous as you say he remarked it is certainly creating a new precedent for you to bring him into the bosom of your family is it conversion bribery or poison that you have in your thoughts  influence if possible mr foley answered somehow or other i have always detected in his writing a vein of common sense  what the dickens is common sense lord armley growled  shall i say a sense of the fitness of things the prime minister replieda sense of proportion perhaps notwithstanding his extraordinary speeches in america i believe that to some extent maraton possesses it anyhow it seemed to me to be worth trying one couldnt face the idea of letting him go up north just now without making an effort  things are really serious there lord armley muttered  worse than any of us know mr foley agreed if you hadnt been coming here i should have sent for you last night the french ambassador was with me for an hour after dinner  no fresh trouble  it was a general conversation but his visit had its purposea very definite and threatening purpose too i do not blame france we are under great obligations to her already half her fleet is there to watch over our possessions she naturally must be sure of her quid pro quo everywhere all over the continent the idea seems to be spreading that we are going to be plunged into what really amounts to a civil war the coming of maraton has strengthened the peoples belief a country without the sinews of movement a country in which the working classes laid down their tools a country whose forges had flickered out and whose railroad tracks were deserted would simply be the helpless prey of any country who cared to pay off old scores  lord armley was looking curiously at the approaching couple  never saw a man he said half to himself who looked the part so little fellow must be wellbred foley  mr foley nodded  no one knows who his people were it doesnt really matter does it accident has made him a gentlemanaccident or fate perhaps that is why he has gained such an ascendency over the people the working classes of the country are most of them sick of their own labour members the practical men can see no further than their noses and the theorists are too far above their heads maraton is the only one who seems to understand you must have a talk with him armley  lady elisabeth with a little smile had turned towards the tennis courts and maraton came on alone mr foley turned to his companion  armley he said this is mr maratonlord armley  it is a pleasure to meet you mr maraton lord armley declared as the two men shook hands in such peaceful surroundings the press over here has not been too kind to you our ideas of your personality are rather based i am afraid upon the punch caricature youve seen it perhaps  maratons eyes lit up with mirth  excellent he observed i have had one framed  he is standing lord armley continued turning to mr foley on the topmost of three tubs his hair flying in the wind his mouth open to about twice its normal size with fire and smoke coming out of it and below a multitude it is a splendid caricature they tell me mr maraton that it is your intention to kindle the fires in england too  maraton was suddenly grave  lord armley he said all the world speaks of me as an apostle of destruction and death it is because they see a very little distance in my own thoughts if ever i do think of myself it is as a builder not as a destroyer that i picture myself only in this world as in any other one must destroy first to build upon a sound foundation  good reasoning sir lord armley replied only one should be very sure before one destroys that the new order of things will be worthy of the sacrifice  after dinner mr foley remarked as he lit a cigarette we are going to talk at present maraton is under a solemn promise to play tennis  maraton looked towards the house  if i might be allowed he said i will go and put on my flannels lady elisabeth is making up a set i think  he turned towards the house the two men stood watching him  is he to be bought lord armley asked in a low tone  mr foley shook his head  not with money or place he answered thoughtfully  there isnt a man breathing who hasnt his price if you could only discover what it is lord armley declared as he took a cigarette from his case and lit it  a truism my friend mr foley admitted which i have always considered a little nebulous however we shall see we have a few hours respite at any rate    chapter xi  lady grensides hospitable instincts were unquenchable the small houseparty to which her brother had reluctantly consented had grown by odd couples until the house was more than half full twentytwo people sat down to dinner that night for the first time in his life mr foley interfered with the arrangement of the table he sought his sister out just as the dressingbell rang  my dear catharine he asked a little reprovingly was it necessary to have such a crowd hereat any rate until after monday you know that i dont interfere as a rule but there were special reasons why i wanted to be as quiet as possible until after maraton had left  lady grensides expression was delightfully apologetic it conveyed also a sense of helplessness  what was i to do she demanded most of these people were asked or half asked weeks ago and i hate putting any one off it is quite a weakness of mine that and i am sure stephen there isnt a soul who could possibly object to mr maraton personally i think he is altogether charming and so distinguishedlooking he has quite the air of being used to good society  mr foleys eyes lit with joyful appreciation of his sisters naïveté perhaps one reason why they got on so well together was because she was continually ministering to his sense of humour  it wasnt altogether that he said but never mind we cant send the people away nowthats certain what i wanted to tell you was that elisabeth must sit next maraton tonight  lady grenside was horrified  however could i explain such an arrangement to jack carton she protested apart from a matter of precedence you know that he is elisabeths declared admirer it is perfectly certain that at a word of encouragement from her he would propose a most suitable match too in every way and you know elisabeth is beginning to be just a little anxiety to me she is twentyfour and girls marry so young nowadays  carton and she can make up for lost time later on mr foley insisted maraton goes tomorrow tonight i am relying upon elisabeth to look after him for some reason or other they seem to get on together excellently  lady grenside took lord carton into one of the corners of her brothers quaint and delightful drawingroom to explain the matter  my dear jack she began never be a politician  i like that the young man answered lady elisabeth has been talking to me for half an hour before dinner trying to get me to interest myself in what she calls serious objects  oh its all right so far as the man is concerned lady grenside amended i was thinking of my own position only an hour ago my brother comes to me and tells me that i am to send elisabeth in to dinner tonight withwith whom do you think  with me i hope the young man replied promptly only i dont know why he should interfere  with mr maraton  what the anarchist fellow  lady grenside nodded several times  i cant refuse stephen in his own house she said and mr maraton is leaving tomorrow  the young man sighed  he is just one of those thoughtful chaps with plenty of gas that elisabeth likes to talk to he complained never mind its got to be put up with i suppose  i am sending you in with lily lady grenside continued shell keep you amused only i felt that i must explain  i cant think what the fellows doing here anyhow carton remarked discontentedly a few generations ago we should have hung him  hush lady grenside whispered dont let elisabeth hear you talk like that here she comes i wonder  lady grenside stopped short she was looking steadily at her daughter and her expression of doubt had a genuine impulse behind it carton was not so reticent  by jove she does look stunning he murmured  elisabeth who seldom wore colours was dressed in blue with a necklace of turquoises on the threshold she paused to make some laughing rejoinder to a man who was holding open the door for her her eyes were brilliant her face was full of animation lady grensides face darkened as the unseen man came into sight it was maraton  never saw elisabeth look so ripping carton repeated just my luck not to take her in  tomorrow night lady grenside promised  thats all very well carton grumbled i wish she didnt look so thundering pleased with herself  lady grenside leaned a little towards him  elisabeth is a dear girl she declared she is doing all this for her uncles sake mr foley is very anxious indeed to conciliate this man and elisabeth is helping him you know how keen she is on doing what she can in that way  carton nodded a little more hopefully his eyes were fixed now upon maraton  cant think how the fellow learnt to turn himself out like that i thought these sort of people dressed anyhow  lady grenside shrugged her shoulders  i believe she said that this man is full of queer contradictions some one once told me that he was enormously wealthy that he had been to an english public school and changed his name out in america rubbish i expect    run and find lily theres a dear boy we are going in now  dinner was served at a round table and a good deal of the conversation was general on maratons left hand however was a lady whose horror at his presence concealed out of deference to her host reduced her to stolid and unbending silence elisabeth quickly aware of the fact made swift atonement while the others talked all around them of general subjects she conversed with maraton almost in whispers lightly enough at first but with an undernote of seriousness always there maraton would have been less than human if he had not been susceptible to the charm of her conversation  i cannot tell you she declared towards the end of the meal how much i am hoping from this brief visit of yours i know you feel that our class has little feeling for the people whom you represent if only i could convince you how wrong that idea is nothing has interested me so much as the different measures which have been brought in for the sake of the people and my uncle toohe is the kindest of men and very broad he would go even further than he does but for his colleagues  he goes a long way maraton reminded her when he asks me to his home invites mewell why should i not say itinvites me to join his party  he is doing what he believes is sensible she went on eagerly he is doing what i know is right it is the best the most splendid idea he has ever had i think that if nothing comes of it she added leaning forward so that her eyes met his i think that if nothing comes of it it will break my heart  maraton was a little more serious for a few minutes she waited in some anxiety for him to speak when he did so she realised that there was a new gravity in his face and in his tone  lady elisabeth he said i am afraid that there is very little hope of our coming to any agreement you must remember that when i promised to come here  oh i know that she interrupted only i wish that we had a little longer time you think that my interest in the people is an amateurish affair half sentimental and half freakish dont you you were probably surprised to hear that i had ever read a volume of political economy in my life but i have i have studied things i have read dozens and dozens of books on sociology and socialism and syndicalism and every conceivable subject that bears upon the relations between your class and ours and i cant come to any but one conclusion there is only one logical conclusion violent methods are useless the betterment of the poor must come about gradually if religion hadnt interfered things would have been far better now even  he looked at her a little startled  it seems strange to hear you say that he remarked  strange only because you will think of me as a dilettante she replied swiftly i have some sort of a brain i have thought of these matters talked of them with my uncle with many others whom even you would admit to be clever men i too see that charity and charitable impulses have perhaps been the greatest drawback of the day to a scientific betterment of the people i too want to see the thing done by laws and not by impulses  you and how many more he sighed and alas this is an age of majorities people talk a good deal i wonder how many of your hateful middle class would give up a tithe of their luxuries to add to the welfare of the others there isnt a person breathing with so little real feeling for the slaves of the world as your middleclass manufacturer your tradesman that is why in the days to come he will be the person who is going to suffer most  maraton was appealed to from across the table with reference to some of the art treasures which were reputed to have found their way from italy to new york he gave at once the information required speaking fluently and with the appreciative air of a connoisseur of many of the pictures which were under discussion soon afterwards lady grenside rose and the men drew up their chairs the evening papers had arrived and there was a general air of seriousness mr foley sent one to maraton who glanced at the opening page upon which his name was displayed in large type  five million workers wait for  maraton  what the strike may mean  home secretary leaves post manchester  tomorrow  illegal strikes bill to re proposed  on monday  maraton only glanced at the paper and put it on one side there was a little constraint one or two who had not known of his identity were glancing curiously in his direction mr foley smiled at him pleasantly  you may drink your port without fear mr maraton he said we live in civilised ages a thousand years ago you would certainly have had some cause for suspicion  maraton raised his glass to his lips and sipped the wine critically  i am afraid he remarked with a gleam in his eyes that there are a good many of you who may be wishing that they could set back time a thousand years  mr foley shook his head  no he decided todays principles are the best we argue away what is wrong in the minds of our enemies and we take unto ourselves what they bring us of good if you would rather mr maraton we will not talk politics at all on the other hand the news tonight is serious armley here is wondering what the actual results will be if sheffield leeds and manchester stand together and the railway strike comes at the same time  i do not know that i wonder at all lord armley declared the result will be ruin  there is no such thing as permanent destruction maraton objected the springs of human life are never crushed sometimes a generation must suffer that succeeding ones may be blest  the question is mr foley said holding up his wineglass how far we are justified in experiments concerning which nothing absolute can be known experiments of so disastrous a nature  a servant entered and made a communication to mr foley who turned at once to maraton  it is your secretary he announced who has arrived from london with some letters  maraton at once followed the servant from the room mr foley too rose to his feet  in ten minutes or so he declared i shall follow you we can have our chat quietly in the study  maraton followed the butler across the hall and found himself ushered into a room at the back of the housea room lined with books with french windows wide open leading out on to the lawn a room beautifully cool and odoriferous with the perfume of roses a single lamp was burning upon a table for the rest the apartment seemed full of the soft blue twilight of the summer night maraton came to a standstill with an exclamation of surprise a tall very slim figure in plain dark clothes had turned from the french windows and was standing there now her face turned towards him a little eagerly a strange light upon her pale cheeks and in the eyes which seemed to shine at him almost feverishly out of the sensuous twilight    chapter xii  julia maraton exclaimed  aaron was run over just as he was starting she explained quickly he is not hurt badly but he wasnt able to catch the train he had an important letter from manchester and one from the committee for you we thought it best that i should bring them i hope we decided rightly  she was standing out of the circle of the lamplight in the shadows of the room there was a queer nervousness about her manner a strained anxiety in the way her eyes scarcely left his face which puzzled him  it is very kind of you he said as he took the letters please sit down while i look at them  the first was dated from the house of commons  dear mr maraton  at a committee meeting held this afternoon here it was resolved that i should write to you to the following effect  we understood that you were coming over here entirely in the interests of the great cause of labour of which we the undersigned are the accredited representatives in this country since your arrival however you have preserved an independent attitude which has given cause to much anxiety on our part after declining to attend a meeting at the clarion hall we find you there amongst the audience and you address them in direct opposition to the advice which we were giving them authoritatively we specially invited you to be present at a meeting of this committee today in order that a definite plan of campaign might be formulated before your visit to manchester you have not accepted our invitation and we understand that you are now staying at the private house of the prime minister notwithstanding our request that you should not interview or be interviewed by any representative of the government without one of our committee being present  we wish to express our dissatisfaction with the state of affairs and to say that should you be still intending to address the meeting at manchester on monday night we demand an explanation with you before you go on to the platform we understand that the residence of mr foley is only sixty miles from london if you are still desirous of acting with us we beg you upon receipt of this letter to ask for a motor car and to return here to london we shall all be at number 17 notting hill until midnight or later telephone number 178 so that you can telephone that you are on the way failing your coming some of us will be at the midland hotel manchester from midday on monday  i am  faithfully yours  richard graveling  secretary  for  peter dale chairman  abraham weavel  samuel borden  henry culvain   the second one was from manchester   dear sir  we understand that you will be arriving in manchester about midday on monday we think it would be best if you were to descend from the train either at derby or any adjacent station as no police force which could possibly be raised in the county will be sufficient to control the crowds of people who will gather in the streets to welcome you  we beg that you will send us a telegram informing us by what train you are travelling and we will send a messenger to derby who will confer with you as to the best means of reaching the rooms which we are providing for you  anticipating your visit  i am  faithfully yours  william preston  secretary manchester labour party   maraton replaced the letters in their envelopes and turned with them in his hand towards julia she had moved a little towards the open french windows every one seemed to have made their way out on to the lawn chinese lanterns were hanging from some of the trees and along the straight box hedge that led to the rose gardens the women were strolling about in their evening gowns without wraps or covering and the men had joined them servants were passing coffee around served from a table on which stood a little row of bottles filled with various liqueurs some one in the drawingroom was singing but the voice was suddenly silenced every one turned their heads a little further back in the woods a nightingale had commenced to sing  you are tired maraton whispered  she shook her head the strained anxious look was still in her face  no she replied in a low tone i am not tired  there is something the matter he insisted something i am sure wont you sit down and may i not order some refreshment for you the people here are very hospitable  her gesture of dissent was almost peremptory  no  the monosyllable had a sting which surprised him  tell me what it is he begged  she opened her lips and closed them again he saw then the rising and falling of her bosom underneath that black stuff gown she stretched out her hand towards the gardens somehow or other she seemed to grow taller  i do not understand this she said i do not understand your being here one of them dressed like them speaking their language sharing their luxuries it is a great blow to me it is perhaps because i am foolish but it tortures me  but isnt that a little unreasonable he asked her quietly to accomplish anything in this world it is necessary to know more than one side of life  but thisthis she cried hysterically is the side which has made our blood boil for generations these women in silk and laces these idle pleasureloving men this eating and drinking this luxury in beautiful surroundings with ears deafened to all the mad sobbing cries of the world this is their life day by day you have been in the wilderness you have seen the life of those others you have the feeling for them in your heart can you sit at table with these people and wear their clothes and not feel like a hypocrite  i assure you maraton replied that i can  she was trembling slightly she had never seemed to him so tall her eyes now were ablaze she had indeed the air of a prophetess  they are ignorant men they who sent you that letter she continued pointing to it but they have the truth do you know what they are saying  maraton inclined his head gravely he felt that he knew very well what they were saying she did not give him time however to interrupt  they are saying that you are to be bought that that is why you are here that mr foley will pay a great price for you they are saying that all those hopes we had built upon your coming are to be dashed away they say that you are for the fleshpots i darent breathe a word of this to aaron she added hurriedly or i think that he would go mad he is blind with passionate love for you he does not see the danger he will not believe that you are not as a god  maraton looked past her into the gardens away into the violet sky the nightingale was singing now clearly and wonderfully perhaps for a moment his thoughts strayed from the great battle of life perhaps his innate sense and worship of beauty the artist in the man which was the real thing making him great in his daily work triumphed apart from any other consideration the music of life was in his veins soft and stately elisabeth standing a little apart was looking in upon them an exquisite figure with a background of dark green trees  when you faced death in chicago julia went on her voice quivering with the effort she was making to keep it low when you offered your body to the law and preached fire and murder with your lips you did it for the sake of the people there was nothing in life so glorious to you then as the one great cause that was the man we hoped to see are you that man  maratons thoughts came back he moved a little towards her her hand shot out as though to keep him at a distance  are you that man she repeated  her thin form was shaken with stifled sobs  i hope so he answered gravely my ways are not the ways to which you have been accustomed in my heart i believe that i see further into the real truth than some of those very ignorant friends of yours who have been sent into parliament by the operatives they represent further even than you julia handicapped by your sex with your eyes fixed day by day only upon the misery of life you blame me because i am here amongst these people as an equal listen is one responsible for their birth and instincts i tell you now what i have told to no one for no one has ever ventured to ask me twice of my parentage i was born in a sense as these people were born i cannot help it if finding it advisable to come amongst them i find their ways easy that is all i came here to keep a promise to a man who is in his way a great statesman he is prime minister of our country he has without a doubt so far as it is possible for such a man to have it there at all the cause of the people at his heart is it for me to ignore him to leave what he would say to me unsaid to pull down the pillars which have kept this a proud country for many hundreds of years without even listening remember that if i speak at manchester the things that are in my heart this country for your time and mine must perish of that i am sure that has been made clear to me do you wonder julia that before i take that last step i lift every stone i turn over every page i listen to every word which may be spoken by those who have the right to speak that is why i am here on monday morning i leave on monday night i speak to the people in manchester  she listened to him very much as a prisoner at the bar might listen to a judge who reasons before he pronounces sentence and her face became as the face of that prisoner might become who detects some leniency of tone some softening of manner on the part of the arbiter of his fate she ceased to tremble her lips relaxed her eyes grew softer and softer she came a step nearer resting her fingertips upon a little table her body leaning towards him he had a queer vision of her for a momentno longer the prophetess a touch of the delilah in the soft sweetness of her eyes  oh forgive me she begged i was foolish forgive me  he smiled at her reassuringly  there is nothing to forgive he insisted you asked for an explanation to which you had a right i have tried to give it to you indeed julia you need have no fear whatever i decide in life will be what i think best for our cause  the shadow of fear once more trembled in her tone  whatever you decide she repeated you will notyou will not let them call you a deserter you couldnt do that  there isnt anything in the world he told her quietly which has the power to tempt me from doing the thing which i think best i cannot promise that it will be always the thing which seems right to this committee of men he added touching the envelope with his forefinger i cannot promise you that but it should not worry you you yourself are different it is my hope that soon you will understand me better i think that when that time comes you will cease to fear  the light in her face was wonderful  oh i want to she murmured i want to understand you better there hasnt been anything in life to me like the sound of your name like the thought of you since first i understood perhaps i am as bad as aaron she sighed i too alas am your hopeless slave  he moved a step nearer this time she made no effort to retreat once more she was trembling a little but her face was soft and sweet all the pallor the hard lines the suffering seemed to have passed miraculously out of it a soula womans soulwas shining at him out of her eyes it wasnt her physical self that spokein a way he knew that yet she was calling to him calling to him with all she possessed calling to him as to her master  he succeeded in persuading her to eat and drink and she departed a little grim and unpleased in the motor car which mr foley had insisted upon ordering round then maraton strolled into the garden to take his delayed coffee elisabeth came noiselessly across the turf to his side  i hope there was nothing disturbing in your letters she said  not very he replied it is only what i expected  every one she continued has been admiring your secretary we all thought that she had such a beautiful face  she is not my secretary he explained she came in place of her brother who met with a slight accident just as he was starting  somehow or other he fancied that elisabeth was pleased  i didnt think that it was like you to have a woman secretary she remarked  he smiled as he replied  miss thurnbrein is a very earnest worker and a real humanitarian she has written articles about woman labour in london  julia thurnbrein elisabeth exclaimed yes i have read them if only i had known that that was she i should have liked so much to have talked to her do you think that she would come and see me or let me come and see her we really do want to understand these things and it seems to me somehow that people like julia thurnbrein and all those who really understand keep away from us wilfully they wont exchange thoughts they believe that we are their natural enemies and we arent you know there isnt any one id like to meet and talk with so much as julia thurnbrein  he nodded sympathetically  they are prejudiced he admitted all of them are disgusted with me for being down here they look with grave suspicion upon my ability to wear a dress suit it is just that narrowness which has set back the clock a hundred years    how i like your idea of an openair drawingroom mr foley hasnt been looking for me has he i am due in his study in three minutes  her finger touched his arm  come with me for one moment she insisted a little abruptly  she led him down one of the walksa narrow turf path leading through great clumps of rhododendrons at the bottom was the wood where the nightingale had his home after a few paces she stopped  mr maraton she said this may be our last serious word together for when you have talked with my uncle you will have made your decision look at me please  he looked at her just then the nightingale began to sing again and curiously enough it seemed to him that a different note had crept into the birds song it was a cry for life an absolutely pagan note which came to him through the velvety darkness  isnt it your theory she whispered to destroy for the sake of the future dont do it theory sometimes sounds so sublime but the present is actually here be content to work piecemeal to creep upwards inch by inch life is something you know life is something for all of us no man has the right to destroy it for others he has not even the right to destroy it for himself  maraton was suddenly almost giddy for a moment he had relaxed and that moment was illuminating perhaps she saw the fire which leapt into his eyes if she did she never quailed her head was within a few inches of his his arms almost touching her she saw but she never moved if anything she drew a little nearer  speak to me she begged give me some promise some hope  he was absolutely speechless a wave of reminiscence had carried him back into the study face to face with an accuser he read meaning in julias words now a meaning which at the time they had not possessed it was true that he was being tempted it was true that there was such a thing in the world as temptation a live thing to the strong as well as to the weak  you could be great she murmured you could be a statesman of whom we should all be proud in years to come people would understand they would know that you had chosen the nobler part and then for yourself  for myself he interrupted for myselfwhat  her lips parted and closed again she looked at him very steadily  dont you think she asked quietly that you are more than most men the builder of your own life the master of your own fate the conquerorif indeed you desired to possess  she was gone disappearing through a winding path amongst the bushes which he had never noticed he heard the trailing of her skirts the air around him was empty save for a breath of the perfume shaken from her gown and the song of the bird then he heard her call to him  this way mr maratonjust a little to your left the path leads right out on to the lawn  is it a maze he asked  a very ordinary one she called back gaily follow me and i will lead you out    chapter xiii  mr foley and lord armley were waiting together in the librarynot the smaller apartment into which julia had been shown but a more spacious almost a stately room in the front part of the house upon maratons entrance lord armley changed his position sitting further back amongst the shadows in a low easychair maraton took his place so that he was between the two men it was lord armley who asked the first question  mr maraton he enquired are you an englishman  i think that i may call myself so maraton replied with a smile i was born in america but my parents were english  i asked lord armley continued whether you were an englishman for two reasons one waswell perhaps you might call it curiosity the other because if you are an englishman mr foley and i are going to make a strong and i hope successful appeal to your patriotism  i am afraid maraton replied that you will be appealing to a sentiment of which i am ignorant  do you mean mr foley asked that you have no impulse of affection for your own country  for my country as she exists at present none at all maraton answered that is where i am afraid we shall find this conference so unsatisfactory i am not subject to any of the ordinary convictions of life  that certainly makes the task of arguing with you a little difficult mr foley admitted we had hoped that the vision of this country overrun by a triumphant enemy our towns and our pleasant places in the hands of an alien race our women subject to insults from them our men treated with scornwe had an idea that the vision of these things might count with you for something  for nothing at all maraton replied i am not sure that a successful invasion of this country would not be one of the best medicines she could possibly have  are you serious sir lord armley asked grimly  absolutely maraton answered without a seconds hesitation you people have after all only an external feeling for the deficiencies of your social system you dont feel reallyyou dont understand to me england at the present daythe whole of civilization indeed but we are speaking now only of englandis suffering from an awful disease to me she is like a leper i cannot think that any operation which could cure her is too severe she may have to spend centuries in the hospital but some day the light will come  when you talk like that mr foley declared you seem to us mr maraton to pass outside the pale of logical argument but we want to understand you you mean that for the sake of altering our social conditions you would if you thought it necessary let this country be conquered plunge her for a hundred years or more into misery deeper than any she has yet known what good do you suppose could come of this the poor who are poor now would starve then from whom would come the mammoth war indemnity we should have to pay  not from the poor maraton replied that is one of my theories it would come from the very class whom i would willingly see enfeebledthe greedy grasping middle class the poor must exist automatically they could not exist on lower wages therefore they will not get lower wages if there is no employment for them they will help themselves to the means for life if there is money in the country they have a right to a part of it and they will take it the unfit amongst them will die the unfit are better dead  this is a dangerous doctrine mr maraton lord armley remarked  it is a primitive law maraton answered put yourself down amongst the people with a wife by your side and children crying to you for bread would you call yourself a man if you let them starve if you sent your children sobbing away from you when there was bread to be had for the fighting bread to be taken from those who had also meat i think not i am not afraid of plunging the country into disaster it is my belief that the sufferings and the loss which would ensue would not fall upon the class who are already dwelling in misery  mr foley moved nervously to the mantelpiece and helped himself to a cigarette  mr maraton he said we will not argue on these lines i like to feel my feet upon the earth i like to deal with the things one knows about grant me this at least that it is possible to reach the end at which you are striving by milder means  it may be maraton admitted i am not sure milder means have been tried for a good many generations i tell you frankly that i do not believe it is possible by legislation to redistribute the wealth of the world  lord armley from his seat amongst the shadows smiled sarcastically  you too mr maraton he murmured what is your answer i wonder to the oft quoted question you may redistribute wealth but how do you propose to keep it in a state of equilibrium  maraton smiled  there would have to be three perhaps halfadozenwho can tell how manyredistributions by violent means he replied but remember that all this time education clean living freedom from sordid anxieties would be telling upon the lower orders as their physical condition improved so would their minds as the conditions under which men live become more equal so will their brains become more equal and their power of acquiring wealth this remember may be the work of a hundred yearsperhaps morebut it is the end at which we should aim  you absolutely mean then mr foley persisted to destroy the welfare of the country for this generation and perhaps the next in order that a new people may arise governed according to your methods in ages which neither you nor i nor any of us will ever see  that is what i mean maraton assented need i remind you that if we had not possessed in the past men who gave their lives for the sake of posterity the nations of the world would be even in a more backward condition than they are today  mr foley smiled  mr maraton he said now i am going to ask you this question tomorrow you go to manchester to pronounce your doctrines tomorrow you are going to incite the working people of england practically to revolt are you going to tell them that it is for posterity they must strike do you mean when you thunder at them from the platforms to tell them the truthto tell them that the good which you promise is not for them nor for their children nor their childrens children but for the unborn generations do you mean to tell them this  maraton was silent lord armley was watching him closely mr foleys eyes were bright and a little flush had stained the parchment pallor of his cheeks he was feeling all the thrill of the fencer who has touched  i cannot convince you mr maraton he went on that yours is not a splendid dream an idyllic vision which would fade from the canvas before even the colours were dry but you have common sense and i hope at least i can persuade you to see this you wont rally the working men of england to your standard under that motto thats why their leaders are ignorant and commonplace men they know very well that its to the pockets of their hearers they must appeal a shilling a week more now is what they want not to have their children born to a better life and their childrens children move on the upward plane human nature isnt like that especially the human nature which i admit has suffered from the selfishness and greediness of the middle classes through all these years the people arent ready to dream dreams they want money in their pockets cash so much a weeknothing else i tell you that selfinterest is before the eyes of every one of those lancashire operatives to whom you are going to speak an hour or so less work a week an ounce more of tobacco a glass of beer when he feels inclined a little more money in the bankthats what he wants  you may be speaking the truth mr foley maraton confessed quietly at any rate you have voiced some of my deepest fears i know that i cannot bring the people to my standard by showing them the whole of my mind but why should i if i know that my cause is just if i know that it is for the good of the world isnt it my duty to conceal as much as i find it wise to conceal to keep my hand to the plough even though i drive it through the fields of devastation  then your mission is not an honest one lord armley declared suddenly it is dishonest that good things may come of it  it is possible to reason like that maraton admitted  now listen mr foley continued i will show you the other way i will look with you into the future i cannot agree with all your views but i too would like to see the diminution of capital from the hands of the manufacturers and the middle classes and an increase of prosperity to the operatives i would like to see the gulf between them narrowed year by year i would like to see the working man everywhere established in quarters where life is wholesome and pleasant i would like to see his schools better even than they are at present i would like to see him in the years to come a stronger a more capable a more dignified unit of the empire he can only be made so by prosperity therefore i wish for him prosperity you want to sow the country red with ruin and fire and there isnt any man breathing not even you can tell exactly what the outcome of it all might be i want to work at the same thing more gently last year for the first time i passed a bill in parliament which interfered between the relations of master and man in a certain trade dispute i compelled the employers by act of parliament to agree to a vital principle upon which the men insisted the night i drove home from the house i said to lady elisabeth my niece that that measure small though it was marked a new era in the social conditions of the country it did what i have commenced i am prepared to go on with i am prepared by every logical and honest means to legislate for labour i am prepared to legislate in such a way that the prosperity of the manufacturer all the manufacturers in this country must be shared by the workpeople i am prepared to fight tooth and nail against twenty per cent dividends on capital and twentyfive shillings a week wages for the operative there are others in the cabinet of my point of view in a couple of years we must go to the country i am going to the country to ask for a peoples government go to manchester if you must but talk common sense to the people let them strike where they are subject to wrongs and i promise you that i am on their side and every pressure that my government can bring to bear upon the employers shall be used in their favour you shall winyou as the champion of the men shall win all along the line you shall improve the conditions of every one of those industries in the north butit must be done legitimately and without sinister complications i know what is in your mind mr maraton quite well i know your proposal it is in your mind to have the railway strike the coal strike the ironfounders strike and the strike of the lancashire operatives all take place on the same day you intend to lay the country pulseless and motionless you wont accept terms you court disasterdisaster which you refer to as an operation dont do it try my way i offer you certain success i offer you my alliance a seat in parliament at once a place in my government in two years time what more can you ask for what more can you do for the people than fight for them side by side with me  maraton had moved a little nearer to the window he was looking out into the night very faintly now in the distant woods he could still catch the song of the nightingale almost he fancied in the shadows that he could catch sight of julias strained face leaning towards him the face of the prophetess warning him against the easy ways calling to him to remember his principles had been to him a part of his life what if he should be wrong what if he should bring misery and suffering upon millions upon millions for the sake of a generation which might never be born there was something practical about mr foleys offer an offer which could have been made only by a great man his brain moved swiftly as he stood there he seemed to look out upon a vast plain of misery a country of silent furnaces of smokeless chimneys a country drooping and lifeless dotted with the figures of dying men and women what an offering what a sacrifice would the people still believe in him when the blow fell could he himself pass out of life with the memory of it all in his mind and feel that his lifes work had been good he remained speechless  let me force one more argument upon you mr foley continued you must know a little what type of mind is most common amongst labour i ask you what will be the attitude of labour towards the starvation of the next ten or twenty years if you should bring the ruin you threaten upon the country i ask you to use your common sense of what use would you be who would listen to you if they left you alive would any audience of starving men and women looking back upon the comparative prosperity of the past listen to a word from your lips believe me they would not they would be more likely if they found you to rend you limb from limb the operatives of this country are not dreamers they dont want to give their wives and children and their own selves body and soul for a dream therefore i come back to the sane common sense of the whole affair by this time next year if you use your power to bring destruction upon this country your name will be loathed and detested amongst the very people for whose sake you do it  maraton turned away  you have put some of my own fears before me mr foley he confessed in a new and very impressive light if i thought that i myself were the only one who could teach you would indeed terrify me the doctrines in which i believe however will endure even though i should pass  endure to be discarded and despised by all thinking men lord armley exclaimed  you may be right maraton admitted slowly i cannot say will you forgive me if i make you no answer at all tonight my thoughts are a little confused you have made me see myself with your eyes and i wish to reconsider certain matters before i go perhaps you will give me ten minutes more to discuss them  mr foley was still a little flushed as they shook hands  i am glad he declared very glad that you are at least going to think over what i have said you must have common sense i have read your book backwards and forwards i have read your articles in the american reviews and in the english papers there is nothing more splendid than the visions you write of but there is no gangway across from this world into the world of dreams mr maraton remember that and remember too how great your responsibility is i have never tried to hide from you what i believe your real power to be i have always said that the moment a real leader was found the country would be in danger you are that leader for gods sake mr maraton realise your responsibility    now shall we go back into the gardens or into the drawingroom my niece will sing to us if you are fond of music  maraton excused himself and slipped out into the gardens alone for more than an hour he walked restlessly about without relief without gaining any added clearness of vision the atmosphere of the place seemed to him somehow enervating the little walk amongst the rhododendrons was still fragrant with perfume reminiscent of that strange moment of emotion the air was still languorous although the nightingales song had ceased the atmosphere seemed still vibrating with the music of his past song he stood before the window of the room where he had talked with julia what would she say he wondered would she think that he had sold his soul if he chose the more peaceful way it was a night of perplexed thoughts confused emotions one thing only was clear for the first time in his life certain dreams which had been as dear to him as life itself had received a shattering blow always he had spoken and acted from conviction it was that which had given his words their splendid force it was that which had made the words which he had spoken live as though they had been winged with fire perhaps it was his own fault perhaps he should have avoided altogether this house of the easier ways    chapter xiv  from the atmosphere of lyndwood park and its surroundingsfragrant almost epicureanmaraton passed to the hard squalor of the great smokehung city of the north there were no beautiful women or cultured men to bid him welcome the labour member and his companion who hastened him out of the train at derby and into an open motorcar were hardfeatured lancashire men keen on their work and practical as the day as they talked together in that long ugly ride maraton almost smiled as he thought of those perfervid dreams of his which had always been at the back of his head that creed of life some part of which he had intended to unfold to the people during these few days  plainspeaking is what our folk like john henneford assured him as they sat side by side in the small open car driven by one of the committee plain honest words sound advice with a bit o grit in it  to hell with the masters is the motto they like best preston remarked moving his pipe to the corner of his mouth its an old text but its an ever popular one theres the mill where i work now fourteen hundred of us the girls average from eighteen bob to a pound a week men twentyfour to twentyeight foremen thirtyfive to two pounds its not much of wages the house rents high in these parts and food too the business has just been turned into a companycapital three hundred thousand pounds profits last year fortytwo thousand thats after paying us our bit thats the sort of thing turns the blood of the people sour up here it was the aristocrats brought about the revolution in france it will be the manufacturers who do it here and do it quick unless things are altered they tell me youre a bit of a revolutionist mr maraton  im anything maraton answered that will do away with such profits as youve been speaking of i am anything which will bring a fair share of the profits of his labour to the operative who now gets none i hate capital its a false quantity a false value its got to come back to the people it belongs to them  youre right man henneford declared grimly how are you going to get it back eh show us we are powerful up here we could paralyse trade from the clyde to the thames if we thought it would do any good whats your text tonight mr maraton  i havent thought maraton replied i have plenty to say to the people though  you gave em what for in chicago preston remarked with a grin  i havent been used to mince words maraton admitted  theres four thousand policemen told off to look after you henneford informed him bythebye is it true that dale and all of them are coming up tonight  maraton nodded  i wired for some of them he assented so long as i am going to make a definite pronouncement they may as well hear it  been spending the weekend with foley havent you preston enquired closing his eyes a little  maraton nodded yes he confessed i have been there  there are many that dont think much of foley henneford remarked myself i am not sure what to make of him i think hed be a peoples man right enough if it wasnt for the cabinet  i believe in my heart maraton said that he is a peoples man  they sped on through deserted spaces past smokestained factories across cobbled streets past a wilderness of small houses grimy everywhere repellent soon they entered manchester by the back way and pulled up presently at a small and unimposing hotel  weve taken a room for you here henneford announced its close to the hall and its quiet and clean enough the big hotels i doubt whether youd ever be able to get out of when once they found where you were  as a matter of fact preston added theres a room taken in your name at the midland to put folks off a bit well have to smuggle you out here if theres any trouble tonight the people are rare and restless  it will do very nicely i am sure maraton replied  the place was an ordinary commercial hotel clean apparently but otherwise wholly unattractive henneford led the way upstairs and with some pride threw open the door of a room on the first floor weve got you a sittingroom he said thought you might want to talk to these press people perhaps or do a bit of work your secretarys somewhere about the placeturned up with a typewriter early this morning and theres a young woman  a what maraton asked  a young woman henneford continuedsecretarys sister or something  maraton smiled  miss thurnbrein  what the tailoress preston replied shes a good sort wrote rare stuff she did about her trade they are out together seeing the sights didnt expect you quite so soon i expect  maraton looked around the little sittingroom it was furnished with a carpet of bright green thrown over a foundation of linoleum a suite of stamped magenta plush an overmantel gilt cornices over the windows a piano a table covered with a gaudy tablecloth on the walls were hung some oleographs the lighting of the room was of gas with incandescent mantles there had been apparently judging by an odour which still remained a great deal of beer consumed in the apartment at one time or another  nice room this mr henneford remarked approvingly slap up aint it your bedrooms next door and your secretarys just round the corner done you proud i reckon like a royal suite eh  he laughed goodhumouredly mr preston removed his pipe and rang the bell  one drink i think he suggested and well leave mr maraton alone for a bit you and ill go down to the station and meet the chaps from london and well have a meeting up heresay at five oclock that suit you mr maraton  excellently maraton assented what shall i order he asked as the waiter entered  beer whiskey and cigars were brought maraton asked a few eager questions about the condition of one of the industries and followed henneford to the door talking rapidly  i know so little about the state of woman labour over here he said in america they are better paid in proportion perhaps if miss thurnbrein is here she will be able to give me some information  youll soon get posted up mr henneford declared i can see youve got a quick way of dealing with things so long till five oclock then theres a dozen chaps waiting downstairs to see you well leave it to your judgment just what you want to say to the press ring the bell and have the waiter bring their cards up  they departed and maraton returned to his sittingroom he stood for a moment looking out over the city the roar of which came to him clearly enough through the open window he forgot the depressing tawdriness of his surroundings in the exhilaration of the sound he was back again amongst the people back again where the wheels of life were crashing the people he drew himself up and his eyes sought the furthest limits of that dim yellow haze somehow notwithstanding a vague uneasiness which hung about him like an effort of wounded conscience he had a still greater buoyancy of thought when he considered his possibly altered attitude towards the multitude who waited for his message he felt his feet upon the earth with more certainty with more implicit realism than in those days when he had spoken to them of the future and had perhaps forgotten to tell them how far away that future must be there was something more practical about his present attitude what would they say here in manchester expecting fire and thunder from his lips and finding him hold out the olive branch he shrugged his shouldersa useless speculation after all he rang the bell and glanced through the cards which the waiter brought him  i have nothing of importance to say to any reporters he declared but i will see them all for two minutes you can show them up in the order in which they came  the waiter withdrew and maraton was left for a few moments alone then the door was opened and closed again by the waiter who made no announcement a man came forwarda small man very neatly dressed with gold spectacles and a little black beard maraton welcomed him and pointed to a chair  i have nothing whatever to say to the newspapers he explained until after i have addressed my first few meetings you probably will have nothing to ask me then all the same i am very pleased to see you and since you have been waiting i thought i had better have you come up if it were only for a moment no one who has a great cause at their backs you know can afford to disregard the press  the man laid his hat upon the table maraton glancing across the room at him was instantly conscious that this newcomer was no ordinary person he had a strong intellectual forehead a wellshaped mouth his voice when he spoke was pleasant although his accent was peculiaralmost foreign  mr maraton his visitor began i thank you very much for your courtesy but i have nothing to do with the press my name is beldeman i have come to manchester especially to see you  maraton nodded  we are strangers i believe he asked  strangers personally no thinking man today is a stranger to mr maraton in any other way  you are very kind maraton replied what can i do for you  beldeman glanced towards the door so as to be sure that it was closed  mr maraton he enquired are you a badtempered man  at times maraton admitted  i regret to see his visitor proceeded that you are a man of superior physique to mine i am here to make you an offer which you may consider an insult if you are a narrow ordinary englishman obstinate with castiron principles and the usual prejudices you will probably try to throw me downstairs it is part of my living to run the risk of being thrown downstairs  i will do my best maraton promised him to restrain myself you have at least succeeded in exciting my curiosity  i am to look at mr beldeman continued an unimportant person as a matter of fact i represent a very great country and i come to you charged with a great mission  maraton became a little graver go on he said  i am anxiousperhaps overanxious mr beldeman proceeded that i should put this matter before you in the most favourable light i must confess that i have spent hours trying to make up my mind exactly how i should tell you my business i have changed my mind so many times that there is nothing left of my original intention i speak now as the thoughts come to me i am here on behalf of a syndicate of manufacturersforeign manufacturersto offer you a bribe  maraton stood quite still upon the hearthrug his face showed no emotion whatever  you are i believe mr beldeman went on only half an englishman that is why i am hoping that you will behave like a reasonable being and that my person may be saved from violence upon your word rests the industrial future of this country for the next ten years if your forges burn out and your factories are emptied it will mean an era of prosperity for my country indescribable we are great trade rivals we need just the opening what we get we may not be able to hold altogether when trade is once more good here but that is of no consequence we shall have it for a year or two and that year or two will mean a good many millions to us  maratons eyes began to twinkle  the matter he remarked becomes clearer to me you are either the most ingenuous person i ever met or the most subtle tell me is it a personal bribe you have brought  it is not mr beldeman replied it did not occur to those in whose employment i am or to me to offer you a single sixpence i am here to offer you if you send your people out on strike within the next weekthe coal strike the railway strike the ironfounders the smelters from the clyde southwardsone million pounds as a subscription to your strike funds  you have it with you maraton enquired after a moment  i have four drafts for two hundred and fifty thousand pounds each in my pocketbook at the present moment mr beldeman declared they are payable to your order you can accept my offer and pay them into your private banking account or the banking account of any one of your trades unions there is not the slightest doubt but that they will be met  are there any terms at all connected with this little subscription  none beldeman replied  and your object maraton added is to benefit through our loss of trade  entirely mr beldeman assented without a quiver upon his face  maraton was silent for a moment  i do not see my way absolutely clear he announced to recommending a railway strike at the present moment if i acceded to all the others what would your position be the railway strike is of little consequence to a foreign nation the coal strike and the iron and steel works of sheffield and leeds closedthats where english trade would suffer most especially if the cotton people came out  mr beldeman shook his head slowly my conditions he said embrace the railways  somehow i fancied that they would maraton remarked tell me why  beldeman rose slowly to his feet  are you an englishman he asked  i cant deny it maraton replied i was born abroad why are you so interested in my nationality  beldeman shrugged his shoulders  i cannot tell you just an idea i do not wish to say too much i wish you only to consider what a million pounds will do to help your work people you they say are one of those who love the people as your own children a million pounds may enable them to hold out until they can secure practically what terms they like those million pounds are yours today yours for the people if you pledge your word to a universal strike  including the railways  including the railways mr beldeman assented  maraton smiled quietly  i do not ask you he said what country you represent i think that it is not necessary you have come to me rather as though i were a dictator there are others besides myself with whom influence rests  it is you only who count mr beldeman declared i am thankful that at any rate you have met my offer in a reasonable spirit accept it mr maraton what concern have you for other things save only for the welfare of the people  i have considered this matter maraton remarked many many times a universal strike absolutely universal so far as regards transport and coal would place the country in a paralytic and helpless condition still so many people have assured us that an onslaught from any foreign country is never seriously to be considered that i have come to believe it myself what is your opinion  mr beldeman remained silent for a few moments  one cannot tell he said the stock of coal available for your home fleet happens to be rather low just now one cannot tell what might happen do you greatly care wasnt it you who in one of your speeches pointed out that a war in your country would be welcome that the class who would suffer would be the class who are your great oppressorsthe manufacturers the middle classesand that with their downfall the working man would struggle upwards do you believe mr maraton that a war would hurt your own people  my own ideas maraton replied are in a state of transition however your offer is declined  declined without conditions mr beldeman enquired taking up his hat  for the present it is declined without conditions i will be quite frank with you your offer doesnt shock me as it might do if i were a rightfeeling imperialist of the proper jingo type i believe that a week ago i should have considered it very seriously indeed its acceptance would have been in accordance with my beliefs and yet since you have made it you have made me wonder more than ever whether i have been right i find a revulsion of feeling in considering it which i cannot understand  i may approach you again mr beldeman asked if circumstances should change possibly you yourself may upon reflection appreciate my suggestion more thoroughly  maraton was silent for a moment when he looked up he was alone mr beldeman had not waited for his reply    chapter xv  one by one maraton got rid at last of the little crowd of journalists who had been waiting for him below the last on the list was perhaps the most difficult he pressed very hard for an answer to his direct question  war or peace mr maraton which is it to be just one word thats all  maraton shook his head  in less than an hour the delegates from london will be here he announced we shall hold a conference and come to our decision then  will their coming make any real difference the journalist persisted you hadnt much to say to delegates in america  the labour party over here is better organised in some respects maraton told him i have nothing to say until after the conference  his persistent visitor drew a little nearer to him  theres a report about that youve been staying with foley  and how does that affect the matter maraton enquired  the journalist looked him in the face  the men never had a leader yet he said whom officialdom didnt spoil all this time maraton was standing with the door in one hand and his other hand upon the shoulder of the man whom he was endeavouring to get rid of his grasp suddenly tightened the door was closed and the reporter was outside maraton turned to aaron with whom as yet he had scarcely exchanged a word the latter was sitting at a table sorting letters  how long will those fellows be he asked  aaron glanced at the clock  on their way here by now i should say he replied they are all coming they tried to leave david ross behind but he wouldnt have it  maraton nodded grimly  too many he muttered  aaron leaned a little forward in his place his long hatchetshaped face was drawn and white his eyes were full of a pitiful anxiety  they were talking like men beside themselves at the clarion and up at dales house last night he said they were mad about your having gone to foleys gravelinghe was the worsthes telling them all that youre up to some mischief on your own account they are all grumbling like a lot of sore heads if they could stop your speaking here tonight i believe they would theyre a rotten lot before they got their places in parliament they were perfect firebrands blast them  and you aaron  maraton suddenly paused the door was softly opened and julia stood there she was wearing her hat and coat but her hands were gloveless she had just returned from the street  come in maraton invited so youre looking after aaron are you  i couldnt keep away julia said simply i thought id better let you both know that the street below is filling up theyve heard that you are here people were running away from before the midland as i came round the corner  maraton glanced out of the window there was a hurrying crowd fast approaching the front of the hotel he drew back  i was just on the point of asking aaron he remarked exactly what it is that is expected from me tonight tell me what is in your mind  her face lit up as she looked at him  we are like children she replied all of us we have too much faith i think that what we are expecting is a miracle  is it wise maraton asked quietly dont you think that it may lead to disappointment  she considered the thought for a moment and brushed it away  we are not afraid aaron and i  you are belligerents both of you  and so are you julia retorted swiftly what was it you said in chicago about the phrasemakersthe socialism that flourished in the study while women and children starved in the streets those are the sort of things that we remember aaron and i  this is a country of slow progress maraton reminded them one builds stone by stone listen to me carefully you two since you have had understanding your eyes have been fixed upon this one immense problem i have a question to ask you concerning it shall i destroy for the sake of the unborn generations or shall i use all my cunning and the power of the people to lead them a little further into the light during their living days what would they say themselves do you think would one in a hundred be content to sacrifice himself for a principle  who knows that the millennium would be so long delayed julia exclaimed a few years might see society reconstituted with new laws and a new humanity  maraton shook his head  dont make any mistake about that he said if i press the levers upon which today my hand seems to rest this country will be laid waste with famine and riot and conquest an hour ago a little man was here a little blackbearded man with a quiet voice charged with a great mission he came to offer me on behalf of a syndicate of foreign manufacturers a million pounds towards our universal strike  they both gasped the thing was surely incredible  an incident like that maraton continued may show you what this country must lose for her rivals do not give away a million pounds for nothing  julias eyes were fixed upon his her face was full of strained anxiety  you talk she murmured as though you had doubts as though you were hesitating forgive mewe have waited so long for todaywe and all the others  could any one he demanded stand in the position i stand in today and not have doubts  her eyes flashed at him  yes she cried a prophet could a real man couldthe man we thought you were could  aaron leaned forward aghast his monosyllable was charged with terrified reproach  julia  she turned upon him  you too you werent at lyndwood were you    doubts she went on fiercely her eyes flashing once more upon maraton how can you fire their blood if there are doubts in your heart so long these people have waited no wonder their hearts are sick and their brains are clogged their will is tired prophet after prophet they have followed blindly through the wilderness always it has been the prophet who has been caught up into the easier ways and the people who have sunk back into misery  she fell suddenly upon her knees before he could stop her she was at his feet her face straining up to his  forgive me she cried for the love of the women and the little children dont fail us now if you dont say the word tonight it will never be spoken never in your day nor mine it isnt legislation they want any more its revolution the cleansing fires the land where the sun shines lies on the other side of the terrible way lead them across dont try the devious paths they have filled you with the poison of common sense it isnt common sense thats wanted its only an earthquake can bring out the spirit of the people and make them see and hold what belongs to them  maraton lifted her up her body was quivering she lay for a moment passive in his arms then she sprang away she stood with her back to him looking out of the window  the streets are full of people she said quietly their eyes are all turned here poor people  maraton crossed the room and stood by her side he spoke very gently he even took her hand which lay like a lump of ice in his  julia he whispered you lose hope and trust too soon  you have spoken of doubts she answered in a low tone the prophet has no doubts  there was a sound of voices outside of heavy footsteps on the stairs they heard gravelings loud unpleasant voice the delegates had arrived    chapter xvi  maraton with the peculiar sensitiveness of the artist to an altered atmosphere was keenly conscious of the change when julia had left the room and the delegates had entered one by one they shook hands with maraton and took their places around the table they had no appearance of men charged with a great mission henneford who had met them at the station was beaming with hospitality peter dale was full of gruff goodhumour and jokes graveling alone entered with a scowl and sat with folded arms and the air of a dissentient borden who complained of feeling trainsick insisted upon drinks being served and culvain with a notebook upon his knee ostentatiously sharpened a pencil it was very much like a meeting of a parish council ross alone amongst the delegates had the absorbed air of a man on the threshold of great things and aaron from his seat behind maraton watched his master all the time with strained and passionate attention  in the first place peter dale began weve no wish to commence this meeting with any unpleasantness at the same time mr maraton we did think that after that letter of ours youd have seen your way clear to come up to london and cut short that visit to mr foley we were all there waiting for you and there were some of us that didnt take it altogether in what i might call a favourable spirit that you chose to keep away  to tell you the truth maraton replied calmly i did not see the faintest reason why i should shorten my visit to mr foley we had arranged to meet here today and that seemed to me to be quite sufficient  peter dale tugged at his beard for a moment  i am not wishful he reiterated to commence a discussion which might lead to disagreement between us well drop the matter for the present is that agreeable to everybody  there was a little murmur of assent graveling only was stolidly silent peter dale struck the table with his fist  now then lads he said lets get on with it  this being mainly my show john henneford declared ill come and sit at your right hand mr maraton youve got all the papers ive sent you about the cotton workers  i have looked them through maraton replied but most of their contents were familiar to me i made a study of the condition of all your industries so far as i could last year  between you and me peter dale grumbled this meeting ought to have been held in newcastle and not manchester these cotton chaps of yours henneford aint doing so badly its my miners that want another leg up  henneford struck the table with his fist  rot he exclaimed your miners have just had a turn halfacrown a week extra and a minimum wagewhat more do you want and a piece of plate and a nice fat cheque for mr dale he added turning to the others and winking  peter dale beamed goodhumouredly upon them  well he retorted i earned it you fellows should organise in the same way it took me a good many years hard work i can tell you to bring my lot up to the scratch anyway here we are and manchester its got to be this time in an hour mr maraton the secretary of the manchester labour party will be here hes got two demand scales made out for you to look through your job is to work the people up so that they drop their tools next saturday night  there was an idea maraton reminded them quietly that i should speak tonight not only to the operatives of manchester but to labour throughout the empire that i should make a pronouncement which should have in it something of a common basis for all industrieswhich would in short unsettle labour in every great centre  they all looked a little blank henneford shook his head  it cant be done he affirmed one job at a times our way youre going to speak to cotton tonight and we want the mills emptied by the end of the week weve got a scheme amongst the unions as you know for helping one another and as soon as we ye finished with cotton then well go for iron  thats an old promise weavel declared sturdily  what about the potteries mr borden exclaimed its six years since we had any sort of a dustup and my majority was the smallest of the lot of you last election somethings got to be done down my way my chaps wont go paying in and paying in forever weve fiftynine thousand pounds waiting and the condition of our girl labour is beastly  iron comes next weavel persisted stolidly thats been settled amongst ourselves and as for your fiftynine thousand borden what about our hundred and thirty thousand we shall all have to be lending up here too to work this thing properly  lets get on peter dale proposed rapping on the table now listen here all of you what i propose is if were satisfied with mr maratons address tonight as ive no doubt we shall be he added bowing to maraton with clumsy politeness that we appoint him kind of lecturer to the unions and we make out a sort of itinerary for him to kind of pave the way and then he gives one of these chicago orations of his at the last moment in each of the principal centres wed fix a salaryno need to be mean about itand get to work as soon as this affairs over and meanwhile while this strikes on mr maraton might address a few meetings in other centres on behalf of these fellows and rope in some coin there are one or two matters we shall have to have an understanding about however and one as had better be cleared up right now ill ask you mr maraton to explain to us just what you meant down at the clarion the other night we werent expecting you there and you rather took us aback and we didnt find what you said altogether helpful or particularly lucid now whats this business about a universal strike  maraton sat for a moment almost silent he looked down the table along the line of faces coarse faces most of them of varying strength plebeian forceful here and there with one almost common quality of stubbornness they were men of the people all of them men of the narrow ways what words of his could take them into the further land he raised his head he felt curiously depressed immeasurably out of touch with these who should have been his helpmates the sight of julia just then would have been a joy to him  perhaps maraton began with a little sigh i had better first explain my own position you are each of you members of parliament for a particular district the interests of each of you are bound up in the welfare of the operatives who send you to parliament its your job to look after them and ive no doubt you do it well only you see its a piecemeal sort of business to call yourselves the representatives of labour in its broadest sense i belong more i am afraid to the school of theorists in my mind i bring all labour together all the toilers of the world who are slaves to the great moloch capital you have an immense middle class here in england who are living in fatness and content the keynote of my creed is that these people have twice the incomes they ought to have and labour half as much that of course is just the simple oldfashioned illogical socialism with which you probably all started life and which doubtless lies in some forgotten chamber of the minds of all of you youve given it up because youve decided that it was unpractical i havent i believe that if we were to pull down the pillars which hold up the greatness of this nation i believe that if we were to lay her in ruins about us that in the years to comeperhaps i ought to say the generations to comethe rebuilding stone by stone would be on the sane principle which once established would last for eternity of an absolute partnership between capital and labour a partnership which i say would be eternal because in course of time the two would become one  they all looked at one another a little blankly peter dale grunted with expressionless face and relit his pipe which had gone out during these few moments of intense listening graveling reached out his hand and took a cigar from a box which had been placed upon the table henneford and his neighbour exchanged glances which culminated in a stealthy wink alone at the table david ross sat like a figure of stone his mouth a little open something of the light in his face  im too much of an englishman for one graveling said to want to pull the country down now where does this universal strike come in  the universal strike maraton explained quietly is the doctrine i came to england to preach it is the doctrine i meant to preach tonight if your coal strike and your iron strike and your railway strike were declared within the next few days the pillars would indeed be pulled down  why i should say so peter dale declared gruffly half the people in the country would be starving thered be no subscriptions to the unions the blooming germans would be over here in no time and we should lose our jobs  it wouldnt do mr maraton borden said briskly its our job to improve the position of our constituents but its jolly certain we shouldnt do that by bringing ruin upon the country  david ross suddenly struck the table with his fist  you are wrong all of you he cried hoarsely you are ignorant men thickheaded fat narrow fools full of selfinterest and prejudice you want your jobs they come first i tell you that the mans right purge the country get rid of the poison of illdistributed capital start again a new nation and a new morning  dale looked across the table pityingly  what you need ross is a drink he remarked i noticed you werent doing yourself very well coming down  david ross rose heavily to his feet his arm was stretched out towards dale and it was the arm of an accuser  doing myself well he repeated with fierce contempt thats the keynote of your lives you lazy selfsatisfied swine who call yourselves peoples men what do you know or care about the people how many of you have walked by day and night in the wilderness and felt your heart die away within you how many of you have watched the people hour by hourthe broken people the vicious people the cripples the white slaves of crueler days than the most barbarous countries in history have ever permitted to their children you understand your jobs and you do yourselves well thats your motto and your epitaph theres only one amongst you whos a peoples man and thats him  he pointed to maraton and sat down peter dale removed his pipe from his mouth  its just as well david ross for you to remember he said gruffly that youre here on sufferance seems to me theres a bit of the dog in the manger about your whining i dont know as it matters to any one particularly what your opinion is but if you expect to be taken in along of us youll have to alter your style a bit its all very well for the platform but it dont go down here now lads lets get on with business what i say is this if mr maraton is going on the platform tonight to talk anarchy why then wed best stop it we want subscriptions we want the sympathy of the british public in this strike and theres nothing would make them button up their pockets quicker than for mr maraton there to go and talk about bringing ruin upon the empire for the sake of the people who aint born yet thats what i call thinking in the clouds theres nowt of good in it for us he added with a momentary and vigorous return into his own vernacular get it out of thy head lad or pack thy bag and get thee back to america there was a brief silence most of those present had drawn a little sigh of relief it was obvious that they were entirely in agreement with dale only ross was leaning across the table his eyes blinking drumming upon the tablecloth with the palm of his hand  thats right he muttered thats right send him away the only one who sees the truth send him away its dangerous you might lose your jobs  then maraton spoke quietly from his place  gentlemen he said i gather one thing at least from our brief conference you are not extremists i will bear that in mind but as to what i may or may not say tonight i make no promises  if youre not going to support the strike peter dale declared sturdily then thou shalt never set foot upon the platform weve had our fears that this might be the result of your spending the weekend with mr foley theres six of us here all accredited representatives of great industrial centres and hes never thought fit to ask one of us to set foot under his roof never mind that we perhaps he added with a slow glance at maraton havent learnt the knack of wearing our sunday coats but just you listen if mr foleys been getting at you about this cotton strike and you mean to throw cold water upon it tonight then i tell ye that youre out for trouble these lancashire lads dont stick at a bit theyll pull you limb from limb if you give them any of mr foleys soft sawder were out to fightin our own way perhaps but to fight  it is true that i have spent the weekend with mr foley maraton admitted i had thought perhaps to have reported to you today the substance of our conversation i feel now though he continued that it would be useless you call yourselves labour members and in your way you are no doubt excellent machines i too call myself a labour man but we stand far apart in our ideas in our methods i think mr peter dale and gentlemen that we will go our own ways we will fight for the people as seems best to us i do not think that an alliance is possible  they stared at him a little amazed  look here young man peter dale expostulated whats it all about what do you want from us i spoke of a job as lecturer just now if youve really got the gift of speaking that they say you have thatll bring you into parliament in time and i reckon youll settle down fast enough with the rest of us then until then what is it you want we are sensible men we all know you cant go spouting round the country for nothing whether its for the people or womans suffrage or any old game open your mouth and lets hear what you have to say  maraton rose to his feet  i will perhaps he said come to you with an offer a little later on for the present i must be excused i have an appointment which mr henneford has arranged for me with mr preston secretary of the union here there are a good many facts i need to make sure of before tonight  mr dale moved his pipe to the other side of his mouth  thats all very well for a tale he muttered but im not so sure about letting you go on to the platform at all tonight we dont want our people fed up with the wrong sort of stuff  maraton smiled  mr dale he begged quietly listen they were all for a moment silent maraton opened the window from outside came a low roar of voices from the packed crowds who were even now blocking the street  these are my masters mr dale maraton said and i dont think theres any power you or your friends could make use of tonight which will keep me from my appointment with them    chapter xvii  in the roar of applause which followed maratons brilliant but wholly unprepared peroration a roar which broke and swelled like the waves of the sea different people upon the platform heard different things peter dale and his little band of coadjutors were men enough to know that a new force had come amongst them it is possible even that they hardened as they were by time and circumstances felt some thrill of that erstwhile enthusiasm which in their younger days had brought them out from the ranks of their fellows to aaron listening with quivering attention to every sentence it seemed like the consummation of all his dreams julia alone was conscious of a certain restraint knew that behind all the deep feeling and splendid hopefulness of maratons words there was a sense of something kept back it wasnt what he had meant to say something had come between maraton and his passionate dreams of freedom he too had become a particularist he too was content to preach salvation piecemeal he had spoken to them at first simply as one worker to another then he had drifted out into the larger sea and for those few moments he had been at any rate vigorously in earnest as he had attacked with scorpionlike bitterness the hideous disproportions which existed between the capitalized corporation and the labour which supported it yet afterwards he had gone back within himself almost she had expected to see him with his hands upraised bidding them tear down these barriers for themselves instead he showed them the legalized way not to free humanity but to ensure for themselves a more comfortable place in life it was all very magnificent the strike was assured now almost the success of it  it was long before they let him leave the platform in the droning impotence of the men who followed him the vast audience seemed to realise once more the splendid perfection of his wholly natural and inspiring oratory they rose and shouted for him and once again as he said a few words the spell of silence lay upon them julia sat telling herself passionately that all was well that nothing more than this was to have been hoped for that indeed the liberator had come more than once she felt aarons hands gripping her arm as maratons words seemed to cleave a way towards the splendid truth ross on her other side was like a man carried into another s world  it is the messiah he muttered the messiah of suffering men and women no longer will they cry aloud for bread and be given stones  everything that happened afterwards seemed in a way commonplace when at last they succeeded in leaving the platform they had to wait for a long time in an anteroom while some portion of the immense crowd dispersed peter dale as soon as he had lit his pipe came up to maraton and patted him on the shoulder  theres no doubt about thy gift lad he said condescendingly a man who can talk as you do has no need to look elsewhere for a living  gave it to em straight mr weavel assented and what i propose is a meeting at sheffieldsay this day monthand an appeal to the ironfounders its all very well borden he went on a little angrily but my people are looking for something from me in return for their cash what with these strikes here and strikes there and a bit out of it for everybody why its time sheffield spoke  theres a question i should like to ask graveling intervened plunging into the discussion and that is why are you so cocksure mr maraton of government support in favour of the men you said in your speech tonight so far as i remember that if the masters wouldnt give in without government must force them to see the rights of the matter and not only that but government should compel them to recognise the union and to deal with it now youve only been in this country a few days and it seemed to me you were talking on a pretty tall order  not at all maraton replied i have a scheme of my own scarcely developed as yet a scheme which i wasnt sure when i came here that i should ever make use of which justified me in saying what i did  they looked at him jealously  is it an arrangement with mr foley that youre speaking of peter dale enquired  perhaps so maraton assented  there was a dead silence maraton was leaning slightly against a table julia was talking to the wife of one of the delegates a little way off the others were all spread around smoking and helping themselves to drinks which had just been brought in gravelings face was dark and angry  are we to gather he demanded that theres some sort of an understanding between you and mr foley  if there is maraton asked easily to whom am i responsible  there was a silence brief but intense julia had turned her head the others too were listening peter dale was blowing tobacco smoke from his mouth borden was breathing heavily gravelings small eyes were bright with anger and distrust they were all of them realising the presence of a new force which had come amongst them and already with the immeasurable selfishness of their class they were speculating as to its personal effect upon themselves peter dale with his hands in his trousers pockets and his pipe between his teeth elbowed his way to maratons side  young man he began solemnly wed best have an understanding ask any of these others and theyll tell you im the leader of the labour party are you one of us or arent you  one of you in a sense i hope mr dale maraton answered simply only you must put me down as an independent i dont understand conditions over here yet where my own way seems best i am used to following it  peter dale removed his pipe from his mouth and spoke with added distinctness  politics over here he said are a simpler game than in the states but theres one class of person weve got to do without and thats the independent member you cant do anything over here except by sticking together if youll come under the standard youre welcome ill say nothing about parliament for a time but well find you all the talking you want and see that youre well paid for it  looking past the speakers hard earnest face maraton was conscious of the scorn flashing in julias i eyes intuitively he felt her appreciation of the coarse selfishness of these men terrified at his gifts resisting stubbornly the unwelcome conviction of a new mastership her lips even moved as though she were signalling to him at that moment indeed he would have been glad of her guidance he needed the machinery which these men controlled distasteful though their ideals and methods might be to him  mr dale he declared i am a peoples man i cannot enroll myself in your party because i fancy that in many ways we should think differently but with so many objects in common it is surely possible for us to be friends  ross leaned suddenly forward in his chair his grey face passionstirred the sweat upon his forehead  aye he cried its the greatest friend or the bitterest enemy of the people youll be youll do more with that tongue of yours than a library of books or a century of parliament and may it wither in your mouth if they buy youthose others god meant you for a peoples man itll be hell for you and for us if they buy you away  maraton changed his position a little he was facing them all now  my friends he said that is one thing of which you need have no fear our methods may be different we may work in different ways but we shall work towards the same goal remember this and remember always that whether we fight under the same banner or not i have told it to you solemnly and from the bottom of my heart i am a peoples man  he turned towards the door and laid his hand upon aarons shoulder julia too rose and followed him  i think he added that the people will have cleared off by now i am going to try and get back to the hotel i have messages to send away and an early train to catch in the morning  they were passing out of the room almost in silence but henneford struck the table with his fist  come he exclaimed we seem in a queer humour tonight dont let mr maraton think too hardly of us wherever his place may be in the future hes done us a grand service tonight and dont lets forget it hes waked these people up as none other of us could have done hes started this strike in such a fashion as none other of us could dont lets forget to be grateful the education and the oratory isnt all on the other side now if we dont see you again tonight mr maraton or before you leave for london heres my thanks for one for tonights work and ill lay odds that the others are with me  they crowded around him after that and though graveling stood on one side and peter dale still maintained his attitude of doubt they all parted cordially enough they reached the back door of the hall and found the shelter of a fourwheeled cab before they could start however they were discovered people came running from all directions looking through the window they could see nothing but a sea of white faces the crazy vehicle rocked from side to side the driver was lifted from his seat the horse unharnessed slowly and surrounded by a cheering multitude they dragged the cab through the streets julia sitting by maratons side felt herself impelled to hold on to his arm her body her every sense was thrilled with the hoarse dramatic roll of their voices the forest of upraised caps the strange calm of the man who glanced sometimes almost sadly from side to side she clutched at him once passionately  isnt it wonderful she murmured all the time they call to youtheir liberator  he smiled and there was a shadow still of sadness in his eyes  it is a moments frenzy he said they have seen a gleam of the truth when the light goes out the old burden will seem all the heavier it is so little that man can do for them  they had flung open the top of the cab and maratons eyes were fixed far ahead at the dull glow which hung over the city the haze of smoke and heat stretching like a sulphurous pall southwards the roar of voices was always in his ears but for a moment his thoughts seemed to have passed away his eyes seemed to be seeking for some message beyond the clouds he alone knew the full meaning of the hour which had passed   they were sitting alone in the library the french windows wide open the languorous night air heavy with the perfume of roses and the sweetness of the cedars drawn out by the long days sunshine mr foley was sitting with folded arms silent and pensivea man waiting and by his side was elisabeth standing for a moment with her fingers upon his shoulder  is that eleven oclock she asked  a quarter past he answered we shall hear in a few minutes now  she moved restlessly away there was something spectral about her in her light muslin frock as she vanished through the windows and reappeared almost immediately threading her way amongst the flower beds suddenly the telephone bell at mr foleys elbow rang he raised the receiver she came swiftly to his side  manchester she heard him say    yes this is lyndwood park it is mr foley speaking go on  there was silence then elisabeth stood with parted lips and luminous eyes her hand upon his shoulder she watched himwatched the slow movement of his head the relaxing of his hard thin lips the flash in his eyes she knewfrom the first she knew  thank you very much and good night mr foley said as he replaced the receiver  then he turned quickly to elisabeth and caught her hand they say that maratons speech was wonderful he announced he declared war but a mans war cotton first and cotton alone  she gave a little sobbing breath her hands were locked together  england will never know mr foley added in a voice still trembling with emotion what she has escaped    chapter xviii  those wonderful few days at manchester had passed and oppressed by the inevitable reaction julia was back at work in the clothing factory  she had given up her place by the window to an anaemiclooking child of seventeen who had a habit of fainting during these long summer afternoons her own fingers were weary and she was conscious of an increasing fatigue as the hours of toil passed on no breath of air came in from the sunbaked streets through the wideflung windows the atmosphere of the long low room in which over a hundred girls closely huddled together were working was sickly with the smell of cloth there was no conversation the click of the machines seemed sometimes to her partially dulled senses like the beating out of their human lives it seemed impossible that the afternoon would ever end the interval for tea came and passedtea in tin cans with thick bread and melting butter the respite was worse almost than the mechanical toil julias eyes ranged over the housetops westwards there was another world of trees flowers and breezes another world altogether she set her teeth it was hard to have no place in it a little time ago she had been content content even to suffer because she was toiling with these others whom she loved and for whom in her profound pity she poured out her life and her talents and now there was a change was it the spell of this cruel summer she wondered or was it something elsesome new desire in her incomplete life something from which for so many years she had been free she let her thoughts momentarily go adrift she was back again in the cab her fingers clutching his arm her heart thrilling with the wonderful passionate splendour of those few hours she recalled his looks his words his little acts of kindness she realised in those few moments how completely he filled her thoughts she began to tremble  better have your place by the window back again miss thurnbrein the girl at her side said suddenly youre looking like clara just before she popped off my aint it awful  julia came back to herself and refused the childs offer  i shall be all right directly she declared this weather cant last much longer  if only the storm would come the child muttered as she turned back to her work  if only the storm would come julia seemed to take these words with her as she passed at last into the streets at the stroke of the hour it was like that with her too there was something inside something around her heart which was robbing her of her rest haunting her through the long lonely nights torturing her through these miserable days soon she would have to turn and face it she shivered with fear at the thought  in the street a man accosted her she looked up with an almost guilty start a little cry broke from her lips it was one of disappointment and gravelings unpleasant lips were twisted into a sneer as he raised his cap  thought it was some one else eh he remarked well it isnt you see its me theres no one else with a mind to come down here this baking afternoon to fetch you  i thought it might be aaron she faltered  never mind whom you thought it might have been he answered gruffly aarons busy i expect typing letters to all the lords and ladies your mr maraton hobnobs with im here and i want to talk with you  i am too tired she pleaded i am going straight home to lie down  id thought of that he answered stubbornly ive got a taxicab waiting at the corner not often i treat myself to anything of that sort im going to take you up to one of those parks in the west end weve paid so much for and see so little of and when i get you there im going to talk to you you can rest on the way up theres a breeze blowing when you get out of these infernally hot streets  she was only too glad to sink back amongst the hard shiny leather cushions of the taxicab and half close her eyes the first taste of the breeze as they neared westminster bridge was almost ecstatic graveling had lit a pipe and smoked by her side in silence we are coming out of our bit of the earth now to theirs he remarked presently as they reached piccadilly brilliant with muslinclad women and flowerhung windows it isnt often i dare trust myself up here makes me feel as though id like to go amongst those sauntering swells and mincing ladies in their muslins and laces and parasols and run amuck amongst themsend them down like a pack of ninepins aye id send them into hell if i could  she was still silent she felt that she needed all her strength they drove on to the achilles statue where he dismissed the taxicab the man stared at the coin which he was offered and looked at the register  ere he exclaimed youre a nice un you are  graveling turned upon him almost fiercely  if you want a tip he said go and drive some of these fine ladies and gentlemen about whove got the money to give im a working man and luxuries arent for me be off with you or ill call a policeman  he shouldered his way across the pavement and julia followed him soon they found a seat in the shade of the trees she leaned back with a little sigh of content  five minutes she begged just five minutes  he glanced at his watch relit his pipe and relapsed once more into sombre silence julias thoughts went flitting away she closed her eyes and leaned back she had only one fear now would he find out he was thick enough in his way but he was no fool and he was already coarsely jealous  ten minutes youve had he announced at last look here julia ive brought you out to ask you a plain question are you going to marry me or are you not  i am not she answered steadily  he had been so certain of her reply that his face betrayed no disappointment only he turned a little in his chair so that he could watch her face she was conscious of the cruelty of his action  then i want to know what you are going to do he continued you are thin and white and worn out youre fit for something better than a tailoress and you know it and youre killing yourself at it youre losing your health and with your health youre losing your power of doing any work worth a snap of the fingers  it isnt so bad except this very hot weather she protested then im secretary to the guild you know i can do my work so much better when im really one of themselves besides they always listen to me at the meetings because i come straight from the benches  youve done your whack he declared no need to go on any longer and you know it i can make a little home for you right up in hampstead and you can go on with your writing and lecturing and give up this slavery you know you were thinking of it a short time back youve no one to consider but yourself youre half promised to me and i want you  i am sorry richard she said if i have ever misled you but i hope that from now onward at any rate there need be no shadow of misunderstanding i do not intend to marry my work is the greatest thing in life to me and i can continue it better unmarried  its the first time youve talked like this he persisted amy chatterton rachael weiss and most of em are married they stick at it all right dont they whats the matter with your doing the same  different people have different ideas she pronounced please be my friend richard and do not worry me about this you can easily find some one else there are any number of girls im sure whod be proud to be your wife as for me it is impossible  and why is it impossible he demanded in a portentous tone  because i do not care for you in that way she answered and because i have no desire to marry at all  he smoked sullenly at his pipe for several moments all the time his eyes were filled with smouldering malevolence  now i am going to begin to talk he said dont look as though you were going to run away because youre not i am going to talk to you about that fellow maraton  why do you mention his name she asked stiffening what has he to do with it  a good deal to my thinking was the grim reply its my belief that youve a fancy for him and thats why youve turned against me  youve no right to say anything of the sort she exclaimed  and by god why havent i he insisted striking his knee with his clenched fist havent you been my girl for six years before he came you were kind of shy but youd have been mine in the end and you know it waiting was all i had to do and i was content to wait and now hes come along and i know very well that i havent a dogs chance youre a working lass julia fit mate for a working man do you think hes one of our sort not he do you think hes for marrying a girl who works for her bread if you do youre a bigger fool than i think you hes forever nosing around amongst these swell ladies and gentlemen with handles to their names ladies and gentlemen who live on the other side of the earth to us he can talk like a prophet i grant you but thats all there is of the prophet about him peoples man indeed hell be the peoples man so long as it pays him and not a second longer  have you finished she asked quietly  no nor never shall have finished he continued raising his voice while hes playing the rotten game hes at now and youre mooning around after him as though he were a god ill never stop speaking until ive knocked the bottom out of that julia you never used to think anything of fine clothes and all these gentlemens tricks its all come of a sudden  have you finished she asked again  never in this life he replied fiercely i tell you he shant have you and you shant have him im there between and im not to be got rid of ill take one of you or both of you by the throat and strangle the life out of you before i quit it isnt he went on his face once more disfigured by that ample sneer it isnt that im afraid of his wanting to marry you he wont do that but hes one of those who are fond of messing aboutphilanderers the word if he tries it on with you hell find hell before his time sit down  she had risen to her feet he clutched at her skirt the sense of his touchshe was peculiarly sensitive to touchgave her the strength she needed she snatched it away  now she declared you have had your say this is what you get for it you have offended me our friendship is forgotten the less i see of you the more content i shall be and as to what i do or what becomes of me it isnt your business i shall do with myself exactly as i chooseexactly as i choose richard graveling you hear that she reiterated with blazing eyes and tone cruelly deliberate i havent much in the world but my body and my soul are my own i shall give them where i choose and on what terms i please if you try to follow me youll put me to the expense of a cab home thats all  she walked away with firm footsteps she felt stronger more of a woman than she had done all day graveling made no attempt to follow her he sat and smoked in stolid silence    chapter xix  julia was conscious of a new vitality as she left the park she was her own mistress now her half tie to graveling was permanently broken so much the better the mans personality had always been distasteful to her she had suffered him only as a fellow worker his overtures in other directions had kept her in a continual state of embarrassment but in her ignorance as to her own feelings she had hesitated to speak out she put sedulously behind her the question of what had brought this new enlightenment  she took the tube to the british museum and went round to see aaron the house was busier than she had ever seen it before taxicabs were coming and going and four or five people sat in the waitingroom aaron looked up and waved his hand as she entered he was alone in the study where he worked  come in he cried eagerly sit down its a joy to see you julia but i darent stop working ive forty or fifty letters to type before he comes in and hell be off again in halfanhour  she sank into an easy chair the atmosphere of the cool room with its opened windows and drawn venetian blinds was most restful  is everything going well aaron she asked him  he nodded  better than well theres a telegram just in from manchester we are bound to win there did you read foleys speech  yes did he mean it all do you think she asked doubtfully  every word he replied confidently weve got it here in black and white there has been a commission appointed members of the government if you pleasenothing less the masters have got an ultimatum if they refuse mr foley has asked maraton to frame a bill weve got the sketch of it here already what do you think of that julia  i only wish that i knew she murmured what can have happened to mr foley  they all do as maraton bids them aaron exclaimed triumphantly if only i had four hands i cant finish julia its impossible   she sprang up and tore off her gloves  let me help she cried eagerly you have another typewriter in the corner there i can work it and you know i could always read your shorthand  he accepted her help a little grudgingly  you must be careful then he enjoined with the air of one who confers a favour there must be no mistakes begin here and do those letters one carbon copy of each ill lift the machine on to the table for you  she propped up the book and very soon there was silence in the room except for the click of the two typewriters presently she stopped short and uttered a little cry  what is it he demanded without looking up from his work  this letter to the secretary of the unionist association nottingham  well  mr maraton is to go there thursday to address a meetinga unionist meeting  aaron glowered at her from over his typewriter  why not its mr foleys idea he wants mr maraton in parliament why not  but as a unionist she gasped nottingham isnt a labour constituency at all  he is coming in as a unionist so as to have a free hand we dont want any interference from peter dale and that lot  she looked at him aghast peter dale and his colleagues had been gods a few weeks ago  cant you see aaron continued irritably that the coming of maraton has changed many things a man like that cant serve under anybody and no man could come as a stranger and lead the labour party he has to be outside this is a working mans constituency he is pledged to fight capital fight it tooth and nail  i suppose its all right julia said it seems different somehow from what we had expected and he never goes to the clarion at all  why should he aaron demanded they are all jealous of him every one of em peter dale is the worst of the lot didnt you hear how they talked to him at manchester  she nodded and for a time they went on with their work she found herself however continually returning to the subject of those vital differences the maraton as they had dreamed of himthe prophet with the flaming sword and this wonderfully civilised person  tell me honestly aaron she asked presently what do you think of it allof himof his methods you are with him all the time havent you ever any doubts  she watched him closely she would have been conscious of the slightest tremor in his reply the slightest hesitation there was nothing of the sort he was merely tolerant of her ignorance  no one who knows maraton he pronounced could fail to trust him  after that she asked no more questions they worked steadily for another half hour or so messages were sometimes brought in to aaron which he summarily disposed of julia wondered at the new facility the heartwhole eagerness which he devoted to every trifling matter then just as she was halfway through copying out a pile of figures maraton came in he stood and watched them in the doorway half amused half surprised for a moment she kept her head down then she looked up slowly  since when he asked have i been the proud possessor of two secretaries  you left me letters enough for four sir aaron reminded him i wanted to finish them all so julia stayed to help me  maraton came smiling towards them  why i am afraid i forgot he said in america i used sometimes to have four typists working you cant possibly get out all those details by yourself aaron  we shall have finished this lot anyhow in an hour  you must get permanent help maraton insisted leave off now both of you i want to talk to your sister do you know he went on turning towards her that i have scarcely seen anything of you since manchester  my work keeps me rather a prisoner she explained and after these hot days one hasnt much energy left  you are still working at the tailoring  she nodded  i like to be in the midst of it all but this weather i am almost afraid i shant be able to go on the atmosphere is hateful it seems to draw all the life out of one  he glanced over her shoulder at the work she had been doing  why not come to me he suggested suddenly aaron needs help he cant possibly do everything for himself i have a thirst for information you know i want statistics on every possible subject there are seven or eight big corporations now whose wages bill i want to compare with the interest they pay on capital aaron doesnt have time even to answer the necessary letters i am in disgrace all round do come  she was sitting quite still looking at him it would have been impossible for any one to have guessed that his words were like music to her  but there is my trade she objected after all i am useful there i keep in touch with the girls  you have finished with that he argued you have done your work there they all know who you are and what you are you have lots of information which would be useful to me aaron must have some one to help him why not you as for the rest i can afford to pay two secretariesyou neednt be afraid of that  i never thought of it she assured him i shouldnt want very much money  leave that to me he begged only accept is it a promise come make it a promise and we will have an evening off all day long i seem to have been moving in a strained atmosphere talking to men who are only half in sympathy with me talking to men who are civil because they have brains enough to see the truth i want an hour or two of rest aaron shall telephone to gardner i was to have dined with him at his club but it is of no importance he was dining there anyhow and the other places i was going to this evening dont count telephone 1718 westminster aaron and say that mr maraton is unable to keep his dinner engagement with mr gardner and begs to be excused then well all go out together what do you say i have found something almost like a roof garden ill tell you all about new york  her face for a moment shone then she looked down at her gown he laughed  you have done your days work and ive done mine he remarked i dare say of the two yours is the more worthy well go just as we are get rid of those people who are waiting aaron i had a look at them they are all the usual classcadgers  there is one gentleman whom you must see aaron declared i didnt put him in the waitingrooma mr beldeman he came to see you in manchester  beldeman  maraton repeated the name then he smiled  a very sensational gentleman he observed came to offer mebut never mind i told you about that yes youre right aaron he is always interesting take your sister away for a few minutes you can be getting ready when ive finished with mr beldeman well start out i shant change a thing  mr beldeman entered the room carrying his hat in his hand unruffled by his long wait to all appearance wearing the same clothes the same smile as on his visit to the hotel in manchester maraton greeted him goodhumouredly  well mr beldeman he began you see i have made things all right for your syndicate of manufacturers although i couldnt accept your offer sit down you wont keep me long will you i have to go out perhaps you are going to give me a little for my lancashire operatives they can do with it strike pay over here is none too liberal you know  mr beldeman laid down his hat he blinked for a moment behind his gold spectacles  the lancashire strike he said softly is of very little service to my principals as you know it is more than that for which we were hoping  maraton nodded but made no remark  my principals mr beldeman continued have watched your career mr maraton for some time they have studied eagerly your speeches and your writings and when you arrived on this side they expected something more from you they expected in fact the enunciation of a certain doctrine which you have already propounded with singular eloquence in other parts of the world they expected to find it the text of your first words to labour in this country i refer of course to the universal strike  it was my great theory maraton admitted suddenly grave i will not say even now that i have abandoned it it is in abeyance  my principals mr beldeman remarked slowly would like it to take place  maraton smiled  your principals i presume he said do not imagine that i am on the earth to gratify them even though they did offer melet me see how much was ita million pounds  this time mr beldeman went on it is not a question of money  not a question of money maraton repeated you dont want to buy me what do you want to do then  we threaten mr beldeman pronounced calmly  maraton for a moment seemed puzzled  threaten he murmured thoughtfully come do i understand you properly is it assassination or anything of that sort youre talking about beldeman shook his head  those are methods for extreme cases he said yours is not an extreme case we do not threaten you mr maraton with death but we do threaten you with the death of your reputation the end of your career as a political power in this country if you do not see your way clear to act as we desire  maraton stood for a few seconds perfectly still  you have courage mr beldeman he remarked  sir mr beldeman replied i have been as near death as most men that is why i occupy my present position i am the special agent of the greatest political power in the world when i choose to make use of my machinery i can kill or spare abduct rob ruinwhat i choose you i only threaten i fancy that will be enough we have our hold upon the press of this country  maraton walked to the door and back again  i killed a man once mr beldeman he said who threatened me  you will not kill me mr beldeman declared with gentle confidence in his tone  if i had known maraton continued softly id have wrung your neck at manchester  quite easy i should say mr beldeman agreed you look strong without a doubt i could make you desperate better be reasonable my people want the railway strike the coal strike and the iron strikewant them both within a month come what are you afraid of stick to your colours mr maraton wasnt it in the north american review you declared that a war and conquest were the inevitable prelude of social reform in this country  did i say that maraton asked  you did now you are here you are afraid never mind war and conquest are to come we give you a month in which to deliver your message you have i believe two large meetings to address before that date make your pronouncement and all will be well the million is yours for the people  a sort of gigantic blackmail maraton remarked drily  you can call it what you like if you have conditions to make i am prepared to listen i do not insult you by offering  maraton flung open the door a little noisily  that will do mr beldeman he said i congratulate you upon the manner in which you have conducted this interview i presume i shall see you again one day before the month is up  you certainly will mr beldeman replied if you should want me beforean advance payment or anything of that sorti am at the royal hotel  maraton was alone in the room for some moments he remained motionless he heard aaron and julia in the hall but he did not hasten to join them he moved instead to the window and stood watching beldemans retreating form    chapter xx  maraton led the way on to the roof of one of londons newer hotels  they wont give us dinner here he explained london isnt civilised enough for that yet or perhaps its a matter of climate but we can get all sorts of things to eat and some wine and sit and watch the lights come out i was here the other night alone and i thought it the most restful spot in london  he called a waiter and had a table drawn up to the palisaded edge of the roof then he slipped something into the mans hand and there seemed to be no difficulty about serving them with anything they required  a salad some sandwiches a bottle of hock and plenty of strawberries we shant starve at any rate maraton declared lean back in your chairs you children of the city lean down and look at your mother look at her smokehung arms stretched out as though to gather in the universe and the lights upon her bosomsee how they come twinkling into existence  both of them followed his outstretched finger with their eyes but julia only shivered  i hate it she muttered hate it all london seems to me like a great rapacious monster our bodies and souls are sacrificed over there for what i was in piccadilly and the parks today is there any justice in the world i wonder its just as though there were a kink in the great wheels and they werent running true  sometimes i think maraton declared that the matter would right itself automatically but for the interference of weak people the laws of life are tampered with so often by people without understanding they keep alive the unworthy they try to make life easier for the unfit they endow hospitals and build model dwellings its a sop to their consciences its like planting a flower on the grave of the man you have murdered  but these things help aaron protested  help they retard maraton insisted all charity is the most vicious form of selfindulgence cant you see that if the poor died in the street and the sick were left to crawl about the face of the earth the whole business would right itself automatically the unfit would die out a stronger generation would arise a generation stronger and better able to look after itself but come we have been serious long enough you are tired with your days work miss julia and aaron too ive been in the committee room of the house of commons half the day and my heads addled with figures here comes our supper let us drop the more serious things of life well try and put a little colour into your cheeks young lady  he served them both and filled their glasses with wine then as he ate he leaned back in his chair and watched them for all her strange beauty julia too was one of the suffering children of the world the lines of her figure which should have been so subtle and fascinating were sharpened by an unnatural thinness aarons cheeks were almost like a consumptives his physique was puny there was something in their expression common to both maraton was conscious of a wave of pity as he withdrew his eyes  sometimes he said i feel almost angry with you two you carry on your shoulders the burden of other peoples sufferings it is well to feel and realise them and the gift of sympathy is a beautiful thing but our own individualism is also a sacred gift it is not for us to weaken or destroy it by encouraging a superabundant sympathy for others we each have our place in the world whether we owe it to fate or our own efforts and it is our duty to make the best of it our own happiness indeed is a present charge upon ourselves for the ultimate benefit of others a happy person in the world does good always you two have a leaning towards morbidness if i had time i would undertake your education as it is we will have another bottle of wine and i shall take you to a music hall  it was an evening that lived in julias mind with particular vividness for years to come and yet one which she always found it difficult to piece together in her thoughts they went to one of the less fashionable music halls where the turns were frequent and there was no ballet aaron was very soon able to reestablish his temporarily lost capacity for enjoyment maraton leaning back in his place with a cigar in his mouth appreciated everything and applauded constantly it was julia who found the new atmosphere most difficult she laughed often it is true but she had always a semisubjective feeling as though it were some other person who was really there and she the instrument chosen to give physical indication of that other persons presence only once life seemed suddenly to thrill and burn in her veins to shoot through her body with startling significance and in that brief space of time life itself was transformed for her maraton by chance found her hand as they sat side by side and held it for a moment in his there was nothing secret about his action the firm pressure of his fingers even seemed as though they might have been the kindly encouraging touch of a sympathetic friend but upon julia his touch was magical the rest of the evening faded into insignificance she understood feelings which had come to her that afternoon in the park with absolute completeness for the first time from that moment she took her place definitely amongst the women who walk through life but whose feet seldom touch the earth  when the performance was over maraton called a taxicab  aaron he directed you must take your sister back to her lodgings no i insist he added as she protested no buses tonight go home and sleep well and think about yourself  she shook her head  i will go home in a taxi she agreed if you will do one thing for me it wont take long it has been in my mind ever since you said what you did about charity i want us all to go down to the embankment it isnt late enough really but i want you to come  he sighed  you are incorrigible he declared never mind we will go how good the air is well walk  they turned along the strand and descended the narrow street which led to the embankment then they walked slowly as far as blackfriars bridge they neither of them spoke a word from time to time they glanced at the silent and motionless figures on the seats for the most part the loiterers there were either asleep or sitting with closed eyes here and there they caught a glance from some spectral face a glance cold and listless the fires of life were dead amongst these people the animal desires alone remained their faces were dumb  they stood together at the corner of blackfriars bridge  well maraton said i have done your bidding i have been here before many times and i have been here in the winter  tell me she asked there is a girl there on that third seat crying am i doing wrong if i go to her and give her money for a nights lodging  without a doubt he answered and yet i expect youll do it principles are splendidin the abnegation if we are to be illogical let me be the breaker of my own laws  he thrust some money into her hand and julia disappeared for some time she remained talking with the figure upon the seat aaron and maraton leaned over the corner of the bridge and looked down the curving arc of lights towards the houses of parliament  i shall end there you know aaron maraton sighed i am not looking forward to it its a queer sort of a hothouse for a man  i wonder aaron murmured thoughtfully i used to think of you travelling from one to the other of the great cities and i used to think that when you had spoken to them the people would see the truth and rise and take their own i used to be very fond of the old testament once he went on his voice sinking a little lower life was so simple in those days and the words of a prophet seemed greater than any laws  and nowadays maraton continued life has become like a huge and complex piece of machinery humanity has given way to mechanics aaron i dont believe i can help this people by any other way save by laws  they both turned quickly around julia was standing by their side and with her the girl  i told her julia explained that it was not my money i was offering but the money of a gentleman who was the greatest friend the poor people of the world have ever known she wanted to speak to you  the girl drew her shawl a little closer around her shoulders her face bore upon it the terrible stamp of suffering without its redeeming purification save for her abundant hair her very sex would have been unrecognisable she looked steadily at maraton  you sent me money she said  i did he admitted  are you one of those softhearted fools who go about doing this sort of thing she demanded  i am not he replied i object to giving money away i am sorry to see people suffering but as a rule i think that it is their own fault if they come to the straits that you are in i sent the money to please this young lady  their own fault eh she muttered  i qualify that he added quickly their own fault because they submit to a heritage of unjust laws it is your own fault because you dont join together and smash the laws you would fill the jails perhaps but youd make it easier for those who came after  she stood quite silent for a moment when she spoke the truculent note had departed from her tone  i came here she said meaning to chuck this money in your face i thought you were one of these canting hypocrites who salve their consciences by giving away what they dont want my baby died this morning in the hospital and they turned me out if i keep your money do you know what i shall do with it get drunk  he nodded  why not  she looked at him stolidly  when ive spent it i shall go into the river im not fit for anything else im too weak to work and for the rest look at me im as ugly as sin itselfjust a few bones held together  take the money and get drunk maraton advised youre quite right theres no help for you youve no spirit to help yourself if you hang on to the crust of the world through charity you only do the world harm youre better out of it  she gathered up the money and shivered a little  ill drink yer health she muttered as she turned away  julia half started to follow her but maraton held her arm  useless he whispered shes one of the broken creatures of the world whilst you keep her alive you spread corruption shell probably hang on to life until it gives her up  he called a taxi  now i am going to have my own way he announced aaron is going to take you home i came here because you wished it but its very amateurish you know this sort of thing its on a par with district visiting and slumming and all the rest of it a disease in the body sometimes brings out scars a doctor doesnt stare at the scars he treats the body for the disease get these places out of your mind julia they are only useful inasmuch as they remind us of the black truth  he took her hands  remember he added that youve finished with the tailoring for a time aaron will want you tomorrow or as soon as you can come weve piles of work to do  her eyes shone at him  work she murmured but think of the difference if it wasnt for what youve just said about individualism i think that i should be feeling cruelly selfish  rubbish he exclaimed youre secretary of the womens guild arent you you can keep that up ill come and talk to your girls some day your work has been too narrow down there there are some other womens industries i want you to enquire into till tomorrow  he strode vigorously away the taxicab turned eastward over blackfriars bridge    chapter xxi  on the following morning maraton saw elisabeth for the first time since his return from manchester as he rang the bell of mr foleys residence in downing street at a few minutes before the hour at which he had been bidden to luncheon he found himself wondering with a leaven of resentment in his feelings why he had so persistently avoided the house during the last three weeks all his consultations with mr foley and they had been many had taken place at the house of commons he had refused endless invitations of a social character and even when mr foley had told him in plain words that his niece was anxious to see him maraton had postponed his call this luncheon party however was inevitable he was to meet a great lawyer who had a place in the government and two other cabinet ministers no excuse would have served his purpose  the man who took his hat and coat had evidently received special instructions  mr foley is engaged with his secretary sir he said a messenger has just arrived from abroad will you come this way  he was taken to elisabeths little room she was there waiting for him directly she rose he knew why he had kept away  are you not a little ashamed of yourself mr maraton she asked as the door was closed behind the departing servant  on the contrary he replied i am proud  she laughed at him naturally at first but with a note of selfconsciousness following swiftly as she realised the significance of his words  how foolish really i know it is only a subterfuge to avoid being scolded sit down wont you you will have to wait at least ten minutes for luncheon  they looked at one another he took up a volume of poems from the small table by his side and put it down again  well she asked  you have conquered he declared you see i came down to earth  it isnt possible for me she said simply to tell you how glad i am dont you yourself feel that you have done the right thing  since that night at manchester he told her i have scarcely stopped to think do you know that your strongest allies were mr peter dale and his men  she shrugged her shoulders  i disclaim my allies if we arrived at the same conclusion we did so by differing lines of thought let me tell you she went on there were two things for which i have prayed one was that you might start your fight exactly as you have done the other that you might find no official place amongst the labour members of course i cant pretend to the practical experience of a real politician but my uncle talks to me a great deal and to me the truth seemed so clear it is the advanced unionists who need you they are really the party from whom progress must come because it is the middle class which has to be attacked and it is amongst the middle classes that liberalism has its stronghold if you once took your place among the labour members you would be a labour member and nothing else people wouldnt take what you said seriously  i am coming into the house if at all as an independent member he announced  she nodded  mr foley is quite satisfied with thatin fact he thinks its best do you know he seems to have gained a new lease of life during the last few weeks what do you think of his commission on your manchester strike  he kept his word maraton admitted i expected no less  i can tell you this she went on because i know that he will tell you himself after luncheon the masters met here this morning they are simply furious with my uncle but they have had to give in the bill you drafted would have been rushed through parliament without a moments delay if they had not mr foley showed them your draft they have given in on every point  i am afraid im going to keep your uncle rather busy maraton remarked very soon after this is settled i have promised to speak at sheffield  in a way it is terrible she said with a sigh and yet it is so much better than the things we feared tell me about yourself a little wont you how have you been spending your time you have a large gloomy house here they tell me shrouded with mystery have you any amusements or have you been working all the time  half my days have been spent with your uncle he reminded her the other half at home working so many of my facts were rusty as to my house is it really mysterious i wonder it is large and gloomy at the extreme corner of an unfashionable square it suits me because i love space and quietness and yet i like to be near the heart of things  but do you do nothing but work she asked have you no hobbies  he shook his head  i seem to have had no time for games i like walking walking in the country or even walking in the cities and watching the people only the london streets are so sad then i am fond of reading im afraid i should be rather a strange figure if i were to be suddenly projected into your world lady elisabeth  but i like to feel that you are in my world she said gently believe me it isnt altogether made up of people who play games  i read the daily papers he remarked didnt i see something yesterday about lady elisabeth landon having won the scratch prize at ranelagh at a ladies golf meeting  she laughed pleasantly  oh well she protested you must make allowance for my bringing up we begin to play games in this country as soon as we can crawl about the nursery it all depends upon the value you set upon these things  a servant knocked at the door and announced the service of luncheon elisabeth rose reluctantly to her feet  now i suppose i must hand you over to the serious business of life she sighed if you do have a minute to spare when you have finished with my uncle she added in a lower tone as they passed down the wide staircase side by side come up and see me before you go i shall be in till four oclock  the familiarity of her words half whispered in his ear the delightful suggestion of some confidential understanding between them were alike fascinating to him in her plain white serge coat and skirt and smart hatshe had just come in from walking in the parkshe seemed to him to represent so perfectly the very best and most delightful type of womanhood her complexion was perfect her skin fresh as a childs she carried herself with the spring and grace of one who walks through life selfconfidently fortified always with the knowledge that she was a favourite with women as well as with men he sat by her side at luncheon and he could not help admiring the delicate tact with which she prevented the conversation from ever remaining more than a few seconds in channels which might have made him feel something of an alien there was another nephew of mr foleys there a famous polo player and sportsman lord carton whose eyes seldom left elisabeths face sir william blend the great lawyer mr horrill and lord armley these with elisabeths mother and herself made up the party  i think i am going to bar politics lady grenside said as she took her place  impossible mr foley retorted in high good humour this is a political luncheon we have great and weighty matters to discuss you women are permitted to be present but we allot to you the hardest task of allsilence  a sheer impossibility so far as mother is concerned elisabeth observed as for me i call myself a practical politician i intend to take part in the discussion  mr foley looked across the round table with twinkling eyes  we are going to talk about universal manhood suffrage he announced  scandalous elisabeth declared before we have our votes  perhaps maraton suggested it was universal suffrage that mr foley meant  including children and aliens lady grenside remarked i am sure the children at the school i went over yesterday could have ruled the nation admirably they seemed to know positively everything  mother you are too frivolous elisabeth insisted if this tone of levity is not dropped i shall start another subject of conversation mr maraton you of course are in favour of universal manhood suffrage  i am not at all sure about it he replied it gives the vote to a lot of people id sooner see deported  but youyou to talk like that she exclaimed  he smiled  votes should belong to those who have a stake in the country not to the flotsam and jetsam he continued solemnly  but youre a tory she cried  not a bit he answered if i had my way you would very soon see that one man wouldnt have so much more stake in the country than another then universal suffrage follows automaticallyin fact thats the way id arrive at it  dont ever let mr maraton be prime minister elisabeth begged hes too iconoclastic  and just now i was a tory maraton protested  it isnt my fault that you are a study in contraries she laughed but then politicians are rather like that arent they i think really that they should be like surgeons specialise all the time  come down to ranelagh and play golf after luncheon lord carton suggested abruptly from across the table ive got my little racing car outside and ill take you down there like a rocket  thanks she answered i want particularly to stay in till four oclock this afternoon besides you cant play golf you know  i dont think elisabeth has improved he remarked to her mother turning deliberately away  and i am sure jacks left his heart in central america elisabeth declared he was always fond of darkcomplexioned ladies mr maraton have you been a great traveller  he shook his head  i have been in south america he replied and i know most of the country between san francisco and new york pretty well  and europe she asked  i walked from vienna to paris when i was a boy he told her its years though since i was on the continent  her cousin began to talk of his hunting experiences and every one listened as soon as the service of luncheon was concluded lady grenside rose  i dare say we shall all meet again before you go she said coffee is being served to you in the library stephen we wont say goodbye to anybody jack dont forget that you are dining here tonight you shall take in the blackest young lady i can pick out for you  elisabeth followed her mother at the last moment maraton caught a little whisper which only just floated from her lips  till four oclock  the two younger men took their departure almost immediately the others moved into the library mr foley plunged at once into the subject which was uppermost in their minds  mr maraton he began we want to talk about these strikes horrill here and blend have an idea that you are working towards some definite resultthat you have more in your mind than i have told them it is only this morning he went on in a lower tone and glancing towards the closed door that i explained to them your manchester speech they know now that england has you to thank for the fact that we are not at this moment preparing for war    chapter xxii  between three and four oclock half a dozen people on different devices tried to draw elisabeth from her retirement her particular friend called to suggest a round of the picture galleries tea at the club and a motor ride to ranelagh lord carton repeated his invitation to a game of golf two people invited her out into the country on various pretexts her dressmaker rang up and begged for her presence without delay to all of these importunities elisabeth remained deaf she sat in her room in an easychair drawn up to the open window with a book in her hand at which she scarcely glanced her thoughts were with the five men downstairs every now and then she glanced at the clock she heard the conference break up she sat quite still listening presently there was the sound of a firm tread upon the stairs she closed her book and breathed a little sigh a servant ushered in maraton  you have not forgotten then she said softly come and sit in my favourite chair and rest for a few moments i am sure that you must be tired  he sank down with an air of content she sat upon the end of the sofa close to him her head resting upon her hands  well she asked have you converted sir william  up to a certain extent i believe he answered after a momentary hesitation i dont think that he trusts me lawyers have a habit of not trusting people you know on the other hand i dont think he means to give any trouble of course they dont like what they have to face no one does it isnt every one who has the sagacity of your uncle  i am glad she said that you appreciate him tell me now what is going to happen  mr foley will have his own way maraton declared the manchester strike will be over in a few days the sheffield strike will be dealt with in the same manner people will talk about the great loss of trade the shocking depreciation of profits the lowered incomes of the people and all that sort of thing what will really happen will be that the investor and the manufacturer are going to pay and labour is going to get just about a tithe of its own in these two cases the country will be none the poorer the money will be still there only its distribution will be saner  and the end of it she murmured what will the end of it be  we can none of us tell that he answered gravely there are some like sir william who insist that when labour has once started as it will have started after sheffield there will be no holding it i can not answer for it i only say that the course mr foley has adopted is distinctly the best for the country if an obstinate man had been in his place today nothing could have saved you from civil war first and possibly from foreign conquest later  a month ago she observed you seemed fully prepared for these things  i was he admitted  but you are an englishman are you not  i am english i daresay that under other considerations i might even have called myself a patriotic englishman as it is i have very little feeling of that sort there has been too much selfglorification and its the wrong class of people whove revelled in it and enjoyed it its a fine thing to die for ones country its a shameful thing that that country should grind the life and brains and blood out of a hundred of her children day by day  a servant brought in tea delightfully served there were small yellow china cups pale tea with a faint aromatic odour thick cream strawberries and cakes  if only you would appreciate it she declared you are really rather a privileged person no one has tea with me here  i do appreciate it he assured her perhaps more than you think  there was a moments silence as he was taking his cup from her fingers their eyes met and she looked away again almost immediately  i wish she said that you would tell me more about yourselfwhat you did in america what your life has been you are rather a mysterious person arent you  in a sense perhaps i must seem so he admitted you see i was an orphan very early there wasnt any one who cared how i grew up and i wandered a good deal the earlier part of my life i was over herei was at heidelberg university bye the byeand in paris for two years studying art of all things then somethingi dont know what it wascalled me to america and i found it hard to come back its a big country you know lady elisabeth it gets hold of you if it hadnt driven me out i doubt whether i should ever have left it  but what was it first inspired you with thiswell wouldnt you call it a passionfor championing the cause of the people  he shook his head  born in me i suppose i have watched them lived with them and then i have been through the whole gamut of socialistic literature it is not worth reading most of it the essential facts are there to look at halfadozen phrases a single field of view its all very simple  now i am going to ask you something else she went on that first night when we talked together you seemed so full of hope so dauntless since then is it my fancysince you came back from manchesterare you a little disappointed with life dont you know in your heart that youve done whats best  i wish i did he answered simply my common sense tells me that i have chosen well and then sometimes in the nights or when i am alone other thoughts come to me and i feel almost as though i had been faithless as though i had simply chosen the easier way look how pleasant it is all being made for me i am no longer an outcast i bask in the sun of your uncles patronage people ask me to dinner seek my friendship people whom i feel ought to hate me i am not sure about it all  listen she said if you had indeed pulled down those pillars dont you think that day by day and night by night you would have been haunted by the faces of those whom you had destroyed think of the children who would have died of starvation the women who would have been torn from their husbands the ruined homes the sorrow and the misery all through the land yours would have been the hand which had dealt this blow you would not have lived to have seen into the future would it have been enough for you to have believed that you had done it for the bestthat that unborn generation of which you spoke would have unfitted oh i do not think so i believe that when you realise it you must be glad  it is at any rate consoling to hear you say so he remarked yet when you have made up your mind to play the martyr it is a little hard he added helping himself to strawberries to be treated like a pampered being  in other words she laughed you are discontented because you have been successful  i suppose human nature never meant to let us rest satisfied  dont you ever think of yourself she asked what your own life is going to be youve settled down now you will be a member of parliament in a few weeks a cabinet minister before long i know what my uncle thinks of you he believes in you to tell you the truth so do i  i am glad  i believe she went on that you will do the work that you came here to do there is no reason why you should not do it from the cabinet but there is the restyour own life are you never going to amuse yourself to take holiday to draw some of the outside things into your scheme of being  he sat quite silent for a little time he was inclined to struggle against the charm of her soft voice the easy intimacy with which she treated him in a sense he felt as though he were losing control of himself  i dont know he said i think one ought to find ones work sufficient for a time it is engrossing isnt it and that reminds mei must go  he rose almost abruptly to his feet she was quick to appreciate his slight confusion of thought his nervous selfimpatience and she smiled quietly she was content to let him escape she held out her hand though and his fingers seemed conscious of the firm delicate warmth of her clasp  come and talk to me again soon she begged come either as a politician or a friend or however you like it gives me so much pleasure to talk with you uncle will tell you that every one spoils me even sir william comes and tells me about his troubles with the irish members will you come  he made a half promise his departure was a little hastyalmost abrupt he was conscious of a distinct turmoil of feeling he hurried away as though anxious to rid himself of the influence of the place at the corner of the street he was about to hail a taxicab when a man gripped him by the arm he turned quickly around the face was somehow familiar to himthe grey untidy beard long hairy eyebrows sunken eyes the shabby clothes it was david ross  can i speak a word with you mr maraton  maraton nodded  of course i dont remember your name you were at manchester werent you and at my house with the others  ross my name is the man answered id no call to be at manchester for im not one of the delegates im not an mp but ive done a lot of speaking for them lately and peter dale he said if i paid my own expenses i could come along i borrowed the money i had to come i had to hear you speak i wanted to know your message  were you satisfied with it maraton enquired  i dont know was the doubtful reply you ask me a question i cant answer myself i thought so at the time but since then ive spent many sleepless nights and many tired hours asking myself that question now i am here to ask you one did you speak that night what you had in your mind when you left americawhat you thought of on the steamer coming overwhat you meant to say when first you set foot in this country  maraton was interested he walked slowly along by the side of his companion  i did not he admitted i came with other views  i knew it ross exclaimed almost fiercely i felt it man you came to preach redemption even though the means were sharp and short and sudden means of blood means of death before you ever came here i seemed to hear your voice crying across that great continent crying even across the ocean it was a terrible cry but it seemed as though it must reach up into heaven and down into hell for it was aflame with truth it seemed to me that i could see the revolution upon us the death that is like sleep the looking down once more from some undiscovered place upon the new morning you never uttered that cry over here  maraton glanced at his companion curiously  mine was an immense responsibility he said granted that i had the power do you think that i had the right to stir up a civil war here in the face of the help i was promised for our people  david ross sighed  i dont know he confessed i only know that many years ago peter dale when he was a young man spoke as though the word of truth were burning in his heart he was for a revolution he would be content with nothing less and borden was like that and graveling and others whom you dont know and then the people gave them their mandate knocked a bit of money together and sent them to parliament there somehow or other they seemed to fall into the easier ways they worked stolidly and honestly no doubt but something had gone something weve all missed something that by this time might have helped when they told meit was aaron who came and told merode his bicycle like a madman all the way from soho maraton is come he shouted then it seemed to me that freedom was here no more compromises but battlethe naked sword battle with the wrongs of generations to requite is the sword sheathed  maraton passed his arm through his companions  it is not sheathed he declared nor while i have life will it be sheathed if i have chosen the quieter methods it is because for the present i have come to believe that they are the best six hundred thousand people in lancashire are going to start life next monday with an increase of between fifteen and twenty per cent to their weekly wage isnt that something to the good and then in a few weeks every forge and furnace in sheffield will be cold until the mens demands are granted there and when that is over we go for every industry one by one throughout the country before a year is past i reckon that many millions will have passed from the pockets of the middle classes into the pockets of the labouring man i am going to set that stream running faster and faster and then i am going to begin all over again with prosperity the labouring classes will gain strength you will have more time for thought for education for selfknowledge and as they gain strength once more we raise our hands do they seem slow to you our methods david ross believe me they did to me yet in my heart i know that i have chosen the right  the man drew a little sigh there may have been disappointment mingled with it yet there was a certain amount of relief  i was afraid for you maraton he said i thought of those others when they stumbled upon the easy ways and i was afraid with you it may be different hold on your way then it is not for me to criticise but if you slacken if your hand droops then i shall come again  he turned abruptly away and disappeared walking with quick shambling footsteps maraton looked after him thoughtfully for several moments then he continued on his way homewards    chapter xxiii  the last words had been spoken the suspense of a few hours was at an end maraton was on his way back to london a duly accredited member of parliament for the eastern division of nottingham from his place in the railway carriage he fancied that he could hear even now the roar of voices feel the thrill of emotion with which he had waited for the result an independent member even when backed as maraton had been backed is never in a wholly safe position on the whole he had done well he had increased the majority of four hundred to a majority of seven hundred and this too in the face of unexpected difficulties at the last minute a surprise had been sprung upon the constituency a labour candidate had entered the field maratons telegram to peter dale had produced no reply the man if not officially recognised was at least not officially discouraged his intervention had been useless however maraton had carried the working men with him in a sense it was an election on the strangest issues which had ever been fought many of the most farseeing journalists of the day predicted in this new alliance the redistribution of parties which for some time had been inevitable so far as maraton was concerned it was without doubt an unexpected phase in his career he was maraton mp representative of a manufacturing town elected indeed as an independent but with a weighty backing of the unionist party behind him the next time he spoke probably if he did speak before his journey to sheffield would be in the house of commons would he like those others feel the inertia of it the slow decay of his ambitions the fatal tendency towards compromise  arrived at st pancras maraton drove straight to his house in russell square and letting himself in with his latchkey made his way to the study the lights were still burning there julia and aaron were sitting opposite to one another at the end of the long table a typewriter between them and a pile of papers by aarons side julia rose at once to her feet  you are in she cried we have been telephoning all the evening we heard half an hour ago  maraton nodded  in by seven hundred not bad i suppose considering that i must have been rather a hard nut to crack has peter dale been here  aaron shook his head  he hasnt been near the place  maratons face hardened  you know that they sprang a labour candidate upon me at the last moment he did me no particular harm but it was an infamous trick i wired to dale yesterday and had no reply  david ross has been here aaron said we heard all about it from him there is dissension in the camp dale was in favour of withdrawing their candidate but graveling wouldnt have it  he did me no harm anyway maraton remarked the labour vote was mine from the start  so it ought to have been aaron declared vigorously what could they do but vote for you with manchester staring them in the face  maratons expression lightened a gleam of humour twinkled in his eyes  after all he murmured it would have been almost gilbertian if i had been returned to parliament with the labour vote against me    aaron go and ring up peter dale i want this matter cleared up ask him when we can meet  aaron left the room upon his errand maraton moved restlessly about the room for a moment or two he mixed himself a drink at the sideboard and lit a cigarette julias eyes followed him all the time  so you are a member of parliament she said at last  i hope you approve he queried  julia did not answer him at once he looked across at her from the depth of the easy chair into which he had thrown himself she was wearing a plain black dress buttoned to her throat and unrelieved even by a linen collar or any touch of white she was pale and her eyes seemed all the more beautiful for the faint violet lines beneath them  parliament has been the grave of so many mens careers maraton continued i am fully warned nothing of the sort is going to happen to me i wouldnt have gone in now but for foley its only fair it helps him and hes sticking to his pledges like a man  when do you go to sheffield she asked  next wednesday no postponements  julia nodded  mr elgood has been here this afternoon she said from sheffield he is the secretary of the union you know he is coming again tomorrow morning he wants to talk to you about the boys age limit  any letters of consequence  julia pointed a little disdainfully to a pile upon the table  all invitations she observed coldly perhaps you had better look them through  maraton shook his head  they are no use to me he declared unless theyre political  he rose and stood by julias side glancing idly through the heap of papers by the side of her machine  you seem to have found plenty to do anyway he remarked  there was a great deal she assured him i think i have collected all the possible information you can need on the steel works of sheffield  havent been overworking i hope  she laughed at him softly her parted lips seemed somehow to lighten her face  this doesnt quite compare with nine hours a day over a sewing machine with a hundred other girls packed into a small room she reminded him no i havent been overworking i almost wished an hour ago that i could find something more to do  why didnt you go out  tomorrow night is guild night she said i go out then to talk to my girls miss stevens is coming from the lyceum club to lecture to us on womans suffrage  do you want a vote he asked  if it comes she replied it isnt worth worrying about i like my girls though to be taught to think  there was a brief silence maraton was still examining the letters laid out for his inspection julia was standing by his side as the last one slipped through his fingers he turned quickly towards her oppressed by some mysterious significance in her silence her eyes were luminous she seemed to be trembling she avoided his enquiring glance  julia he exclaimed  she lifted her head slowly almost unwillingly though her lips were parted she made no attempt at speech then the door was suddenly opened aaron entered in some excitement  mr dale and some of the others are here now sir he announced i heard they were on their way when i telephoned they would like to see you at once  maraton stood for a moment quite still without replying aaron gazed across the table in some surprise  what shall i say to them he asked they are here now  maraton shrugged his shoulders  let them come in he directed    chapter xxiv  the three menpeter dale abraham weavel and graveling filed into the room a little solemnly maraton shook hands with the two former but graveling who kept his head turned away from julia affected not to notice maratons friendly overtures  so you managed it all right peter dale remarked pretty close fit wasnt it  seven hundred maraton replied not so bad considering you see i was a complete stranger and i am not sure that i have learnt the knack yet of that sort of platform speaking  however that may be abraham weavel declared accepting a cigar from the box which maraton had ordered and standing with his hands underneath his coattails upon the hearthrug youve done the trick youre an mp same as we are  youve no objection i hope maraton remarked lightly  thats as may be mr weavel observed sententiously we dont so to speak know exactly where we are just at this moment theres all sorts of rumours going about and we want them cleared up go on dale ask him the first question youre spokesman you know  mr peter dale threw away the match with which he had just lit his pipe sampled the whiskey and water to which he had helped himself with a most liberal hand and deliberately selected the most comfortable chair within reach with his hands in his trousers pockets the thumbs protruding his pipe in the lefthand corner of his mouth his eyebrows drawn close together he looked steadfastly towards maraton  the first question he began stolidly is this you owe your seat in parliament to the unionists what have you promised them in return you havent attempted to commit us to anything i hope  certainly not maraton replied such an idea never occurred to me so far as i know he went on after a moments hesitation mr foley is not at the moment in need of your support his majority is sufficient  peter dale frowned ominously  that may or may not be he remarked gruffly so long as you havent taken it upon yourself to pledge us to anything well that disposes of question number one the next is where are you going to sit in the house  maratons eyebrows were slightly raised  where am i going to sit he repeated remember if you please that as a member i have never been inside your house of commons i am not acquainted with its procedure where in your opinion ought i to sit  your place is with us peter dale declared i cant see that theres any doubt about that  and why  youre a labour man arent you peter dale asked you call yourself one anyway  if i am a labour man maraton said why did you put up a candidate to oppose me at nottingham  peter dale smoked steadily for several moments  it was nowt to do with me he announced the fellow sprung up all on his own as it were graveling here may have known something of it but so far as we are concerned he was not an authorised candidate  maraton shrugged his shoulders slightly  there was nothing he objected to convey that idea to the electors he made use of the labour agent and the labour committee rooms my telegram to you remained unanswered under those circumstances i really can scarcely see how you find it possible to disown him  in any case abraham weavel intervened with conciliation in his tone he didnt do himself a bit a good nor you a bit of harm four hundred and thirty votes he polled out of eight thousand and those were votes which otherwise would have gone to the liberal i should say myself that it did you good if anything  you may be right maraton admitted at the same time one thing is very clear you did not offer me the slightest official support it is true that i did not ask for it i prefer as i have told you all along my independence it will be my object to continue without direct association with any party if i can find a place in the house allotted to independent members i shall sit there if not i shall sit with the unionists  peter dales face darkened this was what they had feared  you mean that youre breaking away from us he exclaimed angrily theres no room in our little party for independent members no sort of sense in a mere handful of us all pulling different ways  i never joined your party mr dale maraton reminded him i have never joined any mans party i am for the people  and what about us graveling demanded arent we for the people isnt that what were in parliament for isnt that why we are called labour members  maraton regarded the last speaker steadily  mr graveling he said since you have mooted the question i will admit that i do not consider you as a body of men entirely devoted to the cause of the people you are each devoted to your own constituency it is your business to look after the few thousand voters who sent you into parliament and in your eagerness to serve and please them i think that you sometimes forget the greater the more universal truths i may be wrong that is how the matter seems to me  then since youre so frank peter dale declared with undiminished wrath ill just imitate your candour ill tell you how you seem to us you seem like a man with a gift whose head has been turned by mr foley and his fine friends youre full of great phrases but theres nothing practical about them or you youre on your way to an easy place for yourself in the world and a seat in foleys cabinet  have you any objection maraton asked to the peoples cause being represented in the cabinet  it was the last straw this peter dales voice shook with passion  its been a promise he shouted for this many a year a sop to the people it was at the last election theres one of us ought to be in the cabinetone of us i say not a carpetbagger  were the wrong type of man graveling broke in sarcastically thats what he said he was heard to say it to the home secretary the wrong type of man he called us  maraton suddenly changed his attitude he was momentarily conscious of julia listening from her place in the background to every word with strained attention after all these men had doubtless done good work according to their capacity  my friends he protested why do we bandy words like this perhaps it is my fault i have had a long and tiring day and i must confess that i to some extent resented a labour man being set up against me without a word of explanation you mean well all of you i am sure even if we cant quite see the same way dont lets quarrel i am not used to parties i cant serve under any one my votes my own and i dont like the political juggery of selling it here and there for a quid pro quo we may sit on opposite benches but i give you my word that there isnt anything in the world which brings me into political life or will keep me there save the welfare of the people now shake hands all of you let us have a drink together and part friends  peter dale shook his head doggedly he had risen to his feeta man filled with slow burning but bitter anger  no sir he declared me and my mates have stood for the people for this many a year and weve no fancy for a fine gentleman springing up like a jackinthebox from somewhere else in the house without any reference to us and yet calling himself and advertising himself as the champion of our cause outside parliament we cant stop you the trades union men think more of you maybe than they do of us but inside you can plough your own furrow and for my part when youre on your legs the smokingroom will be plenty good enough for me  and for the rest of us graveling agreed fiercely if youre so keen on being independent you shall see what you can do on your own  dale was already on his way to the door but maraton checked him  mr dale he said you are an older man than i am a man of much experience i beg you to reflect the feelings which prompt you towards this action are unworthy if you attempt to send me to coventry you will simply bring ridicule upon a party which should be the broadestminded in the house  mr dale turned around he had already crammed his black wideawake hat on to his head like all men whose outlook upon life is limited the idea of ridicule was hateful to him  you mark my words young man he growled the one that makes a fool of himself is the one thats going to play the toady to a master who will send him to heel with a kick every time he opens his mouth to bark go your own way im only sorry you ever set foot in this country  he passed out followed by weavel graveling only lingered upon the threshold he was looking towards julia  miss thurnbrein he said can i have a word with you  you cannot she replied steadily  he remained there dogged full of suppressed wrath the sight of her taking her place before the typewriter seemed to madden him already she was the better for the change of work and surroundings for the improved conditions of her daily life there was the promise of colour in her cheeks her plain black gown was as simple as ever but her hair was arranged with care and she carried herself with a new distinction born of her immense contentment her supercilious attitude attracted while it infuriated him  its only a word i want he persisted i have a right to some sort of civility at any rate  you have no rights at all she retorted i thought that we had finished with that the last time we spoke together  i want to know he went on obstinately why you havent been to work lately  because i have left weinbergs she told him curtly it is no business of yours but if it will help to get rid of you  left weinbergs he repeated got another job eh  i am mr maratons assistant secretary she announced  his face for a moment was almost distorted with anger  youre living hereunder this roof he demanded  it is no concern of yours where or how i am living she answered  thats a lie graveling exclaimed furiously youre my girl ive hung around after you for six years ive known you since you were a child ill be dd if ill be thrown on one side now and see you become another mans mistressespecially his  he came a step further into the room maraton who had been standing with his back to them arranging some papers on his desk turned slowly around graveling was advancing towards him with the air of a bully  do you hearyoumaraton he cried ive had enough of you you can flout us all at our work if you like but you go a bit too far when you think to make a plaything of my girl do you hear that  perfectly maraton replied  and what have you got to say about it  maraton shrugged his shoulders slightly  i dont know that i have anything particular to say about it if it interests you to be told my opinion of you you are welcome to hear it  graveling advanced a step nearer still his fists were clenched an ugly scowl had parted his lips julia came swiftly from her seat her eyes were filled with fury she faced graveling  richard graveling she exclaimed i am ashamed to think that i ever let you call yourself my friend if you do not leave the room and the house at once i swear that i will never speak to you again as long as i live  he pushed her aside roughly  ill talk to you presently he declared its him that my business is with now  maratons eyes flashed a little dangerously  keep your hands off that young lady he ordered  youd like her to protect you would you graveling taunted listen here im not the sort of man to have my girl taken away and made another mans plaything is she going to stop here answer me quickly  as long as she chooses maraton replied  then take that graveling shouted  maraton stepped lightly to one side graveling was overbalanced by his fierce blow into the empty air the next moment he was lying on his back and the room seemed to be spinning around him maraton was standing with his finger upon the bell julia was by his side her eyes blazing she spoke never a word but as graveling struggled back to his senses he could see the scorn upon her face  aaron and a man servant entered the room simultaneously maraton pointed to the figure upon the floor  aaron he said your friend mr graveling has met with a slight accident you had better take him outside and put him in a taxicab  graveling rose painfully to his feet he was very pale and there was blood upon his cheek he leaned on aarons arm and he looked towards maraton and julia  better apologise and shake hands maraton advised quietly  graveling seemed not to have heard him he looked towards them both and his fingers gripped aarons shoulder so that the young man winced with pain then without a single word he turned towards the door  let him go julia cried fiercely i am only thankful that you punished him we do not want his apologies i hope that i may never see him again  graveling who had reached the door leaning heavily upon aaron turned around his face with the streak of blood upon his cheek was ghastly he left the room between aaron and the servant they heard his unsteady footsteps in the hall a whistle the departure of the cab aaron has gone with him maraton remarked quietly perhaps it is as well  her face suddenly relaxed and softened the fury left her eyes she sank back into the easy chair  i am ashamed she moaned oh i am ashamed    chapter xxv  the sound of traffic outside had died away the silence became almost unnaturally prolonged only the echo of julias last words seemed somehow or other to remain words which inspired maraton with a curious and indefinable emotion a pity which he could not altogether analyse twice he had turned softly as though to leave the room and twice he had returned he stood now upon the hearthrug looking down at her perplexed himself in some degree agitated she was not weeping although every now and then her bosom rose and fell as though with some suppressed storm it was simply a paroxysm of sensitiveness she was afraid to look up afraid to break a silence which to her was full of consolation maraton a little ashamed of the scene in which he had been an unwilling participator bitterly selfaccusing still found his thoughts diverted from his own humiliation as he watched the girla long slim figure bent in one strangely graceful curve her beautiful hair gleaming in the soft light her face still half hidden by her strong capable fingersa figure exquisitely symbolic full of pathos her elbows rested upon her knees she was crouched a little forward julia he ventured at last  she looked up without undue haste but without hesitation she had obviously been waiting for speech from him he saw then that his impression had been a true one there were no traces of tears in her eyes which sought his at oncesought his with a look which warned him suddenly of his danger her cheeks were burning she was still shaking with some internal passion  after all he said soothingly there are such people in the world one cant ignore the fact of their existence they dont really count  her eyes flashed  it is terrible that they should be allowed to live  he smiled at her sympathetically speech seemed somehow to lessen the tension between them  my dear julia he declared i am suffering just as much as you i have the feeling that i have descended to the level of a common brawler yet what was i to do he needed the lesson very badly indeed  i only hope that it will last him all his life i only hope that he will not come near either of us again  very doubtful whether he will want to i should think maraton remarked leaning against the table you certainly didnt mince your words  if i could have thought of harsher ones i would have used them she asserted  what a waste of time it has been this evening he sighed as his fingers turned over the pile of letters by his side what with mr peter dale and his little deputation and this idiotic person graveling i have scarcely done a thing since i got home  theres nothing that you need do until tomorrow she told him softly  there was another brief pause she was sitting up nowleaning back in her chair indeedtrembling no longer although the colour still flamed in her cheeks her eyes which seldom left his face were strangely almost liquidly soft maraton moved restlessly in his place perhaps he had been unwise not to have stolen out of the room during the first few moments julia as he very well knew was no ordinary person and he felt a sense of growing uneasiness the tension of silence became ominous and he spoke simply to dissipate it  i hope i really didnt hurt the fellow  if you had killed him she replied he deserved it  he was an insulting beast of course maraton continued after all though one mustnt bring oneself down to the level of these creatures he saw with his eyes and what is seen from that point of view isnt of any account perhaps it isnt his fault that he hasnt learnt to govern himself if i were you julia i wouldnt bother about it any more really  it wasnt altogether what he said she whispered it wasnt altogether that  he looked at her enquiringly  you mean  she shook her head  tell me he begged  once more he saw that little quiver pass through her frame her lips were parted and closed again maraton was puzzled but did his best to follow her line of thought  the only way to treat such a person he continued is to treat him as a lunatic that is what he really is i scarcely heard what he said already i have forgotten every word  but i cant i never can  he shrugged his shoulders  my dear julia he protested i appeal to your common sense  she looked at him almost angrily her foot beat upon the floor  what has common sense to do with it she exclaimed of course it was a foolish thing to say he didnt even believe iti am sure of that it was simply mad insensate jealousy a vicious attempt to make me suffer that isnt where he hurt it was becauseshall i tell you  a sudden instinct warned him he held out his hand  it will only distress you no i dont want to hear  the momentary silence seemed endowed with peculiar qualities they heard the little clock ticking upon the mantelpiece the tinkle of a hansom bell outside the muffled sound of motor horns in the distance very slowly her head drooped back once more to the shelter of her hands  you dont understand she said simply why should you i wasnt even angrythat is the terrible part of it i wishedi found myself wishingthat it were true  maratons hands suddenly gripped the edge of the table against which he was leaning her face was still concealed once more her long slim body was shaken with quivering sobs  the shame of it she moaned that is where he hurt the shame of hearing it and knowing it wasnt true and of wanting it to be true i havent ever thought of any one like thathe knows that well enough he used to call me sexless there isnt any man in the world has ever dared to touch my lipshe knows it  maraton left his place and quietly approached her she heard him coming and the trembling gradually ceased he sat on the arm of her chair and his hand rested gently upon her shoulder  dear julia he said i am glad that you have been honest life is always full of these emotions you know especially for highlystrung people and sometimes the atmosphere gets a little overcharged and they blaze out as they have done this evening and perhaps one is the better for it  she remained quite motionless during his brief pause one hand had moved from before her face and had gripped his  theres our work you know julia he went on there isnt anything in the world must interfere with that we cant divide our lives can we we ought not to want to if i could make you understandcan i i wonderhow splendid it is to have some one here by my side who understands it seems to me that i am going to be a little lonely i shall have to stand on my own feet a good deal i rely so much upon you julia you are a woman arent youi mean a real woman i need you  very slowly she raised her head her eyes met his freely there was something of the childlike adoration of an instinctive and triumphant purity in the smile which parted her lips maraton understood at once that the danger was past the thunder had left the air  you know that i am your slave she murmured dont be afraid that i am becoming neurotic you see this was all a little new to me and for a moment i felt that i wanted to go and hide myself that has all passed now i am not even ashamed i suppose one gets terrified with receiving so much and wants to give its a very natural feminine impulse isnt it and i shall givemy fingers my brainall i possess  she rose suddenly to her feet and glanced at the clock  what a day you must have had she exclaimed you are not going to look at my sheffield figures even before the morning oh youll be surprised when you see them youve a wonderful case some of the fortunes that have been made therethat are being made there noware barbaric i mustnt talk about it or i shall get angry listen theres aaron  they heard the sound of his latchkey a moment later he entered the room he looked anxiously at maraton julia he scarcely noticed  i took him home he announced he never spoke a word the whole way seemed stupid i shouldnt be surprised if he hadnt got a little concussion  did you send for a doctor maraton asked  his landlady was going to do that aaron continued it was all i could do to sit in the cab by his side i wishyes i almost wish that hed never got up from that carpet  thanks maraton replied i didnt come over here to fill the inside of an english prison  prison  aarons expression of contempt was sublime  theres nothing they could have done to you sir all the same i only wish that your blow had killed him  why  aaron dropped his voice for a minute  because wherever we go or move he said there will always be the snake in the grass he will be filled forever with a poisonous hatred for you he will never dare to raise his hand against you to your facehe isnt that sort of manbut hell have his stab before hes finished he was born a sneak  maraton smiled carelessly as he bade them good night  the one thing in the world he reminded them worse than having no friends is to have no enemies    chapter xxvi  eight days later maraton delivered his preliminary address to the ironworkers of sheffield and at six oclock the next morning the strike had been unanimously proclaimed the columns of the daily newspapers still hopelessly bound over to the interests of the capitalist were full of solemn warnings against this new and disturbing force in english sociology the daily oracle alone paused to present a few words of appreciation of the splendid dramatic force wielded by this revolutionary  if this man is sincere the oracle declared the country needs him if he is a charlatan then for heavens sake even at the expense of all the laws that were ever framed away with him there is no man breathing today who is developing a more potent a more widereaching influence upon the destinies of our country  maratons first address had been delivered to a great multitude but there was no building whose roof could cover the hordes of men who had made up their minds to hear his last words at sheffield from far and wide the people came that night in countless streams a platform had been arranged in the middle of the principal pleasure park of the town and around this from early in the afternoon they began to take up their places when night fell so far as the eye could see the ground was covered with a black mass of humanity the multitude filled the park and crowded up the encircling streets as the darkness deepened they lit torches beyond down in the valley and up on the hillside were rows of lights and the flare of furnaces soon to be quenched even that little group of hard unimaginative men who stood with maraton upon the platform felt the strange thrill of the tense and swelling throng gathered together with this inspiring background  it seemed to maraton himself as he stood there listening to the roar of welcoming voices as though all their white faces were gathered into one the prototype of suffering humanity the sad hollowchecked holloweyed victim of birth and heritage his voice seemed to swell that night to something greater than its usual volume some peculiar gift of penetration seemed to have been accorded him a hundred thousand men heard his passionate prayer to them they were hardfeatured hardminded yorkshiremen most of them but they never forgot  you will get the half a crown a week which your leaders demand maraton told them your mastersmay god forgive me for using the wordwill pay to that extent butif there is any justice beyond this world how indeed will they meet the debt built upon your sufferings your cramped lives and the graves of your little children that half a crown a week i say will come to you dont dare any of you to be satisfied when it does come it isnt a few shillings only that are owing to you its another social system a rearrangement of your whole scheme of life under which you and your children and your childrens children may live with the dignity and freedom due to that strange and common gift of life which beats in your pulses and in mine i am here tonight to show you the way to that extra halfcrown but i dont want you for one moment to think that these small increases in wages represent the end and aim of myself and those who share my beliefs your day may not see it nor mine but history for the last thousand years has shown us the slow emancipation of the peoples of the world there are many rungs in the ladder yet to be climbed your children may have to take up the burden where you have left it a revolution may be necessary sorrows innumerable may lie between you and the goal of your class and yet i bid you hope i plead with each one of you to remember that he is not only an individual that he is a unit of humanity that he is the progenitor of unborn children a force from which will spring the happier and the freer generation if not in our time in the days to come  he passed on to speak for a few moments about the reconstituted state of society which was his favourite theme and from that to a peroration unpreparedfiercely passionately eloquent when he had finished speaking the air seemed curiously dull and lifeless an extraordinary silence like the silence before a thunderstorm brooded over the place then the human sea broke its bounds the smutblackened trees quivered with the thunder of their voices showers of sparks rose into the air from the torches they waved it was a pandemonium of sound they came on like a mighty flood before whose force the dam has suddenly yielded the platform was crushed like a nutshell before their onslaught they were mad with a great enthusiasm beside themselves with a passion stirred only in such men once or twice in a lifetime the roar of their voices as they shouted his name reached even to the station to which maraton had been smuggled secretly in a fast motorcara disappearance which a great journalist on the next morning alluded to as the one supremely dramatic touch in a night of wonders the roar of voices indeed was still in his ears as he stood before the window of his compartment looking out over the firehung city with its vaporous flames its huge furnaces its glare which was already becoming fainter a myriad lights still twinkled upon the hillsides the smokestained sky was red with the reflection of those thousand torches even as the train rushed on into the darkness he could hear the echo of their cry as they sought for him  maraton maraton  he threw himself at last into a corner seat of his compartment and conscious of a somewhat rare physical exhaustion he rang the bell for the attendant and ordered refreshments the evening papers were by his side but he had no fancy to read the thrill of the last few hours was still upon him he sat with folded arms looking idly through the window at the chaotic prospect suddenly he was aware that the door of his compartment had been opened a man had entered and was taking the seat opposite to him a man whose appearance struck maraton at once as being vaguely familiar a man who smiled at him almost with the air of an old acquaintance  you dont recognise me i can see the newcomer said smiling slightly yet we ought to know one another  maraton looked at the intruder curiously it was in many respects a remarkable face a low heavy forehead eyes in which shone the unmistakable light broad firm mouth fair hair left unusually long in figure the man was short and stout his collar had parted and a black bow of unusual size was drooping from his shoulder he was slightly out of breath too as though he had but recently recovered from some strenuous exercise  i will save you from speculationsi am henry selingman he pronounced  maraton held out his hand  selingman he exclaimed it is your photographs of course then we have never met  never until tonight selingman admitted when i heard that you were in england i made up my mind to come over tonight seemed to me propitious i wanted to understand this marvellous power of yours of which so many people have written nothing has been exaggerated the message which i have struggled to deliver to the world through my poetry my plays such prose as i have ventured upon you yourself can tear from your heart and throw to the peoples own ears    forgive mei too will smoke i will drink wine also he added ringing the bell i had a dozen friends to help me but every bone in my body aches with the struggle to escape you maddened them those people it was magnificent  he ordered champagne from the attendant and began to smoke a long black cigar nervously and quickly  tonight i shall write of this he went on i have lived for fortyfive years and i have hunted all over the world and in my study i have conjured up all the visions a man may but never yet has there been anything like this the black hillside a mass of soft black velvet jewelled like a womans gown the red fires from the blasting furnaces the shower of sparks from a thousand torches the glow upon the fog poisoned sky those facesgod how white never in my life have i seen the writing of the finger of the messiah as i saw it tonight it has been the hour of a lifetime maraton over there man our toilers are toilers indeed but not like that it isnt stamped into them no theyre not branded  over there maraton repeated  belgium germany selingman continued germany chiefly our socialism has done better for us than that it has kindled a little fire in the heart of the men and from its warmth has sprung something of that selfrespect which will be the seed of the new humanity i want you over there maraton i want to show you your heart will warm with joy god what food for hell are your manufacturers here how theyll burn  the curse of england is its terrible middle class maraton said slowly the present generation is the first even to dimly realise it our aristocracy is no better nor any worse than the aristocracy of other nations rather better perhaps than worse but our middle class rules the land they represent the voting power they conceal their real sentiments under the name of liberalism they keep their heel upon the neck of labour i tell you when the revolution comes it will be hampstead and kensington the mob will sack and burn not park lane and grosvenor square  youre right selingman agreed of course youre right you and i make no mistakes we are of the order of those whose eyes were touched in the cradle maraton sometimes i am sorry im an artist sometimes i loathe this sense of beauty which drives my pen into the pleasanter ways theres only one thing in the world for you and me to work for the world today doesnt deserve the offerings of the artist until it has purged itself i waste my time writing plays but then after all i am not english if those were my people maraton i doubt whether my pen could ever have wandered even for a moment into the pleasant ways  maraton sighed  there is america too he groaned  a conglomeration selingman declared hastily not to be reckoned with yet as a nation what is born amongst the older peoples must find its way there by natural law it is not a country for commencements englandit is england where the harvest is ripe what are you doing man  maraton looked thoughtfully out of the window the train was gathering speed they were travelling now at a great pace outside the twilight was fading a black cloud had passed across the rising moon the electric light illuminated the carriage it was almost as though they were passing through a tunnel  you ask me almost the saddest question one could ask he replied gently i am working for posterity there is no other course i called those people together tonight at sheffield for the sake of half a crown a week extra wages it will make life a little easier for them and i suppose every atom of prosperity must count in the sum of their future and their childrens future  spent in beer most likely selingman muttered why not maraton exclaimed the possession of money to spend in luxuries of any sort must add something at least to their dignity it means a lightening of the heart for a moment an impulse of gladness why should we judge beer is only a prototype of other things then selingman mark this i brought the men of lancashire out on strike some few weeks ago and sheffield now is following suit it is a matter of a few shillings a week only it is true but i am very careful to tell them always that it is simply a compromise which i am advocating these small increases are nothing the operatives have a naturegiven right to a share in the product of their labour in these days their slave hire is thrown at them by an interloping person who calls himself an employer in the days to come it will be different  you beat time then selingman cried you head the waves my friend maraton they are right those who turned me out of my villa at versailles and sent me over to you they were right indeed i have business with you manan inspiration to share ours is a great meeting you know maxendorf  by name maraton admitted a little startled  a profound thinker selingman declared a mighty thinker a giant a pioneer i tell you that he sees maraton he has pitched his tent upon the hilltop what do you know of him  chiefly maraton replied that he is an aristocrat a diplomatist and the future ambassador here of a country i do not love  selingman drained a glass of champagne before he answered he lit another of his long thin cigars and smoked furiously  aristocratyes he assented but you do not know maxendorf he will be a joy to you man oh he sees the day of the millions is coming and he knows it on the continent our middle class isnt like yours the conflict will never be so terrible thank god our labour stands already with its feet upon the ground with us development is all that is necessary but youyou are up against a culdesac a black mountain of prejudice and custom nothing can save you but an earthquake or a revolution and you know it you came to england with those ideas maraton you have turned opportunist it was the only thing left for you you didnt happen to see the one way out tomorrow it will be a new day with you tomorrow we will show you  they were rushing into london now selingman rose to his feet  at seven oclock tomorrow i shall fetch you he announced that is if i do not come in the morning i may come beforei may give you the whole day for your own i make no promise your addresswrite it down i have no memory  maraton wrote it and passed it over selingman thrust it into his pocket  i go to work he cried some part of the genius of your voice shall tremble tomorrow in the genius of my prose i promise you that listen our friend maxendorf would say to the vainest man in europe but i know no man knows himself save himself adieu    chapter xxvii  the lengthy reports of his sheffield visit and speeches of which the newspapers made great capital an extraordinary impression of the same in selingmans wonderful prose and the caprice of a halfpenny paper made maraton suddenly the most talked about man in england a notoriety which he would have done much to have avoided was forced upon him early on the morning following his return his house was besieged with a little stream of journalists photographers politicians men and women of all orders and degrees seeking for a few moments interview with the man of the hour maraton retreated precipitately into his smaller study at the back of the house and left aaron to cope as well as he might with the assailing host every now and then the telephone bell rang and aaron made his report  there are fourteen men here who want to interview you he announced all from good papers if you wont be interviewed some of them want a photograph  send them away maraton directed tell them the only photograph i ever had taken is in the hands of the chicago police  theres the editor here himself from the biweekly  my compliments and excuses maraton replied i will be interviewed by no one  theres a representative from the oracle here aaron continued who wants to know your exact position in connection with the labour party what shall i say  tell him to apply to mr dale maraton answered  mr foley and lady elisabeth landon are outside in a car mr foleys compliments and if you could spare a moment they would be glad to come in and see you  maraton hesitated  you had better let them come in  shall i go julia asked  maraton shook his head  stay where you are he enjoined perhaps they will go sooner if they see that i am at work with you  mr foley was in his best and happiest mood he shook hands heartily with maraton elisabeth said nothing at all but maraton was conscious of one swift look into his eyes and of thefact that her fingers rested in his several seconds longer than was necessary  we are profoundly mortified both my niece and i mr foley said never have i had so many journalists on my doorstep even on that notorious thursday when they thought that i was going to declare war i really fancy maraton that they are going to make a celebrity of you have you seen the papers  i have read selingmans sketch maraton replied  they say mr foley went on that he wrote all night at the office in fleet street and that his sheets were flung into type as he wrote them selingman toothe great selingman you know him  he travelled down from sheffield with me last night maraton answered  a more dangerous person even than you mr foley observed and an anglophobe never mind what did we call about elisabeth  well we were really on our way to the city his niece reminded him it was you who suggested when we were at the top of the square that we should call in and see mr maraton  there was something in my mind mr foley persisted i remember next friday is the last day of the session you know mr maraton we want you to go down to scotland with us for a week  maraton shook his head  it is very kind of you he said but i shall take no holiday i need none i have endless work here during the vacation there are some industries i have scarcely looked into at all and there is my bill and the draft of another one to follow thank you very much mr foley all the same  elisabeth set down the illustrated paper which she had picked up she looked across at maraton  dont you think for one week mr maraton she suggested softly that you could bring your work with you you could have a study in a quiet corner of the house and if you did not care to bring a secretary i would promise you the services of an amateur one  perhaps by accident as she spoke she glanced across at julia and perhaps by accident julia at that moment happened to glance up their eyes met julia from the grim loneliness of her own world looked steadfastly at this exquisite type of the things in life which she hated  you are very kind maraton repeated but indeed i must not think of it it seems to me he went on after a slight hesitation that every time lately when i have stood at the halting of two ways and have had to make up my mind which to follow i have been forced by circumstances to choose the easier way this time at least my duty is quite plain i have work to do in london which i cannot neglect  elisabeth picked up the paper which she had set down the moment before her eyes had been quick to appreciate the smothered fierceness of julias gaze at maraton she did not glance  well i am sorry mr foley said you are a young man now maraton but one works the better for a change i didnt come to talk shop but youve set a nice hornets nest about our heads up in sheffield  there are many more to follow maraton assured him  mr foley chuckled his sense of humour was indomitable  if there is one thing in the press this morning he declared more pronounced than the diatribes upon your speech it is the number of compliments paid to me for my perspicuity in extending the hand of friendship to the most dangerous political factor at present existentvide the oracle ive wasted many hours arguing with some of my colleagues if i had known what was coming i might just as well have sat tight and waited for today i am vindicated whitewashed only the opposition are furious they are trying to claim you as a natural member of the radical party shouldnt be surprised if they didnt approach you today sometime  maraton smiled  the people i am in the most disgrace with he observed are my own little lot  that neednt worry you mr foley rejoined our labour members are not a serious body the forces they represent are all right but they seem to have a perfectly devilish gift of selecting the wrong representatives    youll be in the house this afternoon certainly  i shall be rather curious to see what sort of a reception they give you mr foley continued you couldnt manage to walk in with me i suppose it would mean such a headline for the daily oracle  elisabeth glanced up from her paper  i am afraid uncle she remarked that punch was right when it said that your sense of humour would always prevent your becoming a great politician  let punch wait until i claim the title mr foley retorted smiling no man has ever consented to be premier who was a great politicianin these days at any rate i doubt even whether our friend maraton would be a successful premier i fancy that if ever he aspires so high it will be to the dictatorship of the new republic  maraton sighed  even the oracle he reminded them is convinced that i have no personal ambitions  mr foley took up his hat he had been in high good humour throughout the interview already he was looking forward to meeting his colleagues  well well be off maraton he said we had no right to come and disturb you at this time in the morning only we were really anxious to book you for our quiet week in scotland change your mind about it theres a good fellow i shall be your helpless prey up there you could make of me what you would maraton shook his head very firmly  it is not possible he answered please do not think that i do not appreciate your hospitalityand your kindness lady elisabeth  she looked at him for a moment rather curiously there was something of reproach in her eyes something too which he failed to understand she did not speak at all  miss thurnbrein maraton begged will you see mr foley and lady elisabeth out it sounds cowardly doesnt it he added but i really dont think that i dare show myself  julia rose slowly to her feet and passed towards the door which maraton was holding open she lingered outside while maraton shook hands with his two visitors then would have hurried on in advance but that elisabeth stopped her  do tell me she asked you are the miss thurnbrein who has written so much upon woman labour arent you  i have written one or two articles julia replied looking straight ahead of her  i read one in the national review elisabeth continued and another in one of the evening papers i cant tell you miss thurnbrein how interested i was  julia turned and looked slowly at her questioner her cheeks seemed more pallid than usual her eyes were full of smouldering fire  i didnt write to interest people she said calmly i wrote to punish them to let them know a little of what they were guilty  but surely elisabeth protested you make some excuse for those who have really no opportunity for finding out there is a society now i am told for watching over the conditions of woman labour in the east end is that so really  there is such a society julia admitted i am the secretary of it  you must let me join elisabeth begged please do wont you come and see me one afternoonany afternoonand tell me all about it indeed i am in earnest she went on a little puzzled at the others unresponsiveness this isnt just a whim i am really interested in these matters but it is so hard to help unless one is put in the right way  the time has passed julia pronounced when patronage is of any assistance to such societies as the one we were speaking of nothing is of any use now but hard grim work we dont want money we dont need support of any kind whatever we need work and brains  i am afraid elisabeth said as she held out her hand that you think i am incapable of either  julias lips were tightly compressed she made no reply mr foley glanced back at her curiously as they stepped into the car  what a singularly forbidding young woman he remarked  elisabeth shrugged her shoulders it is given to women to understand much    the car glided off as they neared the corner of the square they passed a stout foreignlooking man with an enormous head a soft grey hat set far back a quantity of fair hair and the ingenuous eager look of a child he was hurrying towards the corner house and scarcely glanced in their direction mr foley however leaned forward with interest  who is that strangelooking person elisabeth asked  mr foley became impressive  one of the greatest writers and philosophers of the day he replied i expect he is on his way to see maraton that was henry selingman    chapter xxviii  selingman took little heed of the cordon around maraton he brushed them all to one side and when at last confronted by the final barrier in the shape of julia he only patted her gently upon the back  ah but my dear child he exclaimed you do not understand listen i raise my voice i shoutlike thismaraton it is i who am hereselingman you see he will come if he is within hearing you know of me you palefaced child you have heard of selingman is it not so  before julia could answer the door of the study was opened  come in maraton called out from an invisible place  selingman with a little bow of triumph to julia passed down the passage and into the library he threw his hat upon the sofa and held out both his hands to maraton julia who had followed him sank into a chair before her typewriter  i have made you famous my friend he declared you may quote these words in after life as representing the full sublimity of my conceit but it is true have you read my appreciation in the oracle  i have maraton admitted smiling  the real thing selingman continued crisp and crackling with genius as they read it the photographers took down their cameras the editors whispered to their journalists to be off to russell square the ladies began to pen their cards of invitation  thats all very well maraton remarked a little grimly but where do i come in i have no time for the journalists i refuse to be photographed and i am not likely to accept the invitations it takes my two secretaries half their time to wade through my correspondence and to decide which of it is to be pitched into the wastepaper basket i am not a dealer in quack remedies or an actor i dont want advertisement  pooh my friendpooh selingman retorted drawing out his worn leather case and thrusting one of the long black cigars into his mouth everything that is spontaneous in life is good for youeven advertisement but listen to my news it is great news believe me    a match please  maraton struck a vesta and handed it to him selingman transferred the flame to a piece of paper from the wastepaper basket and puffed contentedly at his cigar  i light not cigars with a flavour like this with a wax vesta he explained where was i oh i knowthe news this morning i have received a message maxendorf has left for england maraton smiled  is that all he said i could have told you that myself the fact is announced in all the morning papers  he will be at the ritz hotel tonight selingman continued unruffled when he arrives i shall be there we speak together for an hour and then i come for you  i shall be glad to meet maxendorf maraton agreed quietly he is a great man but dont you think for his first few days in england it would be better to leave him alone so far as i am concerned  later i will remind you of those words selingman declared for a genius you see no further than the end of your nose they tell me that when you landed there were prophets in the east end who rose up and shoutedmaraton is come maraton is here no morejust the simple announcementas though that fact alone were changing life very well i will be your prophet and you shall be the people i will say to you as they cried to the children of israel groaning under their toilmaxendorf has come maxendorf is here  maraton was silent for a moment he was sitting on the edge of the table with folded arms his visitor was pacing up and down the room blowing out dense volumes of smoke  you have more in your mind selingman than you have told me he said  what is there that is hidden from the eye of genius selingman cried with a theatrical wave of the hand more than i have told you indeedmore than i shall tell you one thing at least i have learnt in my struggles with the pen and that is to avoid the anticlimax it is a great thing to remember that so i am dumb i speak no more   why dont you send your poor little secretary out for a walk mademoiselle forgive me but he works you too hard  she looked up at him smiling  i worked very much harder before i came here she answered quietly  i am fortunate in my secretary maraton interposed this is miss julia thurnbrein selingman i dont suppose you read our reviews but miss thurnbrein is an authority on woman labour  i read nothing selingman declared moving over and grasping her by the hand i read nothing people are my books i am fortyfive years old i have done with reading i know a great deal i have read a great deal i read no more miss julia thurnbrein you say well i like the name of julia only young lady you would do better to spend a little more time with the roses and a little less under the roofs of this grey city youth you know youth is everything you work best for others by realising the joys of life yourself i too am a philanthropist miss juliai dont like your other namei too think and write for others i too have dreams of a millennium of days when the huge wheel shall be driven to a different tune and faces be lifted to the skies that hang now towards the gutters but details annoy me details i cannot master i do not want to know how many sufferers there are in the world and what particular sum they starve upon i leave others to do that work i only point forward to the day of emancipation put your hand in mine and i will show you in time where the clouds will first break  julia smiled at him a little sadly  perhaps it is as well she said that we have champions who do not care for detail it is detail and the sight of suffering which sap all the enthusiasms out of us before our time  selingman frowned at her angrily he blew out another cloud of smoke  you make me angry he asserted i love your sex i adore womanhood i look upon a beautiful woman as a gift to the world beauty is a gift to be made much of to be nourished to be glorified you are tired young woman you work too hard you have the rare gifthas any one ever told you that you are beautiful  julia stared at him her lips a little parted half angry half wondering  look at her selingman continued turning to maraton she has the slim body the long delicate figure of those botticellis we all loveexcept the russians i never yet met a russian who could appreciate a botticelli and her eyeslook at them man and you let her sit there till the hollows are forming in her cheeks be ashamed of yourself take her out into the country one works just as well in the sunshine you do better work if you can smell flowers growing around you while your brain is active lend her to me for a week ill take her to my cottage in the ardennes there i live with the sunbreakfast at sunrise to bed at sunset i will dictate to you miss juliadictate beautiful things you shall be proud always you shall sayi have worked for selingman conceited ass you will probably add thank heavens that i am conceited nothing is so splendid in life as to know your own worth nothing makes so much for happiness    maraton where shall i find you tonight  in the house of commons probably maraton replied but take my advice leave maxendorf alone for a few days  we will seewe will see selingman went on a little impatiently come i have nothing to donothing whatever i came to london to see you maraton you must put up with me workput it away the sun shines let us all go into the country i will get a car or what of the river perhaps not i am too restless i cannot sit still i will walk about always and i cannot swim we will take a car and sometimes we will walk i go to fetch it now eh  maraton glanced helplessly at julia they both laughed  i have to be back at four oclock the former said i have an appointment at the house of commons then  excellent selingman declared i go there with you your house of commons always fascinates me i hear you speak perhaps no what does it matter i will hear the others drone i go to fetch a car  maraton held out his hand  i have a car he observed it is waiting now at the back entrance you had better get your things on miss thurnbrein i can see that we have come under the influence of a master spirit  she looked at the pile of letters by her side but maraton only shook his head  we must parody his own phrase and declare that selingman is here he said go and put your things on and tell aaron we will steal out like conspirators at the back door  they lunched at a roadside inn in buckinghamshire an inn ivycovered with a lawn behind and a garden full of cottage flowers selingman with his own hands dragged out the table from the little sittingroom through the open windows to a shaded corner of the lawn drew the cork from a bottle of wine and taking off his coat started to make a salad  insects everywhere he remarked cheerfully hold your parasol over my salad please miss julia so what does it matter where there are flowers and trees there must be insects let them live their day of life  so long as we dont eat them julia protested  i have tasted insects in south america which were delicious selingman assured them thereleave your parasol over the salad and maraton move the icepail a little more into the shade now while they set the luncheon we will walk in that little flower garden and i will tell you if you like a story of mine i once wrote the story of two roses i published it alas it is so hard to save even our most beautiful thoughts from the vulgarity of print in these days where everythinglove and wine and even the roses themselvescost money bah  the story please julia begged  he walked in the middle and took an arm of each of his companions  so you would hear my little story he exclaimed then listen  they obeyed presently he forgot himself his eyes were halfclosed his thoughts seemed to have wandered into the strangest places as his allegory proceeded he seemed to drift away from all knowledge of his immediate surroundings he chose his words always with the most exquisite and precise care they listened entranced then suddenly he stopped short in the path  for half an hour have i been giving of myself he declared almost i faint come  he tightened his grasp upon their arms and started walking with short abrupt footstepsand great haste for the luncheon table  fool that i am he muttered it is one oclock and i lunch always at halfpast twelve i must eat quickly see the waiter looks at us sorrowfully what of the omelette i wonder come miss julia at my right hand there ah was i not right the roses are creeping alreadycreeping into their proper place sit back in your chair and eat slowly and drink the yellow wine and listen to the humming of those bees so soon you will become normal a woman just what you should be heavens it is well that i came to see maraton when i saw you this morning in that room i said to myselfthere is a human creature who half lives what a sin to half live    taste that salad maraton taste it man and admit that it is well that i came  they were alone in the gardenthe inn was a little way off the main road and they had discovered it entirely by accident both julia and maraton yielded gracefully enough to the influence of their companions personality  whether it is well for us or not maraton remarked as he watched the wine flow into his glass to yield up ones will like this to become even as a docile child i do not know but it is very pleasant it is an hour of detachment  it is the secret of youth the secret of life the secret of joy selingman declared detachment is the word life would make slaves of all of us if one did not sometimes square ones shoulders and sayno thank you i have had enough goodbye i return presently one needs a will perhaps but then what is life without will i myself was at work the greatest theatrical manager in the world kept sentry before my door the greatest genius who ever trod upon the stage sent me frantic messages every few hours then they spoke to me of maraton i heard the crymaraton is here i heard the thunder from across the seas up from my desk out from my roomhysterics entreaties nothing stopped me no luggage worth mentioning away i come to london to sheffieldwhat a place tomorrowtomorrow or the next day i return full of life and vigour it is splendid i broke away no one else could have done it i left them in tears what did i care it is for myselffor myself i do these things unless i myself am at my best what have i to give the world miss julia your health to the roses and may they never leave your cheeks no dont go yet there are strawberries coming  maraton and his host sat together for a few moments in the garden before they started on their return journey selingman leaned across the table he had forgotten to put on his coat and he sat unabashed in his shirt sleeves he had drunk a good deal of wine and the little beads of perspiration stood out upon his forehead  maraton he said you need me you are like the others when the fire has touched their eyes and indeed they see the things that are they fall on their knees and they tear away at the weeds and rubbish that cumber the earth and they never lift their eyes and soon their frame grows weary and their heart cold be wise man the mark is upon you those live best and work best in this world who have a soul for its beauties women for instance he went on smoking furiously what help do you make of women none you sit at one end of the table your secretary at the other you dont look at her she might have pigs eyes for anything you know about it idiot and shenot quite as bad perhaps women feel a little you know that they dont show why not marry maraton no perhaps you are right and yet women are wonderful you cant do your greatest work maraton you never will reach your greatest work unless a womans hand is yours  they rode back to london in comparative silence selingman frankly and openly slept with his grey hat on the back of his head his untidy feet upon the opposite cushions his mouth wide open maraton more than once found himself watching julia covertly there was no doubt that in her strange quiet way she was beautiful as he sat and looked at her his thoughts travelled back to the little garden the sheltered corner under the trees the curious sense of relaxation which in that short hour selingman had inspired was the man indeed right his philosophy sound was there indeed wisdom in the loosening of the bonds he met her eyes suddenly and she smiled at him with herwell he scarcely dared to tell himself that he knew how it was he closed his eyes again a thought had come to him sweeter than any yet  as they neared london selingman awoke smiled blandly upon them brushed the cigar ash from his coat and waistcoat put on his hat and looked about him with interest  so we are arrived he said presently the houses of parliament eh i enter with you maraton you find me a corner where i sleep while the others speak and wake at the sound of your voice afterwards late tonight we shall go to maxendorf    chapter xxix  it happened to be a quiet evening in the house and maraton and selingman dined together at a little before eight oclock selingmans personality was too unusual to escape attention and as his identity became known a good many passersby looked at them curiously some one sent word to mr foley of their presence and very soon he came in and joined them  six years ago this month mr selingman the prime minister reminded him we met at madame hermenes in paris you were often there in those days  selingman nodded vigorously  i remember it perfectly he saidperfectly it was a wonderful evening an english cabinet minister the president of france coquelin rostand and i myself were there a clever woman she knew how to attract in england there is nothing of the sort eh  nothing mr foley admitted i am going to beg you both to come on to me tonight my niece is receiving a few friends but i can promise you nothing of the same class of attraction mr selingman  we cannot come selingman declared without hesitation i take my friend maraton somewhere as we sit here mr foley we have spoken of politics you are a great man if any one can lift your country from the rut along which she is travelling you will do it a unionist prime minister and you hold out the hand to maraton but what foresight what acumen you see beyond the thunderclouds the things that we have seen not only do you see them but you have the courage to follow your convictions what a mess you are making of parties  mr foley smiled  ah well you see he said i am no politician it is the one claim i have upon posterity that i am the first nonpolitician who ever became prime minister  excellent excellent selingman murmured  maraton alas mr foley continued is only half a convert as yet he wears his yoke heavily  a queer place for him selingman declared i looked down and saw him there this evening i listened to the dozen words he spoke he seemed to me rather like a lawyer who having a dull case says what he has to say and sits down does he do any real good here mr foley  it is from these walls the prime minister reminded him that the laws of the country are framed  selingman shook his head slowly  academically correct he admitted and yet walls of brick and stone may crumble and split the laws which endure come into being through the power of the people  dont throw cold water upon my compromise mr foley begged we are hoping for great things we are fighting the class against which you have written so splendidly we are fighting the bourgeoisie tooth and nail one thing is certainly writtenthat if maraton here stands by my side for the next seven years labour will have thrown off one at least of the shackles that bind her isnt it better to release her slowly and gradually than to destroy her altogether by trying more violent means  ah who knows selingman remarked enigmatically who knows    and what of the rest of the evening are there more laws to be mademore speeches  finished mr foley replied there is nothing more to be done that is why i am proposing that you two men go to your rooms make yourselves look as much like philistines as you can and come and pay your respects to my niece lady elisabeth is complaining a little about you maraton he went on you are a rare visitor  lady elisabeth is very kind maraton murmured  i wish that we could come selingman said if i lived here long i would bustle our friend maraton about today i have had him a little way into the country him and his palefaced secretary and i have poured sunshine down upon them and wine and good things to eat oh they are very narrow both of them when they look out at life not so am i i love to feel the great thoughts swinging through my brain but i love also the good things of life i love the interludes of careless joys i love all the pleasant things our bodies were meant to appreciate those who do not they wither early i do not like pale cheeks therefore i wish that i could stay a little time with this friend of ours i would see that he paid his respects to all the charming ladies who were ready to welcome him  mr foley laughed softly  what a marvellous mixture you would make you two he observed your prose and maratons eloquence your philosophy and his tenacity so you wont come well i am disappointed  we go to see a friend of mine selingman announced we go to pay our respects to a man famous indeed a man who will make history in your country  mr foleys expression suddenly changed he leaned a little across the table  are you speaking of maxendorf  selingman nodded vigorously  since you have guessed ityes he admitted we go to maxendorf i take maraton there it will be a great meeting we threewe represent much a great meeting indeed  mr foleys face was troubled  maxendorf only arrives tonight he remarked presently  what matter selingman replied he is like mehe is tireless and though his body be weary his brain is ever working  what do they say on the continent about his coming mr foley enquired we thought that he was settled for life in rome  selingman shook his head portentously  politics he declared ah in the abstract they are wonderful but in the concrete they do not interest me maxendorf has come here doubtless with great schemes in his mind  schemes of friendship or of enmity mr foley asked swiftly  selingmans shoulders were hunched  who can tell who can tell the thoughts which his brain has conceived maxendorf is a silent man he is the first peoples champion who has ever held high office in his country you see he has the gifts which no one can deny he moves forward to whatever place he would occupy and he takes it he is in politics as i in literature  the mans magnificent egotism passed unnoticed curiously enough the truth of it was so apparent that its expression seemed natural  i must confess mr foley said quietly to you two alone that i had rather he had come at some other time selingman you are indeed one of the happiest of the earth you have no responsibilities save the responsibilities you owe to your genius the only call to which you need listen is the call to give to the world the thoughts and music which beat in your brain and with us things are different there is the future of a country the future of an empire always at stake when one sleeps and when one wakes  selingman nodded his head vigorously  frankly he admitted i sympathise with you responsibility i hate and yours mr foley he added is a great one i am a friend of england i am a friend of the england who should be as your country is today i fear that she has very few friends indeed apart from her own shores you may gain allies from reasons of policy but you have not the national gifts which win friendship  how do you account for it mr foley asked him  your press for one thing selingman replied your press written for and inspired with the whole spirit of the bourgeoisie you prate about your empire but youve never learnt yet to think imperially but there it is not for this i crossed the channel it is to be with maraton  so long as you do not take him from me i will not grudge you his company mr foley remarked rising on the other hand i would very much rather that you made your bow to my niece tonight than went to maxendorf  maraton felt suddenly a twinge of something i which was almost compunction mr foleys face was white and tired he had the air of a man oppressed with anxieties which he was doing his best to conceal  if i can he said i should like very much to see lady elisabeth perhaps i shall be in time after our interview with maxendorf or before i will go home and change on the chance  the prime minister nodded but his slightly relaxed expression seemed to show that he appreciated maratons intention selingman looked after him gloomily as he left the room  what devilish impulse he muttered leads these men to pass into your rotten english politics it is like a poet trying to navigate a dredger bah  need you go into that gloomy chamber again my friend  maraton shook his head  i have finished he declared there will be no division  but do you never speak there  up to now i have not uttered more than a dozen words or so maraton replied you try it yourselftry speaking to a crowd of welldressed wellfed smug units of respectability each with his mind full of his own affairs or the affairs of his constituency you try it you wouldnt find the words stream i can tell you  selingman grunted  and nowwhat now  to my roomsto my house maraton announced while i change  it is good i shall talk to your secretary i shall talk to miss julia while you disappear shall i rob you my friend  you would rob me of a great deal if you took her away maraton answered but  selingman interrupted him with a fiercely contemptuous exclamation  you have itthe rotten insular conceit of these englishmen you think that she would not come do you think that if i were to say to hercome and listen while i make garlands of words while i take you through the golden doorsdo you think that she would not put her hand in mine fancyto live in my fairy chamber to listen while i give shape and substance to all that i conceivewhat woman would refuse  maraton laughed softly as they passed out into the palace yard  try julia he suggested    chapter xxx  selingman had the air of one who has achieved a personal triumph as with his arm in maratons he led him towards the man whom they had come to visit  behold he exclaimed it is a triumph this it is a thing to be remembered i have brought you two together  maratons first impressions of maxendorf were curiously mixed he saw before him a tall lanky figure of a man dressed in sombre black a man of dark complexion with beardless face and tanned skin plentifully freckled his hair and eyes were coal black he held out his hand to maraton but the smile with which he had welcomed selingman had passed from his lips  you are not the maraton i expected some day to meet he said a little bluntly and yet i am glad to know you  selingman shrugged his shoulders  maxmy friend max do not be peevish he begged i tell you that he is the maraton of whom we have spoken together i have heard him i have been to sheffield and listened dont be prejudiced max wait  maxendorf motioned them to seats and stood with his finger upon the bell  yes selingman assented we will drink with you you breathe of the rhine my friend i see myself sitting with you in your terraced garden drinking moselle wine out of cut glasses so it shall be we will fall into the atmosphere what a palace you live in max is it because you are an ambassador that they must house you so splendidly  maxendorf glanced around him he was in one of the best suites in the hotel but he had the air of one who was only then for the first time made aware of the fact  these things are done for me he said carelessly it seems i have come before i was expected the embassy is scarcely ready for occupation  he ordered wine from the waiter and exchanged personal reminiscences with selingman until it was brought selingman grunted with satisfaction  two bottles he remarked come i like that a less thoughtful man would have ordered one first and the other afterwards the period of waiting for the second bottle would have destroyed the appetite quite an artist my friend max and the winewell we shall see  he raised the glass to his lips with the air of a connoisseur  it will do he decided setting it down empty and lighting one of his black cigars now let us talk or shall i for a change be silent and let you talk today my tongue has been busy maraton is a silent man and he has a silent secretary with great eyes behind which lurk fancies and dreams the poor little thing has never been encouraged to speak of a silent manmaraton rather like you max which of you will talk the more i wonder i shall be dumb  it will be i who will talk maxendorf asserted i because i have a mission things to explain to our friend here if he will but listen  listenof course he will listen selingman interrupted you twowhat was it the oracle called you boththe worlds deliverers put your heads together and decide how you are going to do it the people over here max are rotting in their kennels sinkholes they live in live what a word  if you indeed have something to say to me maraton proposed let us each remember who we are there is no need for preambles i know you to be a peoples man we have all watched your rise we have all marvelled at it  a socialist statesman in the stiffestnecked country of europe selingman muttered marvelled at it indeed  i am where i am maxendorf declared because the world is governed by laws and in the main they are laws of justice and right the people of my country fifty years ago were as deep in the mire as the people of your country today their liberation has already dawned that is why i stand where i do your people alas are still dwellers in the caves the moment for you has not yet arrived when i heard that maraton had come to england i changed all my plans i said to myself i will go to maraton and i will show him how he may lead his people to the light and then i heard other things  continue maraton said simply  maxendorf rose to his feet he came a little nearer to maraton he stood looking down at him with folded armsa lank gaunt figure the angular lines of his body and limbs accentuated by his black clothes and black tie  it came upon me like a thunderbolt maxendorf proceeded i heard unexpectedly that maraton had entered parliament had placed his hand in the hand of a ministernot even the leader of the peoples party you do not read the press of my country perhaps you did not hear across the seas the groan which came from the hearts of my children i said to myselfthe maraton whom we knew of exists no longer yet i will go and see  maraton moved in his chair a little uneasily he felt suddenly as though he were a prisoner at the bar and this man his judge  you do not understand the circumstances which i found existing on my arrival here maraton explained you do not understand the promises which i have received from mr foley and which he is already carrying into effect you read of the lancashire strike  maxendorf nodded his long head slowly but said nothing  the settlement of that maraton continued was arranged before i spoke to the people it is the same with sheffield for the first time the parliament of this country has passed a measure compelling the manufacturers to recognise and treat with the demands of the people trade unionism has been lifted to an entirely different level there are three bills now being draftedpeoples bills revolutionary measures they would have been called a thousand years ago every industry in the country will have its day in the next ten years capital will have earned many millions less and those many millions will have gone to the labouring classes  is it you who speak maxendorf asked grimly or is this another mana sophist living in the shadow of maratons fame is there anything of the truth anything of the great compelling truth in this piecemeal legislation is it in this way that the freedom of a country can be gained one gathered that the maraton who sent his message across the seas had different plans  i had maraton admitted but the time came when i was forced to ask myself whether they were not rather the plans of the dreamer and the theorist when i was forced to ask myself whether i was justified in destroying this generation for the sake of those to come life after all is a marvellous gift you and i may believe in immortality but who can be sure it is easy enough to play chess but when the pawns are human lives who would not hesitate  maxendorf sighed  i cannot talk with you maraton he said you will not speak with me honestly you came you landed on these shores with an inspired ideasomething magnificent something worthy you have substituted for it the timeworn methods of all the reformers since the days of adam who have parted with their principles and dabbled in sentimental altruism piecemeal legislationwhat can it do  it can build maraton declared it can build generation by generation it can produce a saner race and as the light comes so the truth will flow in upon the minds of all  an illusion selingman interrupted with a sudden fierceness in his tone once maraton you looked at life sanely enough are you sure that today you have not put on the poisoned spectacles dont you know the end of these spasmodic reforms you pass your influence passes your mantle is buried in your grave and the country slips back and the people suffer and the great wheel grinds them into bone and powder just as surely a century hence as a century ago man you dont start right if you would restore a ruined and neglected garden you must first destroy make a bonfire of the weeds prepare your soil then in the springtime fresh flowers will blossom the trees will give leaf the birds who have deserted a ruined and fruitless waste will return and sing once more the song of life but there must be destruction maraton you yourself preached it once preached fire and the sword something has gone from you since those days compromisethe spirit of compromise you call it how one hates the sound of it bah man you are on a lower level when you talk the smug talk of today i am disappointed in you maxendorf is disappointed in you you are riding down the easy way on to the sandbanks of failure  your garden maraton rejoined with an answering note of passion in his tone would never have blossomed again if you had driven the plough across it ripped up its fruit trees torn up its neglected plants by ruthless force you must plant fresh seed and grow new trees then theres another nation another world what about your responsibilities to the present one isnt it great to save what is rather than to destroy for the sake of those who have neither toiled nor suffered i thought as you once the philosopher thinks like that in his study stand before those people look into their white labourworn faces feel with them sorrow with them for a little time and i tell you that your hand will falter before it drives the plough you will raise your eyes to heaven and pray that you may see some way of bringing help to themto them who livethe help for which they crave havent they a right to their lives who gives us a mandate to sweep them away for the sake of the unborn  you have become a sentimentalist maraton maxendorf declared grimly the soft places in your heart have led you to forget for a moment the inexorable laws let us pass from these generalities let us speak of things such as you had at first intended i know what was in your heart you meant to pass from birmingham to glasgow to preach the holy war of labour a giant crusade you meant to close the mills to stop the wheels to blank the forges and rake out the furnaces of the country you meant to place your finger upon its arteries and stop their beating you meant to turn the people loose upon their oppressors though they must perish in their thousands yet you meant to show them the naked truth to show them of what they are being deprived to show them the irresistible laws of justice so that for very shame they must drop their tools and stand for their rights why didnt you do it  i have told you maraton answered  yes you have told us maxendorf continued supposing there were still a way by which even this present generation could reap the benefit are you great enough maraton to listen to me i wonder that is what i ask myself since you have become a party politician a friend of ministers since you have joined in the puppet dance of the world see to what i have brought my people in ten years time i tell you that nearly every industry in my country will be conducted upon a profitsharing basis  you have brought them to this maraton reminded him swiftly by peaceful methods  for me there were no other needed maxendorf urged for you the case is different if you are one of those who love to strut about and boast of your nationality if you are one of those in whom lingers the smallest particle of the falsest sentiment which the age of romance has ever handed down to uswhat they call patriotismthen my words will be wasted but here is the message which i have brought to you and to your people this is the dream of my life which he selingman alone has known ofthe fusion of our races  magnificent selingman cried springing to his feet the dream of a god listen to it maraton my brain has realised it i too have seen it your country is bound in the everlasting shackles generations must pass before you can even weaken the hold of your bourgeoisie upon the soul and spirit of your land you are tied hard and fast and withal you are on the downward grade the work which you do today the next generation will undo give up this foolish legislation listen to maxendorf he will show you the way  when you speak of fusion maraton asked you mean conquest  there is no such word maxendorf insisted the hearts of our people are close together put aside all these artificial ententes and alliances there are no two people whose ideals and whose aims and whose destiny are so close together as your countrys and mine it is for that very reason that these periods of distrust and suspicion continually occur suspicions which impoverish two countries with the millions we spend on senseless schemes of defence away with them all stop the pendulum of your country declare your coal strike your railway strike your ironfounders strike let the revolution come i tell you then that we shall appear not as invaders but as friends and liberators your industries shall start again on a new basis the basis which you and i know of the basis which gives to the toilers their just and legitimate share of what they produce your trade shall flourish just as it flourished before but away to dust and powder with your streets of pigsties the ratholes into which your weary labourers creep after their hours of senseless slavery you and i maraton know how industries should be conducted you and i know the just share which capital should claim you and i together will make the laws oh what does it matter whether you are english or icelanders fins or turks humanity is so much greater than nationality your men shall work side by side with mine and what each produces each shall have what is being done for my country shall surely be done for yours cant you see maratoncant you see my prophet who gropes in the darkness that i am showing you the only way  maraton rose to his feet he came and stood by maxendorfs side  maxendorf he said you may be speaking to me from your heart yes i will admit that you are speaking to me from your heart but you ask me to take an awful risk you stand first in your country today but in your country there are other powerful influences at work so much of what you say is true if i believed maxendorfif i believed that this fusion as you call it of our people could come about in the way you suggest if i believed that the building up of our prosperity could start again on the real and rational basis of many of your institutions if i believed this maxendorf no false sentiment would stand in my way i would risk the eternal shame of the historians so far as i could do it i would give you this country but there is always the doubt the awful doubt you have a ruler whose ideas are not your ideas you have a people behind you who are strange to me i have not travelled in your country i know little of it what if your people should assume the guise of conquerors should garrison our towns with foreign soldiers demand a huge indemnity and then withdrawing leave us to our fate you have no guarantees to offer me maxendorf  none but my word maxendorf confessed quietly  you bargain like a politician selingman cried man cant you see the glory of it  i can see the glory maraton answered turning around but i can see also the ineffaceable ignominy of it is your country great enough maxendorf to follow where your finger points i do not know  yet you too maxendorf persisted must sometimes have looked into futurity you must have seen the slow decay of national pride the nations of the world growing closer and closer together cant you bear to strike a blow for the great things you and i see so well the utter barbarism of warfare the hideous waste of our mighty armaments draining the money like blood from our countries and all for senselessness all just to keep alive that strange spirit which belongs to the days of romance and the days of romance only its a workaday world now maraton we draw nearer to the last bend in the worlds history oh this is the truth i have seen it for so long its my religion maraton the time may not have come to preach it broadcast but its there in my heart  selingman struck the table with the palm of his hand  enough he said the words have been spoken tomorrow or the next day we meet again go to your study maraton and think lock the door turn out the julia i shall some day rob you of hold your head look into the future think think no more words now they do no good come i stay with maxendorf i go with you to the lift  maxendorf held out his hand  selingman is as usual right he confessed we are speaking in a great language maraton it is enough for tonight perhaps come back to me when you will within the next fortyeight hours  they left him there a curious figure straight and motionless standing upon the threshold of his room selingman gripped maraton by the arm as he hurried him along the corridor  youve doubts maraton he muttered doubts curse them they are not worthy you should see the truth youre big enough you will see it tomorrow get out of the fog maxendorf is the most profound thinker of these days he is over here with that scheme of his deep in his heart its become a passion with him we have talked of it by the hour spoken of you prayed for some prophet on your side with eyes to see the truth into the lift with you man look for me tomorrow farewell    chapter xxxi  maraton was more than ever conscious as he climbed the stairs of the house in downing street an hour or so later of a certain fragility of appearance in mr foley markedly apparent during these last few weeks he was standing talking to lord armley who was one of the late arrivals as maraton entered talking in a low tone and with an obviously serious manner at the sound of maratons name however he turned swiftly around his face seemed to lighten he held out his hand with an air almost of relief  so you have come he exclaimed i am glad  maraton shook hands and would have passed on but mr foley detained him  armley and i were talking about this after noons decision he continued there will be no secret about it tomorrow it has been decided to carry out our autumn manoeuvred as usual in south em waters  maraton nodded  i am afraid that is one of the things the significance of which fails to reach me he remarked you were against it were you not  mr foley groaned softly  my friend he said there is only one fault with the members of my government only one fault with this country we are all foolishly and blindly sanguine we are optimistic by persuasion and selfpersuasion we like the comfortable creed i suppose that the bogey of war has strutted with us for so long that we have grown used to it  maraton looked at his companion thoughtfully  do you seriously believe mr foley he asked in an undertone in the possibility in the imminent possibility of war  mr foley halfclosed his eyes and sighed  oh my dear maraton he murmured it isnt a question of belief its like asking me whether i believe i can see from here into my own drawingroom the figures in there are real enough arent they so is the cloud i can see gathering all the time over our heads it is a question only of the propitious momentof that there is no manner of doubt  you speak of affairs maraton admitted of which i know nothing i do not even understand the balance of power i always thought though that every great nation our own included paid a certain amount of insurance in the shape of huge contributions towards a navy and army that we paid such insurance as was necessary and were rewarded with adequate results  mr foley forgot his depression for an instant and smiled  what a theorist you are it all depends upon the amount of insurance you take up whether the risk is covered weve underinsured for many years thanks to that little kink in our disposition we got a nasty knock in south africa and we had to pay our own loss it did us good for a year or two now the pendulum has just reached the other extreme weve swung back once more into our silly dream oh maraton its true enough that we have great problems to face sociologically dont think that i underrate them you know i dont but every time i sit and talk to you i have always at the back of my mind that other fear    have you seen maxendorf tonight  i have just left him maraton replied  an interesting interview  very  mr foley gripped his arm  my friend he saidyou see i am beginning to call you thatyou have talked tonight with one of the most wonderful and the most dangerous enemies of our country you wont think me drivelling will you or presuming if i beg you to remember that fact and that you are notwithstanding your foreign birth one of us you are an englishman a member of the english house of parliament  i do not forget that maraton declared gravely  go and find lady elisabeth mr foley directed she was a little hurt at the idea that you were not coming i have a few more words to say to armley  maraton passed on into the rooms which were only half filled some fancy possessed him to pause for a moment in the spot where he had stood alone for some time on his first visit to this house and as he lingered there lady elisabeth came into the room leaning on the arm of a great lawyer she saw him almost at onceher eyes indeed seemed to glance instinctively towards the spot where he was standing maraton felt the change in her expression with a whisper she left her escort and came immediately in his direction he watched her step by step was it his fancy or had she lost some of the haughtiness of carriage which he had noticed that night not many months ago the slight coldness which in those first moments had half attracted and half repelled him perhaps it was because he was now admitted within the circle of her friends she came to him at any rate quickly almost eagerly and the smile about her lips as she took his hand was one of real and natural pleasure  how good of you she murmured i scarcely hoped that you would come you have been with maxendorf  he nodded  is it a confession he asked it was mr foleys first question to me  it is because we hate and distrust the man she replied you arent a politician you see mr maraton you dont quite appreciate some of the forces which are making an old man of my uncle today which make life almost intolerable for many of us when we think seriously she went on simply  arent you exaggerating that sentiment just a little he suggested  not a particle she assured him however you came here to be entertained didnt you i wont croak to you any more i think i have done my duty for this evening let us find a corner and talk like ordinary human beings are you going in to supper  i hadnt thought of it he admitted  i dined at seven oclock she told him we seem to have provided supper for hundreds of people and i am sure not half of them are coming  they passed through two of the rooms into a long low apartment which led into the winter gardens at one end refreshments were being served and the rest of the space was taken up with little tables elisabeth led him to one placed just inside the winter garden a footman filled their glasses with champagne  now we are going to be normal human beings she declared how much i wish that you really were a normal human being  in what respect am i different  you know quite well she answered i should like you to be what you seem to bejust a capable clever rising politician with a place in the cabinet before you working for your country sincere free from all these strange notions  working for my country he repeated that is just the difficult part of the whole situation nowadays i know that i am rather a trouble to your uncle sometimes i fear that i may become even a greater trouble it is so hard to adopt the attitude which you suggest when one feels the intolerable situation which exists in that country  but we are on the highroad now to great reforms she reminded him another decade of years and the people whom you worship will surely be lifting their heads  he smiled as she looked across at him with a puzzled air  it is strange she remarked that you too have the appearance of a man dissatisfied with himself i wonder why surely you must feel that everything has gone your way since you came to england  i am not sure how i feel about it he replied think i came with different ideas i came with a religion which admitted no compromises and i have accepted a compromise  a wise and a sane one she declared almost passionately and tonighttell me am i not righttonight there have been those who have sought to upset it in your mind  you are clairvoyant  not i but it is so easy to see it is the dream of maxendorfs life to bring england to the verge of a revolution by paralysing her industries better for him that than any violent scheme of conquest if he can stop the engine that drives the wheels of the country they can come over in tourist steamers and tell us how to govern it better  and if they did he asked quickly isnt it possible that their rule over the people might be better than the rule of this stubborn generation  she drew herself up her eyes flashed with anger  havent you a single gleam of patriotism she demanded  he sighed  i think that i have he replied and yet it lies at the back of my thoughts at the back of my heart it is more like an artistic inspiration one of those things that lie among the pleasant impulses of life right in the foreground i see the great groaning cycle of humanity being flung from the everlasting wheels into the bottomless abyss i cannot take my eyes from the people you see  she sat almost rigid for some brief space of time a servant was arranging plates in front of them their glasses were refilled the music of a waltz stole in through the open door around them many other people were sitting an atmosphere of gaiety began gradually to develop maraton watched his companion closely her eyes were full of trouble her sensitive mouth quivering a little there was a straight line across her forehead her fair hair was arranged in great coils without a single ornament she wore no jewels at all save a single string of pearls around her slim white neck maraton as the moments passed was conscious of a curious weakening a return of that same thrill which the sound of her voice that first dayhalf imperious half gracioushad incited in him he waved his hand towards the crowd of those who supped around them  let us forget he begged i too feel that i have more in my mind tonight than my brain can cope with let us rest for a little time  her face lightened  we will she assented gladly only do remember what my constant prayer about you is things you know in some respects must go on as they are and the country needs its strongest sons mr foley would like to bring you even closer to him i know he is simply aching with impatience to have you in the cabinet dont do anything rash mr maraton dont do anything which would make it impossible there are many beautiful theories in life which would be simply hateful failures if one tried to bring them into practice try to remember that experience goes for something and nowfinished tell me about sheffield i read selingmans marvellous article one could almost see the whole scene there how i should love to hear you speak not in parliamenti dont mean that i almost realise how impossible you find that  it is only a matter of earnestness he replied and a certain aptitude for forming phrases quickly no one can feel deeply about anything and not find themselves more or less eloquent when they come to talk about it by the bye have you ever met selingman  she shook her head  my uncle knew him he tells me that he asked him here tonight i wish that he had come and yet i am not sure some of his writings i have hated he too is a theorist isnt he i wonder  she paused and looked expectant  i often wonder she went on is there nothing else in your life at all except this passionate altruism in your younger life for instance werent there ever any sports or occupations that you cared for  yes he admitted slowly for some years i did a good many of the usual things  and now the desire for them has all gone she asked havent you any personal hopes or dreams in connection with life isnt there anything you look forward to or desire for yourself  i seem to have so little time and yet one has dreamsone always must have dreams you know  tell me about yours she insisted  he sat up abruptly her fingers fell upon his arm  we will go and sit under my rose tree she suggested  they moved back into the winter garden until they came to a seat at its furthest extremity a fountain was playing a few yards away and clusters of great pink roses were drooping down from some trelliswork before them  here at least she continued as she leaned back we will not be tempted to talk seriously tell me about yourself do you never look forward into the future have you no personal ambitions or hopes  he looked steadily ahead of him  i am only a very ordinary man he replied like every one else sometimes i look up to the clouds  tell me what you see there she begged  he was silent the sound of voices now came to them like a distant murmur a background to the slow falling of the water into the fountain basin  lady elisabeth he said it is not always possible to tell even ones own self what the thoughts mean which come into ones brain  you will not even try to tell me then  i must not he answered  she sat with her hands folded in front of her her head drooped a little maraton felt himself suddenly at war with a whole multitude of emotions was it possible that this thing had come to him that a woman could take the great place in his life a woman not of his kind one who could not even share the passion which was to have absorbed every impulse of his existence to the end she was of a different world perhaps it had all been a mistake perhaps it would have been better for him to have stayed outside to have never crossed the little borderland which led into the land of compromises and all the time while his brain was at work something stronger more wonderful was throbbing in his heart he moved restlessly in his place her ungloved hand lay within a few inches of him he suddenly caught it  lady elisabeth he whispered i feel like a traitor i feel myself moved to say things to you under false pretences i ought not to have come here  what do you mean she demanded you cant mean  their eyes met he read the truth unerringly no not that he answered there is no one what i feel is at any rate consecrate but i have no right i am not sure even at this moment whether it is not in my heart to take a step which you would look upon as the blackest ingratitude my life lady elisabeth holds issues in it far apart and it is vowed dedicate  you are going to break away she asked quietly  i may he admitted that is the truth that is why i hesitated about coming here tonight and yet i wanted to come i wasnt sure why i know nowit was to see you  oh dont be rash she begged dont i may talk to you now really from my heart maynt i she went on looking steadfastly into his face dont imagine that that great gulf exists it doesnt if you break away it will be a mistake you want to feel your feet upon the clouds you dont know how much safer you will be if you keep them upon the earth you may bring incalculable suffering and misery upon the very people whom you wish to benefit you think that i am a woman perhaps and i know little yes but sometimes we who are outside see much and it is dangerous you know to act upon theories i havent spoken a single selfish word have i i havent tried to tell you how much i should hate to lose you  he rose to his feet  i am going away he said hoarsely i must fight this thing out alone but  he looked around the words seemed to fail him their little corner of the winter garden was still uninvaded  but lady elisabeth he continued you know the thing which makes it harder for me than ever you know very well that if i decide to do what must make me a stranger in this household i shall do it at a personal sacrifice which i never dreamed could exist  she swayed a little towards him her face was suddenly changed alluring her eyes pleaded with him  you mustnt go away she whispered if you go now you must come backdo you bearyou must come back    chapter xxxii  it was the eve of the reopening of parliament maraton who had been absent from londonno one knew whereduring the last six weeks had suddenly reappeared once more he had invited the committee of the labour party to meet at his house his invitation was accepted but it was obvious that this time their attitude towards the man who welcomed them was one of declared and pronounced hostility graveling was there with sullen evil face he made no attempt to shake hands with maraton and he sat at the table provided for them with folded arms and dour uncompromising aspect dale came late and he too greeted maraton with bluff unfriendliness bordens attitude was noncommittal weavel shook hands but his frown and manner were portentous culvain the diplomat of the party was quiet and reserved david ross alone had never lost his attitude of unwavering fidelity he sat at maratons left hand his head a little drooped his eyes almost hidden beneath his shaggy grey eyebrows his lower lip protuberant he had somehow the air of a guarding dog ready to spring into bitter words if his master were touched  gentlemen maraton began when at last they were all assembled i have asked you the committee who were appointed to meet me on my arrival england to meet me once more here on the eve of the reopening of parliament  there was a grim silence no one spoke their general attitude was one of suspicious waiting  you all know maraton went on with what ideas i first came to england i found however that circumstances here were in many respects different from anything i had imagined you all know that i modified my plans i decided to adopt a middle course  a seat in parliament graveling muttered and a place at the prime ministers dinner table  for some reason or other maraton continued unruffled my coming into parliament seemed obnoxious to mr dale and most of you i decided in favour of that course however because the offer made me by mr foley was one which in the interests of the people i could not refuse mr foley has done his best to keep to the terms of his compact with me perhaps i ought to say that he has kept to it the successful termination of the lancashire strike is due entirely to his efforts the prolongation of the sheffield strike is in no way his fault the blind stupidity of the masters was too much even for him the position has developed very much as i feared it might you cannot make employers see reason by act of parliament mr foley kept his word he has been on the side of the men throughout this struggle he has used every atom of influence he possesses to compel the employers to give in temporarily he has failedonly temporarily mind for a bill will be introduced into parliament during this session which will very much alter the position of the employers but this partial failure has convinced me of one thing this is too lawabiding a country for compromises for the last six weeks i have been travelling on the continent i have realised how splendidly labour has emancipated itself there compared to its slow progress in this country from town to town in northern europe i passed and found the great industries of the various districts in the hands of a composite body of men embracing the boy learning the simplest machine and the financier in the office every man there working like a single part of one huge machine each for the profit of the whole a genuine scheme of profitsharing is there being successfully carried out it is owing to this visit and the convictions which have come to me from the same that i have called you together today  you invited us peter dale remarked deliberately and here we are as to what goods likely to come of our meeting thats another matter theres no denying the fact that weve not been able to work together up till now and whether we shall in the future is by no means clear  i am sorry to hear you say so mr dale maraton declared i only hope that before you go you will have changed your mind  not in the least likely that i can see peter dale retorted for my part i cant reckon up what you want with us youve gone into the house on your own and youve chosen to sit in a place by yourself youve tried your best to manage things according to your own way of thinking without us now all of a sudden you invite us here i wonder whether this has anything to do with it  with some deliberation peter dale produced from his pocket a letter which he smoothed out upon the table before him he had the air of a man who prepares a bombshell maraton stretched out his hand toward it  is that for me he asked  peter dale kept his fingers upon it  its contents concern you he announced ill read it if youll be so good as to listen came as a bit of a shock to us i must confess  anonymous maraton murmured  if its contents are untrue peter dale said you will be able to contradict them with your kind permission then listen everybody  dear sir  the following facts concerning a recent addition to the ranks of your party should i think be of some interest to you  the proper name of mr maraton is mr maraton lawes  mr maraton lawes and a younger brother were once the possessors of the worldfamous lawes oil springs and are now the principal shareholders in the lawes oil company  the person in question is a millionaire  a socialist millionaire who conceals the fact of his wealth and keeps his purse closed is a person i think open to criticism  a sketch of mr maraton lawes career will shortly appear in an evening paper   maraton listened without change of countenance all eyes were turned upon him  well he enquired nonchalantly  is this true peter dale demanded  maraton inclined his head  the writer he said a man named beldeman i am sure has been singularly moderate in his statements i have been expecting the article to appear for some time  they were all of them apparently afflicted with a curious combination of emotions they were angry and yetwith the exception of gravelingthere was beneath their anger some evidence of that curious respect for wealth prevalent amongst their order they looked at maraton with a new interest  a millionaire peter dale exclaimed impressively you admit it youa socialista peoples man as youve called yourself and never a word to one of us never a copper of your money to the party i repeat itnot one copper have we seen  the mans cheeks were flushed with anger his brows lowered something of his indignation was reflected in the faces of all of themmomentarily a queer sort of cupidity seemed to have stolen into their expressions maraton shrugged his shoulders slightly  why should i subscribe to your party funds he asked calmly some of you do good work no doubt and yet there is no such destroyer of good work as money work individual effort unselfish enthusiasm are the torches which should light on your cause money would only serve the purpose of a slow poison amongst you  prattle abraham weavel muttered  rot peter dale agreed just another question mr maraton why have you kept this secret from us  i will make a statement maraton replied coolly perhaps it will save needless questions my money is derived from oil springs i prospected for them myself and i have had to fight for them it was in wilder days than you know of here i have a younger brother or rather a halfbrother whom i was sorry to see over here the other day who is my partner my average profits are twentyeight thousand pounds a year ten thousand pounds goes to the support of a childrens home in new york the remainder is distributed in other directions amongst institutions for the rescue of children five thousand a year i keep for myself  five thousand a year peter dale gasped indignantly did you hear that he added turning to the others  four hundred a year and a hundred and fifty from subscriptions and thats every penny i have to bring up seven children upon weavel declared with disgust  and mines less than that and the subscriptions falling off borden grunted  what sort of a socialist is a man with five thousand a year who keeps his pockets tightly buttoned up i should like to know graveling exclaimed angrily  maraton smiled  you have common sense i am sure all of you he said in fact no one could possibly accuse you of being dreamers every effort of my life will be devoted towards the promulgation of my beliefs absolutely without regard to my pecuniary position i admit that the possession of wealth is contrary to the principles of life which i should like to see established still until conditions alter it would be even more contrary to my principles to distribute my money in charity which i abominate or to weaken good causes by unwholesome and unearned contributions to them shall we now proceed to the subject of our discussion  what is it anyway peter dale demanded gruffly do you find that after being so plaguey independent you need our help after all is that what it is  i want no ones help maraton replied quietly i only want to give you this earliest notice because in your way you do represent the peoplethat it is my intention to revert to my first ideas i have arranged a tour in the potteries next week i go straight on to newcastle and from there to glasgow i intend to preach a universal strike i intend if i can to bring the shipbuilders the coalminers the dockers the railroad men out on strike while the sheffield trouble is as yet unsolved whatever may come of it i intend that the government of this country shall realise how much their prosperity is dependent upon the peoples will  there was a little murmur peter dale who had filled his pipe was puffing away steadily  look here he said slowly newcastles my job  is it maraton replied there are a million and a quarter of miners to be considered you may be the representative of a few of them i am not sure that in this matter you represent their wishes if you are for peace i am going to see  as for the potteries mr borden declared a strike theres overdue and thats certain but if all the others are going to strike at the same time why whats the good of it the unions cant stand it  we have tried striking piecemeal maraton pointed out it doesnt seem to me that its a success what is called the government here can deal with one strike at a time theyve soldiers enough and law enough for that they havent for a universal strike  peter dale struck the table with his clenched fist his expression was grim and his tone truculent  what i say is this he pronounced im dead against any interference from outsiders if i think a strikes good for my people well ill blow the whistle if youre for newcastle next week mr maraton so am i if youre for preaching a strike well im for preaching against it  hear hear graveling exclaimed im with you  maraton smiled a little bitterly  as you will mr dale he replied but remember youll have to seek another constituency next time you want to come into parliament do be reasonable he went on do you suppose the people will listen to you preaching peace and contentment theyll whip you out of the town  its the carpetbagger that will have to go first dale declared vigorously theres no two ways about that  maraton sighed  sometimes he said looking around at them i feel that it must be my fault that there has never been any sympathy between us sometimes i am sure that it is yours dont you ever look a little way beyond the actual wants of your own constituents dont you ever peer over the edge and realise that the real cause of the people is no local matter it is a great blow for their freedom this which i mean to strike id like to have had you all with me its a huge responsibility for one  its revolution culvain muttered you may call that a responsibility indeed whos going to feed the people whos going to keep them from pillaging and rioting  no one maraton replied quietly a revolution is inevitable perhaps after that we may have to face the coming of a foreign enemy and yet even with this contingency in view i want you to ask yourselves what have the people to lose those who will suffer by anything that could possibly happen will be the wealthy from those who have not nothing can be taken what i prophesy is that in the next phase of our history a new era will dawn our industries will be reestablished upon different lines the loss entailed by the revolution by the dislocating of all our industries will fall upon the people who are able and who deserve to pay for it  there was a moments grim silence then david ross suddenly lifted his head  its a great blow he cried its the hand of the lord falling upon the land long overduetoo long overdue the mans right this people have had a century to set their house in order the warning has been in their ears long enough the thunder has muttered so long its time the storm should break let ruin come i say  you can talk any silly nonsense you like david ross dale declared angrily but what i say is that we are listening to the most dangerous stuff any man ever spouted whats to become of us id like to know with a revolution in the country  you would probably lose your jobs maraton answered calmly what does it matter there are others to follow you the first whom the people will turn upon will be those who have pulled down the pillars our names will be hated by every one of them what does it matter it is for their good  peter dale doubled up his fist and once more he smote the table before him  i am dead against you maraton he announced put that in your pipe and smoke it if you go to newcastle i go there to fight you if you go to any of the places in this country represented by us our member will be there to fight we are in parliament to do our best for the people we represent bit by bit as we can we are not there to plunge the country into a revolution and run the risk of a foreign invasion there isnt one of us englishmen here wholl agree with you or side with you for one moment  hear hear they all echoed  not one graveling interposed and for my part i go further i say that the man who stands there and talks about the risk of a foreign invasion like that is no englishman i call him a traitor and if the thing comes he speaks of may he be hung from the nearest lamppost thats all ive got to say  maraton opened his lips and closed them again he looked slowly down that wall of blank unsympathetic faces and he merely shrugged his shoulders words were wasted upon them  very well gentlemen he said let it be war perhaps wed better let this be the end of our deliberations  graveling rose slowly to his feet his face was filled with evil things he pointed to maraton  theres a word more to be spoken he exclaimed theres more behind this scheme of maratons than hes willing to have us understand it looks to me and it sounds to me like a piece of dirty underhand business ill ask you a question maraton were you at the ritz hotel one night about two months ago with the ambassador of a foreign a country  i was maraton admitted coolly  graveling looked around with a little cry of triumph  its a plot this nothing more nor less than a plot he declared vigorously what sort of an englishman does he call himself i wonder its the foreigners that are at the bottom of the lot of it they want our trade theyd be glad of our country theyve bribed this man maraton to get it without the trouble of fighting for it even  maraton moved towards the door holding it open he turned and faced them  before i came he said i hoped that you might be men i find you just the usual sort of pigmies you call yourselves peoples men you havent mastered the elementary truths of your religion whats england or france or any other country in the world by the side of humanity be off ill go my own way go yours and take your little tinsel of jingoism with you whenever you want to fight me i shall be ready  and fight you we shall peter dale thundered mark you that theres limits even to us the government of this country maynt be all it should be but after all its our english government and there is a point at which every man has to support it the law is the law and so you may find out my friend  they filed out maraton closed the door after them he was alone he threw open the window to get rid of the odour of tobacco smoke which still hung about the echo of their raucous voices seemed still in the air these were the men who should have been his friends and associates these were the men to whom he had the right to look for sympathy they treated him like a dangerous lunatic their own small interests their own small careers were threatened and they were up in arms without a moments hesitation not one of them had made the slightest attempt to see the whole truth the word revolution had terrified them the approach of a crisis had driven their thoughts into one narrow focus what would it mean for them  he resumed his seat the empty chairs pushed back seemed somehow or other allegorical he was alone the man for whose friendship he had indeed felt some desire the man who had opened his hands and heart to himstephen foleywould know him henceforth no more he drew his thoughts resolutely away from that side of his life closed his ears to the music which beat there crushed down the fancies which sprang up so easily if ever he relaxed his hold upon his will he was lonely for the first time in his life perhaps intensely lonely in all the country there was scarcely a human being who would not soon look upon him as a madman what did one live for after all just to continue the dull hopeless struggleto fight without hope of reward to fight with oneself as well as with the world  the door was opened softly julia came in perhaps she guessed from his attitude something of his trouble for she moved at once to his side  they have gone she asked  they have gone he admitted  she sighed  i shall not ask you anything she said because i know pigs of menpigs with their noses to the ground how can they lift their heads you could not make them understand  i scarcely tried he confessed they have found out for one thing that i am wealthy a fact that does not concern them in the least and they accused me of it as though it were a crime it was all so hopeless you cannot make men understand who have not the capacity for understanding you cannot make the blind see they even reminded me that they were englishmen they talked the usual rubbish about conquest and foreign enemies and patriotism  clods she muttered but you  she sat down beside him her eyes full of light she laid her hands boldly upon his  you will not let yourself be discouraged she i pleaded remember that even if you are alone in the world you are right you fight without hope of reward without hope of appreciation you will be the enemy of every one and yet you know in your heart that you have the truth you know it and i know it and aaron knows it and david ross believes it there are millions of others if you could only find them who understand toomen too great to come out from their studies and talk claptrap to the mob there are other people in the world who understand who will sympathise what does it matter that you cannot hear their spoken voices and wewell you know about us  her voice was almost a caress the loneliness in his heart was so intense  oh you know about us she continued ioh i am your slave and aaron we believe we understand there isnt anything in this world she went on with a little sob there isnt anything i wouldnt gladly do to help you if only one could help  he returned very gently the pressure of her burning fingers she drew his eyes towards hers and he was startled to see in those few minutes how beautiful she was there was inspiration in her splendidly modelled facethe high forehead the eyes brilliantly clear kindled now with the light of enthusiasm and all the softer burning of her exquisite sympathy her lipsfull and red they seemedwere slightly parted she was breathing quickly like one who has run a race  oh dear master she whisperedlet me call you thatdont even for a moment be fainthearted  the door was suddenly thrown open selingman entered an enormous bunch of roses in his hand a green hat on the back of his head  fainthearted he exclaimed what a word who is fainthearted julia i have brought you flowers you would have to kiss rue for them if he were not here dont glower at me every one kisses me great ladies would if i asked them to thats the best of being a genius lord what a wreck he looks whats wrong with you man i know i met them at the corner of the street there was the ratfaced fellow with the red tie and the minerlabour members they call themselves i would like to see them with a spade have you been trying to get at their brains maraton whats that to make a man like you depressed did you think they had any did you think you could draw a single spark of fire out of dull pap like that bah  julia was moving quietly about the room putting the flowers in water aaron had slipped in and was seated before his desk selingman his broad face set suddenly into hard lines plumped himself into the chair which peter dale had occupied  man alive lift your headlift your head to the skies he ordered youre the biggest man in this country will you treat the prick of a pin like a mortal wound what did you expect from them lord almighty    ive packed my bag im ready for the road two hundred and fifty pounds a time from the daily oracle for thumbnail sketches of the human firebrand lord what is any one depressed for in this country its chockfull of humour if i lived here long i should be fat  he looked downward at his figure with complacency julia laughed softly  arent you fat now she asked  immense he confessed but its nothing to what i could be it agrees with me he went on you see i have learnt the art of being satisfied with myself i know what i am i am content that is where you my friend maraton need to grow a little older oh you are great enough great enough if you only knew it even maxendorf admits that and he told me frankly hes disappointed in you dont sit there like a dumb figure any longer we are all coming with you arent we i have brought my car over from belgium it is a caravan it will hold us allaaron too let us start let us get out of this accursed city where is the first move  we cant leave tonight maraton said i am addressing a meeting of the representatives of the amalgamated railway workersthat is if peter dale doesnt manage to stop it hell do his best  he wont succeed aaron declared eagerly i saw ernshaw two hours ago theyre on to peter dale and his move do you know why peter dale was late here this afternoon hed been to downing street i heard foleys lost you but hes holding on to the labour party hes pitting the labour party against you in the country selingman laughed heartily  hes got it he exclaimed thats the scheme i am all for a fight spoiling for it fighting and eating are the grandest things in the world what time is the meeting  seven oclock maraton replied  two hours we will give you selingman continued nine oclock a little restaurant i know in the west end the four of us before we start we will do ourselves well  before i leave london maraton said i must see maxendorf once more  selingman stroked his face thoughtfully  your risk he remarked dont you let these chaps think you are mixed up with maxendorf  i must see maxendorf maraton insisted when i leave london tonight the die is cast i have cut myself adrift from everything in life i shall make enemies with every class of society there must be one word more pass between maxendorf and me before i hold up the torch  hes got it selingman declared the trick is on him already maxendorf he shall see i will arrange a meeting somewherenot at the hotel miss julia write down this address this is where we all meet at nine halfpast six now i will take you round to your meeting maraton do you want any papers  i want no papers maraton answered i speak to these men tonight as i shall speak to them in the north i take no papers from london with me no figures nothing it is just the things i see i want to tell them  selingman nodded  you shall speak immortal words he declared and ii am the one man in the world to transcribe them to write in the background to give them colour and point what giants we are maratonyou with your stream of words and i with my pen miss julia he added remember that you are to be our inspiration as well as my secretary put on your prettiest clothes tonight it is our last holiday  she looked at him coldly  i do not wear pretty clothes she said  little fool he exclaimed just because youve the big things beating in your brain youd like to close your eyes to the fact that your sex is the most wonderful thing on gods earth thats the worst of a woman if ever she begins to think seriously she does her hair in a lump changes silk for cotton forgets her corsets and leaves off ribbons silly silly child he went on shaking his forefinger at her i tell you women have done their greatest work in the world when their brains have been covered with a pretty hat    there she goes he growled as she left the room thinks im a flippant old windbag i know and im not why dont you fall in love with her maraton it would be the making of you even a prophet needs relaxation she is yours body and soul one can tell it with every sentence she speaks and she is for the cause he concluded with a graver note in his tone she has found the fire somewhere there were women like her who held robespierres hand  maraton glanced up selingman was leaning forward and his eyes were fixed steadily upon his friend  i was afraid just a little afraid he said slowly of the other woman i am glad she didnt count enough women are the very devil sometimes when they come between us and the right thing    chapter xxxiii  selingman came into the restaurant with a huge rose in his buttonhole and another bunch of flowerscarnations this timein his hands he made his way to the little round table where julia and aaron were seated  for you miss julia he declared depositing them by her side pin them in the front of your frock drink wine tonight be gay let us see pink also in your cheeks it is a great evening this maraton is here  not yet julia answered smiling  selingman sat down between them he gave a lengthy order to a waiter then he turned abruptly to julia  he will keep to it you think this time you believe that he has made up his mind  i do she asserted vigorously  what is he made of that man selingman continued sipping the vermouth which he had just ordered he makes love to you eh ach never mind your brother for a man like maraton what does it matter you are of the right stuff you would be proud  she looked steadily out of the restaurant  i have been a worker she said in a clothing factory since i was old enough to stand up and what little time i have had to spare i have spent in study in trying to fit myself for the fight against those things that you and i and all of us know of there has been no opportunity she went on more slowly i have not allowed myself  ah but it comesit must come selingman interrupted you have the instincti am sure of that use your power a little it will be for his good every man who neglects his passions weakens you have the gifts julia i tell you thati selingman who know much about woman and more about love and life youve felt it too yourself sometimes in the quiet hours havent you lain in your bed with your eyes wide open and seen the ceiling roll away and the skies lean down and felt the thoughts come stealing into your brain till all of a sudden you found that your pulses were beating fast and your heart was trembling and there was a sort of faint music in your blood and in your ears ah well one knows suffer yourself to think of these hours when he is with you sometimes dont make an ice maiden of yourself youve done good work i know all about you you could do more splendid work still if you could weave that little spell which you and i know of  it is too late she sighed too late now he has become used to me i am a machinenothing more to him he does not even realise that i am a woman  what do you expect aaron asked harshly why should a man with great things in his brain waste a moment in thinking of women  selingmans underlip shot out a queer little way he had of showing his contempt  little man he told aaron you are a fanatic you do not understand it is a quarter past nine and i am hungry    ah  maraton came in just then he had the air of a man who has been through a crisis but his eyes were bright as though with triumph selingman stood up and filled a glass with wine  the first rivet has been driven home he cried i see it  it has indeed maraton answered for good or for evil the railway strike is decided upon there is civil war waging now i can tell you he added as he sat down graveling was there with a message the whole of the labour party is against the strike the leaders of the men are hot for it and the men themselves there wasnt a single one of them who hesitated ernshaw who represents the union told me that there wasnt one of them who wouldnt get the sack if he dared to waver they know what the government did in lancashire and they know what they tried to do at sheffield with the railway companies theyll have even more influence  let us dine selingman insisted welcoming the approach of the waiters you see me a man of fortyfive robust the picture of health how do i do it in this manner when i dine all cares go to the winds when i dine i forget the hard places i let my brain free of its burden i talk nonsense i love best with a pretty woman tonight we will talk with miss julia you see i have brought her more flowers she does not wear them but they lie by her plate  i have never worn an ornament in my life julia told him and i dont think that any one has ever given me flowers  selingman groaned  oh what pitiful words he exclaimed if there is one thing sadder in life than the slavery of the people it is to find a woman who has forgotten her sex almost you inspire me young lady with the desire to take you by the hand and offer you my escort into the gentler ways if i were sure of success not even my fair friends on the other side of the channel could keep me from your feet maraton look away from the walls theres nothing beyondjust a world full of fancies theres some sole otèro on your plate which is worth tasting and theres champagne in your glass what matter if there are troubles outside thats goodthere is music  he beckoned to the chef dorchestre engaged him for a few moments in conversation poured him out a glass of wine and slipped something into his hand then he recommenced his dinner with a chuckle of satisfaction  the little man can play he declared he has it in his fingers we shall hear now the waltzes that i love ah miss julia why is this not paris why can i not get up and put my arm around your waist and whisper in your ear as we float round and round in a waltz stupid questions i am too short to dance with you for one thing and much too fat but one loves to imagine listen  maraton had already set down his knife and fork the strains of the waltz had come to him with a queer note of familiarity a familiarity which at first he found elusive then as the movement progressed he remembered once more he was sitting in that distant corner of the winter garden hearing every now and then the faint sound of the orchestra from the ballroom it was the same waltz alas the same music was warming his blood and it was too late now he had passed into the other world in his pocket lay the letter which he had received that evening from mr foleya few dignified lines of bitter disappointment he was an outcast one who might even soon be regarded as the wrecker of his own country and still the music grew and faded and grew again  it was late before they had finished dinner and maraton took selingman to one side  remember he insisted it is a bargain before i go north i must see maxendorf  selingman nodded  it is arranged he said we both agreed that it was better for you not to go to the hotel wait  he glanced at his watch and nodded  stay with your brother little one he directed turning to julia we shall be away only a few moments come  where are we going maraton enquired as they passed through the restaurant and ascended the stairs  selingman placed his finger by the side of his nose  a plan of mine he whispered maxendorf is here in a private room  selingman hurried his companion into a small private diningroom maxendorf was sitting there alone smoking a cigarette over the remnants of an unpretentious feast he welcomed them without a smile his aspect indeed as he waved his hand towards a chair was almost forbidding  what do you want with me maraton he asked they tell meselingman tells methere was a word you had to say before you press the levers say it then and remember that hereafter the less communication between you and me the better  maraton ignored the chair he stood a little way inside the room through the partially opened window came the ceaseless roar of traffic from the busy street below  maxendorf he began there isnt much to be said you knowselingman has told youwhat my decision is it took me some time to make up my mindonly because i doubted one thing and one thing alone in the world that one thing maxendorf was your good faith  maxendorf lifted his eyes swiftly  you doubted me he repeated  youre a peoples man i know maraton went one but here and there one finds queer traits in your character they say that you are also a patriot and a schemer  they say truly maxendorf admitted yet these things are by the way they occupy a little cell of lifeno more it is for the people i live and breathe  for the people of the world maraton persisted slowlyfor humanity is there any difference in your mind maxendorf between the people of one country and the people of another  maxendorf never faltered his long narrow face was turned steadily towards maraton his eyebrows were drawn together he spoke slowly and with great distinctness  i am for humanity he declared many of the people of my country i have already freed it is for the sufferers in other lands that i toil in these days if i am a patriot it is because it is part of my political outfit and a political outfit is necessary to the man who labours as i have laboured  so be it then maraton decided i accept your words within a month from this time the revolution will be here this land will be laid waste the terror will be brewed i fear nothing maxendorf but as one man to another i have come to tell you before i start north that if in your heart there is a single grain of deceit if ever it shall be made clear to me that i have been made the catspaw of what you have called patriotism if the people of this country have left a breath of life in my body i shall dedicate it to a purpose at which you can guess  it is to threaten me that you have come maxendorf asked quietly  dont put it like that maraton replied these are just the words which you yourself cannot fail to understand neither you nor i hold life so dearly that the thought of losing it need make us quaver i am here only to say this one wordto tell you that the heavens have never opened more surely to let out the lightning than will your death be a charge upon me if you should vary even a hairsbreadth from our contract if maxendorf the peoples man hides himself for only a moment in the shadow of maxendorf the politician he shall die  maxendorf held out his hand  death he said scornfully is not the greatest ill with which you could threaten me but let it be so humanity shall be our mottono other  you spar at one another selingman declared like a couple of sophists you are both men of the truth you are both on your way to the light i give you my benediction i watch over youi selingman i am the witness of the joining of your hands unlock the gates without fear maraton maxendorf will do his work   chapter xxxiv   about seven miles from london selingman gave the signal for the car to pull up they drew in by the side of the road and they all stood up in their places before them the red glow which hung over the city was almost lurid strange volumes of smoke were rising to the sky  rioters selingman muttered  julia looked around with a little shiver there were no trains running and a great many of the shops were closed some of the people lounging about in the streets had the air of holiday makers little bands of men were marching arm in arm shouting occasionally one of them picked up a stone and threw it through a shop window they had not seen a policeman for miles  it is the beginning of the end maraton said slowly the only pity is that one must see it at all  julia pointed down the road  what is that she asked  a long greylooking line was slowly unwinding itself into the level road it came into sight like a serpent it reached as far as the eye could see from somewhere behind they heard the sound of music  soldiers maraton repliedmarching too  they moved the car over to the other side of the road presently a mounted officer galloped on ahead and rode up to them  your name and address please  maraton hesitated  why do you ask for it he demanded  i am sorry to inform you that your car must be surrendered at once was the reply i hope we shall not inconvenience you very much but those are the general orders every motor car is to be commandeered sorry for the lady give me your name and address please at once the cost price of your car and how long it has been in your possession  selingman gasped  is the country at war he asked we have come from south wales today we heard nothing en route  there are no newspapers being issued the officer told them the telegraph is abandoned to the government and also the telephone even we have no idea what is happening we are trying to run a few trains through to the north but we have had a couple of hundred men killed already they are to start again the other side of romford in the meantime i am sorry but i am bound to take possession of your car at once  my name is selingman  the officer looked at him curiously  are you henry selingman he enquiredi mean the fellow who has been writing about maraton  selingman nodded  then i am afraid i cant say i do feel so sorry to inconvenience you the officer continued grimly alight at once if you pleaseall of you  but how are we to get into london selingman protested  walk the officer replied promptly be thankful if you reach there at all and keep to the main streets especially if the lady is going with you  are there no police left maraton demanded  we drafted most of them away to the riot centres then the train service ceased too and they havent been able to come back now we have had an alarm from somewherei dont know where and weve got orders to push troops towards the east coast if youll take my advice mr selingman the officer concluded youll keep your name to yourself for a little time people whove been associated in any way with maraton are not too popular just now around here  some more officers had ridden up two were already in the car soon it vanished in a cloud of dust on its way back julia selingman aaron and maraton were left in the road along which the soldiers were still marching they started out to walk now and then a motorcar rattled by full of soldiers but for the most part the streets were almost empty no one spoke to them or attempted to molest them in any way as they drew nearer london however the streets became more and more crowded men in the middle of the road were addressing little knots of listeners there was a complete row of shops the plateglass windows of which had been knocked in and the contents raided they pushed steadily onwards here and there little groups of loiterers assumed a threatening aspect they came across the dead body of a man lying upon the pavement no one seemed to mind very few of the passersby even glanced at him selingman shivered  ghastly he muttered this reminds me of the first days of the french troubles how quiet the people keep they are tired of robbing for money it is food they want a sandwich just now would be a dangerous possession  they reached algate there were still no trains running and nearly all the houses were tightly shuttered  six weeks maraton murmured to himself as he looked around could any one believe that this might happen in six weeks  why not selingman demanded you stop the arteries of life when you stop all communication from centre to centre its the most merciful way after all everything will be over the sooner  they passed down threadneedle street a wilderness with boards nailed up in front of the great bank windows a little further on there was the usual crowd of people but they were all hanging about uncertain what to do there was no stock exchange business being transacted simply because there were no buyers at the mansion house they found a few buses running and managed to board one which was going westwards it set them down in new oxford street not far from russell square here there were denser crowds than ever the entrance to the square itself was almost blocked  whats going on here maraton asked a loiterer  they heard a loud hoarse yell repeated several times the man pointed with his finger  they are round maratons house he answered they have broken in all his windows hes not there or theyd have had him out and flayed him alive  a brief silence ensued there seemed something ominous in this message delivered apparently from one typical of his class a worker out of work a pipe in his mouth a generally aimless air about his movements  but forgive me selingman remarked i am a stranger in this country i have been told that maraton is a friend of the people  the man nodded gloomily  theres plenty that calls him so in other parts of the country he assented i belong to a working mans club and what we cant see is whats the bally use of a job like this hes bitten off more than he can chewthats what maratons done hes stopped the railways and the coal and even you can tell what that means i suppose sir pretty well every factory in the country is shutting down or has shut down well supposing the government make terms which they say they cant the miners and railway men may get a bit more what about all the rest of us were more likely to get a bit less then what if the germans get over here theres all sorts of rumours about this morning they say that threequarters of the fleet is hung up for want of coal    my look there theyve fired his house i wouldnt be in his shoes for something they say hes hiding up in northumberland  the man passed on maraton was the first to speak  come he said quietly there is nothing here to be discouraged at we knew very well that for the first few monthsyears perhapsthis thing had to be faced we must get rooms somewhere i have to meet the railway men tonight young ernshaw rode up from derby on a motorcycle to make the appointment as for you selingman maraton went on as they turned back towards new oxford street why do you stay here your coming has been splendid it has been a joy to have you near but between ourselves he added lowering his voice you know what mobs are take my advice and get back home for a time we shall meet again  selingman shook his head  i helped to light the torch he declared ill see it burn for a while i was in paris through the last riotsa dirty sight it was youll pull through this maybe were better apart for a time but well see one another housed first he added i want to know where you all are  there was no difficulty about shelter of a sort the private hotels which were plentiful in the neighbourhood were half empty and supplied rooms readily enough although they were curiously apathetic about the matter at each one of them the charges for food were enormous maraton divided a bundle of notes into half and made aaron take one portion  look after julia he directed and i think youd better keep away from me a good many of them knew that you were my secretary look after your sister keep quiet for a time wait  he tore a sheet of paper from his pocketbook wrote a few lines upon it and twisted it up  you will find an address in new york there he said if anything happens to me go over and present it in person  aaron took it almost mechanically his eyes scarcely for a second had left his masters face  let me stay here he begged if its only an attic there may be work to be done let me stay sir my little bit of life is of no more account to me than a snap of the fingers dont send me away julias a womanthey wont hurt her she can go back to her old rooms the streets are quite orderly let me stay sir  no one seemed to notice us come in julia pleaded let me stay too you heard what the porter saidwe could choose what rooms we liked it is safer in this part of london than in the east end and you know she added looking at him steadily that if there is trouble to come i have no fear  maraton hesitated perhaps they were as well where they were under shelter he nodded  very well he agreed there seems to be no one to show us about we will go and select rooms  in the hall they passed a man in the livery of the hotel maraton enquired the way to the telephone but he only shook his head  telephone isnt working sir he announced not to private subscribers at any rate they havent answered a call for two days  are any meals being served in the restaurant maraton asked  the man shook his head  not regular meals sir he replied what food weve got is all locked up you can get something between eight and nine we close the hotel doors then  they tell me i can select any room i like upstairs that isnt occupied maraton remarked  the porter nodded  nearly all the servants have gone he explained so they cant try to run the hotel gone out to find food somewhere they couldnt feed them here  is there wine in the place selingman asked  plenty the man answered  if needs be then we will carouse selingman declared first a wash then i will forage leave it to me to forage you others i know the tricks i shall not go away i shall stay here with you  they selected roomsmaraton and selingman adjoining ones on the first floor the others higher up then selingman departed on his expedition and maraton sat down before the window in the sittingroom he drew aside the curtain and stared they had been in the hotel rather less than half an hour but the autumn twilight had deepened rapidly darkness had fallen upon the citya strange unredeemed darkness the street lamps were unlit it was as though a black hand had been laid upon the place only here and there the sky was reddened as though with conflagration maratons head sunk upon his arms these indeed were the days when he would need all his courage he threw open the window there was a curious silence without the roar of traffic had ceased entirely the only sound was the footfall of the people upon the pavement he looked down into the street crowded with little knots of men one or two of them carrying torches he watched them stream by it was the breaking up of the crowd which had gathered together to sack and burn his house   the door was softly opened and closed again he turned half around through the shadows he saw julias pale face as she came swiftly towards him with a sudden gesture she fell on her knees by his side her fingers clasped him she clung to his arm  ah i knew that i should find you like this she cried dont look down into the street dont look at those unlit places look up to the skies see there is a star there already nothing up therenothing which really mattersis altered this is only the destruction that must come before the dawn it was you yourself who prophesied it you yourself who saw it so clearly oh dont be sad because you have pulled down the pillars it isnt so very long before the morning  he passed his arm around her and gripped her fingers tightly so they were sitting when by and by selingman burst into the room    chapter xxxv  selingman was once more entirely his old self he staggered into the room with a tin of biscuits under one arm and three bottles of hock under the other all of which he deposited noisily upon the round table in the middle of the room  i am the prince of caterers he declared i surpass myself come out of the shadows you dreamer there is work to be done food to be eaten wine to be drunk  from his lefthand pocket he produced three candles which he placed at intervals along the mantelpiece and lit then for the first time he saw julia  ah he cried our inspiration congratulate yourself dear miss julia after all you are going to dine or sup or whatever meal you may choose to call it behold  from his other pocket he produced two great jars of potted meat a jar of jam a handful of miscellaneous knives and forks and a corkscrew  i have found an intelligent person here he confided to them he has shown me the way to the wine cellar only the landlord and he are permitted to fetch wine they fear a raid niersteiner of a reasonable vintage  i will fetch aaron julia said as she left the room  the girl worships you and youre a beast to her selingman exclaimed his eyes fixed upon the door through which she had vanished a man indeed a creature of wood and sawdust listen  his hand flashed out his hand which grasped still the corkscrew  listen you man from the clouds he continued i shall rob you of her i adore her today she may think me merely fat and eccentric dont rely upon that i have the gift when i choose i can tell fairy tales i can creep a little way into her mind and fill her brain with delicate fancies build images there and destroy them play softly upon the keynote of her emotions until one day she will wake up and what will have happened she will be mine  he banged the table with the bottle of wine he was holding then with great care and accuracy he drew the cork  your health he cried raising his glass ah no i have not sipped the wine i change the toast to julia  maraton rose to his feet and turned his back upon the gloomy darkness which brooded over the city he took the glass of wine which selingman was holding out and leaned towards him earnestly  my friend he said it seems strange to me that we speak of these things at such an hour yet let me tell you something i dont know why i want to tell you but i do i am not perhaps quite what you think me only the night you and i went north together the gates of that world which you speak of so easily were closed behind me  it was the other woman selingman exclaimed  it was the other woman maraton echoed  selingman set down the bottle upon the table two great tears rolled down from his blue eyes he held out both his hands and gripped maratons  my friend he said now indeed i love you we are twin souls you too are human as you are wonderful you see what an old woman i am this sentimentoh it will be the end of me but tell mei must know it was because you went north that it was ended  maraton nodded slowly  i chose the opposite camp he answered what could i do  nature selingman declared brandishing a great silk handkerchief is the queerest mistress who ever played pranks with us here in the same camp dwells a divinity and youyou must peer down into the lower world    never mind potted meat and hock are good julia he added turning his head at the sound of the opening door to genius in adversity all gentle familiarities are permitted i grant myself the privilege of your christian name come and grace our feast i have found food and wine i am your selfappointed caterer there is no butter but that is simply one of those pleasant tests for us a test of will and fortitude all my life until tonight i have loved butter from henceforthuntil we can get it againi detest it let us eat drink and be merry where is aaron  he went out into the streets julia replied he will be back presently  aaron came in a few minutes later struggling with the weight of the parcels he was carrying he laid them down upon the sideboard and turned towards maraton with an air of triumph  ive been there sir he announced ive got the letters your private dispatch box and a lot of papers we needed its only the outside walls of the house that are charred the fire was put out almost at once and ive seen ernshaw  maratons eyes were lit with pleasure  youre a fine fellow aaron he commended  ive got my bicycle too aaron continued i can get half over london if necessary while you stay here  tell me about ernshaw maraton begged quickly  hes loyalthey all are aaron cried oh you should hear him talk about peter dale and graveling and that lot theyre spread up north now all of them trying to kill the strike and the men wont move anywhere his own miners wouldnt listen to dale mr foley sent him up to newcastle in his motorcar they played a garden hose on him and burned an effigy of himself dressed in old womans clothes mr foleys had the railway men to downing street twice but theyve never wavered ernshaw is splendid there are seven of them and ernshaws own words were that theyve made up their minds that grass could grow in the tracks and hell fires scorch up the land before theyd go back to slavery theyre for you sir body and soul they wont give in  thank god maraton muttered what about the mob  loafers and wastrels aaron exclaimed indignantly dirty parasites of humanity thieves not an honest worker amongst them theyre the sort who shouted themselves hoarse on mafeking night and hid in their holes when the war drums were calling the authorities got a hundred police from somewhere and they crumbled away like rats running for their holes ernshaw asks you not to go back to russell square because of the difficulty of getting at you but this was his message to you sir when i told him of your arrival he begged me to tell you that they were the scum of the earth that from newcastle to the thames the men who stand idle today wait in faith and trust for your word and yours only he will be here before long  selingman nodded ponderously his mouth was very full but he did not delay his speech  you have brought a splendid message young man he pronounced sit down and eat with us exercise your imagination but a little and you will indeed believe that you have been bidden to a feast of lucullus has any one i wonder ever appreciated the marvellous and yet subtle sympathy which can exist between potted meat and biscuitsespecially when washed down with hock join us my young friend aaron abandon yourself with us to the pleasure of the table we will discuss any subject upon the earthexcept butter miss julia do you know where i shall go when i leave here no i go to seek chocolates and flowers for you  she laughed gaily  chocolates and flowers she repeated at ten oclock at night and for me too  and why not for you selingman demanded almost indignantly you are like all enthusiasts of your sex you are too intense you concentrate too much you have lived in a cold and austere atmosphere you have waited a long time for the hand which is to lead you into the sunshine  she laughed at him once more yet perhaps this time a little wistfully  very well she promised i will reform i will eat all the chocolates you can bring me and i will sleep with your flowers at my bedside there am i improving  selingman rose to his feet he drained his glass of wine and lit one of his long black cigars by the flame of the candle  dear julia he said you have spoken i start on the quest of my life    chapter xxxvi  selingman had scarcely left the place when ernshaw arrived piloted into the room by aaron who had been waiting for him below maraton and he gripped hands heartily during the first few days of the campaign they had been constant companions  at least he declared as he looked into maratons face whatever the world may think of the justice of their cause no one will ever any longer deny the might of the people  none but fools ever did deny it maraton answered  how are they in the north ernshaw asked  united and confident maraton assured him up there i dont think they realise the position so much as here in nottingham and leicester people are leading their usual daily lives it was only as we neared london that one began to understand  london is paralysed with fear ernshaw asserted perhaps with reason the government are working the telephones and telegraph to a very small extent the army engineers are doing the best they can with the east coast railways  what about dale and his friends  ernshaws dark sallow face was lit with triumph  they are flustered to death like a lot of rabbits in the middle of a cornfield with the reapers at work he exclaimed heckled and terrified to death cecil was at them the other night are you not he cried the representatives of the people wilmott was in the houseone of ustreasurer for the amalgamated society and while dale was hesitating he sprang up before god no he answered there isnt a labour member in this house who stands for more than the constituency he represents or is here for more than the salary he draws the cause of the people is in safer hands then they called for you there have been questions about your whereabouts every day they wanted to impeach you for high treason through all the storm foley is the only man who has kept quiet he sent for me i referred him to you  the time for conferences is past maraton said firmly  we know it ernshaw replied whats the good of them a sop for the men a pat on the back for their leaders a buttering press and a public who cares only how much or how little they are inconvenienced we have had enough of that my men must wake into a new life or sleep for ever  what is the foreign news maraton asked  all uncertain the air is full of rumours several atlantic liners are late and reports have come by wireless of a number of strange cruisers off queenstown personally i dont think that anything definite has been done the moment to strike isnt yet the admiralty have been working like slaves to get coal to their fleet  you came alone maraton enquired  ernshaw nodded  i came alone because the seven of us are as men with one heart we are with you into hell  and the men maraton continuedi wonder how many of them realise what they may have to go through  you stirred something up in them ernshaw said slowly something they have never felt before you made them feel that they have the right of nature to live a dignified life and to enjoy a certain share of the profits of their labour not as a grudgingly given wage but as a lawestablished right theres a feeling born in them thats newits done them good already i never heard so little grumbling at the pay i think its in their heart that theyre fighting for a principle this time and not for an extra coin dragged from the unwilling pockets of men who have no human right to be the janitors of what their labour produces theyve got the proper feeling at last sir youve touched something which is as near the religious sense as anything a man can feel who has no call that way its something that will last too their womenkind have laid hold of it when they start life again they mean to start on a different plane  how are the accounts lasting out maraton asked  ernshaw produced some books from his pocket and they sat down at the table  were not so badly off for money he declared its the purchasing power of it thats making things difficult i have spread the people out as much as i can its the best chance but next week will be a black one  they pored over the figures for a time outside the streets were almost as silent as death suddenly the door was thrown open and they both looked up hastily selingman stood there but selingman transformed all the colour seemed to have left his cheeks his eyes were burning with a steely fire he closed the door behind him and he shivered where he stood maraton sprang to his feet  what in gods name has happened man he cried quick  selingman came a little further into the room he raised his hands above his head his voice was thick with horror  i have betrayed you he moaned i have betrayed the people  he stood there still trembling maraton poured him out wine but he swept it away  no more of those things for me he continued listen to my tale if there is a god may he hear me by every line i have written by every world of fancy into which i have been led by every particle of what nations have called my genius i swear that i speak the truth  i believe you maraton said go on tell me quickly  i trusted maxendorf selingman proceeded his voice shaking trusted and loved him as a brother i have been his tool and his dupe  maraton felt himself suddenly at the edge of the world he leaned over and looked into the abyss called hell for a moment he shivered then he set his teeth  go on he repeated  maxendorf and i have spoken many times of the future of this country the dream which he outlined for you he has spoken of to me with glittering eyes with heaving chest with trembling voice it was his scheme that i should take you to him you too believed as i did tonight i visited him i stepped in upon the one weak moment of his life he needed a confidant he was bursting with joy and triumph he showed me his heart he showed me the great and terrible hatred which burns there for england and everything english the peoples man he calls himself he is for the people of his own country and his own country only you and i have been the tools of his crafty schemes this country if he possesses it he will occupy as a conqueror he will set his heel upon it he will demand the greatest indemnity of all times and every penny of it will flow into his beloved land we thought that the dawn had come we poor miserable and deluded victims of his craft we are dooming the people of this country to generations of slavery  maraton for a moment sat quite still when he spoke his tone was singularly matteroffact  where is maxendorf he asked  still at the hotel the embassy was not ready and he has made excuses he is more his own master there  maraton turned to ernshaw  ernshaw he begged wait here for me wait  he took up his hat and left the room selingman stood almost as though he were praying  now he muttered is the time for the strong man    chapter xxxvii  into the salon of maxendorfs suite at the ritz hotel freed for a moment from its constant stream of callers came suddenly without announcementfrom a place of hiding indeedmaraton he stepped into the room swiftly and closed the door maxendorf was standing with his back to his visitor bending over a map  whos that he asked without looking up you franz you beldeman  there was no reply maxendorf straightened his gaunt figure and turned around he stood there motionless the palm of one hand covering the map at which he had been gazing the lamplight shining on his gaunt strangely freckled face  you he muttered  maraton remained still speechless maxendorf stretched out his hand for the telephone but before he could grasp it his hand was struck into the air he wasted no time asking useless questions his visitors face was enough  what have you to gain by this he demanded even if you could take my life it will alter nothing  maraton caught him fiercely by the throat maxendorf notwithstanding his superior height was powerless he was forced slowly backwards across the couch on to the floor maraton knelt by his side his grasp was never for a second relaxed  i leave you tonight maraton whispered with a gasp or two of life in you but remember this if i fail to undo your work as sure as i live i will keep my word my hand shall find your throat againyour throat do you hearand shall hold you there tighter and tighter until the life slips out of your body just as it is almost slipping now  maxendorf was unconscious maraton suddenly threw him away then he left the room rang for the lift and made his way once more out into the street piccadilly was a shadowy wilderness st jamess street was thronged with soldiers marching into the park maraton pursued his way steadily into pall mall and downing street even here there were very few people and the front of mr foleys house was almost deserted save for one or two curious loiterers and a couple of policemen maraton rang the bell and found no trouble in obtaining admittance the butler however shook his head when asked if mr foley was at home  mr foley is at the war office sir he announced we cannot tell what time to expect him  i shall wait maraton replied my business is of urgent importance  the butler made no difficulty he recognised maraton as a guest of the house and he showed him into the smaller library which was generally used as a waitingroom for more important visitors it was the room in which maraton had had his first conversation with mr foley he looked around him with faint half painful curiosity if was like a place which he had known well in some other life it seemed impossible to believe that he was the same man or that this was the same room yet it was barely four months ago too restless to sit still he walked up and down the apartment with quick unsteady footsteps then suddenly the door opened elisabeth appeared she recognised maraton and started she looked at him with a fixed incredulous stare  you she exclaimed you here what do you want  your uncle he answered how long will he be  she closed the door behind her with trembling fingers then she came further into the room and confronted him  why are you here she demanded to gloat over your work  to undo it if i can he replied quicklya part of it at any rate i fell into a trapselingman and i ive a way out if theres time i want your uncle  you mean it she begged feverishly her face lightening oh dont raise our hopes again just to disappoint us  i mean it he reiterated i want your uncle with his help if he has the courage if he dare face the inevitable ill break the railway strike tonight and the coal strike tomorrow  she sat down suddenly she too had changed during the last few months her face was thinner there were lines under her eyes she had lost something of the fresh delicate splendour of youth which had made her seem so dazzling  i cant believe that you are in earnest she faltered  there isnt any doubt about it he assured her send round and hurry your uncle  she moved to the writingtable and wrote a few lines hastily then she rang the bell and gave them to a servant she was still without a vestige of colour  i cant dare to feel hopeful she observed gloomily when the door had been closed and they were once more alone we trusted you before we believed that everything would be well you were brutal to us bothto me as well as to my uncle  i made no promises he reminded her i broke no ties i was a peoples man i still am i took the course i thought best i thought i saw a way to real freedom  it was maxendorf she exclaimed under her breath  he nodded  maxendorf was too clever for me he confessed perhaps just at this moment he is a little sorry for it  what do you mean she asked hastily  maraton shrugged his shoulders  oh hes aliveonly just though i shook the life nearly out of him he knows that if we fail within these next twentyfour hours your uncle and i i am going to take whats left i promised him that  her eyes glowed  you are a strange person she declared how did you come to see the truthto know that you had been misled by maxendorf  it was selingman who told me he explained selingman too was deceived but selingman was nearer to him he discovered the truth and he came to me it was a matter of two hours ago i made my way first to maxendorf i remembered my promise i waited about in the corridors outside his room until i saw an opportunity then i slipped in and took him by the throat oh hes alive but not very much alive tonight  tell me about your wonderful journey north she begged  he shook his head  just at present it is like a nightmare he replied we went from place to place and i preached the new salvation i told them to trust in me and i would lead them to the light i believed it though the way i knew must be strewn with difficulties though there were great risks and much suffering i believed it i saw the dawn of the millennium i made them believe that i saw it they placed their trust in me i have led them to the brink of god knows what  you have led them to the brink of war she said gravely we wait for its declaration every hour my uncle and i they know our plight they are waiting for the exactly correct minute  they may wait a day too long maraton muttered for myself i believe that they have already waited a day too long maxendorf was too certain he never dreamed that i might learn the truth listen  a car stopped outside they heard the sound of footsteps in the hall the door was quickly opened mr foley stood there he was looking very grave and white but his eyes flashed at the sight of maraton  you he exclaimed  he gave his coat and hat to the servant then he closed the door behind him he remained standinghe offered no form of greeting to his unexpected visitor  what do you want he demanded why have you come to me  to give you your chance maraton replied with swift emphasis you are the only statesman i know who would have courage to accept it dare you  mr foley remained speechless he stood perfectly still with folded arms  this isnt an hour for recriminations maraton continued i have played into maxendorfs handsi admit it theres time to checkmate him ill free every railroad in the country tomorrow and the coalpits next day with your help  i have forced your delegates to come to me mr foley answered to all my offers they have but one reply they await your word they are not seeking for terms  accept mine maraton begged and i swear to you that they shall consent mind it isnt a small thing but its salvation and its the only salvation  go on mr foley commanded  pledge your word maraton proceeded deliberately pledge me your word that next session you will nationalise the railways on the basis of three per cent for capital a minimum wage of two pounds ten a maximum salary of eight hundred pounds contracts to be pro rata if profits are not earned pledge me that and the railway strike is over  its socialism elisabeth gasped  its common sense mr foley declared i accept what about the coal  you dont need to ask me that maraton replied swiftly our coalfields are the blood and sinews of the country they belong to the government more naturally even than the labourmade railways take them pay your fair price and take them do away with the horde of moneybloated parvenus who fatten and decay on the immoral profits they drag from labour we are at the parting of the ways we wait for the strong man raise your standard and the battle is already won  and you mr foley muttered  i am your man maraton answered  mr foley held out his hand  if you mean it he said gravely well get through yet but are you sure about the othersernshaw and his union men weve tried all human means and ernshaw is like a rock dale and graveling and all the rest have done what they could ernshaw remains outside i thought that i had won the labour party it seems to me when the trouble came that they represented nothing  they dont maraton agreed but ernshaw represents the people and i represent ernshaw he was with me only a little time ago there wont be a labour party any longer it will be a national party and you will make it  i am an old man mr foley murmured slowly but his eyes kindled as he spoke  they both laughed at him  young enough to found a new party maraton insisted young enough to bring the country into safety once more  the atmosphere seemed heavily charged with emotion elisabeths eyes were shining she held out her hands to maraton and he kept them reverently in his  tonight he announced with ernshaws help i start for the north in a few hours we shall have freed the railway lines i leave the press to you mr foley i shall go on to the mines  and i lady elisabeth asked what is my share is there nothing i can do  their eyes met for one long moment  when i return he said quietly i will tell you    chapter xxxviii  from town to town travelling for the most part on the platform of an engine maraton sped on his splendid mission it was ernshaw himself who drove with the help of an assistant but as they passed from place to place the veto was lifted the men in some districts were a little querulous but at maratons coming they were subdued it was peace a peace how splendid they were soon to know by midday trains laden with coal were rushing to several of the channel ports maraton found his task with the miners more difficult and yet in a way his triumph here was still more complete he travelled down the backbone of england preaching peace where war had reigned promising great things in the name of the new government although he had been absent barely fortyeight hours it was a new london into which he travelled on his return the streets were crowded once more with taxicabs the evening papers were being sold the shops were all open the policemen were once more in the streets selingman who had scarcely once left maratons side gazed about him with wonder  it is a miracle this he declared there is no aftermath  the people are waiting maraton said we have given them serious pledges their day is to come  you believe that foley will keep his word selingman asked  i know that he will maraton replied as soon as the bills are drafted he will go to the country it will be a new partythe national party stay and see it selingmana new era in the politics of the world a very wonderful era the country is going to be governed for the people that are worth while  if one could but live long enough selingman sighed all over the universe it comes where was it one read of footsteps that sounded amongst the hills like footsteps upon wool in the nightwatches you can hear those footsteps the world trembles with them  and after all maraton continued the sun of the worlds happiness is made up of the happiness of units presently we shall have time to think of those things  it is true selingman said disconsolately i find myself rejoicing in the good which is coming to humanity and forgetting personal sorrows there is that wonderful that adorable secretary of yourjulia what should you say to me my friend maraton if i were indeed to rob you of her for once i am in earnest  maraton started for a moment the idea at first was ludicrous  i suppose he admitted i should reconcile myself to the inevitable times are going to be different i dare say that aaron will be the only secretary i shall need but will she go remember she is a woman of the people i think that she will never settle down even with your splendid work to control she is less a poet than a humanitarian  what am i man selingman retorted striking himself on the chest but a humanitarian listen to the wonderful proofit is not a secretary i require it is a wife  maraton was staggered  have you told her  what is the use selingman growled she is yours body and soul you have but to lift up your finger and she would follow you to the end of the world i dont idealize women you know maraton and virtue isnt a fetish with me but i know that girl if you hold out your hands she is yours but if you withhold them she is the most virginal creature that ever breathed  she is a splendid character maraton said softly  why dont you marry her yourself selingman asked abruptly how can you look at her hear her speak watch her without wanting to marry her what are you made of  maraton sighed  i am one of the victims i suppose of that curious instinct of selection i care for some one else i have cared for some one else ever since the first night i set foot in england  then ill get her selingman declared in time ill get her  they all dined together at the little restaurant on the borders of soho selingman was the giver of the feast and his spirits were both wonderful and infectious the roar of london was recommencing newspapers were being sold on the streets the strange cruisers seemed mysteriously to have disappeared from the atlantic the fleet imprisoned no longer was on its way to the north sea there was none of the foolish overexuberant rejoicing of bibulous jingoism but a genuine deep spirit of thankfulness abroad men and women were glad but thoughtful there were new times to come great promises had been made there were rumours everywhere of a new political party we pause tonight selingman declared at the end of the first chapter almost i am tempted to linger in this wonderful countryat any rate until the headlines of the next are in type you go down to the house tonight at nine oclock maraton replied glancing at the clock  will they remember selingman continued thoughtfully that you were the samson who pulled down the pillars or will they merely hail you as the deliverer will they think of that ghostly ride of yours on the locomotive i wonder when you tore screaming through the darkness with the risk of a buffer on the line at every mile stepped from the engine grimy with your breath sucked out ofyou by the wind and the roar of the locomotive still throbbing in your earsstepped out to deliver your message to the waiting throngs magnificent a subject worthy of me and my prose i shall write of it maraton i shall sing the glory of it in verse or script when your fame as a politician of the moment has passed you will live because of the garland that i shall weave  maraton sipped his wine thoughtfully  but for your overweening humility selingman he began  selingman struck the table with his fist  it is a night for rejoicings this he thundered i will not have my weaknesses exposed let us for tonight at any rate see the best in each other glance for instance at miss julia admire the exquisite pink of my carnations which she has condescended to wear see how well they become her  i feel like a flower shop julia laughed  and you look like the spirit of the flowers herself selingman declared the wonderful power on the other side of the sun who draws them out of the ground and touches their petals with colour shakes perfume into their blossoms and makes this england of yours in springtime like a beautiful sweetsmelling carpet  dont listen to him julia maraton warned her it was only a month ago that he told me that no civilised man should live in this country because of the women and the beer  a man changes selingman insisted fiercely your beer i will never drink but miss julia knows that she hasnt in the world a slave so abject as i  maraton rose to his feet  i must go he announced i have to talk with mr foley for a few minutes you had better come with me aaron selingman will see julia back  they watched him depart julia sighed as he passed through the door  i can read your thoughts selingman said quickly you are feeling are you not that tonight his leaving us has in it something allegorical he was made for the storms of life to fight in them and rejoice in them and fate has taken him by the hand and is leading him now towards the quieter places  it is not his choice julia murmured it is destiny  cant you look a little way into the future selingman continued peering through halfclosed eyes into his wine glass he represents the only possible link between the only possible political party of this country and the people he will win for them in twelve months what they might have waited for through many weary years he will sit in the high places history will speak well of him i will wager you half a dozen pairs of gloves that within a week the daily oracle will call him the modern rienzi and yet with the end of the struggle with the end of the fierce fighting comes somethingwhat is itdisappointment we have no right to be disappointed and yet somehow one feels that it is the cold and the storm and the wind which keep the best in usthe fighting bestalive  julias eyes were soft for a moment with tears she too was following him a little way into the future  they will make a politician of him she sighed so much the better for politics but there is one thing which i do not think that he will ever forget so long as he lives he will be a peoples man  selingman became curiously silent soon he paid the bill  will you put me in a cab she asked him outside he shook his head  i shall ride home with you  it is rather a long way she reminded him i am down at my old rooms again the house in russell square is full of workmen after the fire it does not matter how far he said simply  his fit of silence continued when at last they arrived at their destination she held out her hand again he shook his head  i am coming in he announced  she hesitated  my rooms are very tiny  i am coming in he repeated  he followed her up the stairs her little sittingroom was in darkness she struck a match and lit the lamp she would have pulled down the blind but he checked her  no he objected let us stand and look down together upon this wilderness so  they were high up and they looked upon a treeless wasterows of houses tall factories the line of the river beyond the murky glow westwards  here i can talk to you he said here it is silent soon i go back to my life and my lifes work you julia must go with me  she drew a little away from him speechless with a queer sort of surprise and a little indignant he held her wrist firmly  i am a man who has written much of love he continued of love and life and all the tangled skein of emotions which make of it a complex thing and yet so few of us know what love is so few of us know what companionship is so few of us know the world in which those others dwell you have looked at me with your great eyes julia and at first you saw nothing but a fat plain old man with plenty of conceit and a humour for idle speeches and today you think a little differently and as the days go on you will think more differently still for i am going to take you with me julia and i am going to keep you with me and i am going to keep the light in your eyes and the laughter at your lips in the only way that counts you will sit with me in my study you shall see my work come and hear it grow i shall take you into the world where the music is born and your eyes will be closed there and you will only know that there is another soul there who is your guide and in whom you trust and for whom you have a strange feeling that is how love comes juliathe only sort of love which lasts it isnt born in this land it doesnt even flourish in this universe if you dont come up in the clouds to find it it isnt the sort that lasts you are going to find it with me dear  she had begun to tremble a little the tears were in her eyes  oh i know he faltered with a break in his own voice but youll leave your sorrows behind in my world   it was midnight when maraton left the house he came out with mr foley and they stood for a moment at the entrance an electric coupé rolled swiftly up  you must come home with me for a minute or two maraton mr foley urged it is on your way  the coupé however was already occupied elisabeth leaned out of the window she held the door open  i am going to take mr maraton back with me she insisted the car is there for you uncle  mr foley smiled  quite right he assented get in maraton i shall be home before you  maraton obeyed and they glided out of the palace yard  i was there all the time elisabeth told him quietly i heard everything i was so glad so proud even your labour members had to come and shake hands with you  i dont think mr dale liked it he remarked smiling they are not bad fellows at heart but theyve got the poison in their systems which seems somehow or other to become part of the equipment of the politicianselfinterest overegotism contraction of interest it makes one almost afraid  she leaned a little towards him  you will not fear anything she whispered confidently tonight as i looked down it seemed to me that as a lookeron i saw more perhaps of the real significance of it all than you who were there it is a new force you know which has come into politics a new party i suppose historians will call tonight the fusion of parties which is going to happen an extraordinary triumph for mr foley perhaps he deserves itin my heart i believe that he doesbut not in the way they would try to make out  his heart is right maraton declared he has wide sympathies and splendid understanding  it is a new chapter which begins tonight she repeated you will have many disappointments to face both of you  but isnt it a glorious fight he exclaimed enthusiastically a great cause at ones back a future filled with magnificent possibilities lady elisabeth he went on you cant imagine what this hour means sometimes i have had moments of horrible depression it is so easy to feel the sorrows of the people in ones heart so easy to stir them into a passionate apprehension of their position and then comes the dull sickening doubt whether after all it had not been better to leave them as they were of what use are wordsthat is what i have felt so often and now there has come the power to do great things for them life couldnt hold anything more splendid  her hand touched his she had withdrawn her glove  you will let me help she begged  he turned towards her then and she saw the light in his face for which she had longed with a little cry her head sank upon his shoulder and his arms closed around her  i am almost jealous of the people she murmured only i want you to teach me to love them and feel for them as you do i want to feel that the same thing in our lives is bringing us always closer together    the end
