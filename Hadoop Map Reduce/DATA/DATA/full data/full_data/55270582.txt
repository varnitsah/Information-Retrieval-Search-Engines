55270582	the double traitor  by e phillips oppenheim  1915       chapter i   the woman leaned across the table towards her companion  my friend she said when we first meti am ashamed considering that i dine alone with you tonight to reflect how short a time agoyou spoke of your removal here from paris very much as though it were a veritable exile i told you then that there might be surprises in store for you this restaurant for instance we both know our paris yet do we lack anything here which you find at the ritz or giros  the young man looked around him appraisingly the two were dining at one of the newest and most fashionable restaurants in berlin the room itself although a little sombre by reason of its oak panelling was relieved from absolute gloom by the lightness and elegance of its furniture and appointments the profusion of flowers and the soft grey carpet so thickly piled that every sound was deadened the delicate strains of music came from an invisible orchestra concealed behind a canopy of palms the headwaiters had the correct clerical air half complacent half dignified among the other diners were many beautiful women in marvellous toilettes a variety of uniforms worn by the officers at different tables gave colour and distinction to a tout ensemble with which even norgate could find no fault  germany has changed very much since i was here as a boy he confessed one has heard of the growing wealth of berlin but i must say that i scarcely expected  he hesitated his companion laughed softly at his embarrassment  do not forget she interrupted that i am austrianaustrian that is to say with much english in my blood what you say about germans does not greatly concern me  of course norgate resumed as he watched the champagne poured into his glass one is too much inclined to form ones conclusions about a nation from the types one meets travelling and you know what the germans have done for monte carlo and the rivieraeven to a lesser extent for paris and rome wherever they have been for the last few years they seem to have left the trail of the nouveaux riches it is not only their clothes but their manners and bearing which affront  the woman leaned her head for a moment against the tips of her slim and beautifully cared for fingers she looked steadfastly across the table at her visàvis  now that you are here she said softly you must forget those things you are a diplomatist and it is for you is it not outwardly at any rate to see only the good of the country in which your work lies  norgate flushed very slightly his companions words had savoured almost of a reproof  you are quite right he admitted i have been here for a month though and you are the first person to whom i have spoken like this and you yourself he pointed out encouraged me did you not when you insisted upon your austroenglish nationality  you must not take me too seriously she begged smiling i spoke foolishly perhaps but only for your good you see mr francis norgate i am just a little interested in you and your career  and i dear baroness he replied smiling across at her am more than a little interested inyou  she unfurled her fan  i believe she sighed that you are going to flirt with me  i should enter into an unequal contest norgate asserted my methods would seem too clumsy because i should be too much in earnest  whatever the truth may be about your methods she declared i rather like them or else i should not be risking my reputation in this still prudish city by dining with you alone and without a chaperon tell me a little about yourself we have met three times is it notonce at the embassy once at the palace and once when you paid me that call how old are you tell me about your people in england and where else you have served besides paris  i am thirty years old he replied i started at bukarest from there i went to rome then i was second attaché at paris and finally as you see here  and your peoplethey are english of course  naturally he answered my mother died when i was quite young and my father when i was at eton i have an estate in hampshire which seems to get on very well without me  and you really care about your profession you have the real feeling for diplomacy  i think there is nothing else like it in the world he assured her  you may well say that she agreed enthusiastically i think you might almost add that there has been no time in the history of europe so fraught with possibilities so fascinating to study as the present  he looked at her keenly it is the first instinct of a young diplomatist to draw in his horns when a beautiful young woman confesses herself interested in his profession  you too think of these things then he remarked  she shrugged her shoulders  but naturally what is there to do for a woman but think we cannot act or rather if we do it is in a very insignificant way we are lookerson at most of the things in life worth doing  i will spare you all the obvious retorts he said if you will tell me why you are gazing into that mirror so earnestly  i was thinking she confessed what a remarkably goodlooking couple we were  he followed the direction of her eyes he himself was of a recognised type his complexion was fair his face cleanshaven and strong almost to ruggedness his mouth was firm his nose thin and straight his grey eyes wellset he was over six feet and rather slim for his height but if his type though attractive enough was in its way ordinary hers was entirely unusual she too was slim but so far from being tall her figure was almost petite her dark brown hair was arranged in perfectly plain braids behind and with a slight fringe in front her complexion was pale her features were almost cameolike in their delicacy and perfection but any suggestion of coldness was dissipated at once by the extraordinary expressiveness of her mouth and the softness of her deep blue eyes norgate looked from the mirror into her face there was a little smile upon his lips but he said nothing  some day she said not in the restaurant here but when we are alone and have time i should so much like to talk with you on really serious matters  there is one serious matter he assured her which i should like to discuss with you now or at any time  she made a little grimace at him  let it be now then she suggested leaning across the table we will leave my sort of serious things for another time i am quite certain that i know where your sort is going to lead us you are going to make love to me  do you mind he asked earnestly  she became suddenly grave  not yet she begged let us talk and live nonsense for a few more weeks you see i really have not known you very long have i and this is a very dangerous city for flirtations at court one has to be so careful and you know i am already considered far too much of a bohemian here i was even given to understand a little time ago by a very great lady that my position was quite precarious  does thatdoes anything matter if  it is not of myself alone that i am thinking everything matters to one in your profession she reminded him pointedly  i believe he exclaimed that you think more of my profession than you do of me  quite impossible she retorted mockingly and yet as i dare say you have already realised it is not only the things you say to our statesmen here and the reports you make which count it is your daily life among the people of the nation to which you are attached the friends you make among them the hospitality you accept and offer which has all the time its subtle significance now i am not sure even that i am a very good companion for you mr francis norgate  you are a very bad one for my peace of mind he assured her  she shook her head you say those things much too glibly she declared i am afraid that you have served a very long apprenticeship  if i have he replied leaning a little across the table it has been an apprenticeship only a probationary period during which one struggles towards the real thing  you think you will know when you have found it she murmured  he drew a little breath his voice even trembled as he answered her i know now he said softly  their heads were almost touching suddenly she drew apart he glanced at her in some surprise conscious of an extraordinary change in her face of the halfuttered exclamation strangled upon her lips he turned his head and followed the direction of her eyes three young men in the uniform of officers had entered the room and stood there as though looking about for a table before them the little company of headwaiters had almost prostrated themselves the manager summoned in breathless haste had made a reverential approach  who are these young men norgate enquired  his companion made no reply her fine silky eyebrows were drawn a little closer together at that moment the tallest of the three newcomers seemed to recognise her he strode at once towards their table norgate glancing up at his approach was simply conscious of the coming of a fair young man of ordinary german type who seemed to be in a remarkably bad temper  so i find you here anna  the baroness rose as though unwillingly to her feet she dropped the slightest of curtseys and resumed her place  your visit is a little unexpected is it not karl she remarked  apparently the young man answered with an unpleasant laugh  he turned and stared at norgate who returned his regard with halfamused halfimpatient indifference the baroness leaned forward eagerly  will you permit me to present mr francis norgate to you karl  norgate who had suddenly recognised the newcomer rose to his feet bowed and remained standing the princes only reply to the introduction was a frown  kindly give me your seat he said imperatively i will conclude your entertainment of the baroness  for a moment there was a dead silence in the background several of the maîtres dhôtel had gathered obsequiously around for some reason or other every one seemed to be looking at norgate as though he were a criminal  isnt your request a little unusual prince he remarked drily  the colour in the young mans face became almost purple  did you hear what i said sir he demanded do you know who i am  perfectly norgate replied a prince who apparently has not learnt how to behave himself in a public place  the young man took a quick step forward norgates fists were clenched and his eyes glittering the baroness stepped between them  mr norgate she said you will please give me your escort home  the princes companions had seized him one by either arm an older man who had been dining in a distant corner of the room and who wore the uniform of an officer of high rank suddenly approached he addressed the prince and they all talked together in excited whispers norgate with calm fingers arranged the cloak around his companion and placed a hundred mark note upon his plate  i will return for my change another evening he said to the dumbfounded waiter if you are ready baroness  they left the restaurant amid an intense hush norgate waited deliberately whilst the door was somewhat unwillingly held open for him by a maître dhôtel but outside the baronesss automobile was summoned at once she placed her fingers upon norgates arm and he felt that she was shivering  please do not take me home she faltered i am so sorryso very sorry  he laughed but why he protested the young fellow behaved like a cub but no one offered him any provocation i should think by this time he is probably heartily ashamed of himself may i come and see you tomorrow  telephone me she begged as she gave him her hand through the window you dont quite understand please telephone to me  she suddenly clutched his hand with both of hers and then fell back out of sight among the cushions norgate remained upon the pavement until the car had disappeared then he looked back once more into the restaurant and strolled across the brilliantlylit street towards the embassy     chapter ii   norgate during his months stay in berlin had already adopted regular habits on the following morning he was called at eight oclock and rode for two hours in the fashionable precincts of the city the latter portion of the time he spent looking in vain for a familiar figure in a green ridinghabit the baroness however did not appear at ten oclock norgate returned to the embassy bathed and breakfasted and a little after eleven made his way round to the business quarters one of his fellowworkers there glanced up and nodded at his arrival  wheres the chief norgate enquired  gone down to the palace the other young man whose name was ansell replied telephoned for the first thing this morning ghastly habit william has of getting up at seven oclock and suddenly remembering that he wants to talk diplomacy the chief will be furious all day now  norgate lit a cigarette and began to open his letters ansell however was in a discoursive mood he swung around from his desk and leaned back in his chair  how can a man he demanded see a question from the same point of view at seven oclock in the morning and seven oclock in the evening absolutely impossible you know thats whats the matter with our versatile friend up yonder he gets all aroused over some scheme or other which comes to him in the dead of night hops out of bed before any one civilised is awake and rings up for ambassadors then at nighttime he becomes normal again and takes everything back the consequence is that this place is a regular diplomatic seesaw settling down in berlin pretty well arent you norgate  very nicely thanks the latter replied  dining alone with the baroness von haase his junior continued a court favourite too never been seen alone before except with her young princeling what honeyed words did you use lothario  oh chuck it norgate interrupted tell me about the baroness von haase she is austrian isnt she  ansell nodded  related to the hapsburgs themselves i believe he said very old family anyhow they say she came to spend a season here because she was a little too goahead for the ladies of vienna i must say that ive never seen her out without a chaperon before except with prince karl they say hed marry hermorganatically of courseif theyd let him and if the lady were willing if you want to know anything more about her go into grays room  norgate looked up from his letters  why grays room how does she come into his department  ansell shook his head  no idea i fancy she is there though  norgate left the room a few minutes later and strolling across the hall of the embassy made his way to an apartment at the back of the house it was plainly furnished there were bars across the window and three immense safes let into the wall an elderly gentleman with goldrimmed spectacles and a very benevolent expression was busy with several books of reference before him seated at a desk he raised his head at norgates entrance  good morning norgate he said  good morning sir norgate replied  anything in my way  norgate shook his head  chiefs gone to the palaceno one knows why i just looked in because i met a woman the other day whom ansell says you know something aboutbaroness von haase  well  is there anything to be told about her norgate asked bluntly i dined with her last night  then i dont think i would again if i were you the other advised there is nothing against her but she is a great friend of certain members of the royal family who are not very well disposed towards us and she is rather a brainy little person they use her a good deal i believe as a means of confidential communication between here and vienna she has been back and forth three or four times lately without any apparent reason  norgate stood with his hands in his pockets frowning slightly  why shes half an englishwoman he remarked  she may be mr gray admitted drily the other halfs austrian all right though i cant tell you anything more about her my dear fellow all i can say is that she is in my book and so long as she is there you know its better for you youngsters to keep away be off now i am decoding a dispatch  norgate retraced his steps to his own room ansell glanced up from a mass of passports as he entered  hows the secret service department this morning he enquired  old gray seems much as usual norgate grumbled one doesnt get much out of him  chief wants you in his room ansell announced hes just come in from the palace looking like nothing on earth  wants me norgate muttered righto  he went to the lookingglass straightened his tie and made his way towards the ambassadors private apartments the latter was alone when he entered seated before his table he was leaning back in his chair however and apparently deep in thought he watched norgate sternly as he crossed the room  good morning sir the latter said  the ambassador nodded  what have you been up to norgate he asked abruptly  nothing at all that i know of sir was the prompt reply  this afternoon the ambassador continued slowly i was to have taken you as you know to the palace to be received by the kaiser at seven oclock this morning i had a message i have just come from the palace the kaiser has given me to understand that your presence in berlin is unwelcome  good god norgate exclaimed  can you offer me any explanation  for a moment norgate was speechless then he recovered himself he forgot altogether his habits of restraint there was an angry note in his tone  its that miserable young cub of a prince karl he exclaimed last night i was dining sir with the baroness von haase at the café de berlin  alone  alone norgate admitted it was not for me to invite a chaperon if the lady did not choose to bring one was it sir as we were finishing dinner the prince came in he made a scene at our table and ordered me to leave  and you the ambassador asked  i simply treated him as i would any other young ass who forgot himself norgate replied indignantly i naturally refused to go and the baroness left the place with me  and you did not expect to hear of this again  i honestly didnt i should have thought for his own sake that the young man would have kept his mouth shut he was hopelessly in the wrong and he behaved like a common young bounder  the ambassador shook his head slowly  mr norgate he said i am very sorry for you but you are under a misapprehension shared by many young men you believe that there is a universal standard of manners and deportment and a universal series of customs for all nations you have our english standard of manners in your mind manners which range from a ploughboy to a king and you seem to take it for granted that these are also subscribed to in other countries in my position i do not wish to say too much but let me tell you that in germany they are not if a prince here chooses to behave like a ploughboy he is right where the ploughboy would be wrong  there was a moments silence norgate was looking a little dazed  then you mean to defend he began  certainly not the ambassador interrupted i am not speaking to you as one of ourselves i am speaking as the representative of england in berlin you are supposed to be studying diplomacy you have been guilty of a colossal blunder you have shown yourself absolutely ignorant of the ideals and customs of the country in which you are it is perfectly correct for young prince karl to behave as you put it like a bounder the people expect it of him he conforms entirely to the standard accepted by the military aristocracy of berlin it is you who have been in the wrongdiplomatically  then you mean sir norgate protested that i should have taken it sitting down  most assuredly you should the ambassador replied unless you were willing to pay the price your only faultyour personal fault i meanthat i can see is that it was a little indiscreet of you to dine alone with a young woman for whom the prince is known to have a foolish passion diplomatically however you have committed every fault possible i am very sorry but i think that you had better report in downing street as soon as possible the train leaves i think at three oclock  norgate for a moment was unable to speak or move he was struggling with a sort of blind fury  this is the end of me then he muttered at last i am to be disgraced because i have come to a city of boors  you are reprimanded and in a sense no doubt punished the ambassador explained calmly because you have come toshall i accept your terma city of boors and fail to adapt yourself the true diplomatist adapts himself wherever he may be my personal sympathies remain with you i will do what i can in my report  norgate had recovered himself  i thank you very much sir he said i shall catch the three oclock train  the ambassador held out his hand the interview had finished he permitted himself to speak differently  i am very sorry indeed norgate that this has happened he declared we all have our trials to bear in this city and you have run up against one of them rather before your time i wish you good luck whatever may happen  norgate clasped his chiefs hand and left the apartment then he made his way to his rooms gave his orders and sent a messenger to secure his seat in the train last of all he went to the telephone he rang up the number which had become already familiar to him almost with reluctance he waited for the reply without any pleasurable anticipations he was filled with a burning sense of resentment a feeling which extended even to the innocent cause of it soon he heard her voice  that is mr norgate is it not  yes he replied i rang up to wish you goodby  goodby but you are going away then  i am sent awaydismissed  he heard her little exclamation of grief its complete genuineness broke down a little the wall of his anger  and it is my fault she exclaimed if only i could do anything will you waitplease wait i will go to the palace myself  his expostulation was almost a shock to her  baroness he replied if i permitted your intervention i could never hold my head up in berlin again in any case i could not stay here the first thing i should do would be to quarrel with that insufferable young cad who insulted us last night i am afraid at the first opportunity i should tell  hush she interrupted oh please hush you must not talk like this even over the telephone cannot you understand that you are not in england  i am beginning to realise he answered gruffly what it means not to be in a free country i am leaving by the three oclock train baroness farewell  but you must not go like this she pleaded come first and see me  no it will only mean more disgrace for you besidesin any case i have decided to go away without seeing you again  her voice was very soft he found himself gripping the pages of the telephone book which hung by his side  but is that kind have i sinned mr francis norgate  of course not he answered keeping his tone level almost indifferent i hope that we shall meet again some day but not in berlin  there was a moments silence he thought even that she had gone away then her reply came back  so be it she murmured not in berlin au revoir     chapter iii   faithful to his insular prejudices norgate on finding that the other seat in his coupé was engaged started out to find the train attendant with a view to changing his place his errand however was in vain the train it seemed was crowded he returned to his compartment to find already installed there one of the most complete and absolute types of germanism he had ever seen a man in a light grey suit the waistcoat of which had apparently abandoned its efforts to compass his girth with a broad pink goodhumoured face beardless and bland flaxen hair streaked here and there with grey was seated in the vacant place he had with him a portmanteau covered with a linen case his boots were a bright shade of yellow his tie was of white satin with a design of lavender flowers a pair of black kid gloves lay by his side he welcomed norgate with the bland broad smile of a fellowpassenger whose one desire it is to make a lifelong friend of his temporary companion  we have the compartment to ourselves is it not so you are english  some queer chance founded upon his illhumour his disgust of germany and all things in it induced norgate to tell a deliberate falsehood  sorry he replied in english i dont speak german  the mans satisfaction was complete  but ii speak the most wonderful english it pleases me always to speak english i like to do so it is practice for me we will talk english together you and i these comic papers they do not amuse and books in the train they make one giddy what i like best is a companion and a bottle of rhine wine  personally norgate confessed gruffly i like to sleep  the other seemed a little taken aback but remained apparently full of the conviction that his overtures could be nothing but acceptable  it is well to sleep he agreed if one has worked hard now i myself am a hard worker my name is selingman i manufacture crockery which i sell in england that is why i speak the english language so wonderful for the last three nights i have been up reading reports of my english customers going through their purchases now it is finished i am well posted i am off to sell crockery in london in manchester in leeds in birmingham i have what the people want they will receive me with open arms some of them even welcome me at their houses thus it is that i look forward to my business trip as a holiday  very pleasant im sure norgate remarked curling himself up in his corner personally i cant see why we cant make our own crockery i get tired of seeing german goods in england  herr selingman was apparently a trifle hurt but his efforts to make himself agreeable were indomitable  if you will he said i can explain why my crockery sells in england where your own fails for one thing then i am cheaper there is a system at my works the like of which is not known in england from the raw material to the finished article i can produce forty per cent cheaper than your makers and mind you that is not because i save in wages it is because of the system in the various departments i do not like to save in wages he went on i like to see my people healthy and strong and happy i like to see them drink beer after work is over and on feast days and sundays i like to see them sit in the gardens and listen to the band and maybe change their beer for a bottle of wine industrially mr englishman ours is a happy country  well i hope you wont think i am rude norgate observed but from the little i have seen of it i call it a beastly country and if you dont mind i am going to sleep  herr selingman sat for several moments with his mouth still open then he gave a little grunt there was not the slightest illhumour in the ejaculation or in his expression he was simply pained  i am sorry if i have talked too much he said i forgot that you perhaps are tired you have met with disappointments maybe i am sorry i will read now and not disturb you  for an hour or so norgate tried in vain to sleep all this time the man opposite turned the pages of his book with the utmost cautiousness moved on tiptoe once to reach down more papers and held out his finger to warn the train attendant who came with some harmless question  the english gentleman norgate heard him whisper is tired let him sleep  soon after five oclock norgate gave it up he rose to his feet stretched himself and was welcomed with a pleasant smile from his companion  you have had a refreshing nap the latter remarked and now is it not so you go to take a cup of english tea  you are quite right norgate admitted better come with me  herr selingman smiled a smile of triumph it was the reward of geniality this he was forming a new friendship  i come with great pleasure he decided only while you drink the tea i drink the coffee or some beer i will see i like best the beer he explained turning sidewise to get out of the door but it is not the best for my figure i have a good conscience and a good digestion and i eat and drink much but it is good to be happy  they made their way down to the restaurant car and seated themselves at a table together  you let me do the ordering herr selingman insisted the man here perhaps does not speak english so you will drink your tea with me sir it is a great pleasure to me to entertain an englishman i make many friends travelling i like to make friends i remember them all and sometimes we meet again kellner some tea for the gentlemanenglish tea with what you call bread and butter so and for me selingman paused for a moment and drew a deep sigh of resignationsome coffee  very kind of you im sure norgate murmured  herr selingman beamed  it is a great pleasure he said but many times i wonder why you englishmen so clever so worldconquering do not take the trouble to make yourselves with the languages of other nations familiar it means but a little study now you perhaps are in business  not exactly norgate replied grimly to tell you the truth at the present moment i have no occupation  no occupation  herr selingman paused in the act of conveying a huge portion of rusk to his mouth and regarded his companion with wonder  so he repeated no occupation well that is what in germany we know nothing of every one must work or must take up the army as a permanent profession you are perhaps one of those englishmen of whom one reads who give up all their time to sport  norgate shook his head  as a matter of fact he said i have worked rather hard during the last five or six years it is only just recently that i have lost my occupation  herr selingmans curiosity was almost childlike in its transparency but norgate found himself unable to gratify it in any case after his denial of any knowledge of the german language he could scarcely lay claim to even the most indirect connection with the diplomatic service  ah well herr selingman declared opportunities will come you have perhaps lost some post well there are others i should not i think be far away from the truth sir if i were to surmise that you had held some sort of an official position  perhaps norgate assented  that is interesting herr selingman continued now with the english of commerce i talk often and i know their views of me and my country but sometimes i have fancied that among your official classes those who are ever so slightly employed in government service there isi do not love the word but i must use ita distrust of germany and her peaceloving propensities  i have met many people norgate admitted who do not look upon germany as a lover of peace  they should come and travel here herr selingman insisted eagerly look out of the windows what do you see factory chimneys furnaces everywhere and further onwhat welltilled lands clean prosperous villages a happy domestic people i tell you that no man in the world is so fond of his wife and children his simple life his simple pleasures as the german  very likely norgate assented but if you look out of the windows continually you will also see that every stationmaster on the line wears a military uniform that every few miles you see barracks these simple peasants you speak of carry themselves with a different air from ours i dont know much about it but i should call it the effect of their military training i know nothing about politics very likely yours is a nation of peaceloving men as a casual observer i should call you more a nation of soldiers  but that herr selingman explained earnestly is for defence only  and your great standing army your wonderful artillery your zeppelins and your navy norgate asked are they for defence only  absolutely and entirely herr selingman declared with a new and ponderous gravity there is nothing the most warlike german desires more fervently than to keep the peace we are strong only because we desire peace peace under which our commerce may grow and our wealth increase  well it seems to me then norgate observed that youve gone to a great deal of expense and taken a great deal of trouble for nothing i dont know much about these things as i told you before but there is no nation in the world who wants to attack germany  herr selingman laid his finger upon his nose  that may be he said yet there are many who look at us with envious eyes i am a good german i know what it is that we want we want peace and to gain peace we need strength and to be strong we arm that is everything it will never be germany who clenches her fist who draws down the black clouds of war over europe it will never be germany i tell you why a war would ruin half of us what of my crockery i sell it all in england believe me young gentleman war exists only in the brains of your sensational novelists it does not come into the world of real purpose  well its very interesting to hear you say so norgate admitted i wish i could wholly agree with you  herr selingman caught him by the sleeve  you are just a little he confided just a little suspicious my young friend you in your little island perhaps it is because you live upon an island you do not expand you have small thoughts you are not great like we in germany not broad not deep but we will talk later of these things i must tell you about our kaiser  norgate opened his lips and closed them again  presently he muttered see you later on  he strolled to his coupé tried in vain to read walked up and down the length of the train smoked a cigarette and returned to his compartment to find herr selingman immersed in the study of many documents  records of my customers and my transactions the latter announced blandly i have a great fondness for detail i know everything i carry with me particulars of everything that is where we germans are so thorough see i place them now all in my bag  he did so and locked it with great care  we go to dinner is it not so he suggested  i suppose we may as well norgate assented indifferently  they found places in the crowded restaurant car the manufacturer of crockery made a highly satisfactory and important meal norgate on the other hand ate little herr selingman shook his head  my young english friend he declared all is not well with you that you turn away from good food come afterwards over a cigar you shall tell me what troubles you have and i will give you sound advice i have a very wide knowledge of life i have a way of seeing the truth and i like to help people  norgate shook his head i am afraid he said that my case is hopeless  presently we will see herr selingman continued rubbing the window with his cuff we are arrived i think at lesel here will board the train one of my agents he will travel with us to the next station it is my way of doing business this it is better than alighting and wasting a day in a small town you will not mind perhaps he added if i bring him into the carriage and talk you do not understand german so it will not weary you  certainly not norgate replied i shall probably drop off to sleep  he will be in the train for less than an hour herr selingman explained but i have many competitors and i like to talk in private in here some one might overhear  how do you know that i am not an english crockery manufacturer norgate remarked  herr selingman laughed heartily his stomach shook and tears rolled down his eyes  that is good he exclaimed an english crockery manufacturer no i do not think so i cannot see you with your sleeves turned up walking amongst the kilns i cannot see you even studying the designs for pots and basins  well bring your man in whenever you want to norgate invited as he turned away i can promise at least that i shall not understand what you are saying and that i wont sneak your designs  there was a queer little smile on herr selingmans broad face it almost seemed as though he had discovered some hidden though unsuspected meaning in the others words     chapter iv   norgate dozed fitfully as the train sped on through the darkness he woke once to find herr selingman in close confabulation with his agent on the opposite side of the compartment they had a notebook before them and several papers spread out upon the seat norgate who was really weary closed his eyes again and it seemed to him that he dreamed for a few moments then suddenly he found himself wideawake although he remained motionless the words which selingman had spoken to his companion were throbbing in his ears  i do not doubt your industry meyer but it is your discretion which is sometimes at fault these plans of the forts of liègethey might as well be published in a magazine we had them when they were made we have received copies of every alteration we know to a metre how far the guns will carry how many men are required to man them what stocks of ammunition are close at hand understand therefore my friend that the sight of these carefully traced plans which you hint to have obtained at the risk of your life excites me not at all  the other mans reply was inaudible in a moment or two selingman spoke again  the information which i am lacking just at present in your sphere of operations is civilian in character take ghent for instance what i should like here what our records need at present is a list of the principal inhabitants with their approximate income and summarising it all the rateable value of the city with these bases it would be easy to fix a reasonable indemnity  norgate was wideawake now he was curled up on his seat underneath his rug and though his eyelids had quivered with a momentary excitement he was careful to remain as near as possible motionless again selingmans agent spoke this time more distinctly  the young man opposite he whispered he is english surely  he is english indeed selingman admitted but he speaks no german that i have ascertained give me your best attention meyer here is again an important commission for you within the next few days hire an automobile and visit the rising country eastwards from antwerp at some spot between six and eight miles from the city on a slight incline and commanding the river scheldt we desire to purchase an acre of land for the erection of a factory you can say that we have purchased the concession for making an american safety razor the land is wanted and urgently see to this yourself and send plans and price to me in london on my return i shall call and inspect the sites and close the bargain  and the antwerp forts  the other pursed his lips  pooh was it not the glorious firm of krupp who fitted the guns there do you think the men who undertook that task were idle i tell you that our plans of the antwerp fortifications are more carefully worked out in detail than the plans held by the belgians themselves here is good work for you to do friend meyer that and the particulars from brussels which you know of will keep you busy until we meet again  herr selingman began to collect his papers but was suddenly thrown back into his seat by the rocking of the train which came a few moments later to a standstill the sound of the opening of windows from the other side of the corridor was heard all down the train selingman and his companion followed the general example opening the door of the carriage and the window opposite a draught blew through the compartment one of the small folded slips of paper from selingmans pocketbook fluttered along the seat it came within reach of norgate cautiously he stretched out his fingers and gripped it in a moment it was in his pocket he sat up in his place selingman had turned around  anything the matter norgate asked sleepily  not that one can gather selingman replied you have slept well i am glad that our conversation has not disturbed you this is my agent from brusselsmr meyer he sells our crockery in that citynot so much as he should sell perhaps but still he does his best  mr meyer was a dark little man who wore goldrimmed spectacles neat clothes and a timid smile norgate nodded to him goodhumouredly  you should get herr selingman to come oftener and help you he remarked yawning i can imagine that he would be able to sell anything he tried to  it is what i often tell him sir mr meyer replied but he is too fond of the english trade  english money is no better than belgian herr selingman declared but there is more of it let us go round to the restaurant car and drink a bottle of wine together while the beds are prepared  certainly norgate assented stretching himself bytheby you had better look after your papers there herr selingman just as i woke up i saw a small slip fluttering along the seat you made a most infernal draught by opening that door and i almost fancy it went out of the window  herr selingmans face became suddenly grave he went through the papers one by one and finally locked them up in his bag  nothing missing i hope norgate asked  herr selingmans face was troubled  i am not sure he said it is my belief that i had with me here a list of my agents in england i cannot find it in a sense it is unimportant yet if a rival firm should obtain possession of it there might be trouble  norgate looked out into the night and smiled  considering that it is blowing half a hurricane and commencing to rain he remarked the slip of paper which i saw blowing about will be of no use to any one when it is picked up  they called the attendant and ordered him to prepare the sleeping berths then they made their way down to the buffet car and herr selingman ordered a bottle of wine  we will drink he proposed to our three countries in our way we represent i think the industrial forces of the worldbelgium england and germany we are the three countries who stand for commerce and peace we will drink prosperity to ourselves and to each other  norgate threw off with apparent effort his sleepiness  what you have said about our three countries is very true he remarked perhaps as you mr meyer are a belgian and you mr selingman know belgium well and have connections with it you can tell me one thing which has always puzzled me why is it that belgium which is as you say a commercial and peaceloving country whose neutrality is absolutely guaranteed by three of the greatest powers in europe should find it necessary to have spent such large sums upon fortifications  in which direction do you mean selingman asked his eyes narrowing a little as he looked across at norgate  the forts of liege and namur norgate replied and antwerp i know nothing more about it than i gathered from an article which i read not long ago in a magazine i had always looked upon belgium as being outside the pale of possible warfare yet according to this article it seems to be bristling to the teeth with armaments  herr selingman cleared his throat  i will tell you the reason he said you have come to the right man to know i am a civilian but there are few things in connection with my country which i do not understand mr meyer here who is a citizen of brussels will bear me out it is the book of a clever intelligent but misguided german writer which has been responsible for belgiums unrestbernhardis germany and the next warthat and articles of a similar tenor which preceded it  never read any of them norgate remarked  it was erroneously supposed selingman continued that bernhardi represented the dominant military opinion of germany when he wrote that if germany ever again invaded france it would be notwithstanding her guarantees of neutrality through belgium bernhardi was a clever writer but he was a soldier and soldiers do not understand the world policy of a great nation such as germany germany will make no war upon any one save commercially she will never again invade france except under the bitterest provocation and if ever she should be driven to defend herself it will assuredly not be at the expense of her broken pledges the forts of belgium might just as well be converted into appleorchards they stand there today as the proof of a certain lack of faith in germany on the part of belgium ministered to by that king of the jingoes as you would say in english bernhardi how often it is that a nation suffers most from her own patriots  herr selingman has expressed the situation admirably mr meyer declared approvingly  very interesting im sure norgate murmured there is one thing about you foreigners he added with an envious sigh the way you all speak the languages of other countries is wonderful are you a belgian mr meyer  half belgian and half french  but you speak english almost without accent norgate remarked  in commerce herr selingman insisted that is necessary all my agents speak four languages  you deserve to capture our trade norgate sighed  to a certain extent my young friend selingman declared we mean to do it we are doing it and yet there is enough for us both there is trade enough for your millions and for mine so long as germany and england remain friends they can divide the commerce of the world between them it is our greatest happiness we who have a business relying upon the goodwill of the two nations to think that year by year the clouds of discord are rolling away from between us young sir as a german citizen i will drink a toast with you an english one i drink to everlasting peace between my country and yours  norgate drained his glass selingman threw back his head as he followed suit and smacked his lips appreciatively  and now the former remarked rising to his feet i think ill go and turn in i dare say you two still have some business to talk about especially if mr meyer is leaving us shortly  norgate made his way back to his compartment undressed leisurely and climbed into the upper bunk for an hour or two he indulged in the fitful slumber usually engendered by night travelling at the frontier he sat up and answered the stereotyped questions herr selingman in skyblue pyjamas and with face looking more beaming and florid than ever poked his head cheerfully out of the lower bunk  awake he enquired  very much so norgate yawned  i have a surprise herr selingman announced wait  almost as he spoke an attendant arrived from the buffet car with some sodawater herr selingmans head vanished for a moment or two when he reappeared he held two glasses in his hand  a whisky soda made in real english fashion he proclaimed triumphantly a good nightcap is it not now we are off again  norgate held out his hand for the tumbler  awfully good of you he murmured  i myself selingman continued seated on the edge of the bunk with his legs far apart to steady himself i myself enjoy a whisky soda it will be indeed a nightcap so here goes  he drained his glass and set it down norgate followed suit selingmans hand came up for the tumbler and norgate was conscious of a curious mixture of sensations which he had once experienced before in the dentists chair he could see selingman distinctly and he fancied that he was watching him closely but the rest of the carriage had become chaos the sound of the locomotive was beating hard upon the drums of his ears his head fell back  it was broad daylight when he awoke selingman fully dressed and looking more beaming than ever was seated upon a ridiculously inadequate campstool upon the floor smoking a cigarette norgate stared at him stupidly  my young friend herr selingman declared impressively if there is one thing in the world i envy you it is that capacity for sleep you all have it you english your heads touch the pillow and off you go do you know that the man is waiting for you to take your coffee  norgate lay quite still for several moments beyond a slight headache he was feeling as usual he leaned over the side of the bunk  how many whiskies and soda did i have last night he asked  herr selingman smiled  but one only he announced there was only one to be had i found a little whisky in my flask i remembered that i had an english travelling companion and i sent for some sodawater you drank yours and you did sleep i go now and sit in the corridor while you dress  norgate swung round in his bunk and slipped to the floor  jolly good of you he muttered sleepily but it was very strong whisky     chapter v   there was a babel of voices as the long train came to a standstill in the harbour station at ostend selingman with characteristic forcefulness pushed his way down the narrow corridor driving before him passengers of less weight and pertinacity until finally he descended on to the platform itself norgate who had followed meekly in his wake stood listening for a moment to the confused stream of explanations he understood well enough what had happened but with selingman at his elbow he assumed an air of noncomprehension  it is extraordinary the latter exclaimed never do i choose this route but i am visited with some mishap you hear what has happened  fellows trying to tell me norgate replied but his flemish is worse to understand than german  the steamer selingman announced has met with an accident entering the harbour there will be a delay of at least six hourspossibly more it is most annoying my appointments in london have been fixed for days  bad luck norgate murmured  you do not seem much distressed  why should i be i really came this way because i was not sure whether i would not stay here for a few days  that is all very well for you selingman declared as they followed their porters into the shed for me i am a man of affairs it is different my business goes by clockwork all is regulated by rule with precision with punctuality now i shall be many hours behind my schedule i shall be compelled to alter my appointmentsi who pride myself always upon altering nothing but behold one must make the best of things what a sunshine what a sea we shall meet without a doubt upon the plage i have friends here i must seek them au revoir my young travelling companion to the good fortune  they drifted apart and norgate having made arrangements about his luggage strolled through the town and on to the promenade it was early for the full season at ostend but the sands were already crowded with an immense throng of children and holidaymakers the hotels were all open and streams of people were passing back and forth along the front norgate who had no wish to meet acquaintances passed the first period of his enforced wait a little wearily he took a taxicab and drove as far as knocke here he strolled across the links and threw himself down finally amongst a little wave of sandy hillocks close to the sea the silence and some remains of the sleepiness of the previous night soon began to have their natural effect he closed his eyes and began to doze when he awoke curiously enough it was a familiar voice which first fell upon his ears he turned his head cautiously seated not a dozen yards away from him was a tall thin man with a bag of golf clubs by his side he was listening with an air of engrossed attention to his companions impressive remarks norgate raising himself upon his elbow no longer had any doubts the man stretched upon his back on the sand partly hidden from sight by a little grassgrown undulation was his late travelling companion  you do well my dear marquis believe me the latter exclaimed property in belgium is valuable today take my advice sell there are so many places where one may live where the climate is better for a man of your constitution  that is all very well his companion replied querulously but remember that belgium after all is my country my château and estates came to me by inheritance notwithstanding the frequent intermarriages of my family with the aristocracy of your country i am still a belgian  ah but my dear friend selingman protested you are more than a belgian more than a man of local nationality you are a citizen of the world of intelligence you are able to see the truth the days are coming when small states may exist no longer without the allprotecting arm of a more powerful country i say no more than this the position of belgium is artificial of her own will or of necessity she must soon become merged in the onward flow of mightier nations  what about holland then  holland too selingman continued knows the truth she knows very well that the limit of her days as an independent kingdom is almost reached the power which has absorbed the states of prussia into one mighty empire pauses only to take breath there are many signs  but my worthy friend the other man interrupted irritably you must take into consideration the fact that belgium is in a different position our existence as a separate kingdom might certainly be threatened by germany but all that has been foreseen our neutrality is guaranteed your country has pledged its honour to maintain it side by side with france and england what have we to fear then  you have to fear marquis selingman replied ponderously the inevitable laws which direct the progress of nations treaties solemnly subscribed to in one generation become worthless as time passes and conditions change  but i do not understand you there the other man exclaimed what you say sounds to me like a reflection upon the honour of your country do you mean to insinuate that she would possiblythat she would ever for a moment contemplate breaking her pledged and sealed word  my friend selingman pronounced drily the path of honour and glory the onward progress of a mighty struggling nation carrying in its hand culture and civilisation might demand even such a sacrifice germany recognises is profoundly imbued with the splendour of her own ideals the matchlessness of her own culture she feels justified in spreading herself out wherever she can find an outletat any cost mind because the end must be good  there was a moments silence then the tall man stood upright  if you came out to find me my friend selingman to bring me this warning i suppose i should consider myself your debtor as a matter of fact i do not you have inspired me with nameless misgivings your voice sounds in my ears like the voice of an ugly fate i am as you have often reminded me half german and i have shown my friendship for germany many times unlike most of the aristocracy of my country i look more often northwards than towards the south but i tell you frankly that there are limits to my germanism i will play no more golf i will walk with you to the clubhouse  all that i have to say selingman went on is not yet said this opportunity of meeting you is too precious to be wasted come as we walk there are certain questions i wish to put to you  they passed within a few feet of where norgate was lying he closed his eyes and held his breath it was not until their figures were almost specks in the distance that he rose cautiously to his feet he made his way back to the clubhouse by another angle gained his taxicab unobserved and drove back to ostend                                       towards evening norgate strolled into one of the cosmopolitan bars at the back of the casino the first person he saw as he handed over his hat to a waiter was selingman spread out upon a cushioned seat with a young lady upon either side of him he at once summoned norgate to his table  an apéritif he insisted come you must not refuse me in two hours we start we tear ourselves away from this wonderful atmosphere in atmosphere mademoiselle he added bowing to the right and the left all is included  it is not norgate admitted an invitation to be disregarded on the other hand i have already an appetite  selingman thundered out an order  here he remarked we dwell for a few brief moments in bohemia i do not introduce you you sit down and join us you are one of us that you speak only english counts for nothing mademoiselle alice here is american now tell us at once how have you spent this afternoon you have bathed perhaps or walked upon the sands  norgate was on the point of speaking of his excursion to knocke but was conscious of selingmans curiously intent gaze the spirit of duplicity seemed to grow upon him  i walked for a little way he said afterwards i lay upon the sands and slept when i found that the steamer was still further delayed i had a bath that was half an hour ago i asked a man whom i met on the promenade where one might dine in travelling clothes lightly but well and he sent me herethe bar de londresand here for my good fortune i am  it is a pity that monsieur does not speak french one of selingmans companions murmured  but mademoiselle norgate protested i have spoken french all my life herr selingman here has misunderstood me it is german of which i am ignorant  the young lady who immediately introduced herself as mademoiselle henriette passed her arm through selingmans  we dine here all together my friend is it not so she begged he will not be in the way and for myself i am triste you talk all the time to mademoiselle laméricaine perhaps because she is the friend of some one in whom you are interested but for me it is dull monsieur langlais shall talk with me and you may hear all the secrets that alice has to tell we she murmured looking up at norgate will speak of other things is it not so  for a moment selingman hesitated norgate would have moved on with a little farewell nod but selingmans companions were insistent  it shall be a partie carrée they both declared almost in unison  you need have no fear mademoiselle henriette continued i will talk all the time to monsieur he shall tell me his name and we shall be very great friends i am not interested in the things of which they talk those others you shall tell me of london monsieur and how you live there  join us by all means selingman invited  on condition that you dine with me norgate insisted as he took up the menu  impossible selingman declared firmly  oh it matters nothing mademoiselle henriette exclaimed so long as we dine  so long mademoiselle alice intervened as we have this brief glimpse of mr selingman let us make the best of it we see him only because of a contretemps i think we must be very nice to him and persuade him to take us to london tonight  selingmans shake of the head was final  dear young ladies he said it was delightful to find you here i came upon the chance i admit but who in ostend would not be here between six and eight we dine we walk down to the quay and if you will you shall wave your hands and wish us bon voyage but london just now is triste it is here you may live the life the bon dieu sends where the sun shines all the time and the sea laps the sands like a great blue lake and you mademoiselle can wear those wonderful costumes and charm all hearts there is nothing like that for you in london  they ordered dinner and walked afterwards down to the quay mademoiselle henriette lingered behind with norgate  let them go on she whispered they have much to talk about it is but a short distance and your steamer will not start before ten we can walk slowly and listen to the music you are not in a hurry monsieur to depart your stay here is too short already  norgates reply although gallant enough was a little vague he was watching selingman with his companion they were talking together with undoubted seriousness  who is mr selingman he enquired i know him only as a travelling companion  mademoiselle henriette extended her hands she shrugged her little shoulders and looked with wideopen eyes up into her companions grave face  but who indeed can answer that question she exclaimed twice he has been here for flying visits once alice has been to see him in berlin he is i believe a very wealthy manufacturer there he crosses often to england he has money and he is always gay  and mademoiselle alice  who knows was the somewhat pointless reply she came from america she arrived here this season with monsieur le general  what general norgate asked a belgian  but no his companion corrected all the world knows that alice is the friend of general le foys chief of the staff in paris he is a very great soldier he spends eleven months working and one month here  and she is also norgate observed meditatively the friend of herr selingman tell me mademoiselle what do you suppose those two are talking of now see how close their heads are together i dont think that herr selingman is a don juan  they speak perhaps of serious matters his companion surmised but who can tell besides is it for us to waste our few moments wondering you will come back to ostend monsieur  norgate looked back at the streaming curve of lights flashing across the dark waters  one never knows he answered  that is what monsieur selingman himself says she remarked with a little sigh enjoy your ostend today my little ones he said when he first met us this evening one never knows how long these days will last so monsieur we must indeed part here  they had all come to a standstill at the gangway of the steamer selingman had apparently finished his conversation with his companion he hurried norgate off and they waved their hands from the deck as a few minutes later the steamer glided away  a most delightful interlude selingman declared i have thoroughly enjoyed these few hours i trust that every time this steamer meets with a little accident it will be at this time of the year and when i am on my way to england  you seem to have friends everywhere norgate observed as he lit a cigar  young ladies yes selingman admitted it chanced that they were both wellknown to me but who else  norgate made no reply he felt that his companion was watching him  it is something he remarked to find charming young ladies in a strange place to dine with one  selingman smiled broadly  if we travelled together often my young friend he said you would discover that i have friends everywhere if i have nothing else to do i go out and make a friend then when i revisit that place it loses its coldness there is some one there to welcome me some one who is glad to see me again look steadily in that direction a few points to the left of the bows in two hours time you will see the lights of your country i have friends there too who will welcome me meantime i go below to sleep you have a cabin  norgate shook his head  i shall doze on deck for a little time he said it is too wonderful a night to go below  it is well for me that it is calm selingman acknowledged i do not love the sea shall we part for a little time if we meet not at dover then in london my young friend london is the greatest city in the world but it is the smallest place in europe one cannot move in the places one knows of without meeting ones friends  until we meet in london then norgate observed as he settled himself down in his chair     chapter vi   norgate spent an utterly fruitless morning on the day after his arrival in london after a lengthy but entirely unsatisfactory visit to the foreign office he presented himself soon after midday at scotland yard  i should like he announced to see the chief commissioner of the police  the official to whom he addressed his enquiry eyed him tolerantly  have you by any chance an appointment he asked  none norgate admitted i only arrived from the continent this morning  the policeman shook his head slowly  it is quite impossible sir he said to see sir philip without an appointment your best course would be to write and state your business and his secretary will then fix a time for you to call  very much obliged to you im sure norgate replied however my business is urgent and if i cant see sir philip morse i will see some one else in authority  norgate was regaled with a copy of the times and a seat in a barelyfurnished waitingroom in about twenty minutes he was told that a mr tyritt would see him and was promptly shown into the presence of that gentleman mr tyritt was a burly and blackbearded person of something more than middleage he glanced down at norgates card in a somewhat puzzled manner and motioned him to a seat  what can i do for you sir he enquired sir philip is very much engaged for the next few days but perhaps you can tell me your business  i have just arrived from berlin norgate explained would you care to possess a complete list of german spies in this country  mr tyritts face was not one capable of showing the most profound emotion nevertheless he seemed a little taken aback  a list of german spies he repeated dear me that sounds very interesting  he took up norgates card and glanced at it the action was in its way significant  you probably dont know who i am norgate continued i have been in the diplomatic service for eight years until a few days ago i was attached to the embassy in berlin  mr tyritt was somewhat impressed by the statement  have you any objection to telling me how you became possessed of this information  none whatever was the prompt reply you shall hear the whole story  norgate told him as briefly as possible of his meeting with selingman their conversation and the subsequent happenings including the interview which he had overheard on the golf links at knocke when he had finished there was a brief silence  sounds rather like a page out of a novel doesnt it mr norgate the police official remarked at last  it may norgate assented drily i cant help what it sounds like it happens to be the exact truth  i do not for a moment doubt it the other declared politely i believe indeed that there are a large number of germans working in this country who are continually collecting and forwarding to berlin commercial and political reports speaking on behalf of my department however mr norgate he went on this is briefly our position in the neighbourhood of our naval bases our dockyards our military aeroplane sheds and in other directions which i need not specify we keep the most scrupulous and exacting watch we even as of course you are aware employ decoy spies ourselves who work in conjunction with our friends at whitehall our system is a rigorous one and our supervision of it unceasing butand this is a big but mr norgatein other directionsso far as regards the country generally that is to saywe do not take the subject of german spies seriously i may almost say that we have no anxiety concerning their capacity for mischief  those are the views of your department norgate asked  so far as i may be said to represent it they are mr tyritt assented i will venture to say that there are many thousands of letters a year which leave this country addressed to germany purporting to contain information of the most important nature which might just as well be published in the newspapers we ought to know because at different times we have opened a good many of them  forgive me if i press this point norgate begged do you consider that because a vast amount of useless information is naturally sent that fact lessens the danger as a whole if only one letter in a thousand contains vital information isnt that sufficient to raise the subject to a more serious level  mr tyritt crossed his legs his tone still indicated the slight tolerance of the man convinced beforehand of the soundness of his position  for the last twelve years he announcedever since i came into office in factthis bogey of german spies has been costing the nation something like fifty thousand a year it is only lately that we have come to take that broader view of the situation which i am endeavouring totomay i say enunciate germans over in this country especially those in comparatively menial positions such as barbers and waiters are necessary to us industrially so long as they earn their living reputably conform to our laws and pay our taxes they are welcome here we do not wish to unnecessarily disturb them we wish instead to offer them the full protection of the country in which they have chosen to do productive work  very interesting norgate remarked i have heard this point of view before once i thought it common sense today i think it academic piffle if we leave the germans engaged in the inland towns alone for a moment do you realise i wonder that there isnt any seaport in england that hasnt its sprinkling of germans engaged in the occupations of which you speak  and in a general way mr tyritt assented smiling they are perfectly welcome to write home to their friends and relations each week and tell them everything they see happening about them everything they know about us  norgate rose reluctantly to his feet  i wont trouble you any longer he decided i presume that if i make a few investigations on my own account and bring you absolute proof that any one of these people whose names are upon my list are in traitorous communication with germany you will view the matter differently  without a doubt mr tyritt promised is that your list will you allow me to glance through it  i brought it here to leave in your hands norgate replied passing it over your attitude however seems to render that course useless  mr tyritt adjusted his eyeglasses and glanced benevolently at the document a sharp ejaculation broke from his lips as his eyes wandered downwards his first expression of incredulity gave way to one of suppressed amusement  why mr norgate he exclaimed as he laid it down do you mean to seriously accuse these people of being engaged in any sort of league against us  most certainly i do norgate insisted  but the thing is ridiculous mr tyritt declared there are names here of princes of bankers of society women many of them wholly and entirely english some of them household names you expect me to believe that these people are all linked together in what amounts to a conspiracy to further the cause of germany at the expense of the country in which they live to which they belong  norgate picked up his hat  i expect you to believe nothing mr tyritt he said drily sorry i troubled you  not at all mr tyritt protested the slight irritation passing from his manner such a visit as yours is an agreeable break in my routine work i feel as though i might be a character in a great modern romance the names of your amateur criminals are still tingling in my memory  norgate turned back from the door  remember them if you can mr tyritt he advised you may have cause to some day     chapter vii   norgate sat the following afternoon upon the leatherstuffed fender of a fashionable mixed bridge club in the neighbourhood of berkeley square exchanging greetings with such of the members as were disposed to find time for social amenities a smartlydressed woman of dark complexion and slightly foreign appearance who had just cut out of a rubber came over and seated herself by his side she took a cigarette from her case and accepted a match from norgate  so you are really back again she murmured it scarcely seems possible  i am just beginning to realise it myself he replied you havent altered bertha  my dear man she protested you did not expect me to age in a month did you it can scarcely be more than that since you left for berlin are you not back again sooner than you expected  norgate nodded  very much sooner he admitted i came in for some unexpected leave which i havent the slightest intention of spending abroad so here i am  not apparently in love with berlin the lady whose name was mrs paston benedek remarked  norgates air of complete candour was very well assumed  i shall never be a success as a diplomatist he confessed when i dislike a place or a person every one knows it i hated berlin i hate the thought of going back again  the woman by his side smiled enigmatically  perhaps she murmured you may get an exchange  perhaps norgate assented meanwhile even a month away from london seems to have brought a fresh set of people here who is the tall thin young man with the sunburnt face he seems familiar somehow but i cant place him  he is a sailor she told him captain baring his name is  friend of yours  she looked at him sidewise  why do you ask  jealousy norgate sighed makes one observant you were lunching with him in the carlton grill you came in with him to the club this afternoon  sherlock holmes she murmured there are other men in the club with whom i luncheven dine  norgate glanced across the room baring was playing bridge at a table close at hand but his attention seemed to be abstracted he looked often towards where mrs benedek sat there was a restlessness about his manner scarcely in keeping with the rest of his appearance  one misses a great deal norgate regretted through being only an occasional visitor here  as for instance  the privilege of being one of those fortunate few  she laughed at him her eyes were full of challenge she leaned a little closer and whispered in his ear there is still a vacant place  for tonight or tomorrow he asked eagerly  for tomorrow she replied you may telephone3702 mayfairat ten oclock  he scribbled down the number then he put his pocketbook away with a sigh  im afraid you are treating that poor sailorman badly he declared  sometimes she confided he bores me he is so very much in earnest tell me about berlin and your work there  i didnt take to germany norgate confessed and germany didnt take to me between ourselvesi shouldnt like another soul in the club to know iti think it is very doubtful if i go back there  that little contretemps with the prince she murmured under her breath  he stiffened at once  but how do you know of it  she bit her lip for a moment a frown of annoyance clouded her face she had said more than she intended  i have correspondents in berlin she explained they tell me of everything i have a friend in fact who was in the restaurant that night  what a coincidence he exclaimed  she nodded and selected a fresh cigarette  isnt it but that table is up i promised to cut in there captain baring likes me to play at the same table and he is here for such a short time that one tries to be kind it is indeed kindness she added taking up her gold purse and belongings for he plays so badly  she moved towards the table it happened to be baring who cut out and he and norgate drifted together they exchanged a few remarks  i met you at marseilles once norgate reminded him you were with the mediterranean squadron commanding the leicester i believe  thought id seen you somewhere before was the prompt acknowledgment youre in the diplomatic service arent you  norgate admitted the fact and suggested a drink the two men settled down to exchange confidences over a whisky and soda baring looked around him with some disapprobation  i cant really stick this place he asserted if it werent forfor some of the people here id never come inside the doors its a rotten way of spending ones time you play i suppose  oh yes i play norgate admitted but i rather agree with you how wonderfully well mrs benedek is looking isnt she  baring withdrew his admiring eyes from her vicinity  prettiest and smartest woman in london he declared  bytheby is she english norgate asked  a mixture of french italian and german i believe baring replied her husband is benedek the painter you know  ive heard of him norgate assented what are you doing now  ive had a job up in town for a week or so at the admiralty baring explained we are examining the plans of a newbut you wouldnt be interested in that  im interested in anything naval norgate assured him  in any case it isnt my job to talk about it baring continued apologetically weve just got a lot of fresh regulations out any one would think we were going to war tomorrow  i suppose war isnt such an impossible event norgate remarked they all say that the germans are dying to have a go at you fellows  baring grinned  they wouldnt have a dogs chance he declared thats the only drawback of having so strong a navy we dont stand any chance of getting a fight  youll have all you can do to keep up judging by the way they talk in germany norgate observed  are you just home from there  norgate nodded i am at the embassy in berlin or rather i have been he replied i am just home on six months leave  and thats your real impression baring enquired eagerly you really think that they mean to have a go at us  i think therell be a war soon norgate confessed it probably wont commence at sea but youll have to do your little lot without a doubt  baring gazed across the room there was a hard light in his eyes  sounds beastly i suppose he muttered but i wish to god it would come a war would give us all a shaking upput us in our right places we all seem to go on drifting any way now the services are all right when theres a bit of a scrap going sometimes but theres a nasty sort of feeling of dry rot about them when year after year all your preparations end in the smoke of a sham fight now i am on this beastly land jobbut there i mustnt bother you with my grumblings  i am interested norgate assured him did you say you were considering something new  baring nodded  plans of a new submarine he confided theres no harm in telling you as much as that  mrs benedek who was dummy for the moment strolled over to them  i am not sure she murmured whether i like the expression you have brought back from germany with you mr norgate  norgate smiled have i really acquired the correct diplomatic air he asked i can assure you that it is an accidentor perhaps i am imitative  you have acquired she complained an air of unnatural reserve you seem as though you had found some problem in life so weighty that you could not lose sight of it even for a moment ah  the glasstopped door had been flung wide open with an unusual flourish a barely perceptible start escaped norgate it was indeed an unexpected appearance this dressed with a perfect regard to the latest london fashion with his hair smoothly brushed and a pearl pin in his black satin tie herr selingman stood upon the threshold beaming upon them     chapter viii   selingman had the air of a man who returns after a long absence to some familiar spot where he expects to find friends and where his welcome is assured mrs paston benedek slipped from her place upon the cushioned fender and held out both her hands  ah it is really you she exclaimed welcome dear friend for days i have wondered what it was in this place which one missed all the time now i know  selingman took the little outstretched hands and raised them to his lips  dear lady he assured her you repay me in one moment for all the weariness of my exile  she turned towards her companion  captain baring she begged please ring the bell mr selingman and i always drink a toast together the moment he first arrives to pay us one of his too rare visits thank you you know captain baring dont you mr selingman this is another friend of mine whom i think that you have not metmr francis norgate mr selingman mr norgate has just arrived from berlin too  for a single moment the newcomer seemed to lose his cheeryblelike expression the glance which he flashed upon norgate contained other elements besides those of polite pleasure he was himself again however almost instantly he grasped his new acquaintance by the hand  mr norgate and i are already old friends he insisted we occupied the same coupe coming from berlin and drank a bottle of wine together in the buffet  mrs benedek threw back her head and laughed a familiar gesture which her enemies declared was in some way associated with the dazzling whiteness of her teeth  and now she exclaimed you find that you belong to the same bridge club what a coincidence  it is rather surprising i must admit norgate assented mr selingman and i discussed many things last night but we did not speak of bridge in fact from the tone of our conversation i should have imagined that cards were an amusement which scarcely entered into mr selingmans scheme of life  one must have ones distractions selingman protested i confess that auction bridge as it is played over here is the one game in the world which attracts me  but how about the crockery norgate asked doesnt that come first  first beyond a doubt selingman agreed heartily always though my plan of campaign is the same on the day of my arrival here i take things easily i spend an hour or so at the office in the morning and the afternoon i take holiday after that i settle down for one weeks hard work londonyour great londontakes always first place with me in the mornings i see my agents and my customers perhaps i lunch with one of them at four oclock i close my desk and crockery does not exist for me any longer i get into a taxi and i come here my first game of bridge is a treat to which i look forward eagerly see there are three of us and several sitting out let us make another table so  they found a fourth without difficulty and took possession of a table at the far end of the room selingman with a huge cigar in his mouth played well and had every appearance of thoroughly enjoying the game towards the end of their third rubber mrs benedek who was dummy leaned across towards norgate  after all perhaps you are better off here she murmured in german there is nothing like this in berlin  one is at least nearer the things one cherishes norgate quoted in the same language  selingman was playing the hand and held between his fingers a card already drawn to play for a moment it was suspended in the air he looked towards norgate and there was a new quality in his piercing gaze an instant return in his expression of the shadow which had swept the broad goodhumour from his face on his first appearance the change came and went like a flash he finished playing the hand and scored his points before he spoke then he turned to norgate  your gift of acquiring languages in a short space of time is most extraordinary my young friend since yesterday you have become able to speak german eh prodigious  norgate smiled without embarrassment the moment was a critical one portentous to an extent which no one at that table could possibly have realised  i am afraid he confessed that when i found that i had a fellow traveller in my coupe i felt most ungracious and unsociable i was in a thoroughly bad temper and indisposed for conversation the simplest way to escape from it seemed to be to plead ignorance of any language save my own  selingman chuckled audibly the cloud had passed from his face to all appearance that momentary suspicion had been strangled  so you found me a bore he observed then i must admit that your manners were good for when you found that i spoke english and that you could not escape conversation you allowed me to talk on about my business and you showed few signs of weariness you should be a diplomatist mr norgate  mr norgate is or rather he was mrs paston benedek remarked he has just left the embassy at berlin  selingman leaned back in his chair and thrust both hands into his trousers pockets he indulged in a few german expletives bombastic and thunderous which relieved him so much that he was able to conclude his speech in english  i am the densest blockhead in all europe he announced emphatically if i had realised your identity i would willingly have left you alone no wonder you were feeling indisposed for idle conversation mr francis norgate eh a little affair at the café de berlin with a lady and a hotheaded young princeling well well young sir you have become more to me than an ordinary acquaintance if i had known the cause of your illhumour i would certainly have left you alone but i would have shaken you first by the hand  the fourth at the table who was an elderly lady of somewhat austere appearance produced a small black cigar from what seemed to be a harmlesslooking reticule which she was carrying and lit it selingman stared at her with his mouth open  is this a bridgetable or is it not she enquired severely these little personal reminiscences are very interesting among yourselves i dare say but i cut in here with the idea of playing bridge  selingman was the first to recover his manners although his eyes seemed still fascinated by the cigar  we owe you apologies madam he acknowledged permit me to cut  the rubber progressed and finished in comparative silence at its conclusion selingman glanced at the clock it was halfpast seven  i am hungry he announced  mrs benedek laughed at him hungry at halfpast seven barbarian  i lunched at halfpast twelve he protested i ate less than usual too i did not even leave my office i was so anxious to finish what was necessary and to find myself here  mrs benedek played with the cards a moment and then rose to her feet with a little grimace  well i suppose i shall have to give in she sighed i am taking it for granted you see that you are expecting me to dine with you  my dear lady selingman declared emphatically if you were to break through our timehonoured custom and deny me the joy of your company on my first evening in london i think that i should send another to look after my business in this country and retire myself to the seclusion of my little country home near potsdam the inducements of managing ones own affairs in this country mr norgate he added are as you may imagine manifold and magnetic  we will not grudge them to you so long as you dont come too often norgate remarked as he bade them good night the man who monopolised mrs benedek would soon make himself unpopular here     chapter ix   norgate had chosen for many reasons to return to london as a visitor his somewhat luxurious rooms in albemarle street were still locked up he had taken a small flat in the milan court solely for the purpose of avoiding immediate association with his friends and relatives his whole outlook upon life was confused and disturbed until he received a definite pronouncement from the headquarters of officialdom he felt himself unable to settle down to any of the ordinary functions of life and behind all this another and a more powerful sentiment possessed him he had left berlin without seeing or hearing anything further from anna von haase no word had come from her nor any message and now that it was too late he began to feel that he had made a mistake it seemed to him that he had visited upon her in some indirect way the misfortune which had befallen him it was scarcely her fault that she had been the object of attentions which nearly every one agreed were unwelcome from this young princeling norgate told himself as he changed his clothes that evening that his behaviour had been the behaviour of a jealous schoolboy then an inspiration seized him half dressed as he was he sat down at the writingtable and wrote to her he wrote rapidly and when he had finished he sealed and addressed the envelope without glancing once more at its contents the letter was stamped and posted within a few minutes but somehow or other it seemed to have made a difference his depression was no longer so complete he looked forward to his lonely dinner at one of the smaller clubs to which he belonged with less aversion  do you know where any of my people are hardy he asked his servant  in scotland i believe sir the man replied i called round this afternoon although i was careful not to mention the fact that you were in town the house is practically in the hands of caretakers  try to keep out of the way as much as you can hardy norgate enjoined for a few days at any rate i should like no one to know that i am in town  very good sir the man replied might i venture to enquire sir if you are likely to be returning to berlin  i think it is very doubtful hardy norgate observed grimly we are more likely to remain here for a time  hardy brushed his masters hat for a moment or two in silence  you will pardon my mentioning it sir he saidi imagine it is of no importancebut one of the german waiters on this floor has been going out of his way to enter into conversation with me this evening he seemed to know your name and to know that you had just come from germany he hinted at some slight trouble there sir  the dickens he did norgate exclaimed thats rather quick work hardy  so i thought sir the man continued a very inquisitive individual indeed i found him he wanted to know whether you had had any news yet as to any further appointment he seemed to know quite well that you had been at the foreign office this morning  what did you tell him  i told him that i knew nothing sir i explained that you had not been back to lunch and that i had not seen you since the morning he tried to make an appointment with me to give me some dinner and take me to a musichall tonight  what did you say to that norgate enquired  i left the matter open sir the man replied i thought i would enquire what your wishes might be the person evidently desires to gain some information about your movements i thought that possibly it might be advantageous for me to tell him just what you desired  norgate lit a cigarette for the moment he was puzzled it was true that during their journey he had mentioned to selingman his intention of taking a flat at the milan court but if this espionage were the direct outcome of that information it was indeed a wonderful organisation which selingman controlled  you have acted very discreetly hardy he said i think you had better tell your friend that i am expecting to leave for somewhere at a moments notice for your own information he added i rather think that i shall stay here it seems to me quite possible that we may find london for a few weeks just as interesting as any city in the world  i am very glad to hear you say so sir the man murmured shall i fetch your overcoat  the telephone bell suddenly interrupted them hardy took up the receiver and listened for a moment  mr hebblethwaite would like to speak to you sir he announced  norgate hurried to the telephone a cheery voice greeted him  hullo that you norgate this is hebblethwaite im just back from a few days in the countryfound your note here i want to hear all about this little matter at once when can i see you  any time you like norgate replied promptly  let me see the voice continued what are you doing tonight  nothing  come straight round to the house of commons and dine or nowait a momentwell go somewhere quieter say the club in a quarter of an hourthe reform club how will that suit you  ill be there with pleasure norgate promised  righto well hear what youve been doing to these peppery germans i had a line from leveson himself this morning a lady in the case i hear well well never mind explanations now see you in a few minutes  norgate laid down the receiver his manner as he accepted his wellbrushed hat had lost all its depression there was no one in the cabinet with more influence than hebblethwaite he would have his chance at any rate and his chance at other things  look here hardy he ordered as he drew on his gloves spend as much time as you like with that fellow and let me know what sort of questions he asks you be careful not to mention the fact that i am dining with mr hebblethwaite for the rest fence with him i am not quite sure what it all means if by any chance he mentions a man named selingman let me know good night  good night sir the man replied  norgate descended into the strand and walked briskly towards pall mall the last few minutes seemed to him to be fraught with promise of a new interest in life yet it was not of any of these things that he was thinking as he made his way towards his destination he was occupied most of the time in wondering how long it would be before he could hope to receive a reply from berlin to his letter     chapter x   the right honourable john hebblethwaite mp since he had become a cabinet minister and had even been mentioned as the possible candidate for supreme office had lost a great deal of that breezy almost boisterous effusion of manner which in his younger days had first endeared him to his constituents he received norgate however with marked and hearty cordiality and took his arm as he led him to the little table which he had reserved in a corner of the diningroom the friendship between the entirely selfmade politician and norgate who was the nephew of a duke and whose aristocratic connections were multifarious and farreaching was in its way a genuine one there were times when hebblethwaite had made use of his younger friend to further his own undoubted social ambitions on the other hand since he had become a power in politics he had always been ready to return in kind such offices the note which he had received from norgate that day was however the first appeal which had ever been made to him  i have been away for a weekends golf hebblethwaite explained as they took their places at the table there comes a time when figures pall and snapping away in debate seems to stick in ones throat i telephoned directly i got your note fortunately i wasnt doing anything this evening we wont play about i know you dont want to see me to talk about the weather and i know somethings up or leveson wouldnt have written to me and you wouldnt be back from berlin lets have the whole story with the soup and fish and well try and hit upon a way to put things right before we reach the liqueurs  ive lots to say to you norgate admitted simply ill begin with the personal side of it heres just a brief narration of exactly what happened to me in the most fashionable restaurant of berlin last thursday night  norgate told his story his friend listened with the absorbed attention of a man who possesses complete powers of concentration  rotten business he remarked when it was finished i suppose youve told oldi mean youve told them the story at the foreign office  had it all out this morning norgate replied  i know exactly what our friend told you mr hebblethwaite continued with a gleam of humour in his eyes he reminded you that the first duty of a diplomatof a young diplomat especiallyis to keep on friendly terms with the governing members of the country to which he is accredited hows that eh  pretty nearly word for word norgate admitted its the sort of platitude i could watch framing in his mind before i was halfway through what i had to say what they dont seem to take sufficient account of in that museum of mummied brains and parchment tonguesforgive me hebblethwaite but it isnt your departmentis that the princes behaviour to me is such as no englishman subscribing to any code of honour could possibly tolerate i will admit if you like that the kaisers attitude may render it advisable for me to be transferred from berlin i do not admit that i am not at once eligible for a position of similar importance in another capital  no one would doubt it john hebblethwaite grumbled except those particular fools we have to deal with i suppose they didnt see it in the same light  they did not norgate admitted  weve a tough proposition to tackle hebblethwaite confessed cheerfully but i am with you norgate and to my mind one of the pleasures of being possessed of a certain amount of power is to help ones friends when you believe in the justice of their cause if you leave things with me ill tackle them tomorrow morning  thats awfully good of you hebblethwaite norgate declared gratefully and just what i expected well leave that matter altogether just now if we may my own little grievance is there and i wanted to explain exactly how it came about apart from that altogether there is something far more important which i have to say to you  hebblethwaite knitted his brows he was clearly puzzled  still personal eh he enquired  norgate shook his head  it is something of vastly more importance he said than any question affecting my welfare i am almost afraid to begin for fear i shall miss any chance for fear i may not seem convincing enough  well have the champagne opened at once then mr hebblethwaite declared perhaps that will loosen your tongue i can see that this is going to be a busy meal charles if that bottle of pommery 1904 is iced just to the degree i like it let it be served if you please in the large sized glasses now norgate  what i am going to relate to you norgate began leaning across the table and speaking very earnestly is a little incident which happened to me on my way back from berlin i had as a fellow passenger a person whom i am convinced is high up in the german secret service intelligence department  all that mr hebblethwaite murmured go ahead norgate i like the commencement of your story i almost feel that i am moving through the pages of a diplomatic romance all that i am praying is that your fellow passenger was a foreign ladya princess if possiblewith wonderful eyes fascinating manners and of a generous disposition  then i am afraid you will be disappointed norgate continued drily the personage in question was a man whose name was selingman he told me that he was a manufacturer of crockery and that he came often to england to see his customers he called himself a peaceloving german and he professed the utmost goodwill towards our country and our national policy at the commencement of our conversation i managed to impress him with the idea that i spoke no german at one of the stations on the line he was joined by a belgian his agent as he told me in brussels for the sale of his crockery i overheard this agent whose name was meyer recount to his principal his recent operations he offered him an exact plan of the forts of liège i heard him instructed to procure a list of the wealthy inhabitants of ghent and the rateable value of the city and i heard him commissioned to purchase land in the neighbourhood of antwerp for a secret purpose  mr hebblethwaites eyebrows became slowly upraised the twinkle in his eyes remained however  my he exclaimed softly were getting on with the romance all right  during the momentary absence of this fellow and his agent from the carriage norgate proceeded i possessed myself of a slip of paper which had become detached from the packet of documents they had been examining it consisted of a list of names mostly of people resident in the united kingdom purporting to be selingmans agents i venture to believe that this list is a precise record of the principal german spies in this country  german spies mr hebblethwaite murmured whew  he sipped his champagne  that list norgate went on is in my pocket i may add that although i was careful to keep up the fiction of not understanding german and although i informed herr selingman that i had seen the paper in question blow out of the window he nevertheless gave me that night a drugged whisky and soda and during the time i slept he must have been through every one of my possessions i found my few letters and papers turned upside down and even my pockets had been ransacked  where was the paper then mr hebblethwaite enquired  in an inner pocket of my pyjamas norgate explained i had them made with a sort of belt inside at the time i was a kings messenger  mr hebblethwaite played with his tie for a moment and drank a little more champagne  could i have a look at the list he asked as though with a sudden inspiration  norgate passed it across the table to him mr hebblethwaite adjusted his pincenez gave a little start as he read the first name leaned back in his chair as he came to another stared at norgate about halfway down the list as though to make sure that he was in earnest and finally finished it in silence he folded it up and handed it back  well well he exclaimed a little pointlessly now tell me norgate you showed this list down therejerking his head towards the street  i did norgate admitted  and what did they say  just what you might expect men whose lives are spent within the four walls of a room in downing street to say norgate replied you are half inclined to make fun of me yourself hebblethwaite but at any rate i know you have a different outlook from theirs old carew was frantically polite he even declared the list to be most interesting he rambled on for about a quarter of an hour on the general subject of the spy mania german espionage he told me was one of the shadowy evils from which england had suffered for generations so far as regards london and the provincial towns he went on whether for good or evil we have a large german population and if they choose to make reports to any one in germany as to events happening here which come under their observation we cannot stop it and it would not even be worth while to try as regards matters of military and naval importance there was a special branch he assured me for looking after these and it was a branch of the service which was remarkably wellserved and remarkably successful having said this he folded the list up and returned it to me rang the bell gave me a frozen hand to shake a mumbled promise about another appointment as soon as there should be a vacancy and that was the end of it  about that other appointment mr hebblethwaite began with some animation  damn the other appointment norgate interrupted testily i didnt come here to cadge hebblethwaite i am never likely to make use of my friends in that way i came for a bigger thing i came to try and make you see a danger the reality of which i have just begun to appreciate myself for the first time in my life  mr hebblethwaites manner slowly changed he pulled down his waistcoat finished off a glass of wine and leaned forward  norgate he said i am sorry that this is the frame of mind in which you have come to me i tell you frankly that you couldnt have appealed to a man in the cabinet less in sympathy with your fears than i myself  i am sorry to hear that norgate replied grimly but go on  before i entered the cabinet mr hebblethwaite continued our relations with foreign powers were just the myth to me that they are to most people who read the morning post one day and the daily mail the next however i made the best part of half a million in business through knowing the top and the bottom and every corner of my job and i started in to do the same when i began to have a share in the government of the country the entente with france is all right in its way but i came to the conclusion that the greatest and broadest stroke of diplomacy possible to englishmen today was to cultivate more benevolent and more confidential relations with germany that same feeling has been spreading through the cabinet during the last two years i am ready to take my share of the blame or praise whichever in the future shall be allotted to the inspirer of that idea it is our hope that when the present government goes out of office one of its chief claims to public approval and to historical praise will be the improvement of our relations with germany we certainly do not wish to disturb the growing confidence which exists between the two countries by any maladroit or unnecessary investigations we believe in short that germanys attitude towards us is friendly and we intend to treat her in the same spirit  tell me norgate asked is that the reason why every scheme for the expansion of the army has been shelved is that the reason for all the troubles with the army council  it is hebblethwaite admitted i trust you norgate and i look upon you as a friend i tell you what the whole world of responsible men and women might as well know but which we naturally dont care about shouting from the housetops we have come to the conclusion that there is no possible chance of the peace of europe being disturbed we have come to the conclusion that civilisation has reached that pitch when the last resource of arms is absolutely unnecessary i do not mind telling you that the balkan crisis presented opportunities to any one of the powers to plunge into warfare had they been so disposed no one bade more boldly for peace then than germany no one wants war germany has nothing to gain by it no animosity against france none towards russia neither of these countries has the slightest intention now or at any time of invading germany why should they the matter of alsace and lorraine is finished if these provinces ever come back to france it will be by political means and not by any madheaded attempt to wrest them away  incidentally norgate asked what about the enormous armaments of germany what about her navy what about the military spirit which practically rules the country  i have spent three months in germany during the last year hebblethwaite replied it is my firm belief that those armaments and that fleet are necessary to germany to preserve her place of dignity among the nations she has russia on one side and france on the other allies watching her all the time and of late years england has been chipping at her whenever she got a chance and flirting with france what can a nation do but make herself strong enough to defend herself against unprovoked attack germany of course is full of the military spirit but it is my opinion norgate that it is a great deal fuller of the great commercial spirit it isnt war with germany that we have to fear its the ruin of our commerce by their great assiduity and more uptodate methods now youve had a statement of policy from me for which the halfpenny press would give me a thousand guineas if id sign it  ive had it norgate admitted and i tell you frankly that i hate it i am an unfledged young diplomat in disgrace and i havent your experience or your brains but i have a hateful idea that i can see the truth and you cant youre too big and too broad in this matter hebblethwaite your heads lifted too high you see the horrors and the needlessness the logical side of war and you brush the thought away from you  mr hebblethwaite sighed  perhaps so he admitted one can only act according to ones convictions you must remember though norgate that we dont carry our pacificism to extremes our navy is and always will be an irresistible defence  even with hostile naval and aeroplane bases atsaycalais boulogne dieppe ostend  mr hebblethwaite pushed a box of cigars towards his guest glanced at the clock and rose  young fellow he said i have engaged a box at the empire let us move on     chapter xi   my position as a cabinet minister mr hebblethwaite declared with a sigh renders my presence in the promenade undesirable if you want to stroll around norgate dont bother about me  norgate picked up his hat jolly good show he remarked ill be back before it begins again  he descended to the lower promenade and sauntered along towards the refreshment bar mrs paston benedek who was seated in the stalls leaned over and touched his arm  my friend she exclaimed you are distrait you walk as though you looked for everything and saw nothing and behold you have found me  norgate shook hands and nodded to baring who was her escort  what have you done with our expansive friend he asked i thought you were dining with him  i compromised she laughed you see what it is to be so popular i should have dined and have come here with captain baringthat was our plan for tonight captain baring however was generous when he saw my predicament he suffered me to dine with mr selingman and he fetched me afterwards even then we could not quite get rid of the dear man he came on here with us and he is now i believe greeting acquaintances everywhere in the promenade i am perfectly convinced that i shall have to look the other way when we go out  i think ill see whether i can rescue him norgate remarked good show isnt it he added turning to her companion  capital replied baring without enthusiasm too many people here though  norgate strolled on and mrs benedek tapped her companion on the knuckles with her fan  how dared you be so rude she exclaimed you are in a very bad humour this evening i can see that i shall have to punish you  thats all very well baring grumbled but it gets more difficult to see you alone every day this evening was to have been mine now this fat german turns up and lays claim to you and then about the first moment weve had a chance to talk norgate comes gassing along youre not nearly as nice to me bertha as you used to be  my dear man she protested in the first place i deny it in the second i ask myself whether you are quite as devoted to me as you were when you first came  in what way he demanded  she turned her wonderful eyes upon him  at first when you came she declared you told me everything you spoke of your long mornings and afternoons at the admiralty you told me of the room in which you worked the men who worked there with you you told me of the building of that little model and how you were all allowed to try your own pet ideas with regard to it and then all of a sudden nothingnot a word about what you have been doing i am an intelligent woman i love to have men friends who do things and if they are really friends of mine i like to enter into their life to know of their work to sympathise to take an interest in it it was like that with you at first now it has all gone you have drawn down a curtain i do not believe that you go to the admiralty at all i do not believe that you have any wonderful invention there over which you spend your time  bertha dear he remonstrated do be reasonable  she shrugged her shoulders  but am i not see how reasonably i have spoken to you i have told you the exact truth i have told you why i do not take quite that same pleasure in your company as when you first came  do consider he begged i spoke to you freely at first because we had not reached the stage in the work when secrecy was absolutely necessary at present we are all upon our honour from the moment we pass inside that little room we are to all effects and purposes dead men nothing that happens there is to be spoken of or hinted at even to our wives or our dearest friends it is the etiquette of my profession bertha be reasonable  pooh she exclaimed fancy asking a woman to be reasonable dont you realise you stupid man that if you were at liberty to tell everybody what it is that you do there well then i should have no more interest in it it is just because you say that you will not and you may not tell that womanlike i am curious  but whatever good could it be to you to know he protested i should simply addle your head with a mass of technical detail not a quarter of which you would be able to understand besides i have told you bertha it is a matter of honour  she looked intently at her programme  there are men she murmured who love so much that even honour counts for little by the side of  of what he whispered hoarsely  of success  for a moment they sat in silence the place was not particularly hot yet there were little beads of perspiration upon barings forehead the fingers which held his programme twitched he rose suddenly to his feet  may i go out and have a drink he asked i wont go if you dont want to be alone  my dear friend i do not mind in the least she assured him if you find mr norgate send him here  in one of the smaller refreshment rooms sat mr selingman a bottle of champagne before him and a wondrously attired lady on either side the heads of all three were close together the lady on the left was talking in a low tone but with many gesticulations  dear friend she exclaimed for one single moment you must not think that i am ungrateful but consider success costs money always and i have been successfulyou admit that my rooms are frequented entirely by the class of young men you have wished me to encourage pauline and i here and rose whom you have met seek our friends in no other direction we are never alone and as you very well know not a day has passed that i have not sent you some little word of gossip or informationthe gossip of the navy and the gossip of the armyand there is always some truth underneath what these young men say it is what you desire is it not  without a doubt selingman assented your work my dear helda has been excellent i commend you i think with fervour of the day when first we talked together and the scheme presented itself to me continue to play aspasia in such a fashion to the young soldiers and sailors of this country and your villa at monte carlo next year is assured  the woman shrugged her shoulders  i will not say that you are not generous she declared for that would be untrue but sometimes you forget that these young men have very little money and the chief profit from their friendship therefore must come to us in other ways  you want a larger allowance selingman asked slowly  not at present but i want to warn you that the time may come when i shall need more a salon in pimlico dear friend is an expensive thing to maintain these young men tell their friends of our hospitality the music our entertainment we become almost too much the fashion and it costs money  selingman held up his champagne glass gazed at the wine for a moment and slowly drank it  i am not of those he announced who expect service for nothing especially good service such as yours watch for the postman dear lady any morning this week there may come for you a pleasant little surprise  she leaned over and patted his arm  you are a prince she murmured but tell me who is the gravelooking young man  selingman glanced up norgate who had been standing at the bar with baring was passing a few feet away  the rakes progress the former quoted solemnly  selingman raised his glass  come and join us he invited  norgate shook his head slightly and passed on selingman leaned a little forward watching his departing figure the buoyant goodnature seemed to have faded out of his face  if you could get that young man to talk now helda he muttered it would be an achievement  she glanced after him to me she declared he looks one of the difficult sort  he is an englishman with a grievance selingman continued if the grievance cuts deep enough he maybut we gossip  the other was a navy man the girl remarked his name is baring  selingman nodded  you need not bother about him he said if it is possible for him to be of use that is arranged for in another quarter so let us finish our wine and separate that letter shall surely come have no fear  selingman strolled away a few minutes later baring had returned to mrs paston benedek and norgate had resumed his place in the box selingman with a goldtopped cane under his arm a fresh cigar between his lips and a broad smile of goodfellowship upon his face strolled down one of the wings of the promenade suddenly he came to a standstill in the box opposite to him norgate and hebblethwaite were seated side by side selingman regarded them for a moment steadfastly  a friend of hebblethwaites he muttered hebblethwaitethe one man whom berlin doubts  he withdrew a little into the shadows his eyes fixed upon the box a little way off in the stalls mrs paston benedek was whispering to baring further back in the promenade helda was entertaining a little party of friends selingmans eyes remained fixed upon norgate     chapter xii   mrs paston benedek on the following afternoon sat in one corner of the very comfortable lounge set with its back to the light in her charming drawingroom norgate sat in the other  i think it is perfectly sweet of you to come she declared i do not care how many enemies i makei will certainly dine with you tonight how i shall manage it i do not yet know you shall call for me here at eight oclockor say a quarter past then we need not hurry away too early from the club if captain baring is there perhaps it would be better if you did not speak of our engagement  norgate sighed  what is the wonderful attraction about baring he asked discontentedly  really there isnt any she replied i like to be kind that is all i do not like to hurt anybodys feelings and i know that captain baring would like very much to dine with me tonight himself i was obliged to throw him over last night because of mr selingmans arrival  you have not always been so considerate he persisted why this especial care for barings feelings  she turned her head a little towards him she was leaning back in her corner of the lounge her hands clasped behind her head there was an elaborate carelessness about her pose which she numbered among her best effects  perhaps she retorted i too find your sudden attraction for me a little remarkable on those few occasions when you did honour us at the club before you left for berlin you were agreeable enough but i do not remember that you once asked me to dine with you there was no captain baring then  the truth is norgate confessed since i returned i have felt rather like hiding myself i dont care about going to my own club or visiting my own friends i came to the st jamess as a sort of compromise  you are not very flattering she complained  wouldnt you rather i were truthful asked norgate ones friends ones real friends are scarcely likely to be found at a mixed bridge club  after that she sighed i am going to telephone to captain baring he at any rate is in love with me and i need something to restore my selfrespect  in love with you perhaps but are you in love with him  she laughed softly at first but with an ever more insistent note of satire underlying her mirth  the woman she said who expects to get anything out of life worth having doesnt fall in love she may give a good deal she may seem to give everything but if she is wise she keeps her heart  poor baring  are you sure she asked fixing her brilliant eyes upon him that he needs your sympathy he is very much in love with me and there are times when i could almost persuade myself that i am in love with him at any rate he attracts me  norgate was momentarily sententious the psychology of love he murmured looking into the fire is a queer study  once more she laughed at him  before you went to berlin she said you used not to talk of the psychology of love your methods so far as i remember them were a little different confess nowyou fell in love in berlin  norgate stifled a sudden desire to confide in his companion  at my age he exclaimed  it is true that it is not a susceptible age mrs benedek admitted you are in what i call your midyouth midyouth as a rule is an age of cynicism as you grow older you will appreciate more the luxury of emotion but tell me was it the little baroness who fascinated you she is a great beauty is she not  i took her out to dinner norgate observed therefore i suppose it was my duty to be in love with her  fancy sharing the same sofa she laughed with a rival of princes do you know that the baroness is a friend of mine she comes sometimes to london  i am much more interested in your love affair he protested  and i find far more interest in your future she insisted let us talk sensibly like good friends and companions what are you going to do they will not treat this affair seriously at the foreign office they cannot think that you were to blame  in a sense no he replied diplomatically however i am from their point of view a heinous offender i rather think i am going to be shelved for six months  just what one would expect from this horrible government mrs benedek exclaimed indignantly  what do you know about the government he asked are you taking up politics as well as the study of the higher auction  she sighed and her eyes were fixed upon him very earnestly as she declared you do not understand me my friend you never did i am not altogether frivolous i am not altogether an artist i have my serious moments  is this going to be one of them  dont make fun of me please she begged you are like so many englishmen directly a woman tries to talk seriously you will push her back into her place you like to treat her as something to frivol with and make love to is it your amour propre which is wounded when you feel sometimes forced to admit that she has as clear an insight into the more important things of life as you yourself  do you talk like that with baring he asked  for several seconds she was silent her eyes had contracted a little she seemed to be seeking for some double meaning in his words  captain baring is an intelligent man she said and he is a man too who understands his own particular subject of course it is a pleasure to talk to him about it  i thought navy men as a rule he remarked were not communicative  do you call it communicative she enquired to discuss the subject you love best with your greatest friend but let us not talk any more of captain baring it is in you just now that i am interested you and your future you seem to think that your friends at the foreign office are not going to find you another positionfor some time at any rate you are not one of those men who think of nothing but sport and amusing themselves what are you going to do during the next few months  at present he confessed thoughtfully i have only the vaguest ideas perhaps you could help me  perhaps i could she admitted we will talk of that another time if you like  it was obvious that she was speaking under a certain tension the silence which ensued was significant  why not now he asked  it is too soon she answered and you would not understand i might say things to you which would perhaps end our friendship which would give you a wrong impression no let us stay just as we are for a little time  this is most tantalising grumbled norgate  she leaned over and patted his hand  have patience my friend she whispered the great things come to those who wait  an interruption commonplace enough yet in its way startling checked the words which were already upon his lips the telephone bell from the little instrument on the table within a few feet of them rang insistently for a moment mrs benedek herself appeared taken by surprise then she raised the receiver to her ear  my friend she said to norgate you must excuse me i told them distinctly to disconnect the instrument so that it rang only in my bedroom i am disobeyed but no matter who is that  norgate leaned back in his place his companions little interjection however was irresistible he glanced towards her there was a slight flush of colour in her cheeks her head was moving slowly as though keeping pace to the words spoken at the other end suddenly she laughed  do not be so foolish she said yes of course you keep your share of the bargain and i mine at eight oclock then i will say no more now as i am engaged with a visitor au revoir  she set down the receiver and turned towards norgate who was turning the pages of an illustrated paper she made a little grimace  oh but life is very queer she declared how i love it now i am going to make you look glum if indeed you do care just that little bit which is all you know of caring perhaps you will be a little disappointed tell me that you are or my vanity will be hurt listen and prepare tonight i cannot dine with you  he turned deliberately around you are going to throw me over he demanded looking at her steadfastly  to throw you over dear friend she repeated cheerfully you would do just the same if you were in my position  it is an affair of duty he persisted or the triumph of a rival  she made a grimace at him it is an affair of duty she admitted but it is certainly with a rival that i must dine  he moved a little nearer to her on the lounge  tell me on your honour he said that you are not dining with baring and i will forgive  for a moment she seemed as though she were summoning all her courage to tell the lie which he half expected instead she changed her mind  do not be unkind she begged i am dining with captain baring the poor man is distracted you know that i cannot bear to hurt people be kind this once you may take my engagement book you may fill it up as you will but tonight i must dine with him consider my friend you may have many months before you in london captain baring finishes his work at the admiralty today and leaves for portsmouth tomorrow morning he may not be in london again for some time i promised him long ago that i would dine with him tonight on one condition that condition he is keeping i cannot break my word  norgate rose gloomily to his feet  of course he said i dont want to be unreasonable and any one can see the poor fellow is head over ears in love with you  she took his arm as she led him towards the door  listen she promised laughing into his face when you are as much in love with me as he is i will put off every other engagement i have in the world and i will dine with you you understand we shall meet later at the club i hope until then au revoir  norgate hailed a taxi outside and was driven at once to the nearest telephone call office there after some search in the directory he rang up a number and enquired for captain baring there was a delay of about five minutes then baring spoke from the other end of the telephone  who is it wants me he enquired rather impatiently  are you baring norgate asked deepening his voice a little  yes who are you  i am a friend norgate answered slowly  what the devil do you mean by a friend was the irritated reply i am engaged here most particularly  there can be nothing so important norgate declared as the warning i am charged to give to you remember that it is a friend who speaks there is a train about five oclock to portsmouth your work is finished take that train and stay away from london  norgate set down the receiver without listening to the tangle of exclamations from the other end and walked quickly out of the shop he reentered his taxi  the st jamess club he ordered     chapter xiii   norgate found selingman in the little drawingroom of the club reclining in an easychair a small cup of black coffee by his side he appeared to be exceedingly irate at the performance of his partner in a recent rubber and he seized upon norgate as a possibly sympathetic confidant  listen to me for one moment he begged and tell me whether i have not the right to be aggrieved i go in on my own hand no trump i am a careful declarer i play here every day when i am in london and they know me well to be a careful declarer my partneri do not know his name i hope i shall never know his name i hope i shall never see him againhe takes me out into what you ask into diamonds i am regretful but i recognise as i believe a necessity i ask you of what do you suppose his hand consists down goes my no trump on the tablea good a very good no trump he has in his hand the ace king queen and five diamonds the king of clubs guarded the ace and two little hearts and he takes me out into diamonds from no trumps with a score at love all two pences they had persuaded me to play too and it was the rubber game afterwards he said to me you seem annoyed and i replied i am annoyed and i am i come in here to drink coffee and cool myself presently i will cut into another rubber where that young man is not perhaps our friend mrs benedek will be here you and i and mrs benedek but not if we can help it the lady who smokes the small black cigars she is very amiable but i cannot attend to the game while she sits there opposite to me she fascinates me in germany sometimes our women smoke cigarettes but cigars and in public never  well get a rubber presently i dare say norgate remarked settling himself in an easychair hows business  business is very good selingman declared it is so good that i must be in london for another week or so before i set off to the provinces it grows and grows all the time soon i must find a manager to take over some of my work here at my time of life one likes to enjoy i love to be in london i do not like these journeys to newcastle and liverpool and places a long way off in london i am happy you should go into business young man it is not well for you to do nothing  do you think i should be useful in the crockery trade norgate asked  herr selingman appeared to take the enquiry quite seriously  why not he demanded you are welleducated you have address you have intelligence mrs benedek has spoken very highly of you but youoh no it would not suit you at all to plunge yourself into commerce nor would it suit you i think to push the affairs of a prosperous german concern you are very english mr norgate is that not so  not aggressively norgate replied as a matter of fact i am rather fed up with my own country just now  mr selingman sat quite still in his chair some signs of a change which came to him occasionally were visible in his face he was for that moment no longer the huge overgrown schoolboy bubbling over with the joy and appetite of life his face seemed to have resolved itself into sterner lines it was the face of a thinker  there are other englishmen besides you selingman said who are a littlewhat you call fed up with your country you have much common sense you do not believe that yours is the only country in the world you like sometimes to hear plain speech from one who knows  without a doubt norgate assented  mr selingman stroked his knee with his fat hand  you in england he continued you are too prosperous very very slowly the country is drifting into the hands of the people a country that is governed entirely by the people goes down down down your classes are losing their hold and their influence you have gone from tory to whig from whig to liberal from liberal to radical and soon it will be the socialists who govern you know what will come then colonies what do your radicals care about colonies institutions what do they care about institutions all you who have inherited money they will bleed you will become worse than a nation of shopkeepers you will be an illustration to all the world of the dangers of democracy so i go on i tell you why that comes about you are in the continent of europe and you will not do as europe does you are a nation outside you have believed in yourselves and believed in yourselves till you think that you are infallible before long will come the revolution it will be a worse revolution than the french revolution  norgate smiled too much common sense about us i think mr selingman for such happenings he declared i grant you that the classes are getting the worst of it so far as regards the government of the country but i cant quite see the future that you depict  good englishman herr selingman murmured approvingly that is your proper attitude you do not see because you will not see i tell you that the best thing in all the world would be a little bloodletting you do not like your government would it not please you to see them humiliated just a little  in what way  oh there are ways selingman declared a little gentle smack like thishis two hands came together with a crash which echoed through the rooma little smack from germany would do the business people would open their eyes and begin to understand a radical government may fill your factories with orders and rob the rich to increase the prosperity of the poor but it will not keep you a great nation amongst the others  norgate nodded  you seem to have studied the question pretty closely he remarked  i study the subject closely selingman went on because my interests are yours my profits are made in england i am german born but i am english too in feeling to me the two nations are one we are of the same race that is why i am sorrowful when i see england slipping back that is why i would like to see her have just a little lesson  selingman paused norgate rose to his feet and stood on the hearthrug with his elbow upon the mantelpiece  twice we have come as far as that mr selingman he pointed out england requires a little lesson you have something in your mind behind that something which you are half inclined to say to me isnt that so why not go on  because i am not sure of you selingman confessed frankly because you might misunderstand what i say and we should be friends no longer and you would say silly things about me and my views therefore i like to keep you for a friend and i go no further at present you say that you are a little angry with your country but you englishmen are so very prejudiced so very quick to take offence so very insular if i may use the word i do not know how angry you are with your country i do not know if your mind is so big and broad that you would be willing to see her suffer a little for her greater good ah but the lady comes at last  mrs benedek was accompanied by a tall middleaged man of fair complexion whom selingman greeted with marked respect she turned to norgate  let me present you she said to prince edward of lenemaurmr francis norgate  the two men shook hands  i played golf with you once at woking norgate reminded his new acquaintance  i not only remember it prince edward answered but i remember the result you beat me three up and we were to have had a return but you had to leave for paris on the next day  you will be able to have your return match now mrs benedek observed mr norgate is going to be in england for some time let us play bridge i have to leave early tonighti am dining outand i should like to make a little money  they strolled into the bridgeroom selingman hung behind with norgate  soon he suggested we must finish our talk is it not so dine with me tonight mrs benedek has deserted me we will eat at the milan grill the cooking there is tolerable and they have some rhine winebut you shall taste it  thank you norgate assented i shall be very pleased  they played three or four rubbers then mrs benedek glanced at the clock  i must go she announced i am dining at eight oclock  stay but for one moment selingman begged we will all take a little mixed vermouth together i shall tell the excellent horton how to prepare it plenty of lemonpeel and just a dashbut i will not give my secret away  he called the steward and whispered some instructions in his ear while they were waiting for the result a man came in with an evening paper in his hand he looked across the room to a table beyond that at which norgate and his friends were playing  heard the news monty he asked  no what is it was the prompt enquiry  poor old baring  the newcomer stopped short for the first time he noticed mrs benedek she half rose from her chair however and her eyes were fixed upon him  what is it she exclaimed what has happened  there was a moments awkward silence mrs benedek snatched the paper away from the mans fingers and read the little paragraph out aloud for a moment she was deathly white  what is it selingman demanded  freddy baring she whisperedcaptain baringshot himself in his room at the admiralty this afternoon some one telephoned to him five minutes later he was founddeada bullet wound through his temple give me my chair please i think that i am going to faint     chapter xiv   selingman and norgate dined together that evening in a corner of a large popular grillroom near the strand they were still suffering from the shock of the recent tragedy they both rather avoided the topic of barings sudden death selingman made but one direct allusion to it  only yesterday he remarked i said to little berthai have known her so long that i call her always berthathat this bureau work was bad for baring when i was over last a few months ago he was the picture of health yesterday he looked wild and worried he was at work with others they say at the admiralty upon some new invention poor fellow  norgate conscious of a curious callousness which even he himself found inexplicable made some conventional reply only selingman began to talk of other matters  truly he observed a visit to your country is good for the patriotic german behold here in london we are welcomed by a german maître dhôtel we are waited on by a german waiter we drink german wine we eat off what i very well know is german crockery  and some day i suppose norgate put in we are to be german subjects isnt that so  selingmans denial was almost unduly emphatic  never he exclaimed there is nothing so foolish as the way many of you english seem to regard us germans as though we were wild beasts of prey now it gives me pleasure to talk with a man like yourself mr norgate i like to look a little into the future and speculate as to our two countries above all things this thing i do truly know the german nation stands for peace yet in order that peace shall everywhere prevail a small war a humanelyconducted war may sometime within the future one must believe take place it would last but a short time but it might lead to great changes i have sometimes thought my young friend norgate that such a war might be the greatest blessing which england could ever experience  as a discipline you mean norgate murmured  as a cleansing tonic selingman declared it would sweep out your radical government it would bring the classes back to power it would kindle in the spirits of your coming generation the spark of that patriotism which is alas just now a very feeble flame what do you think you agree with me eh  it is going a long way norgate said cautiously to approve of a form of discipline so stringent  but not too faroh believe me not too far selingman insisted if that war should come it would come solely with the idea of sweeping away this government which is most distasteful to all german politicians it would come solely with the idea that with a new form of government here more solid and lasting terms of friendship could be arranged between germany and england  a very interesting theory norgate remarked do you believe in it yourself  selingman paused to give an order to a waiter his tone suddenly became more serious he pointed to the menu  they have dared he exclaimed to bring us hollandaise sauce with the asparagus a gastronomic indignity it is such things as this which would endanger the entente between our countries  i dont mind hollandaise norgate ventured  then of eating you know very little herr selingman pronounced there is only one sauce to be served with asparagus and that is finely drawn butter i have explained to the maître dhôtel he must bring us what i desire meanwhile we spoke i think of our two countries you asked me a question i do indeed believe in the theories which i have been advancing  but wouldnt a war smash up your crockery business norgate asked  for six months yes and after that six months fortunes for all of us trade such as the world has never known a settled peace a real union between two great and friendly countries i wish england well i love england i love my holidays over here my business trips which are holidays in themselves and for their sake and for my own sake i say that just a little wrestle a slap on the cheek from one and a punch on the nose from the other and we should find ourselves  war is a very dangerous conflagration norgate remarked i cannot think of any experiment more hazardous  it is no experiment selingman declared it is a certainty all that we do in my country we do by what we call previously ascertained methods we test the ground in front of us before we plant our feet upon it we not only look into the future but we stretch out our hands we make the doubtful places sure our turn of mind is scientific our roadmaking and our bridgebuilding our empiremaking and our diplomacy they are all fashioned in the same manner if you could trust us mr norgate if you could trust yourself to work for the good of both countries we could make very good and profitable use of you during the next six months would you like to hear more  but i know nothing about crockery  would you like to hear more selingman repeated  i think i should  very well then selingman proceeded tomorrow we will talk of it there are some ways in which you might be very useful useful at the same time to your country and to ours your position might be somewhat peculiar but that you would be prepared for a short time to tolerate  peculiar in what respect norgate asked  selingman held his glass of yellow wine up to the light and criticised it for a moment he set it down empty  peculiar he explained inasmuch as you might seem to be working with germany whereas you were really englands best friend but let us leave these details until tomorrow we have talked enough of serious matters i have a box at the gaiety and we must not be latealso a supper party afterwards this is indeed a country for enjoyment tomorrow we speak of these things again you have seen our little german lady at the gaiety you have heard her sing and watch her dance well tonight you shall meet her  rosa morgen norgate exclaimed  selingman nodded complacently  she sups with us he announced she and others that is why when they spoke to me of going back for bridge tonight i pretended that i did not hear bridge is very good but there are other things tonight i am in a frivolous vein i have many friends amongst the young ladies of the gaiety you shall see how they will welcome me  you seem to have found your way about over here norgate remarked as he lit a cigar and waited while his companion paid the bill  i am a citizen of the world selingman admitted i enjoy myself as i go but i have my eyes always fixed upon the future i make many friends and i do not lose them i set my face towards the pleasant places and i keep it in that direction it is the cult of some to be miserable it is mine to be happy the person who does most good in the world is the person who reflects the greatest amount of happiness therefore i am a philanthropist you shall learn from me my young friend how to banish some of that gloom from your face you shall learn how to find happiness  they made their way across to the gaiety where selingman was a very conspicuous figure in the largest and most conspicuous box he watched with complacency the delivery of enormous bouquets to the principal artistes and received their little bow of thanks with spontaneous and unaffected graciousness afterwards he dragged norgate round to the stagedoor installed him in a taxi and handed over to his escort two or three of his guests  i entrust you mr norgate he declared with our one german export more wonderful even than my crockerymiss rosa morgen take good care of her and bring her to the milan the other young ladies are my honoured guests but they are also miss morgens she will tell you their names i have others to look after  norgates last glimpse of selingman was on the pavement outside the theatre surrounded by a little group of lighthearted girls and a few young men  he is perfectly wonderful our mr selingman miss morgen murmured as they started off tell me how long you have known him mr norgate  four days norgate replied  she screamed with laughter  it is so like him she declared he makes friends everywhere a day is sufficient he gives such wonderful parties i do not know why we all like to come but we do i suppose that we all get halfadozen invitations to supper most nights but there is not one of us who does not put off everything to sup with mr selingman he sits in the middleoh you shall watch him tonightand what he says i do not know but we laugh and then we laugh again and every one is happy  i think he is the most irresistible person norgate agreed i met him two or three nights ago coming over from berlin and he spoke of nothing but crockery and politics tonight i dine with him and i find a different person  he is a perfect dear one of the other girls exclaimed but so curiously inquisitive i have a great friend a gunner whom i brought with me to one of his parties and he is always asking me questions about him and his work i had to absolutely worry dick so as to be able to answer all his questions didnt i rosa  miss morgen nodded a little guardedly  i should not call him really inquisitive she said it is because he likes to seem interested in the subject which interests you  i am not at all sure whether that is true the other young lady objected you remember when ellison gray was always around with us why i know that mr selingman simply worried mauds life out of her to get a little model of his aeroplane from him there were no end of things he wanted to know about cubic feet and dimensions he is a dear all the same  a perfect dear the others echoed  they drew up outside the milan rosa morgen turned to their escort  we will meet you in the hall in five minutes she said then we can all go together and find mr selingman     chapter xv   selingmans supper party was in some respects both distinctive and unusual norgate looking around him thought that he had never in his life been among such a motley assemblage of people there were eight or nine musical comedy young ladies a couple of young soldiers one of whom he knew slightly who had arrived as escorts to two of the young ladies prince edward of lenemaur a youthful peer who by various misdemeanours had placed himself outside the pale of any save the most bohemian society and several other men whose faces were unfamiliar they occupied a round table just inside the door of the restaurant and they sat there till long after the lights were lowered the conversation all the time was of the most general and frivolous description and selingman as the hour grew later seemed to grow larger and redder and more joyous the only hint at any serious conversation came from the musical comedy star who sat at norgates left  do you know our host very well she asked norgate once  i am afraid i cant say that i know him well at all norgate replied i met him in the train coming from berlin a few nights ago  he is the most original person she declared he entertains whenever he has a chance he makes new friends every hour he eats and drinks and seems always to be enjoying himself like an overgrown baby and yet all the time there is such a very serious side to him one feels that he has a purpose in it all  perhaps he has norgate ventured  perhaps he has she agreed lowering her voice a little at least i believe one thing i believe that he is a good german and yet a great friend of england  you dont find the two incompatible then  i do not the young lady replied firmly i do not understand everything of course but i am half german and half english so i can appreciate both sides and i do believe that mr selingman if he had not been so immersed in his business might have been a great politician  the conversation drifted into other channels norgate was obliged to give some attention to the more frivolous young lady on his right the general exodus to the bar smokingroom only took place long after midnight every one was speaking of going on to a supper club to dance and norgate quietly slipped away he took a hurried leave of his host  you will excuse me wont you he begged enjoyed my evening tremendously id like you to come and dine with me one night  we will meet at the club tomorrow afternoon selingman declared but why not come on with us now you are not weary they are taking me to a supper club these young people i have engaged myself to dance with miss morgeni who weigh nineteen stone it will be a thing to see come with us  norgate excused himself and left the place a moment later it was a fine night and he walked slowly towards pall mall deep in thought outside one of the big clubs on the righthand side a man descended from a taxicab just as norgate was passing they almost ran into one another  norgate you reprobate  hebblethwaite  the latter passed his arm through the young mans and led him towards the club steps  come in and have a drink he invited i am just up from the house i do wish you could get some of your military friends to stop worrying us norgate two hours tonight have been absolutely wasted because they would talk national service and heckle us about the territorials  ill have the drink although heaven knows i dont need any norgate replied as for the rest i am all on the side of the hecklers you ought to know that  they drew two easychairs together in a corner of the great deserted smokingroom and hebblethwaite ordered the whiskies and sodas  yes he remarked i forgot you are on the other side arent you i havent a word to say against the navy we spend more money than is necessary upon it and i stick out for economy whenever i can but as regards the army my theory is that it is useless its only a temptation to us to meddle in things that dont concern us the navy is sufficient to defend these shores if any one were foolish enough to wish to attack us if we need an army at all we should need one ten times the size but we dont nature has seen to that yet tonight when i was particularly anxious to get on with some important domestic legislation we had to sit and listen to hours of prosy military talk the possibilities of this and that they dont realise these brainfogged exmilitary men that we are living in days of common sense before many years have passed war will belong to the days of romance  for a practical politician hebblethwaite norgate pronounced you have some of the rottenest ideas i ever knew you know perfectly well that if germany attacked france we are almost committed to chip in we couldnt sit still could we and see calais and boulogne dieppe and ostend fortified against us  if germany should attack france hebblethwaite repeated if prussia should send an expeditionary force to cornwall or the siamese should declare themselves on the side of the ulster men we must keep in politics to possibilities that are reasonable  take another view of the same case then norgate continued supposing germany should violate belgiums independence  you silly idiot hebblethwaite exclaimed as he took a long draught of his whisky and soda lit a cigar and leaned back in his chair the neutrality of belgium is guaranteed by a treaty actually signed by germany  supposing she should break her treaty norgate persisted i told you what i heard in the train the other night it isnt for nothing that that sort of work is going on  hebblethwaite shook his head  you are incorrigible norgate germany is one of the powers of europe undoubtedly possessing a high sense of honour and rectitude of conduct if any nation possesses a national conscience and an appreciation of national ethics they do germany would be less likely than any nation in the world to break a treaty  hebblethwaite norgate declared solemnly if you didnt understand the temperament and character of your constituents better than you do the german temperament and character you would never have set your foot across the threshold of westminster the fact of it is youre a domestic politician of the very highest order but as regards foreign affairs and the greater side of international politics well all i can say is youve as little grasp of them as a local mayor might have  look here young fellow hebblethwaite protested do you know that you are talking to a cabinet minister  to a very possible prime minister norgate replied but i am going to tell you what i think all the same im fed up with you all i bring you some certain and sure information proving conclusively that germany is maintaining an extraordinary system of espionage over here and you tell me to mind my own business i tell you hebblethwaite you and your party are thundering good legislators but youll ruin the country before youve finished ive had enough it seems to me we thoroughly deserve the shaking up were going to get i am going to turn german spy myself and work for the other side  you do if theres anything in it hebblethwaite retorted with a grin i promise we wont arrest you you shall hop around the country at your own sweet will preach teutonic doctrines and pave the way for the coming of the conquerors youll have to keep away from our arsenals and our flying places because our service men are so prejudiced short of that you can do what you like  norgate finished his cigar in silence then he threw the end into the fireplace finished his whisky and soda and rose  hebblethwaite he said this is the second time youve treated me like this i shall give you another chance theres just one way i may be of use and i am going to take it on if i get into trouble about it it will be your fault but next time i come and talk with you youll have to listen to me if i shove the words down your throat good night  good night norgate hebblethwaite replied pleasantly what you want is a week or twos change somewhere to get this antiteuton fever out of your veins i think well send you to tokyo and let you have a turn with the geishas in the cherry groves  i wouldnt go out for your government anyway norgate declared ive given you fair warning i am going in on the other side im fed up with the england you fellows represent  nice breezy sort of chap you are for a pal hebblethwaite grumbled well get along with you then come and look me up when youre in a better humour  i shall probably find you in a worse one norgate retorted good night                                       it was one oclock when norgate let himself into his rooms to his surprise the electric lights were burning in his sittingroom he entered a little abruptly and stopped short upon the threshold a slim figure in dark travelling clothes with veil pushed back was lying curled up on his sofa she stirred a little at his coming opened her eyes and looked at him     chapter xvi   throughout those weeks and months of tangled lurid sensations of amazing happenings which were yet to come norgate never once forgot that illuminative rush of fierce yet sweet feelings which suddenly thrilled his pulses he understood in that moment the intolerable depression of the last few days he realised the absolute advent of the one experience hitherto missing from his life the very intensity of his feelings kept him silent kept him unresponsive to her impetuous but unspoken welcome her arms dropped to her side her lips for a moment quivered her voice notwithstanding her efforts to control it shook a little she was no longer the brilliant young court beauty of vienna she was a tired and disappointed girl  you are surprisedi should not have come here it was such a foolish impulse  she caught up her gloves feverishly but norgates moment of stupefaction had passed he clasped her hands  forgive me he begged it is really youanna  his words were almost incoherent but his tone was convincing her fears passed away  you dont wonder that i was a little surprised do you he exclaimed you were not only the last person whom i was thinking of but you were certainly the last person whom i expected to see in london or to welcome here  but why she asked i told you that i came often to this country  i remember norgate admitted yet i never ventured to hope  of course i should not have come here she interrupted it was absurd of me and at such an hour and yet i am staying only a few hundred yards away the temptation tonight was irresistible i felt as one sometimes does in this queer enormous citylonely i telephoned and your servant who answered me said that you were expected back at any moment then i came myself  you cannot imagine that i am not glad to see you he said earnestly  i want to believe that you are glad she answered i have been restless ever since you left tell me at once what did they say to you here  i am practically shelved he told her bitterly in twelve months time perhaps i may be offered something in america or asiacountries where diplomacy languishes in a word your mighty autocrat has spoken the word and i am sacrificed  she moved towards the window  i am stifled she exclaimed open it wide please  he threw it open they looked out eastwards the roar of the night was passing here and there were great black spaces on the thames a skysign or two remained the blue opalescent glare from the gaiety dome still shone the curving lights which spanned the bridges and fringed the embankment still glittered the air even here high up as they were on the seventh story of the building seemed heavy and lifeless  there is a storm coming she said i have felt it for days  she stood looking out pale her large eyes strained as though seeking to read something which eluded her in the clouds or the shadows which hung over the city she had rather the air of a frightened but eager child she rested her fingers upon his arm not exactly affectionately but as though she felt the need of some protection  do you know she whispered the feeling of this storm has been in my heart for days i am afraidafraid for all of us  afraid of what he asked gently  afraid she went on because it seems to me that i can hear at times like this when one is alone the sound of what one of your writers called footsteps amongst the hills footsteps falling upon wool muffled yet somehow ominous there is trouble coming i know it i am sure of it  in this country they do not think so he reminded her most of our great statesmen of today have come to the conclusion that there will be no more war  you have no great statesmen she answered simply you have plenty of men who would make very fine local administrators but you have no statesmen or you would have provided for what is coming  there was a curious conviction in her words a sense of one speaking who has seen the truth  tell me he asked is there anything that you know of  ah but that i may not tell you she interrupted turning away from the window of myself just now i say nothingonly of you i am here for a day or two it is through me that you have suffered this humiliation i wanted to know just how far it went is there anything i can do  what could any one do he asked i am the victim of circumstances  but for a whole year she exclaimed you are not like so many young englishmen you do not wish to spend your time playing polo and golf and shooting you must do something what are you going to do with that year  he moved across the room and took a cigarette from a box  give me something to drink please she begged  he opened a cupboard in his sideboard and gave her some sodawater she had still the air of waiting for his reply  what am i going to do he repeated well here i am with an idle twelve months it makes no difference to anybody what time i get up what time i go to bed with whom or how i spend the day i suppose to some people it would sound like paradise to me it is hateful shall i be your secretary  how do you know that i need a secretary she asked  how should i he replied yet you are not altogether an idler in life are you  for a moment she did not answer the silence in the room was almost impressive he looked at her over the top of the sodawater syphon whose handle he was manipulating  what do you imagine might be my occupation then she asked  i have heard it suggested he said slowly that you have been a useful intermediary in carrying messages of the utmost importance between the kaiser and the emperor of austria  your intelligence department is not so bad she remarked it is true why not at the german court i count for little perhaps in austria my father was the emperors only personal friend my mother was scarcely popular thereshe was too completely englishbut since my father died the emperor will scarcely let me stay a week away yes your information is perhaps true i will supplement it if you like since our little affair in the café de berlin the kaiser who went out of his way to insist upon your removal from berlin has notified the emperor that he would prefer to receive his most private dispatches either through the regular diplomatic channels or by some other messenger  norgates emphatic expletive was only halfstifled as she continued  for myself she said with a shrug i am not sorry i found it very interesting but of late those feelings of which i have told you have taken hold of me i have felt as though a terrible shadow were brooding over the world  let me ask you once more he begged why are you in london  i received a wire from the emperor she explained instructing me to return at once to vienna if i go there i know very well that i shall not be allowed to leave the city i have been trusted implicitly and they will keep me practically a prisoner they will think that i may feel a resentment against the kaiser and they will be afraid therefore i came here i have every excuse for coming it is according to my original plans you will find that by tomorrow morning i shall have a second message from vienna all the same i am not sure that i shall go  there was a ring at the bell norgate started and anna looked at the clock  who is that she asked do you see the time  norgate moved to the door and threw it open a waiter stood there  what do you want demanded norgate  the man pointed to the indicator  the bell rang sir he replied is there anything i can get for you  i rang no bell norgate asserted your indicator must be out of order  norgate would have closed the door but anna intervened  tell the waiter i wish to speak to him she begged  the man advanced at once into the room and glanced interrogatively at anna she addressed him suddenly in austrian and he replied without hesitation she nodded then she turned to norgate and laughed softly  you see how perfect the system is she said i was followed here passed on to your floorwaiter you are a spy are you not she added turning to the man but of course you are  madame the man protested i do not understand  you can go away she replied you can tell herr selingman in your mornings report that i came to mr norgates rooms at an early hour in the morning and spent an hour talking with him you can go now  the man withdrew without remark he was a quiet inoffensivelooking person with sallow complexion suave but silent manners norgate closed the door behind him  a victim of the system which all europe knows of except you people she remarked lightly well after this i must be careful walk with me to my hotel  of course he assented  they made their way along the silent corridors to the lift out into the streets empty of traffic now save for the wateringcarts and street scavengers  will there be trouble for you norgate asked at last because of this  there is more trouble in my own heart she told him quietly i feel strangely disturbed uncertain which way to move let me take your armso i like to walk like that somehow i think mr francis norgate that that little fracas in the café de berlin is going to make a great difference in both our lives i know now what i had begun to believe like all the trusted agents of sovereigns i have become an object of suspicion well we shall see at least i am glad to know that there is some one whom i can trust perhaps tomorrow i will tell you all that is in my heart we might even if you wished it if you were willing to face a few risks we might even work together to hold back the thunder so good night my friend she added turning suddenly around  he held her hand for a moment as they stood together on the pavement outside her hotel for a single moment he fancied that there was a change in that curious personal aloofness which seemed so distinctive of her it passed however as she turned from him with her usual halfinsolent half gracious little nod  tomorrow she directed you must ring me up let it be at eleven oclock     chapter xvii   the ambassador glanced at the clock as he entered his library to greet his early morning visitor it was barely nine oclock  dear friend he exclaimed as he held out his hands i am distressed to keep you waiting such zeal in our affairs must however not remain unnoticed i will remember it in my reports  anna smiled as he stooped to kiss her fingers  i had special reasons she explained for my haste i was disappointed indeed that i could not see you last night  i was at windsor her host remarked now come sit there in the easychair by the side of my table my secretaries have not yet arrived we shall be entirely undisturbed i have ordered coffee here of which we will partake together a compromising meal to share dear baroness but in the library of my own house it may be excused the princess sends her love she will be glad if you will go to her apartments after we have finished our talk  a servant entered with a tray spread a cloth on a small round table upon which he set out coffee with rolls and butter and preserves for a few moments they talked lightly of the weather of her crossing of mutual friends in berlin and vienna then anna as soon as they were alone leaned a little forward in her chair  you know that i have a sort of mission to you she said i should not call it that perhaps but it comes to very nearly the same thing the emperor has charged me to express to you and to count lanyoki his most earnest desire that if the things should come which we know of you both maintain your position here at any cost the emperors last words to me were if war is to come it may be the will of god we are ready but there is one country which must be kept from the ranks of our enemies that country is england england must be dealt with diplomatically he looks across the continent to you prince this is the friendly message which i have brought from his own lips  the prince stirred his coffee thoughtfully he was a man just passing middleage with grey hair thin in places but carefully trimmed brushed sedulously back from his high forehead his moustache too was grey and his face was heavily lined but his eyes clear and bright were almost the eyes of a young man  you can reassure the emperor he declared as you may imagine my supply of information here is plentiful if those things should come that we know of it is my firm belief that with some reasonable yet nominal considerations this government will never lend itself to war  you really believe that she asked earnestly  i do her companion assured her i try to be fair in my judgments london is a pleasant city to live in and english people are agreeable and wellbred but they are a people absolutely without vital impulses patriotism belongs to their poetry books indolence has stagnated their blood they are like a nation under a spell with their faces turned towards the pleasant and desirable things only a few months ago they even further reduced the size of their ridiculous army and threw cold water upon a scheme for raising untrained help in case of emergency even their navy estimates are passed with difficulty the government which is conducting the destinies of a people like this which believes that war belongs to a past age is never likely to become a menace to us  anna drew a little sigh and lit the cigarette which the prince passed her she threw herself back in her chair with an air of contentment  it is so pleasant once more to be among the big things she declared in berlin i think they are not fond of me and they are so pompous and secretive tell me dear prince will you not be kinder to me tell me what is really going to happen  he moved his chair a little closer to hers  i see no reason he said cautiously why you should not be told events then will probably move in this direction provocation will be given by servia that is easily arranged tension will be caused austria will make enormous demands russia will remonstrate and before any one has time to breathe the clouds will part to let the lightnings through if anything we are overready straining with overreadiness  and the plan of campaign  austria and italy the prince continued slowly will easily keep russia in check germany will seize belgium and rush through to paris she will either impose her terms there or leave a secondclass army to conclude the campaign there will be plenty of time for her then to turn back and fall in with her allies against russia  and england anna asked supposing  the prince tapped the table with his forefinger  here he announced we conquer with diplomacy we have imbued the present cabinet even the minister who is responsible for the army with the idea that we stand for peace we shall seem to be the attacked party in this war we shall say to englandremain neutral it is not your quarrel and we will be capable of a great act of selfsacrifice we will withhold our fleet from bombarding the french towns england could do no more than deal with our fleet if she were at war she shall do the same without raising a finger no country could refuse so sane and businesslike an offer especially a country which will at once count upon its fingers how much it will save by not going to war  and afterwards  the prince shrugged his shoulders afterwards is inevitable  please go on she insisted  we shall occupy the whole of the coast from antwerp to havre the indemnity which france and russia will pay us will make us the mightiest nation on earth we shall play with england as a cat with a mouse and when the time comes well perhaps that will do the prince concluded smiling  anna was silent for several moments  i am a woman you know she said simply and this sounds in a way terrible yet for months i have felt it coming  there is nothing terrible about it the prince replied if you keep the great principles of progress always before you if a million or so of lives are sacrificed the great germany of the future gathering under her wings the peoples of the world will raise them to a pitch of culture and contentment and happiness which will more than atone for the sacrifices of today it is after all the future to which we must look  a telephone bell rang at the princes elbow he listened for a moment and nodded  an urgent visitor demands a moment of my time he said rising  i have taken already too much anna declared but i felt it was time that i heard the truth they fence with me so in berlin and believe me prince herschfeld in vienna the emperor is almost wholly ignorant of what is planned  the door was opened behind them the prince turned around a young man had ushered in herr selingman for a moment the latter looked steadily at anna then he glanced at the ambassador as though questioningly  you two must have met the prince murmured  we have met anna declared smiling as she made her way towards the door but we do not know one another it is best like that herr selingman and i work in the same army  but i madame am the sergeant selingman interrupted with a low bow whilst you are upon the staff  she laughed as she made her adieux and departed the door closed heavily behind her selingman came a little further into the room  you have read your dispatches this morning prince he asked  not yet the latter replied is there news then  selingman pointed to the closed door you have spoken for long with her  naturally the prince assented she is a confidential friend of the emperor she has been entrusted for the last two years with all the private dispatches between vienna and berlin  in your letters you will find news selingman declared she is pronounced suspect she is under my care at this moment a report was brought to me half an hour ago that she was here i came on at once myself i trust that i am in time  the prince stood quite silent for a moment  fortunately he answered coolly i have told her nothing     chapter xviii   as norgate entered the premises of selingman horsfal and company a little later on the same morning he looked around him in some surprise he had expected to find a deserted warehouseprobably only an office he saw instead all the evidences of a thriving and prosperous business drays were coming and going from the busy door crates were piled up to the ceiling clerks with notebooks in their hands passed continually back and forth a small boy in a crowded office accepted his card and disappeared in a few minutes he led norgate into a waitingroom and handed him a paper  mr selingman is engaged with a buyer for a few moments sir he reported he will see you presently  norgate looked through the windows out into the warehouse there was no doubt whatever that this was a genuine and considerable trading concern presently the door of the inner office opened and he heard mr selingmans hearty tones  you have done well for yourself and well for your firm sir he was saying there is no one in germany or in the world who can produce crockery at the price we do they will give you a confirmation of the order in the office ah my young friend he went on turning to norgate you have kept your word then you are not a customer but you may walk in i shall make no money out of you but we will talk together  norgate passed on into a comfortably furnished office a little redolent of cigar smoke selingman bit off the end of a cigar and pushed the box towards his visitor  try one of these he invited german made but havana tobaccomild as milk  thank you norgate answered i dont smoke cigars in the morning ill have a cigarette if i may  as you will what do you think of us now that you have found your way here  your business seems to be genuine enough at all events norgate observed  genuine of course it is selingman declared emphatically do you think i should be fool enough to be connected with a bogus affair my father and my grandfather before me were manufacturers of crockery i can assure you that i am a very energetic and a very successful business man if i have interests in greater things those interests have developed naturally side by side with my commercial success when i say that i am a german that to me means more much more than if i were to declare myself a native of any other country in the world sit opposite to me there i have a quarter of an hour to spare i can show you if you will over a thousand designs of various articles i can show you ordersgenuine orders mindfrom some of your big wholesale houses which would astonish you or if you prefer it we can talk of affairs from another point of view what do you say  my interest in your crockery norgate announced is nonexistent i have come to hear your offer i have decided to retiretemporarily at any ratefrom the diplomatic service i understand that i am in disgrace and i resent it i resent having had to leave berlin except at my own choice i am looking for a job in some other walk of life  selingman nodded approvingly  forgive me he said but it is true then that you are in some way dependent upon your profession  i am not a pauper outside it norgate replied but that is not the sole question i need work an interest in life something to think about i must either find something to do or i shall go to abyssinia i should prefer an occupation here  i can help you selingman said slowly if you are a young man of common sense i can put you in the way of earning if you will a thousand pounds a year and your travelling expenses without interfering very much with your present mode of life  selling crockery  selingman flicked the ash from the end of his cigar he shook his head goodnaturedly  i am a judge of character young man he declared i pride myself upon that accomplishment i know very well that in you we have one with brains nevertheless i do not believe that you would sell my crockery  it seems easy enough norgate observed  it may seem easy selingman objected but it is not you have not i am convinced the gifts of a salesman you would not reason and argue with these obstinate british shopkeepers no your value to me would lie in other directionsin your social position your opportunities of meeting with a class above the commercial one in which i have made my few english friends and in your own intelligence  i scarcely see of what value these things would be to a vendor of crockery  they would be of no value at all selingman admitted it is not in the crockery business that i propose to make use of you i believe that we both know that we may dismiss it from our minds it is only fencing with words i will take you a little further you have heard by chance of the anglogerman peace society  the name sounds familiar norgate confessed i cant say that i know anything about it  it was i who inaugurated that body selingman announced it is i who direct its interests  congratulate you im sure you must find it uphill work sometimes  it is uphill work all the time the german agreed our great object is as you can guess from the title to promote goodfeeling between the two countries to heal up all possible breaches to soothe and dispel that pitiful jealousy of which alas too much exists it is not easy mr norgate it is not easy my young friend i meet with many disappointments yet it is a great and worthy undertaking  it sounds all right norgate observed where do i come in  i will explain to carry out the aims of our society there is much information which we are continually needing people in germany are often misled by the press here facts and opinions are presented to them often from an unpalatable point of view furthermore there is a section of the press which so far from being on our side seems deliberately to try to stir up illfeeling between the two countries we want to get behind the press for that purpose we need to know the truth about many matters and as the truth is a somewhat rare commodity we are willing to pay for it now we come face to face it will be your business if you accept my offer to collect such facts as may be useful to us  i see norgate remarked dubiously or rather i dont see at all give me an example of the sort of facts you require  mr selingman leaned a little forward in his chair he was warming to his subject  by all means there is the irish question then  the irish question norgate repeated but of what interest can that be to you in germany  listen selingman continued just as you in london have great newspapers which seem to devote themselves to stirring up bitter feeling between our two countries so we alas in germany have newspapers and journals which seem to devote all their energies to the same object now in this irish question the action of your government has been very much misrepresented in that section of our press and much condemned i should like to get at the truth from an authoritative source i should like to get it in such a form that i can present it fairly and honestly to the public of germany  that sounds reasonable enough norgate admitted there are several pamphlets  i do not want pamphlets selingman interrupted i want an actual report from ulster and dublin of the state of feeling in the country and if possible interviews with prominent people for this the society would pay a bonus over and above the travelling expenses and your salary if you accept my offer this is probably one of the first tasks i should commit to you  give me a few more examples norgate begged  another subject selingman continued upon which there is wide divergence of opinions in germany and a great deal of misrepresentation is the attitude of certain of your cabinet ministers towards the french entente how far they would support it at what they would stop short  isnt that rather a large order norgate ventured i dont number many cabinet ministers among my personal friends  selingman puffed away at his cigar for a moment then he withdrew it from his mouth and expelled large volumes of smoke  you are i believe intimately acquainted with mr hebblethwaite  how the mischief did you know that norgate demanded  our society selingman announced smiling ponderously has ramifications in every direction it is our business to know much we are collectors of information of every sort and nature  seems to have been part of your business to follow me about observed norgate  perhaps so if we thought it good for us to have you followed about we certainly should selingman admitted you see in germany he added leaning back in his chair we lay great stress upon detail and intelligence we get to know things not the smattering of things like you over here are too often content with but to know them thoroughly and understand them nothing ever takes us by surprise we are always forewarned so far as any one can we read the future  you are a very great nation without a doubt norgate acknowledged but my quarter of an hour is coming to an end tell me what else you would expect from me if i accepted this post  for the moment i can think of nothing selingman replied there are many ways in which we might make use of you but to name them now would be to look a little too far into the future  by whom should i really be employed  by the anglogerman peace society selingman answered promptly let me say a word more about that society i am proud of it i am one of those prominent business men who are responsible for its initiation i have given years of time and thought to it all our efforts are directed towards promoting a better understanding with england towards teaching the two countries to appreciate one another but in the background there is always something else it is useless to deny that the mistrust existing between the two countries has brought them more than once almost to the verge of war what we want is to be able at critical times to throw oil upon the troubled waters and if the worst should come if a war really should break out then we want to be able to act as peacemakers to heal as soon as possible any little sores that there may be and to enter afterwards upon a greater friendship with a purified england  it sounds very interesting norgate confessed i had an idea that you were proposing something quite different  please explain  to be perfectly frank with you norgate acknowledged i thought you wanted me to do the ordinary spy businesstraces of fortresses and particulars about guns and aeroplanes  rubbish my dear fellow selingman interrupted rubbish those things we leave to our military department and pray that the question of their use may never arise we are concerned wholly with economic and social questions and our great aim is not war but peace  very well then norgate decided i accept when shall i start  selingman laid his hand upon the others shoulder as he rose to his feet  young man he said you have come to a wise decision your salary will commence from the first of this month continue to live as usual let me have the opportunity of seeing you at the club and let me know each day where you can be found i will give you your instructions from day to day you will be doing a great work and mind you a patriotic work if ever your conscience should trouble you remember that you are working not for germany but for england  i will always remember that norgate promised as he turned away     chapter xix   norgate found anna waiting for him in the hall of the smaller hotel a little further westward to which she had moved he looked admiringly at her cool white muslin gown and the perfection of her somewhat airy toilette  you are five minutes late she remonstrated  i had to go into the city he apologised it was rather an important engagement soon i must tell you all about it  she looked at him a little curiously  i will be patient promised anna and ask no questions  you are still depressed  horribly she confessed i do not know why but london is getting on my nerves it is so hatefully stubbornly obstinately imperturbable i would find another word but it eludes me i think you would call it smug and it is so noisy can we not go somewhere for lunch where it is tranquil where one can rest and get away from this roar  we could go to ranelagh if you liked suggested norgate there are some polo matches on this afternoon but it will be quiet enough for lunch  i should love it she exclaimed let us go quickly  they lunched in a shady corner of the restaurant and sat afterwards under a great oak tree in a retired spot at the further end of the gardens anna was still a little thoughtful  do you know she told her companion that i have received a hint to present myself in berlin as soon as possible  are you going norgate demanded quickly  i am not sure she answered i feel that i must and yet in a sense i do not like to go i have a feeling that they do not mean to let me out of berlin again they think that i know too much  but why should they suddenly lose faith in you norgate asked  perhaps because the end is so near she replied they know that i have strong english sympathies perhaps they think that they would not bear the strain of the times which are coming  you are an even greater pessimist than i myself norgate observed do you really believe that the position is so critical  i know it she assured him i will not tell you all my reasons there is no need for me to break a trust without some definite object it seems to me that if your secret service department were worth anything at all your country would be in a state almost of panic what is it they are playing down there polo isnt it there are six or eight military teams crowds of your young officers making holiday and all the time krupps are working overtime working night and day and surrounded by sentries who shoot at sight any stranger there are parts of the country even now under martial law the streets and the plains resound to the footsteps of armed hosts  but there is no excuse for war he reminded her  an excuse is very easily found she sighed german diplomacy is clumsy enough but i think it can manage that do you know that this morning i had a letter from one of the greatest nobles of our own court at vienna he knew that i had intended to take a villa in normandy for august and september he has written purposely to warn me not to do so to warn me not to be away from austria or germany after the first of august  so soon he murmured  they listened to the band for a moment in the distance an unceasing stream of men and women were passing back and forth under the trees and around the polo field  it will come like a thunderbolt she said and when i think of it all that is english in me rises up in revolt in my heart i know so well that it is germany and germany alone who will provoke this war i am terrified for your country i admit it you see frankly the might of germany is only half understood here it is to be a war of conquest almost of extermination  that isnt the view of your friend selingman norgate reminded her he too hints at coming trouble but he speaks of it as just a salutary little lesson  selingman more than any one else in the world knows differently she assured him but come we talk too seriously on such a wonderful afternoon i have made up my mind on one point at least i will stay here for a few days longer london at this time of the year is wonderful besides i have promised the princess of thurm that i will go to ascot with her why should we talk of serious things any longer let us have a little rest let us promenade there with those other people and listen to the band and have some tea afterwards  norgate rose with alacrity and they strolled across the lawns and down towards the polo field very soon they found themselves meeting friends in every direction anna extricated herself from a little group of acquaintances who had suddenly claimed her and came over to norgate  prince herschfeld wants to talk to me for a few minutes she whispered i think i should like to hear what he has to say the princess is there too whom i have scarcely seen will you come and be presented  might i leave you with them for a few minutes norgate suggested there is a man here whom i want to talk to i will come back for you in half an hour  you must meet the prince first she insisted he was interested when he heard who you were  she turned to the little group who were awaiting her return the ambassador moved a little forward  prince she said may i present to you mr francis norgate mr norgate has just come from berlin  not with the kindliest feelings towards us i am afraid remarked the prince holding out his hand i hope however that you will not judge us as a nation too severely  on the contrary i was quite prepared to like germany norgate declared i was simply the victim of a rather unfortunate happening  there are many others besides myself who sincerely regret it the prince said courteously you are kind enough to leave the baroness for a little time in our charge we will take the greatest care of her and i hope that when you return you will give me the great pleasure of presenting you to the princess  you are very kind norgate murmured  we shall meet again then the prince declared as he turned away with anna by his side  in half an hour anna whispered smiling at him over her shoulder     chapter xx   the right honourable john william hebblethwaite strolled along by the rails of the polo ground exchanging greetings with friends feeling very well content with himself and the world generally a difficult session was drawing towards an end the problem which had defeated so many governments seemed at last under his skilful treatment capable of solution furthermore the session had been one which had added to his reputation both as an orator and a statesman there had been an astonishingly flattering picture of him in an illustrated paper that week and he was exceedingly pleased with the effect of the white hat which he was wearing at almost a jaunty angle he was a great man and he knew it nevertheless he greeted norgate with ample condescension and engaged him at once in conversation  delighted to see you in such company my young friend he declared i think that half an hours conversation with prince herschfeld would put some of those fireeating ideas out of your head thats the man whom we have to thank for the everyday improvement of our relations with germany  the prince has the reputation of being a great diplomatist norgate remarked  added to which hebblethwaite continued he came over here charged as you might say almost with a special mission he came over here to make friends with england he has done it so long as we have him in london there will never be any serious fear of misunderstanding between the two countries  what a howling optimist you are norgate observed  my young friend hebblethwaite protested i am nothing of the sort i am simply a man of much common sense enjoying i may add a few hours holiday bytheby norgate if one might venture to enquire without indiscretion who was the remarkably charming foreign lady whom you were escorting  the baroness von haase norgate replied she is an austrian  mr hebblethwaite sighed he rather posed as an admirer of the other sex  you young fellows he declared who travel about the world are much to be envied there is an elegance about the way these foreign women dress a care for detail in their clothes and jewellery and a carriage which one seldom finds here  they had reached the far end of the field having turned their backs in fact upon the polo altogether norgate suddenly abandoned their conversation  look here he said in an altered tone do you feel inclined to answer a few questions  for publication hebblethwaite asked drily you havent turned journalist by any chance have you  norgate shook his head nevertheless he admitted i have changed my profession the fact is that i have accepted a stipend of a thousand a year and have become a german spy  good luck to you exclaimed hebblethwaite laughing softly well fire away then you shall pick the brains of a cabinet minister at your leisure so long as youll give me a cigaretteand present me when we have finished to the baroness the country has no secrets from you norgate where will you begin  well youve been warned any way norgate reminded him as he offered his cigarette case now tell me it is part of my job to obtain from you a statement of your opinion as to exactly how far our entente with france is binding upon us  hebblethwaite cleared his throat  if this is for publication he remarked could you manage a photograph of myself at the head of the interview in these clothes and with this hat i rather fancy myself today a pocket kodak is of course part of the equipment of a german spy  sorry norgate regretted but thats a bit out of my line i am the disappointed diplomatist doing the dirty work among my late friends what we should like to know from mr hebblethwaite confidentially narrated to a personal friend is whether in the event of a war between germany and russia and france england would feel it her duty to intervene  hebblethwaite glanced around the throng of people had cleared off to watch the concluding stages of the match  i have a sovereign on this he remarked glancing at his card  which have you backed norgate enquired  the lancers  well its any odds on the hussars so youve lost your money norgate told him  hebblethwaite sighed resignedly well he said the question you submit is a problem which has presented itself to us once or twice although i may tell you that there isnt a soul in the cabinet except one who believes in the chance of war we are not a fireeating lot you know we are all for peace and we believe we are going to have it however to answer your questions more closely our obligations depend entirely upon the provocation giving cause for the war if france and russia provoked it in any way we should remain neutral if it were a war of sheer aggression from germany against france we might to a certain extent intervene there is not one of us however who believes for a single moment that germany would enter upon such a war  when you admit that we might to a certain extent intervene norgate said exactly how should we do it i wonder we are not in a particular state of readiness to declare war upon anybody or anything are we he added as they turned around and strolled once more towards the polo ground  we have had no money to waste upon senseless armaments mr hebblethwaite declared severely and if you watch the social measures which we have passed during the last two years you will see that every penny we could spare has been necessary in order to get them into working order it is our contention that an army is absolutely unnecessary and would simply have the effect of provoking military reprisals if we by any chance in the future were drawn into war our navy would be at the service of our allies what more could any country ask than to have assured for them the absolute control of the sea  thats all very well norgate assented it might be our fair share on paper and yet it might not be enough what about our navy if antwerp ostend dunkirk calais boulogne and havre were all german ports as they certainly would be in an unassisted conflict between the french and the germans  they were within hearing now of the music of the band hebblethwaite quickened his pace a little impatiently  look here he protested i came down here for a holiday i tell you frankly that i believe in the possibility of war just as much as i believe in the possibility of an earthquake my own personal feeling is that it is just as necessary to make preparations against one as the other there you are my german spy thats all i have to say to you here are your friends i must pay my respects to the prince and i should like to meet your charming companion  anna detached herself from a little group of men at their approach and norgate at once introduced his friend  i have only been able to induce mr hebblethwaite to talk to me for the last ten minutes he declared by promising to present him to you  a ceremony which we will take for granted she suggested holding out her fingers each time i have come to london mr hebblethwaite i have hoped that i might have this good fortune you interest us so much on the continent  mr hebblethwaite bowed and looked as though he would have liked the interest to have been a little more personal  you see anna explained as she stood between the two men both austria and germany the two countries where i spend most of my time are almost military ridden our great statesmen or the men who stand behind them are all soldiers you represent something wholly different your nation is as great and as prosperous as ours and yet you are a pacifist are you not mr hebblethwaite you scorn any preparations for war you do not believe in it you give back the money that we should spend in military or naval preparations to the people for their betterment it is very wonderful  we act according to our convictions mr hebblethwaite pronounced it is our earnest hope that we have risen sufficiently in the scale of civilisation to be able to devote our millions to more moral objects than the massing of armaments  and you have no fears she persisted earnestly you honestly believe that you are justified in letting the fighting spirit of your people lie dormant  i honestly believe it baroness mr hebblethwaite replied life is a battle for all of them but the fighting which we recognise is the fight for moral and commercial supremacy the lifting of the people by education and strenuous effort to a higher plane of prosperity  of course anna murmured what you say sounds frightfully convincing history only will tell us whether you are in the right  my thirst mr hebblethwaite observed glancing towards the little tables set out under the trees suggests tea and strawberries  if some one hadnt offered me tea in a moment or two anna declared i should have gone back to the prince with whom i must confess i was very bored shall we discuss politics or talk nonsense  talk nonsense mr hebblethwaite decided this is my holiday my brain has stopped working i can think of nothing beyond tea and strawberries we will take that table under the elm trees and you shall tell us all about vienna     chapter xxi   norgate after leaving anna at her hotel drove on to the club where he arrived a few minutes before seven selingman was there with prince edward and half a dozen others selingman who happened not to be playing came over at once and sat by his side on the broad fender  you are late my young friend he remarked  my new career norgate replied makes demands upon me i can no longer spend the whole afternoon playing bridge i have been attending to business  it is very good selingman declared amiably that is the way i like to hear you talk to amuse oneself is good but to work is better still have you by chance any report to make  i have had a long conversation with mr hebblethwaite at ranelagh this afternoon norgate announced  there was a sudden change in selingmans expression a glint of eagerness in his eyes  with hebblethwaite you have begun well he is the man above all others of whose views we wish to feel absolutely certain we know that he is a strong man and a pacifist but a pacifist to what extent that is what we wish to be clear about now tell me you spoke to him seriously  very seriously indeed norgate assented the subject suggested itself naturally and i contrived to get him to discuss the possibilities of a european war i posed rather as a pessimist but he simply jeered at me he assured me that an earthquake was more probable i pressed him on the subject of the entente he spoke of it as a thing of romance and sentiment having no place in any possible development of the international situation i put hypothetical cases of a european war before him but he only scoffed at me on one point only was he absolutely and entirely firmunder no circumstances whatever would the present cabinet declare war upon anybody if the nation found itself face to face with a crisis the government would simply choose the most dignified and advantageous solution which embraced peace in short there is one thing which you may count upon as absolutely certain if england goes to war at any time within the next four years it will be under some other government  selingman was vastly interested he had drawn very close to norgate his pudgy hands stretched out upon his knees he dropped his voice so that it was audible only a few feet away  let me put an extreme case he suggested supposing russia and germany were at war and france as russias ally were compelled to mobilise it would not be a war of germanys provocation but germany in selfdefence would be bound to attack france she might also be compelled by strategic considerations to invade belgium what do you think your friend hebblethwaite would say to that  i am perfectly convinced norgate replied that hebblethwaite would work for peace at any price the members of our present government are pacifists every one of them with the possible exception of the secretary of the admiralty  ah mr selingman murmured mr spencer wyatt he is the gentleman who clamours so hard and fights so well for his navy estimates last time though not all his eloquence could prevail they were cut down almost a half eh  i believe that was so norgate admitted  mr spencer wyatt eh selingman continued his eyes fixed upon the ceiling well well one cannot wonder at his attitude it is not his role to pose as an economist he is responsible for the navy naturally he wants a big navy i wonder what his influence in the cabinet really is  as to that norgate observed i know no more than the man in the street  naturally mr selingman agreed i was thinking to myself  there was a brief silence norgate glanced around the room  i dont see mrs benedek here this afternoon he remarked  selingman shook his head solemnly  the inquest on the death of that poor fellow baring is being held today he explained that is why she is staying away a sad thing that norgatea very sad happening  it was indeed  and mysterious selingman went on the man apparently an hour before was in high spirits the special work upon which he was engaged at the admiralty was almost finished he had received high praise for his share in it every one who had seen him that day spoke of him as in absolutely capital form suddenly he whips out a revolver from his desk and shoots himself and all that any one knows is that he was rung up by some one on the telephone theres a puzzle for you norgate  norgate made no reply he felt selingmans eyes upon him  a wonderful plot for the sensational novelist to the ordinary human being who knew baring there remains a substratum almost of uneasiness where did that voice come from that spoke along the wires and what was its message baring by all accounts had no secrets in his life what was the messagea warning or a threat  i did not read the account of the inquest norgate observed wasnt it possible to trace the person who rang up through the telephone office  in an ordinary case yes selingman agreed in this case no the person who rang up made use of a call office but come it is a gloomy subject this i wish i had known that you were likely to see mr hebblethwaite this afternoon bear this in mind in case you should come across him again it would interest me very much to know whether any breach of friendship has taken place at all between him and mr spencer wyatt do you know spencer wyatt bytheby  only slightly norgate replied not well enough to talk to him intimately as i can do to hebblethwaite  well remember that last little commission selingman concluded are you staying on or leaving now if you are going we will walk together a little exercise is good for me sometimes my figure requires it it is a very short distance but it is better than nothing at all  i am quite ready norgate assured him  they left the room and descended the stairs together at the entrance to the building selingman paused for a moment then he seemed suddenly to remember  it is habit he declared i stand here for a taxi but we have agreed to walk is it not so come  norgate was looking across the street to the other side of the pavement a man was standing there engaged in conversation with a plainlydressed young woman to norgate there was something vaguely familiar about the latter who turned to glance at him as they strolled by on the other side of the road it was not until they reached the corner of the street however that he remembered she was the young woman at the telephone call office near westbourne grove     chapter xxii   mr hebblethwaite was undoubtedly annoyed he found himself regretting more than ever the good nature which had prompted him to give this visitor an audience at a most unusual hour he had been forced into the uncomfortable position of listening to statements the knowledge of which was a serious embarrassment to him  whatever made you come to me mr harrison he exclaimed when at last his callers disclosures had been made it isnt my department  i came to you sir the official replied because i have the privilege of knowing you personally and because i was quite sure that in your hands the matter would be treated wisely  you are sure of your facts i suppose  absolutely sir  i do not know much about navy procedure mr hebblethwaite said thoughtfully but it scarcely seems to me possible for what you tell me to have been kept secret  it is not only possible sir the man assured him but it has been done before in lord charles beresfords time you will find if you make enquiries that not only are the press excluded today from the shipbuilding yards in question but the workpeople are living almost in barracks there are double sentries at every gate and no one is permitted under any circumstances to pass the outer line of offices  mr hebblethwaite sat for a few moments deep in thought  well mr harrison he said at last there is no doubt that you have done what you conceived to be your duty although i must tell you frankly that i wish you had either kept what you know to yourself or taken the information somewhere else since you have brought it to me let me ask you this question are you taking any further steps in the matter at all  certainly not sir was the quiet reply i consider that i have done my duty and finished with it when i leave this room  you are content then mr hebblethwaite observed to leave this matter entirely in my hands  entirely sir the official assented i am perfectly content from this moment to forget all that i know whatever your judgment prompts you to do will i feel sure be satisfactory  mr hebblethwaite rose to his feet and held out his hand  well mr harrison he concluded you have performed a disagreeable duty in a tactful manner personally i am not in the least grateful to you for as i dare say you know mr spencer wyatt is a great friend of mine as a member of the government however i think i can promise you that your services shall not be forgotten good evening  the official departed mr hebblethwaite thrust his hands into his pockets glanced at the clock impatiently and made use of an expression which seldom passed his lips he was in evening dress and due to dine with his wife on the other side of the park furthermore he was very hungry the whole affair was most annoying he rang the bell  ask mr bedells to come here at once he told the servant and tell your mistress i am exceedingly sorry but i shall be detained here for some time she had better go on without me and send the car back i will come as soon as i can explain that it is a matter of official business when you have seen mrs hebblethwaite you can bring me a glass of sherry and a biscuit  the man withdrew and mr hebblethwaite opened a telephone directory in a few moments mr bedells who was his private secretary appeared  richard his chief directed ring up mr spencer wyatt tell him that whatever his engagements may be i wish to see him here for five minutes if he is out you must find out where he is you can begin by ringing up at his house  bedells devoted himself to the telephone mr hebblethwaite munched a biscuit and sipped his sherry presently the latter laid down the telephone and reported success  mr spencer wyatt was on his way to a city dinner sir he announced they caught him in the hall and he will call here  mr hebblethwaite nodded see that he is sent up directly he comes  in less than five minutes mr spencer wyatt was ushered in he was wearing the uniform of an admiral of the fleeta tall broadshouldered man fair complexioned and with the bearing of a sailor  hullo hebblethwaite whats wrong he asked your message just caught me i am dining with the worshipful tannersturtle soup and all the rest of it dont let me miss more than i can help  mr hebblethwaite walked to the door to be sure that it was closed and came back again  look here wyatt he exclaimed what the devil have you been up to  wyatt whistled softly a light broke across his face  what do you mean he demanded  you know perfectly well what i mean hebblethwaite continued five weeks ago we had it all out at a cabinet meeting you asked parliament to lay down six battleships four cruisers thirtyfive submarines and twelve torpedo boats you remember what a devil of a row there was eventually we compromised for half the number of battleships two cruisers and the full amount of small craft  well  i am given to understand hebblethwaite said slowly that you have absolutely disregarded the votethat the whole number of battleships are practically commenced and the whole number of cruisers and rather more than the number of smaller craft  wyatt threw his cocked hat upon the table  well i am up against it a bit sooner than i expected he remarked whos been peaching  never mind hebblethwaite replied i am not telling you that youve managed the whole thing very cleverly and you know very well wyatt that i am on your side i was on your side in pressing the whole of your proposals upon the cabinet although honestly i think they were far larger than necessary however we took a fair vote and we compromised you had no more right to do what you have done  i admit it hebblethwaite wyatt interrupted quickly of course if this comes out my resignations ready for you but i tell you frankly as man to man i cant go on with my job and i wont unless i get the ships voted that i need we are behind our standard now i spent twentyfour hours making up my mind whether i should resign or take this risk i came to the conclusion that i should serve my country better by taking the risk so there you are what are you going to do about it  what the mischief can i do about it hebblethwaite demanded irritably you are putting me in an impossible position let me ask you this wyatt is there anything at the back of your head that the man in the street doesnt know about  yes  what is it then  i have reasons to believe wyatt announced deliberately reasons which are quite sufficient for me although it was impossible for me to get up in parliament and state them that germany is secretly making preparations for war either before the end of this year or the beginning of next  hebblethwaite threw himself into an easychair  sit down wyatt he said your dinner can wait for a few minutes i have had another manonly a youngster and he doesnt know anythingtalking to me like that we are fully acquainted with everything that is going on behind the scenes all our negotiations with germany are at this moment upon the most friendly footing we havent a single matter in dispute old busby as you know has been over in berlin himself and has come back a confirmed pacifist if he had his way our army would practically cease to exist he has been on the spot he ought to know and the armys his job  busby wyatt declared is the silliest old ass who ever escaped petticoats by the mere accident of sex i tell you he is just the sort of idiot the germans have been longing to get hold of and twist round their fingers before twelve months or two years have passed youll curse the name of that man when you look at the mess he has made of the army peace is all very welluniversal peace the only way we can secure it is by being a good deal stronger than we are at present  that is your point of view hebblethwaite reminded him i tell you frankly that i incline towards busbys  then youll eat your words wyatt asserted before many months are out i too have been in germany lately although i was careful to go as a tourist and i have picked up a little information i tell you it isnt for nothing that germany has a complete list of the whole of her rolling stock the actual numbers in each compartment registered and reserved for the use of certain units of her troops i tell you that from one end of the country to the other her state of military preparedness is amazing she has but to press a button and a million men have their rifles in their hands their knapsacks on their backs and each regiment knows exactly at which station and by what train to embark she is making zeppelins night and day training her men till they drop with exhaustion krupps works are guarded by double lines of sentries there are secrets there which no one can penetrate and all the time she is building ships feverishly look hereyou know my cousin lady emily fakenham  of course  only yesterday wyatt continued impressively she showed me a letteri read it mindfrom a cousin of prince hohenlowe she met him at monte carlo this year and they had a sort of flirtation in the postscript he says if you take my advice dont go to dinard this august dont be further away from home than you can help at all this summer what do you think that meant  it sounds queer hebblethwaite admitted  germany is bound to have a knock at us spencer wyatt went on weve talked of it so long that the words pass over our heads as it were but she means it and i tell you another thing she means to do it while theres a radical government in power here and before russia finishes her reorganisation scheme i am not a soldier hebblethwaite but the fellows weve got up at the topnot the soldiers themselves but the chaps like old busby and simonsare simply out and out rotters thats plain speaking isnt it but you and i are the two men concerned in the government of this country who do talk common sense to one another weve fine soldiers and fine organisers but theyve been given the goby simply because they know their job and would insist upon doing it thoroughly if at all russia will have another four million men ready to be called up by the end of 1915 and not only that but what is more important is that shell have the arms and the uniforms for them germany isnt going to wait for that ive thought it all out we are going to get it in the neck before seven or eight months have passed and if you want to know the truth hebblethwaite thats why i have taken a risk and ordered these ships the navy is my care and its my job to see that we keep it up to the proper standard whose votes rob me of my extra battleships why just a handful of labour men and irishmen and cocoa liberals who havent an imperial idea in their brains who think war belongs to the horrors of the past and think theyre doing their duty by what they call keeping down expenses hang it hebblethwaite its worse than a man who wont pay fire insurance for his house in a dangerous neighbourhood so as to save a bit of money what ive done i stick to split on me if you want to  i dont think i shall do that hebblethwaite said but honestly wyatt i cant follow you in your war talk we got over the agadir trouble weve got over a much worse onethe balkan crisis there isnt a single contentious question before us just now the sky is almost clear  believe me wyatt insisted earnestly thats just the time to look for the thunderbolt cant you see that when germany goes to war it will be a war of conquest the war which she has planned for all these years shell choose her own time and shell make a casus belli right enough when the time comes of course shed have taken advantage of the position last year but she simply wasnt ready if you ask me i believe she thinks herself now able to lick the whole of europe i am not at all sure thanks to busby and our last fifteen years military administration that she wouldnt have a good chance of doing it any way i am not going to have my fleet cut down  the country is prosperous hebblethwaite acknowledged we can afford the ships  then look here old chap wyatt begged i am not pleading for my own sake but the countrys keep your mouth shut see what the next month or two brings if theres troublewell i dont suppose i shall be jumped on then if there isnt and you want a victim here i am i disobeyed orders flagrantly my resignation is in my desk at any moment  hebblethwaite glanced at the clock  i am very hungry he said and i have a long way to go for dinner well let it go at that wyatt ill try and keep things quiet for you if it comes out well you know the risk you run  i know the bigger risk we are all running wyatt declared as he took a cigarette from an open box on the table by his side and turned towards the door ill manage the turtle soup now with luck youre a good fellow hebblethwaite i know it goes against the grain with you but by jove you may be thankful for this some time  the right honourable john william hebblethwaite took the hat from his footman stepped into his car and was driven rapidly away he leaned back among the cushions more thoughtful than usual there was a yellow moon in the sky pale as yet the streets were a tangled vortex of motorcars and taxies all filled with men and women in evening dress it was the height of a wonderful season everywhere was dominant the note of prosperity gaiety even splendour the houses in park lane flowerdecked displayed through their wideflung windows a constant panorama of brilliantlylit rooms every one was entertaining in the park on the other side were the usual crowd of earnest hardfaced men and women gathered in little groups around the orator of the moment hebblethwaite felt a queer premonition that evening a man of sanguine temperament thoroughly contented with himself and his position he seemed almost for the first time in his life to have doubts to look into the future to feel the rumblings of an earthquake the great dramatic cry of a nation in the throes of suffering had they been wise all these years to have legislated as though the old dangers by land and sea had passedto have striven to make the people fat and prosperous to have turned a deaf ear to every note of warning supposing the other thing were true supposing norgate and spencer wyatt had found the truth what would history have to say then of this government of which he was so proud would it be possible that they had brought the country to a great prosperity by destroying the very bulwarks of its security  the car drew up with a jerk and hebblethwaite came back to earth nevertheless he promised himself as he hastened across the pavement that on the morrow he would pay a longdelayed visit to the war office     chapter xxiii   anna was seated a few days later with her dearest friend the princess of thurm in a corner of the royal enclosure at ascot for the first time since their arrival they found themselves alone from underneath her parasol the princess looked at her friend curiously  anna she said something has happened to you  perhaps but explain yourself anna replied composedly  it is so simple there you sit in a doucet gown perfection as ever from the aigrette in your hat to those delicately pointed shoes you have been positively hunted by all the nicest menonce or twice indeed i felt myself neglectedand not a smile have i seen upon your lips you go about looking just a little beyond everything what did you see child over the tops of the trees in the paddock when lord wilton was trying so hard to entertain you  an affair of moods i imagine anna declared somehow i dont feel quite in the humour for ascot today to be quite frank she went on turning her head slowly i rather wonder that you do mildred  the princess raised her eyebrows  why not everything so far as i am concerned is couleur de rose madame blanche declared yesterday that my complexion would last for twenty years i found a dozen of the most adorable hats in paris the artist who designs my frocks was positively inspired the last time i sat to him i am going to see maurice in a few weeks and meanwhile i have several new flirtations which interest me amazingly as for you my child one would imagine that you had lost your taste for all frivolity you are as cold as granite be careful dear the men of today in this country at any rate are spoilt sometimes they are even uncourtierlike enough to accept a womans refusal  well anna observed smiling faintly even a lifetime at court has not taught me to dissimulate i am heavyhearted mildred you wondered what i was looking at when i gazed over those green trees under which all those happy people were walking i was looking out across the north sea i was looking through belgium to paris i saw a vast curtain roll up and everything beyond it was a bloodstained panorama  a shade rested for a moment on her companions fair face she shrugged her shoulders  weve known for a long time dear that it must come  but all the same in these last moments it is terrible anna insisted seriously mildred i wonder that i should feel it more than you you are absolutely english your father is english your mother is english it is only your husband that is austrian you have lived in austria only for seven years has that been sufficient to destroy all your patriotism all your love for your own country  the princess made a little grimace  my dear anna she said i am not so serious a person as you are i am profoundly incomprehensibly selfish the only human being in the whole world for whom i have had a spark of real affection is maurice and i adore him what he has told me to do i have done what makes him happy makes me happy for his sake even i have forgotten and shall always forget that i was born an englishwoman circumstances too she went on thoughtfully have made it so easy england is such a changed country when i was a child i could read of the times when our kings really ruled of our battles for dominion of our fight for colonies of our building up a great empire and i could feel just a little thrill i cant now we have gone ahead of napoleon from a nation of shopkeepers we have become a nation of general dealersa fat overconfident bourgeois people socialism has its hand upon the throat of the classes park lane where our aristocracy lived is filled with the mansions of south african jews whom one must meet here or keep out of society altogether our country houses have gone the same way our court set is dowdy dull to a degree and common in a different fashion you are right i have lost my love for england partly because of my marriage partly because of those things which have come to england herself  for the first time there was a little flush of colour in annas exquisitely pale cheeks there was even animation in her tone as she turned towards her friend  mildred she exclaimed it is splendid to hear you say what is really in your mind i am so glad you have spoken to me like this i feel these things too now i am not nearly so english as you my mother was english and my father austrian therefore only half of me should be english yet although i am so much further removed from england than you are i have suddenly felt a return of all my old affection for her  you are going to tell me why her companion begged  of course it is because i believeit is too ridiculousbut i believe that i am in your position with the circumstances reversed i am beginning to care in the most foolish way for an unmistakable englishman  if we had missed this little chance of conversation the princess declared i should have been miserable for the rest of my life there is the duke hanging about behind for heavens sake dont turn thank goodness he has gone away now go on dear tell me about him at once i cant imagine who it may be i have watched you with so many men and i know quite well so long as that little curl is at the corner of your lips that they none of them count do i know him  i do not think so anna replied he is not a very important person  it isnt the man you were dining with in the café de berlin when prince karl came in  yes it is he  the princess made a little grimace  but how unsuitable my dear she exclaimed if you are really in earnest what is the use of your thinking of an englishman he is quite nice i know his mother and my mother were friends and we met once or twice he was very kind to me in paris too but for a serious affair  well it may not come to that anna interrupted but there it is i suppose that it is partly for his sake that i feel this depression  i should have thought that he himself would have been a little out of sympathy with his country just now the princess remarked they tell me that the foreign office ate humble pie with the kaiser for that affair shockingly they not only removed him from the embassy but they are going to give him nothing in europe i heard for a fact that the kaiser requested that he should not be attached to any court with which germany had diplomatic relations  anna nodded i believe that it is true she admitted but i am not sure that he realises it himself even if he does well you know the type he is english to the backbone  but there are englishmen the princess insisted earnestly who are amenable to common sense there are englishmen who are sorrowing over the decline of their own country and who would not be so greatly distressed if she were punished a little  i am afraid mr norgate is not like that anna observed drily however one cannot be sure bother i thought people were very kind to leave us so long in peace dear prince how clever of you to find out our retreat  the ambassador stood bareheaded before them  dear ladies he declared you are the lodestones which would draw one even through these gossamer walls of lace and chiffons of draperies as light as the sunshine and perfumes as sweet as heines poetry  very pretty anna laughed but what you really mean is that you were looking for two of your very useful slaves and have found them  the ambassador glanced around their isolation was complete  ah well he murmured it is a wonderful thing to be so charmingly aided towards such a wonderful end  and to have such complete trust in ones friends anna remarked looking him steadfastly in the face  the prince did not flinch his smile was perfectly courteous and acknowledging  that is my happiness he admitted i will tell you the reason which directed my footsteps this way he added drawing a small betting book from his pocket you must back prince charlie for the next race i will if you choose take your commissions i have a man waiting at the rails  twenty pounds for me please the princess declared i have the horse marked on my card but i had forgotten for the moment  and the same for me anna begged but did you really come only to bring us this valuable tip prince  the ambassador stooped down  there is a dispatch on its way to me he said softly which i believe concerns you it might be necessary for you to take a short journey within the next few days  not back to berlin anna exclaimed  their solitude had been invaded by now and the princess was talking to two or three men who were grouped about her chair the ambassador stooped a little lower  to rome he whispered     chapter xxiv   back from the dusty roads the heat and noise of the long day anna was resting on the couch in her sittingroom a bowl of roses and a note which she had read three or four times stood on a little table by her side one of the blossoms she had fastened into the bosom of her loose gown the blinds were drawn the sounds of the traffic outside were muffled and distant her bath had been just the right temperature her maids attention was skilful and delicate as ever she was conscious of the drowsy sweet perfume of the flowers the pleasant sense of powdered cleanliness everything should have conduced to rest but she lay there with her eyes wideopen there was so much to think about so much that was new finding its way into her stormy young life  madame  anna turned her head her maid had entered noiselessly from the inner room and was standing by her side  madame does not sleep there is a person outside who waits for an interview i have denied him as all others he gave me this  anna almost snatched the piece of paper from her maids fingers she glanced at the name and the disappointment which shone in her eyes was very apparent it was succeeded by an impulse of surprise  you can show him in she directed  selingman appeared a few moments laterselingman cool rosy and confident on the way to his beloved bridge club he took the hand which anna without moving held out to him and raised it gallantly to his lips  i thought it was understood my crockery friend she murmured that in london we did not interchange visits  most true gracious lady he admitted but there are circumstances which can alter the most immovable decisions at this moment we are confronted with one i come to discuss with you the young englishman francis norgate  she turned her head a little her eyes were full of enquiry  to discuss him with me  selingmans eyes as though by accident fell upon the roses and the note  ah well she murmured go on  it is wonderful selingman proceeded to be able to tell the truth i speak to you as one comrade to another this young man was your companion at the café de berlin for the indiscretion of behaving like a bullheaded but courageous young englishman he is practically dismissed from the service he comes back smarting with the injustice of it chance brings him in my way i proceed to do my best to make use of this opportunity  so like you dear herr selingman anna murmured  selingman beamed  ever gracious dear lady well to continue then here i find a young englishman of exactly the order and position likely to be useful to us i approach him frankly he has been humiliated by the country he was willing to serve i talk to him of that country you are english of course i remind him but what manner of an england is it today which claims you it is a very telling argument this upon the classes of this country democracy has laid a throttling hand there is a spirit of discontent they say among the workingclasses the discontent which breeds socialism there is a worse spirit of discontent among the upper classes here and it is the discontent which breeds socalled traitors  i can imagine all the rest anna interposed coolly how far have you succeeded  the young man selingman told her has accepted my proposals he has drawn three months salary in advance he furnished me yesterday with details of a private conversation with a wellknown cabinet minister  anna turned her head so soon she murmured  so soon selingman repeated and now gracious lady here comes my visit to you we have a recruit invaluable if he is indeed a recruit at heart dangerous if he has the brains and wit to choose to make himself so i on my way through life judge men and women and i judge themwell with few exceptions unerringly but at the back of my brain there lingers something of mistrust of this young man i have seen others in his position accept similar proposals i have seen the struggles of shame the doubts the assertion of some part of a mans lower nature reconciling him in the end to accepting the pay of a foreign country i have seen none of these things in this young mansimply a cold and deliberate acceptance of my proposals he conforms to no type he sets up before me a problem which i myself have failed wholly to solve i come to you dear lady for your aid  i am to spy upon the spy she remarked  it is an easy task selingman declared this young man is your slave whatever your daily business may be here some part of your time i imagine will be spent in his company let me know what manner of man he is is this innate corruptness which brings him so easily to the bait or is it the stinging smart of injustice from which he may well be suffering or failing these has he dared to set his wits against mine to play the double traitor if even a suspicion of this should come to you there must be an end of mr francis norgate  anna toyed for a moment with the rose at her bosom her eyes were looking out of the room once again she was conscious of a curious slackening of purpose a confusion of issues which had once seemed to her so clear  very well she promised i will send you a report in the course of a few days  i should not selingman continued rising venture to trouble you baroness as i know the sphere of your activities is far removed from mine but chance has put you in the position of being able to ascertain definitely the things which i desire to know for our common sake you will i am sure seek to discover the truth  so far as i can certainly anna replied but i must admit that i like you find mr norgate a little incomprehensible  there are men selingman declared there have been many of the strongest men in history impenetrable to the world who have yielded their secrets readily to a womans influence the diplomatists in life who have failed have been those who have underrated the powers possessed by your wonderful sex  among whom anna remarked no one will ever number herr selingman  dear baroness selingman concluded as the maid whom anna had summoned stood ready to show him out it is because in my life i have been brought into contact with so many charming examples of your power                                       once more silence and solitude anna moved restlessly about on her couch her eyes were a little hot that future into which she looked seemed to become more than ever a tangled web at halfpast seven her maid reappeared  madame will dress for dinner  anna swung herself to her feet she glanced at the clock  i suppose so she assented  i have three gowns laid out the maid continued respectfully madame would look wonderful in the light green  anything anna yawned  the telephone bell tinkled anna took down the receiver herself  yes she asked  her manner suddenly changed it was a familiar voice speaking her maid who stood in the background watched and wondered  it is you baroness i rang up to see whether there was any chance of your being able to dine with me i have just got back to town  how dared you go away without telling me she exclaimed and how can i dine with you do you not realise that it is ascot thursday and i have had many invitations to dine tonight i am going to a very big dinnerparty at thurm house  bad luck norgate replied disconsolately and tomorrow  i have not finished about tonight yet anna continued i suppose you do not by any chance want me to dine with you very much  of course i do was the prompt answer you see plenty of the princess of thurm and nothing of me and there is always the chance that you may have to go abroad i think that it is your duty  as a matter of duty anna interrupted i ought to dine at thurm house as a matter of pleasure i shall dine with you you will very likely not enjoy yourself i am going to be very cross indeed you have neglected me shamefully it is only these wonderful roses which have saved you  so long as i am saved he murmured tell me please where you would like to dine  any place on earth she replied you may call for me here at halfpast eight i shall wear a hat and i would like to go somewhere where our people do not go  anna set down the telephone the listlessness had gone from her manner she glanced at the clock and ran lightly into the other room  put all that splendour away she ordered her maid cheerfully tonight we shall dazzle no one something perfectly quiet and a hat please i dine in a restaurant and ring the bell marie for two aperitifsnot that i need one i am hungry marie i am looking forward to my dinner already i think something dead black i am looking well tonight i can afford to wear black  marie beamed  madame has recovered her spirits she remarked demurely  anna was suddenly silent her lightheartedness was a revelation she turned to her maid  marie she directed you will telephone to thurm house you will ask for lucille the princesss maid you will give my love to the princess you will say that a sudden headache has prostrated me it will be enough you need say no more tomorrow i lunch with the princess and she will understand     chapter xxv   confess anna exclaimed as she leaned back in her chair that my idea was excellent your little restaurant was in its way perfection but the heatdoes one feel it anywhere i wonder as one does in london  here at any rate we have air norgate remarked appreciatively  we are far removed she went on from the clamour of diners that babel of voices the smell of cooking the meretricious music we look over the housetops soon just behind that tall building there you will see the yellow moon  they were taking their coffee in annas sittingroom seated in easychairs drawn up to the wideflung windows the topmost boughs of some tall elm trees rustled almost in their faces away before them spread the phantasmagoria of a wilderness of london roofs softened and melting into the dim blue obscurity of the falling twilight lights were flashing out everywhere and above them shone the stars norgate drew a long breath of content  it is wonderful this he murmured  we are at least alone anna said and i can talk to you i want to talk to you should you be very much flattered i wonder if i were to say that i have been thinking of little else for the last three or four days than how to approach you how to say something to you without any fear of being misunderstood how to convince you of my own sincerity  if i am not flattered he answered looking at her keenly i am at least content please go on  you are one of those i believe she continued earnestly who realise that somewhere not far removed from the splendour of these summer days a storm is gathering i am one of those who know england has but a few more weeks of this selfconfident selfesteeming security very soon the shock will come oh you sit there my friend and you are very monosyllabic but that is because you do not wholly trust me  he swung suddenly round upon her and there was an unaccustomed fire in his eyes  may it not be for some other reason he asked quickly  there was a moments silence her own face seemed paler than ever in the strange half light but her eyes were wonderful he told himself with passionate insistence that they were the eyes of a truthful woman  tell me she begged what reason  he leaned towards her  it is so hopeless he said i am just a broken diplomat whose career is ended almost before it is begun and youwell you have everything at your feet it is foolish of me isnt it but i love you  he took her hand and she did not withdraw it  if it is foolish she murmured then i am foolish too perhaps you can guess now why i came to london  he drew her into his arms she made no resistance her lips even were seeking his it seemed to him in those breathless moments that a greater thing than even the destiny of nations was born into the world there was a new vigour in his pulses as she gently pushed him back a new splendour in life  dear she exclaimed of course we are both very foolish and yet i do not know i have been wondering why this has not come to me long ago and now that it has come i am happy  you careyou really care he insisted passionately  of course i do she told him quietly enough and yet very convincingly if i did not care i should not be here if i did not care i should not be going to say the things to you which i am going to say now sit back in your chair please hold my hand still smoke if you will but listen  he obeyed a deeper seriousness crept into her tone but her face was still soft and wonderful the new things were lingering there  i want to tell you first she said what i think you already know the moment for which germany has toiled so long from which she has never faltered is very close at hand with all her marvellous resources and that amazing war equipment of which you in this country know little she will soon throw down the gage to england you are an englishman francis you are not going to forget it are you  forget it he repeated  i know she continued slowly that selingman has made advances to you i know that he has a devilish gift for enrolling on his list men of honour and conscience he has the knack of subtle argument of twisting facts and preying upon human weaknesses you have been shockingly treated by your foreign office you yourself are entirely out of sympathy with your government you know very well that england as she is is a country which has lost her ideals a country in which many of her sons might indeed without much reproach lose their pride selingman knows this he knows how to work upon these facts he might very easily convince you that the truest service you could render your country was to assist her in passing through a temporary tribulation  he looked at her almost in surprise  you seem to know the mans methods he observed  i do she answered and i detest them now francis please tell me the truth is your name too upon that long roll of those who are pledged to assist his country  it is he admitted  she drew a little away  you admit it you have already consented  i have drawn a quarters salary norgate confessed i have entered selingmans corps of the german secret service  you mean that you are a traitor she exclaimed  a traitor to the false england of today norgate replied a friend i hope of the real england  she sat quite still for some moments  somehow or other she said i scarcely fancied that you would give in so easily  you seem disappointed he remarked yet after all am i not on your side  i suppose so she answered without enthusiasm  there was another and a more prolonged silence norgate rose at last to his feet he walked restlessly to the end of the room and back again a dark mass of clouds had rolled up the air seemed almost sulphurous with the presage of a coming storm they looked out into the gathering darkness  i dont understand he said you are austrian that is the same as german i tell you that i have come over on your side you seem disappointed  perhaps i am she admitted standing up too and linking her arm through his you see my mother was english and they say that i am entirely like her i was brought up here in the english country sometimes my life at vienna and berlin seems almost like a dream to me something unreal as though i were playing at being some other woman when i am back here i feel as though i had come home do you know really that nothing would make me happier than to hear or think nothing about duty to just know that i had come back to england to stay and that you were english and that we were going to live just the sort of life i pictured to myself that two people could live so happily over here without too much ambition without intrigue simply and honestly i am a little weary of cities and courts francis tonight more than ever england seems to appeal to me to remind me that i am one of her daughters  are you trying me anna he asked hoarsely  trying you of course not she answered i am speaking to you just simply and naturally because you are the one person in the world to whom i may speak like that  then lets drop it both of us he exclaimed holding her arm tightly to his courts and cities can do without you and selingman can do without me well take a cottage somewhere and live through these evil days  she shook her head  you and i are not like that francis she declared when the storm breaks we mustnt be found hiding in our holes you know that quite well it is for us to decide what part we may play you have chosen so in a measure have i tomorrow i am going on a secret mission to italy  anna he cried in dismay  alas yes she repeated we may not even meet again francis till the map of europe has been rewritten with the blood of many of our friends and millions of our countrypeople but i shall think of you and the kiss you will give me now shall be the last upon my lips  you can go away he demanded you can leave me like this  i must she answered simply i have work before me goodby francis somehow i knew what was coming i believe that i am glad dear but i must think about it and so must you  norgate left the hotel and walked out amid the first mutterings of the storm he found a taxi and drove to his rooms for an hour he sat before his window watching the lightning play fighting the thoughts which beat upon his brain fighting all the time a losing battle at midnight the storm had ceased he walked back through the rainstreaming streets the air was filled with sweet and pungent perfumes the heaviness had passed from the atmosphere his own heart was lighter he walked swiftly outside her hotel he paused and looked up at the window there was a light still burning in her room he even fancied that he could see the outline of her figure leaning back in the easychair which he had wheeled up close to the casement he entered the hotel stepped into the lift ascended to her floor and made his way with tingling pulses and beating heart along the corridor he knocked softly at her door there was a little hesitation then he heard her voice on the other side  who is that  it is ifrancis he answered softly let me in  there was a little exclamation she opened the door holding up her finger  quietly she whispered what is it francis why have you come back what has happened to you  he drew her into the room she herself looked weary and there were lines under her eyes it seemed even as though she might have been weeping but it was a new norgate who spoke his words rang out with a fierce vigour his eyes seemed on fire  anna he cried i cant fence with you i cant lie to you i cant deceive you ive tried these things and i went away choking i had to come back you shall know the truth even though you betray me i am no man of selingmans i have taken his paltry moneyit went last night to a hospital i am for englandgod knows itthe england of any government england however misguided or mistaken i want to do the work for her thats easiest and that comes to me i am on selingmans roll what do you think hell get from me nothing that isnt false no information that wont mislead him no facts save those i shall distort until they may seem so near the truth that he will build and count upon them every minute of my time will be spent to foil his schemes they dont believe me in whitehall or selingman would be at bow street tomorrow morning thats why i am going my own way tell him if you will there is only one thing strong enough to bring me here to risk everything and thats my love for you  she was in his arms sobbing and crying and yet laughing she clutched at him drew down his face and covered his lips with kisses  oh i am so thankful she cried so thankful francis i achedmy heart ached to have you sit there and talk as you did now i know that you are the man i thought you were francis we will work together  you mean it  i do england was my mothers country england shall be my husbands country i will tell you many things that should help from now my work shall be for you if they find me out well i will pay the price you shall run your risk francis for your country and i must take mine but at least well keep our honour and our conscience and our love oh this is a better parting dear this is a better good night     chapter xxvi   mrs benedek was the first to notice the transformation which had certainly taken place in norgates appearance she came and sat by his side upon the cushioned fender  what a metamorphosis she exclaimed why you look as though providence had been showering countless benefits upon you  there were several people lounging around and mrs benedeks remark certainly had point  you look like monty when hes had a winning week one of them observed  it is something more than gross lucre a young man declared who had just strolled up i believe that it is a good fat appointment rome perhaps where every one of you fellows wants to get to nowadays  or perhaps the prince intervened with a little bow mrs benedek has promised to dine with you she is generally responsible for the gloom or happiness of us poor males in this room  norgate smiled  none of these wonderful things have happenedand yet something perhaps more wonderful he announced i am engaged to be married  there was a mingled chorus of exclamations and congratulations selingman who had been standing on the outskirts of the group drew a little nearer his face wore a somewhat puzzled expression  and the lady he enquired may we not know the ladys name that is surely important  it is the baroness von haase norgate replied you probably know her by name and repute at least mr selingman she is an austrian but she is often at berlin  selingman stretched out his great hand for some reason or other the announcement seemed to have given him real pleasure  know her my dear young friend while i may not claim the privilege of intimate friendship with her the baroness is a young lady of the greatest distinction and repute in berlin i congratulate you i congratulate you most heartily the anger of our young princeling is no longer to be wondered at i cannot tell you how thoroughly interesting this news is to me  you are very good indeed i am sure all of you norgate declared answering the general murmur of kindly words the baroness doesnt play bridge but id like to bring her in one afternoon if i may  i have had the honour of meeting the baroness von haase several times prince lenemaur said it will give me the utmost pleasure to renew my acquaintance with her these alliances are most pleasing since i have taken up my residence in this country i regard them with the utmost favour they do much to cement the good feeling between germany austria and england which is so desirable  english people mrs benedek remarked will at least have the opportunity of judging austrian women from the proper standpoint anna is one of the most accomplished and beautiful women in either vienna or berlin i hope so much that she will not have forgotten me altogether  they all drifted presently back to the bridge tables norgate however excused himself he had some letters to write he declared and presently he withdrew to the little drawingroom in about a quarter of an hour as he had expected the door opened and selingman entered he crossed the room at once to where norgate was writing and laid his hand upon his shoulder  young man he said i wish to talk with you bring your chair around sit there so that the light falls upon your face so now let me see where does that door lead to  into the secretarys room but it is locked norgate told him  so and the outer one i myself have carefully closed we talk here then in private this is great news which you have brought this afternoon  it is naturally of some interest to me norgate assented but i scarcely see  it is of immense interest also to me selingman interrupted it may be that you do not know this at present it may be that i anticipate but if so no matter between you and your fiancée there will naturally be no secrets you are perhaps already aware that she holds a high position amongst those who are working for the power and development and expansion of our great empire  i have gathered something of the sort norgate admitted i know of course that she is a personal favourite of the emperors and persona grata at the court of berlin  you have no scruple then about marrying a woman who belongs to a certain clique a certain school of diplomacy which you might from a superficial point of view consider inimical to your countrys interests  i have no scruple at all in marrying the baroness von haase norgate replied firmly as for the rest you and i have discussed fully the matter of the political relations between our countries i have shown you practically have i not what my own views are  that is true my young friend selingman confessed we have spoken together man to man heart to heart i have tried to show you that even though we should stand with sword outstretched across the seas yet in the hearts of our people there dwells a real affection real goodwill towards your country i think that i have convinced you i have come indeed to have a certain amount of confidence in you that i have already proved but your news today alters much there are grades of that society which you have joined rings within rings as you may well imagine i see the prospect before me now of making much greater and more valuable use of you it was your brain and a certain impatience with the political conduct of your country which brought you over to our side why should not that become an alliancean absolute alliance your interests are drawn into ours you have now a real and great reason for throwing in your lot with us let me look at you let me think whether i may not venture upon a great gamble  norgate did not flinch he appeared simply a little puzzled selingmans blue steellike eyes seemed striving to reach the back of his brain  all the things that we accomplish in my country the latter continued we do by method and order we do them scientifically we reach out into the future so far as we can we foresee everything we leave little to chance yet there are times when one cannot deal in certainties young man the news which you have told us this afternoon has brought us to this pitch i am inclined to gambleto gamble upon you  is there any question of consulting me in this norgate asked coolly  selingman brushed the interruption on one side  i now make clear to you what i mean he continued you have joined my little army of helpers those whom i have been able to convince of the justice and reasonableness of germanys ultimate aim now i want more from you i want to make of you something different more than anything in the world for the furtherance of my schemes here i need a young englishman of your position and with your connections to whom i can give my whole confidence who will act for me with implicit obedience without hesitation will you accept that post francis norgate  if you think i am capable of it norgate replied promptly  you are capable of it selingman asserted there is only one grim possibility to be risked are you entirely trustworthy would you flinch at the danger moment before this afternoon i hesitated it is your alliance with the baroness which gives me that last drop of confidence which was necessary  i am ready to do your work norgate said i can say no more my own country has no use for me my own country seems to have no use for any one at all just now who thinks a little beyond the days eating and drinking and growing fat  selingman nodded his head the note of bitterness in the others tone was to his liking  of rewards of benefits i shall not now speak he proceeded you have something in you of the spirit of men who aim at the greater things there is indeed in your attitude towards life something of the idealism the everstretching heavenward culture of my own people i recognise that spirit in you and i will not give a lower tone to our talk this afternoon by speaking of money yet what you wish for you may have when the time comes what further reward you may desire whether it be rank or high position you may have but for the present let it be sufficient that you are my man  he held out his hand and all the time his eyes never left norgates gone the florid and beaming geniality of the man his easy goodhumour his air of goodliving and rollicking gaiety there were lines in his forehead the firm contraction of his lips brought lines even across his plump cheeks it was the face this of a strong man and a thinker he held norgates fingers and norgate never flinched  so he said at last as he turned away now you are indeed in the inner circle mr francis norgate good listen to me then we will speak of war the war that is to come the war that is closer at hand than even you might imagine  war with england norgate exclaimed  selingman struck his hands together  no he declared you may take it as a compliment if you likea national compliment we do not at the present moment desire war with england our plan of campaign for its speedy and successful accomplishment demands your neutrality the north sea must be free to us our fleet must be in a position to meet and destroy as it is well able to do the russian and the french fleets now you know what has kept germany from war for so long  you are ready for it then norgate remarked  we are overready for it selingman continued we are spoiling for it we have piled up enormous stores of ordnance ammunition and all the appurtenances of warfare our schemes have been cut and dried to the last detail yet time after time we have been forced to stay our hand need i tell you why it is because in all those small diplomatic complications which have arisen and from which war might have followed england has been involved we want to choose a time and a cause which will give england every opportunity of standing peacefully on one side that time is close at hand from all that i can hear your country is at the present moment in danger of civil war your ministers who are most in favour are radical pacifists your army has never been so small or your shipbuilding programme more curtailed besides there is no warlike spirit in your nation you sleep peacefully i think that our time has come you will not need to strain your ears my friend before many weeks have passed the tocsin will be sounding does that move you let me look at you  norgates face showed little emotion selingman nodded ponderously  surely norgate asked germany will wait for some reasonable pretext  she will find one through austria selingman replied that is simple mind though this may seem to you a war wholly of aggression and though i do not hesitate to say that we have been prepared for years for a war of aggression there are other factors which will come to light only a few months ago an entire russian scheme for the invasion of germany next spring was discovered by one of our secret service agents  norgate nodded  one question more he said supposing germany takes the plunge and then england contrary to anticipation decides to support france  selingmans face darkened a sudden purposeless anger shook his voice  we choose a time he declared when englands hands are tied she is in no position to go to war with any one i have many reports reaching me every day i have come to the firm conclusion that we have reached the hour england will not fight  and what will happen to her eventually norgate asked  selingman smiled slowly  when france is crushed he explained and her northern ports garrisoned by us england must be taught just a little lesson the lesson of which you and i have spoken the lesson which will be for her good that is what we have planned that is how things will happen hush there is some one coming it is finished this come to me tomorrow morning there is work for you     chapter xxvii   later on that evening norgate walked up and down the platform at charingcross with anna her arm rested upon his her expression was animated and she talked almost eagerly norgate carried himself like a man who has found a new thing in life he was feeling none of the depression of the last few days  dear anna begged you wont forget will you all the time that i am away that you must never for a single moment relax your caution selingman speaks of trust well he gambles it is true yet he protects himself whenever he can you will not move from early morning until you go to bed at night without being watched to prove what i sayyou see the man who is reading an evening paper under the gaslamp there yes he is one of selingmans men he is watching us now more than once he has been at our side scraps of conversation or anything he can gather will go back to selingman and selingman day by day pieces everything together dont let there be a single thing which he can lay hold of  ill lead him a dance norgate promised nodding a little grimly as for that anna dear you neednt be afraid if ever i had any wits theyll be awake during the next few weeks  when i come back from rome anna went on i shall have more to tell you i believe that i shall be able to tell you even the date of the great happening i wonder what other commissions he will give you the one tonight is simple be careful dear thinkthink hard before you make up your mind remember that there is some duplicity which might become suddenly obvious an official statement might upset everything these english papers are so garrulous you might find yourself hardpressed for an explanation  ill be careful dear norgate assured her as they stood at last before the door of her compartment and of ourselves  she lifted her veil  we have so little time she murmured  but have you thought over what i suggested he begged  she laughed at him softly  it sounds quite attractive she whispered shall we talk of it when i come back from italy goodby dear of course i do not really want to kiss you but our friend under the gaslamp is lookingand you know our engagement it is so satisfactory to dear mr selingman it is the one genuine thing about us isnt it so goodby  the long train drew out from the platform a few minutes later norgate lingered until it was out of sight then he took a taxi and drove to the house of commons he sent in a card addressed to david bullen esq and waited for some time at last a young man came down the corridor towards him  i am mr bullens private secretary he announced mr bullen cannot leave the house for some time would you care to go into the strangers gallery or will you wait in his room  i should like to listen to the debate if it is possible norgate decided  a place was found for him with some difficulty the house was crowded the debate concerned one of the proposed amendments to the home rule bill not in itself important yet interesting to norgate on account of the bitter feeling which seemed to underlie the speeches of the extreme partisans on either side the debate led nowhere there was no division no master mind intervening yet it left a certain impression on norgates mind at a little before ten the young man who had found him his place touched his shoulder  mr bullen will see you now sir he said  norgate followed his conductor through a maze of passages into a barelyfurnished but lofty apartment the personage whom he had come to see was standing at the further end talking somewhat heatedly to one or two of his supporters at norgates entrance however he dismissed them and motioned his visitor to a chair he was a tall powerfullooking man with the eyes and forehead of a thinker there was a certain laconic quality in his speech which belied his nationality  you come to me i understand mr norgate he began on behalf of some friends in america not directly but representing a gentleman who in his letter did not disclose himself it sounds rather complicated but please talk to me i am at your service  i am sorry for the apparent mystery norgate said as he took the seat to which he was invited i will make up for it by being very brief i have come on behalf of a certain individualwhom we will call if you please mr x mr x has powerful connections in america associated chiefly with germanamericans as you know from your own correspondence with an organisation over there the situation in ireland is intensely interesting to them at the present moment  i have gathered that sir mr bullen confessed the help which the irish and americans have sent to dublin has scarcely been of the magnitude which one might have expected but one is at least assured of their sympathy  it is partly my mission to assure you of something else norgate declared a secret meeting has been held in new york and a sum of money has been promised the amount of which would i think surprise you the conditions attached to this gift however are peculiar they are inspired by a profound disbelief in the bona fides of england and the honourableness of her intentions so far as regards the administration of the bill when passed  mr bullen who at first had seemed a little puzzled was now deeply interested he drew his chair nearer to his visitors  what grounds have you or those whom you represent for saying that he demanded  none that i can divulge norgate replied yet they form the motive of the offer which i am about to make to you i am instructed to say that the sum of a million pounds will be paid into your funds on certain guarantees to be given by you it is my business here to place these guarantees before you and to report as to your attitude concerning them  one million pounds mr bullen murmured breathlessly  there are the conditions norgate reminded him  well  in the first place norgate continued the subscribers to this fund which is by no means exhausted by the sum i mention demand that you accept no compromise that at all costs you insist upon the whole bill and that if it is attempted at the last moment to deprive the irish people by trickery of the full extent of their liberty you do not hesitate to encourage your nationalist party to fight for their freedom  mr bullens lips were a little parted but his face was immovable  go on  in the event of your doing so norgate continued more money and arms themselves if you require them will be available but the motto of those who have the cause of ireland entirely at heart is no compromise they recognise the fact that you are in a difficult position they fear that you have allowed yourself to be influenced to be weakened by pressure so easily brought upon you from high quarters  i understand mr bullen remarked go on  there is a further condition norgate proceeded though that is less important the position in europe at the present moment seems to indicate a lasting peace yet if anything should happen that that peace should be broken you are asked to pledge your word that none of your nationalist volunteers should take up arms on behalf of england until that bill has become law and is in operation further if that unlikely event a war should take place that you have the courage to keep your men solid and armed and that if the ulster volunteers unlike your men decide to fight for england as they very well might do that you then proceed to take by force what it is not the intention of england to grant you by any other means  mr bullen leaned back in his chair he picked up a penholder and played with it for several moments  young man he asked at last who is mr x  that in the present stage of our negotiations norgate answered coolly i am not permitted to tell you  may i guess as to his nationality mr bullen enquired  i cannot prevent your doing that  the speculation is an interesting one mr bullen went on still fingering the penholder is mr x a german  norgate was silent  i cannot answer questions he said until you have expressed your views  you can have them then mr bullen declared  you can go back to mr x and tell him this ireland needs help sorely today from all her sons whether at home or in foreign countries more than anything she needs money the million pounds of which you speak would be a splendid contribution to what i may term our war chest but as to my views here they are it is my intention and the intention of my party to fight to the last gasp for the literal carrying out of the bill which is to grant us our liberty we will not have it whittled away or weakened one iota our lives and the lives of greater men have been spent to win this measure and now we stand at the gates of success we should be traitors if we consented to part with a single one of the benefits it brings us therefore you can tell mr x that should this government attempt any such trickery as he not unreasonably suspects then his conditions will be met my men shall fight and their cause will be just  so far norgate admitted this is very satisfactory  to pass on mr bullen continued let me at once confess that i find something sinister mr norgate in this mysterious visit of yours in the hidden identity of mr x i suspect some underlying motive which prompts the offering of this million pounds i may be wrong but it seems to me that i can see beneath it all the hand of a foreign enemy of england  supposing you were right mr bullen norgate said what is england but a foreign enemy of ireland  a light flashed for a moment in mr bullens eyes his lip curled inwards  young man he demanded are you an englishman  i am norgate admitted  you speak poorly then to proceed to the matter in point my word is pledged to fight i will plunge the country i love into civil war to gain her rights as greater patriots than i have done before but the thing which i will not do is to be made the catspaw or to suffer ireland to be made the catspaw of germany if war should come before the settlement of my business this is the position i should take i would cross to dublin and i would tell every nationalist volunteer to shoulder his rifle and to fight for the british empire and i would go on to belfasti david bullento belfast where i think that i am the most hated man alive and i would stand side by side with the leader of those men of ulster and i would beg them to fight side by side with my nationalists and when the war was over if my rights were not granted if ireland were not set free then i would bid my men take breathing time and use all their skill all the experience they had gained and turn and fight for their own freedom against the men with whom they had struggled in the same ranks is that million pounds to be mine mr norgate  norgate shook his head  nor any part of it sir he answered  i presume mr bullen remarked as he rose that i shall never have the pleasure of meeting mr x  i most sincerely hope norgate declared fervently that you never will goodday mr bullen  he held out his hand mr bullen hesitated  sir he said i am glad to shake hands with an irishman i am willing to shake hands with an honest englishman just where you come in i dont know so good evening you will find my secretary outside he will show you how to get away  for a moment norgate faltered a hot rejoinder trembled upon his lips then he remembered himself and turned on his heel it was his first lesson in discipline he left the room without protest     chapter xxviii   mr hebblethwaite turned into pall mall his hands behind his back his expression a little less indicative of bland good humour than usual he had forgotten to light his customary cigarette after the exigencies of a cabinet council he had even forgotten to linger for a few minutes upon the doorstep in case any photographer should be hanging around to take a snapshot of a famous visitor leaving an historic scene and quite unconsciously he ignored the salutation of several friends it was only by the merest chance that he happened to glance up at the corner of the street and recognised norgate across the way he paused at once and beckoned to him  well young fellow he exclaimed as they shook hands hows the german spy business going  pretty well thanks norgate answered coolly i am in it twice over now im marrying an austrian lady shortly very high up indeed in the diplomatic secret service of her country between us you may take it that we could read if we chose the secrets of the cabinet council from which you have just come  any fresh warnings eh  norgate turned and walked by his friends side  it is no use warning you he declared youve a hide as thick as a rhinoceros your complacency is bombproof you wont believe anything until its too late  confoundedly disagreeable companion you make norgate the cabinet minister remarked irritably you know quite as well as i do that the german scare is all bunkum and you only hammer it in either to amuse yourself or because you are of a sensational turn of mind all the same  all the same what norgate interrupted  hebblethwaite took his young friends arm and led him into his club  we will take an apéritif in the smokingroom he said after that i will look in my book and see where i am lunching it is perhaps not the wisest thing for a cabinet minister to talk in the street since the suffragette scares i have quite an eye for a detective and there has been a fellow within a few yards of your elbow ever since you spoke to me  thats all right norgate reassured him lets see its tuesday isnt it i call him boko he never leaves me my weekend shadowers are a trifle less assiduous but boko is suspicious he has deucedly long ears too  what the devil are you talking about hebblethwaite demanded as they sat down  the fact of it is norgate explained they dont altogether trust me in my new profession they give me some important jobs to look after but they watch me night and day what theyd do if i turned em up i cant imagine bytheby if you do hear of my being found mysteriously shot or poisoned or something of that sort dont you take on any theory as to suicide it will be murder right enough however he added raising his glass to his lips and nodding they havent found me out yet  i hear hebblethwaite muttered that the bookstalls are loaded with this sort of rubbish you do it very well though  oh i am the real thing all right norgate declared bytheby whats the matter with you  nothing hebblethwaite replied when you come to think of it sitting here and feeling the reviving influence of this remarkably wellconcocted beverage i can confidently answer nothing and yet a few minutes ago i must admit that i was conscious of a sensation of gloom you know norgate youre not the only idiot in the world who goes about seeing shadows for the first time in my life i begin to wonder whether we havent got a couple of them among us of course i dont take any notice of spencer wyatt its his job he plays the part of popular heronational anthem god save the empire and all that sort of thing he must keep in with his admirals and the people so of course hes always barking for ships but white now i have always looked upon white as being absolutely the most levelheaded sensible and peaceadoring minister this country ever had  whats wrong with him norgate asked  i cannot hebblethwaite regretted talk confidentially to a german spy  getting cautious as the years roll on arent you norgate sighed i hoped i was going to get something interesting out of you to cable to berlin  you try cabling to berlin young fellow hebblethwaite replied grimly and ill have you up at bow street pretty soon theres no doubt about it though old white has got the shivers for some reason or other to any sane person things were never calmer and more peaceful than at the present moment and white isnt a believer in the german peril either he is half inclined to agree with old busby he got us out of that balkan trouble in great style and all i can say is that if any nation in europe wanted war then she could have had it for the asking  well exactly what is the matter with white at the present moment norgate demanded  got the shakes hebblethwaite confided of course we dont employ wellborn young germans who are undergoing a period of rustication as english spies but we do get to know a bit what goes on there and the reports that are coming in are just a little curious rolling stock is being called into the termini of all the railways staff officers in mufti have been round all the frontiers theres an enormous amount of drilling going on and the ordnance factories are working at full pressure day and night  the manoeuvres are due very soon norgate reminded his friend  so i told white hebblethwaite continued but manoeuvres as he remarked dont lead to quite so much feverish activity as there is about germany just now personally i havent a single seconds anxiety i only regret the effect that this sort of feeling has upon the others thank heavens we are a government of sane peacebelieving people  a government of fatheaded asses who go about with your ears stuffed full of wool norgate declared with a sudden bitterness what youve been telling me is the truth germanys getting ready for war and youll have it in the neck pretty soon  hebblethwaite set down his empty glass he had recovered his composure  well i am glad i met you any way young fellow he remarked youre always such an optimist you cheer one up sorry i cant ask you to lunch he went on consulting his book but i find i am motoring down for a round of golf this afternoon  yes you would play golf norgate grunted as they strolled towards the door youre the modern nero playing golf while the earthquake yawns under london  play you some day if you like hebblethwaite suggested as he called for a taxi they took my handicap down two last week at walton heathnot before it was time either bytheby when can i meet the young lady my people may be out of town next week but ill give you both a lunch or a dinner if youll say the word thursday night eh  at present norgate replied the baroness is in italy arranging for the mobilisation of the italian armies but if shes back for thursday we shall be delighted shell be quite interested to meet you a keen bright alert politician of your type will simply fascinate her  well make it thursday night then at the carlton hebblethwaite called out from his taxi take care of boko so long  at the top of st jamess street norgate received the bow of a very elegantlydressed young woman who was accompanied by a wellknown soldier a few steps further on he came face to face with selingman  a small city london the latter declared i am on my way to the berkeley to lunch will you come with me i am alone today and i hate to eat alone miss morgen has deserted me shamefully  i met her a moment or two ago norgate remarked she was with colonel bowden  selingman nodded rosa has been taking a great interest in flying lately colonel bowden is head of the flying section well well one must expect to be deserted sometimes we older men  especially in so great a cause norgate observed drily  selingman smiled enigmatically  and you my young friend he enquired what have you been doing this morning  i have just left hebblethwaite norgate answered  there was a cabinet council this morning wasnt there  norgate nodded  an unimportant one i should imagine hebblethwaite seemed thoroughly satisfied with himself and with life generally he has gone down to walton heath to play golf  selingman led the way into the restaurant  very good exercise for an english cabinet minister he remarked capital for the muscles     chapter xxix   i had no objection norgate remarked a few hours later to lunching with you at the berkeleyvery good lunch it was toobut to dine with you in soho certainly seems to require some explanation why do we do it is it my punishment for a days inactivity because if so i beg to protest i did my best with hebblethwaite this morning and it was only because there was nothing for him to tell me that i heard nothing  selingman spread himself out at the little table and talked in voluble german to the portly headwaiter in greasy clothes then he turned to his guest  my young friend he enjoined you should cultivate a spirit of optimism i grant you that the place is small and close that the odour of other peoples dinners is repellent that this cloth perhaps is not so clean as it once was or the linen so fine as we are accustomed to but what would you have all sides of life come into the great scheme it is here that we shall meet a person whom i need to meet a person whom i do not choose to have visit me at my home whom i do not choose to be seen with in any public place of great repute  i should say we were safe here from knocking against any of our friends norgate observed anyhow the beers all right  they were served with lightcoloured beer in tall chased tumblers selingman eyed his with approval  a nation he declared which brews beer like this deserves well of the world you did wisely norgate to become ever so slightly associated with us now examine carefully these hors doeuvres i have talked with karl the headwaiter instead of eighteen pence we shall pay three shillings each for our dinner the whole resources of the establishment are at our disposal fresh tins of delicatessen you perceive do not be afraid that you will goaway hungry  i am more afraid norgate grumbled that i shall go away sick however  you may be interested to hear announced selingman glancing up that our visit is not in vain you perceive the two men entering the nearest one is a bulgarian he is a creature of mine the other is brought here by him to meet us it is good  the newcomers made their way along the room one the bulgarian was short and dark he wore a wellbrushed blue serge suit with a red tie and a small bowler hat he was smoking a long brown cigarette and he carried a bundle of newspapers behind him came a youth with a pale sensitive face and dark eyes illdressed with the grip of poverty upon him from his patched shoes to his frayed collar and wellworn cap nevertheless he carried himself as though indifferent to these things his companion stopped short as he neared the table at which the two men were sitting and took off his hat greeting selingman with respect  my friend stralhaus selingman exclaimed it goes well i trust you are a stranger let me introduce to you my secretary mr francis norgate  stralhaus bowed and turned to his young companion  this he said is the young man with whom you desired to speak we will sit down if we may sigismund this is the great herr selingman philanthropist and millionaire with his secretary mr norgate we take dinner with him tonight  the youth shook hands without enthusiasm his manner towards selingman was cold at norgate he glanced once or twice with something approaching curiosity stralhaus proceeded to make conversation  our young friend he explained addressing norgate is an exile in london he belongs to an unfortunate country he is a native of bosnia  the boys lip curled  it is possible he remarked that mr norgate has never even heard of my country he is very little likely to know its history  on the contrary norgate replied i know it very well you have had the misfortune during the last few years to come under austrian rule  since you put it like that the boy declared we are friends i am one of those who cry out to heaven in horror at the injustice which has been done we love liberty we bosnians we love our own people and our own institutions and we hate austria may you never know sir what it is to be ruled by an alien race  you have at least the sympathy of many nations who are powerless to interfere selingman said quietly i read your pamphlet mr henriote with very great interest before we leave tonight i shall make a proposal to you  the boy seemed puzzled for a moment but stralhaus intervened with some commonplace remark  after dinner he suggested we will talk  certainly during the progress of the meal henriote said little he ate although obviously half famished with restraint but although norgate did his best to engage him in conversation he seemed taciturn almost sullen towards the end of dinner when every one was smoking and coffee had been served selingman glanced at his watch  now he said i will tell you my young bosnian patriot why i sent for you would you like to go back to your country in the first place  it is impossible henriote declared bitterly i am exile i am forbidden to return under pain of death  selingman opened his pocketbook and searching among his papers produced a thin blue one which he opened and passed across the table  read that he ordered shortly  the young man obeyed a sudden exclamation broke from his lips a pink flush which neither the wine nor the food had produced burned in his cheeks he sat hunched up leaning forward his eyes devouring the paper when he had finished he still gripped it  it is my pardon he cried i may go back homeback to bosnia  it is your free pardon selingman replied but it is granted to you upon conditions those conditions i may say are entirely for your countrys sake and are framed by those who feel exactly as you feelthat austrian rule for bosnia is an injustice  go on the young man muttered what am i to do  you are a member selingman went on of the extreme revolutionary party a party pledged to stop at nothing to drive your countrys enemies across her borders very well listen to me the pardon which you have there is granted to you without any promise having been asked for or given in return it is i alone who dictate terms to you your countrys position her wrongs and the abuses of the present form of government can only be brought before the notice of europe in one way you are pledged to do that all that i require of you is that you keep your pledge  the young man half rose to his feet with excitement  keep it who is more anxious to keep it than i if europe wants to know how we feel she shall know we will proclaim the wrongs of our country so that england and russia france and italy shall hear and judge for themselves if you need deeds to rivet the attention of the world upon our sufferings then there shall be deeds there shall  he stopped short a look of despair crossed his face  but we have no money he exclaimed we patriots are starving our lands have been confiscated we have nothing i live over here heaven knows howi sigismund henriote have toiled for my living with polish jews and the outcasts of europe  selingman dived once more into his pocketbook he passed a packet across the table  young man he said that sum has been collected for your funds by the friends of your country abroad take it and use it as you think best all that i ask from you is that what you do you do quickly let me suggest an occasion for you the archduke of austria will be in your capital almost as soon as you can reach home  the boys face was transfigured his great eyes were lit with a wonderful fire his frame seemed to have filled out norgate looked at him in wonderment he was like a prophet then suddenly he grew calm he placed his pardon to which was attached his passport and the notes in his breastcoat pocket he rose to his feet and took the cap from the floor by his side  there is a train tonight he announced i wish you farewell gentlemen i know nothing of you sir he added turning to selingman and i ask no questions i only know that you have pointed towards the light and for that i thank you good night gentlemen  he left them and walked out of the restaurant like a man in a dream selingman helped himself to a liqueur and passed the bottle to norgate  it is in strange places that one may start sometimes the driving wheels of fate he remarked     chapter xxx   anna almost threw herself from the railway carriage into norgates arms she kissed him on both cheeks held him for a moment away from her then passed her arm affectionately through his  you dear she exclaimed oh how weary i am of it nearly a week in the train and how well you are looking and i am not going to stay a single second bothering about luggage marie give the porter my dressingcase here are the keys you can see to everything  norgate carried almost off his feet by the delight of her welcome led her away towards a taxicab  i am starving she told him i would have nothing at dover except a cup of tea i knew that you would meet me and i thought that we would have our first meal in england together you shall take me somewhere where we can have supper and tell me all the news i dont look too hideous do i in my travelling clothes  you look adorable he assured her and i believe you know it  i have done my best she confessed demurely marie took so much trouble with my hair we had the most delightful coupe all to ourselves fancy we are back again in london i have been to italy i have spoken to kings and prime ministers and i am back again with you and queerly enough not until tomorrow shall i see the one person who really rules italy  who is that he asked  i am not sure that i shall tell you everything she decided you have not opened your mouth to me yet i shall wait until suppertime have you changed your mind since i went away  i shall never change it he assured her eagerly we are in a taxicab and i know its most unusual and improper but  if you hadnt kissed me she declared a moment later as she leaned forward to look in the glass i should not have eaten a mouthful of supper  they drove to the milan grill it was a little early for the theatre people and they were almost alone in the place anna drew a great sigh of content as she settled down in her chair  i think i must have been lonely for a long time she whispered for it is so delightful to get back and be with you tell me what you have been doing  i have been promoted norgate announced my prospective alliance with you has completed selingmans confidence in me i have been entrusted with several commissions  he told her of his adventures she listened breathlessly to the account of his dinner in soho  it is queer how all this is working out she observed i knew before that the trouble was to come through austria the emperor was very anxious indeed that it should not he wanted to have his country brought reluctantly into the struggle even at this moment i believe that if he thought there was the slightest chance of england becoming embroiled he would travel to berlin himself to plead with the kaiser i really dont know why but the one thing in austria which would be thoroughly unpopular would be a war with england  tell me about your mission he asked  to a certain point she confessed with a little grimace it was unsuccessful i have brought a reply to the personal letter i took over to the king i have talked with guillamo the secretary of state for foreign affairs with whom of course everything is supposed to rest what i have brought with me however and what i heard from guillamo are nothing but a repetition of the assurances given to our ambassador the few private words which i was to get i have failed in obtaining simply because the one person who could have spoken them is here in london  who is that he enquired curiously  the comtesse di strozzi she told him it is she who has directed the foreign policy of italy through guillamo for the last ten years he does nothing without her he is like a lost child indeed when she is away and where do you think she is why here in london she is staying at the italian embassy signor cardina is her cousin the great ball tomorrow night of which you have read is in her honour you shall be my escort at one time i knew her quite well  the comtesse di strozzi he exclaimed why she spent the whole of last season in paris i saw quite a great deal of her  how odd anna murmured but how delightful we shall be able to talk to her together you and i  it is rather a coincidence he admitted she had a sort of craze to visit some of the places in paris where it is necessary for a woman to go incognito and i was always her escort i heard from her only a few weeks ago and she told me that she was coming to london  anna shook her head at him gaily  well she said i wont indulge in any antejealousies i only hope that through her we shall get to know the truth are things here still quiet  absolutely  also in paris francis i feel so helpless on my way i thought of staying over of going to see the minister of war and placing certain facts before him and then i realised how little use it would all be they wont believe us francis they would simply call us alarmists they wont believe that the storm is gathering  dont i know it norgate assented earnestly why hebblethwaite here has always been a great friend of mine i have done all i can to influence him he simply laughs in my face today for the first time he admitted that there was a slight uneasiness at the cabinet meeting and that white had referred to a certain mysterious activity throughout germany nevertheless he has gone down to walton heath to play golf  she made a little grimace  your great drake she reminded him played bowls when the armada sailed your cabinet ministers will be playing golf or tennis oh what a careless country you area careless haphazard blind pigheaded nation to watch over the destinies of such an empire im so tired of politics dear i am so tired of all the big things that concern other people they press upon one now it is finished you and i are alone you are my lover arent you remind me of it if you will i will discuss the subject you mentioned the other day of course i shall say no i am not nearly ready to be married yet but i should like to hear your arguments  their heads grew closer and closer together they were almost touching when selingman and rosa morgen came in selingman paused before their table  well well young people he exclaimed forgive me baroness if i am somewhat failing in respect but the doings of this young man have become some concern of mine  her greeting was tinged with a certain condescension she had suddenly stiffened there was something of the grande dame in the way she held up the tips of her fingers  you do not disapprove i trust  baroness selingman declared earnestly it is an alliance for which no words can express my approval it comes at the one moment it has riveted to us and our interests one whose services will never be forgotten may i venture to hope that your journey to italy has been productive  not entirely as we had hoped anna replied yet the position there is not unfavourable  selingman glanced towards the table at which miss morgen had already seated herself  i must not neglect my duties he remarked turning away  especially anna murmured glancing across the room when they might so easily be construed into pleasures  selingman beamed amiably  the young lady he said is more than ornamentalshe is extremely useful from the fact that i may not be privileged to present her to you i must be careful that she cannot consider herself neglected and so good night baroness good night norgate  he passed on the baroness watched him as he took his place opposite his companion  is it my fancy norgate asked or does selingman not meet entirely with your approval  she shrugged her shoulders  it is not that she replied he is a great man in his way the napoleon of the bourgeoisie but then he is one of them himself he collects the whole scheme of information as to the social life and opinionsthe domestic particulars i call themof your country details of your industries are at his fingertips he and i do not come into contact i am the trusted agent of both sovereigns but it is only in high diplomatic affairs that i ever intervene selingman it is true may be considered the greatest spy who ever breathed but a spy he is if we could only persuade your too amiable officials to believe onetenth of what we could tell them i think our friend there would breakfast in an english fortress if you have such a thing  we should only place him under police supervision declared norgate and let him go its just our way thats all  she waved the subject of selingman on one side but almost at that moment he stood once more before them he held an evening paper in his hand  i bring you the news he announced a terrible tragedy has happened the archduke of austria and his consort have been assassinated on their tour through bosnia  for a moment neither anna nor norgate moved norgate felt a strange sense of sickening excitement it was as though the curtain had been rung up  is the assassins name there he asked  the crime selingman replied appears to have been committed by a young servian student his name is sigismund henriote     chapter xxxi   they paused at last breathless and walked out of the most wonderful ballroom in london into the gardens aglow with fairy lanterns whose brilliance was already fading before the rising moon they found a seat under a tall elm tree and anna leaned back it was a queer mixture of sounds which came to their ears in the near distance the music of a wonderful orchestra rising and falling further away the roar of the great city still awake and alive outside the boundary of those grey stone walls  of course she murmured this is the one thing which completes my subjugation fancy an englishman being able to waltz almost in that beautiful room i fancied myself back in vienna except that it was more wonderful because it was you  you are turning my head he whispered this is like a night out of paradise and to think that we are really in the middle of london  ah do not mention london she begged or else i shall begin to think of sodom and gomorrah after all why need one live for anything else except the present  there is the comtesse he reminded her disconsolately  she sighed  how horrid of you  let us forget her then he begged we will go into the marquee there and have supper and afterwards dance again well steal tonight out of the calendar well call it ours and play with it as we please  she shook her head  no she decided you have reminded me of our duty and you are quite right you were brought here to talk to the comtesse i do not know why but she is in a curiously impenetrable frame of mind i tried hard to get her to talk to me but it was useless you must see what you can do fortunately she seems to be absolutely delighted to have met you again you have a dance with her have you not  he drew out his programme reluctantly  the next one too he sighed  anna rose quickly to her feet  how absurd of me to forget take me inside please and go and look for her at once  its all very well norgate grumbled but the last time i saw her she was about three deep among the notabilities i really dont feel that i ought to jostle dukes and ambassadors to claim a dance  you must not be so foolish anna insisted the comtesse cares nothing for dukes and ambassadors but she is most ridiculously fond of goodlooking young men mind you will do better with her if you speak entirely outside all of us she is a very peculiar woman if one could only read the secrets she has stored up in her brain sometimes she is so lavish with them and at other times and with other people it seems as though it would take an earthquake to force a sentence from her lips there she is see in that corner never mind the people around her go and do your duty  norgate found it easier than he had expected she no sooner saw him coming than she rose to her feet and welcomed him she laid her fingers upon his arm and they moved away towards the ballroom  i am afraid he apologised that i am rather an intruder you all seemed so interested in listening to the duke  on the contrary i welcome you as a deliverer she declared i have heard those stories so often and worse than having heard them is the necessity always to smile the duke is a dear good person and he has been exceedingly kind to me during the whole of my stay but oh how one sometimes does weary oneself of this london of yours yet i love it do you know that you were almost the first person i asked for when i arrived here they told me that you were in berlin  i was he admitted i am in the act of being transferred  fortunate person she murmured you speak the language of all capitals but i cannot fancy you in berlin  they had reached the edge of the ballroom he hesitated  do you care to dance or shall we go outside and talk  she smiled at him both may we not you dear discreet person when i think of the strange places where i have danced with youperhaps it is better not to remember  they moved away to the music and later on found their way into the garden the comtesse was a little thoughtful  you are a great friend of annas are you not she enquired  we are engaged to be married he answered simply  she made a little grimace  ah she sighed you nice men it comes to you all you amuse yourselves with us for a time and then the real feeling comes and where are we but it is queer too she went on thoughtfully that anna should marry an englishman especially just now  why especially just now  the comtesse evaded the question  anna seemed always she said to prefer the men of her own country oh what music shall we have one turn more mr francis norgate it is the waltz they playedbut who could expect a man to remember  they plunged again into the crowd of dancers the comtesse was breathless yet exhilarated when at last they emerged  but you dance as ever wonderfully she cried you make me think of those days in paris you make me even sad  they remain he assured her one of the most pleasant memories of my life  she patted his hand affectionately then her tone changed  almost she declared you have driven all other things out of my mind what is it that anna is so anxious to know from me you are in her confidence she tells me  entirely  that again is strange the comtesse continued when one considers your nationality yet anna herself has assured me of it do you know that she is a person whom i very much envy her life is so full of variety she is the special protégée of the emperor no woman at vienna is more trusted  i am not sure norgate observed that she was altogether satisfied with the results of her visit to rome  the comtesses fan fluttered slowly back and forth she looked for a moment or two idly upon the brilliant scene the smooth garden paths the sheltered seats the lawns themselves were crowded with little throngs of women in exquisite toilettes men in uniform and court dress there were wellknown faces everywhere it was the crowning triumph of a wonderful london season  annas was a very difficult mission the comtesse pointed out confidentially there is really no secret about these matters the whole world knows of italys position a few months ago at the time of what you call the balkan crisis germany pressed us very hard for a definite assurance of our support under any conditions of the triple alliance i remember that andrea was three hours with the king that day and our reply was unacceptable in berlin it may have helped to keep the peace one cannot tell the kaisers present letter is simply a repetition of his feverish attempt to probe our intentions  but at present norgate ventured there is no balkan crisis  the comtesse looked at him lazily out of the corners of her sleepy eyes  is there not she asked simply i have been away from italy for a week or so and andrea trusts nothing to letters yesterday i had a dispatch begging me to return i go tomorrow morning i do not know whether it is because of the pressure of affairs or because he wearies himself a little without me  one might easily imagine the latter norgate remarked but is it indeed any secret to you that there is a great feeling of uneasiness throughout the continent an extraordinary state of animation a bustle although a secret bustle of preparation in germany  i have heard rumours of this the comtesse confessed  when one bears these things in mind and looks a little into the future norgate continued one might easily believe that the reply to that still unanswered letter of the kaisers might well become historical  you would like me would you not she asked to tell you what that reply will most certainly be  very much  you are an englishman she remarked thoughtfully and intriguing with anna i fear that i do not understand the position  must you understand it  perhaps not she admitted it really matters very little i will speak to you just in the only way i can speak as a private individual i tell you that i do not believe that andrea will ever under any circumstances join in any war against england nor any war which has for its object the crushing of france in his mind the triple alliance was the most selfish alliance which any country has ever entered into but so long as the other two powers understood the situation it was scarcely italys part to point out the fact that she gained everything by it and risked nothing italy has sheltered herself for years under its provisions but neither at the time of signing it nor at any other time has she had the slightest intention of joining in an aggressive war at the request of her allies you see her government felt themselves safeand i think that that was where andrea was so cleverin promising to fulfil their obligations in case of an attack by any other power upon germany or austria because it was perfectly certain to andrea and to every person of common sense that no such aggressive attack would ever be made you read austrias demands from servia in the paper this morning  i did norgate admitted no one in the world could find them reasonable  they are not meant to be reasonable the comtesse pointed out they are the foundation from which the world quarrel shall spring russia must intervene to protect servia from their hideous injustice germany and austria will throw down the gage germany may be right or she may be wrong but she believes she can count on great britains neutrality she needs our help and believes she will get it that is because german diplomacy always believes that it is going to get what it wants now in a few words i will tell you what the german emperor would give me a province to know i will tell you that no matter what the temptation what the proffered reward may be italy will not join in this war on the side of germany and austria  you are very kind comtesse norgate said simply and i shall respect your confidence  she rose and laid her fingers upon his arm  to people whom i like she declared i speak frankly i give away no secrets i say what i believe and now i must leave you for a much subtler person and a much subtler conversation prince herschfeld is waiting to talk to me perhaps he too would like to know the answer which will go to his master but how can i tell  the ambassador had paused before them the comtesse rose and accepted his arm  i shall take away with me tonight at least two charming memories she assured him as she gathered up her skirts my two dances mr norgate have been delightful now i am equally sure of entertainment of another sort from prince herschfeld  the prince bowed  ah madame he sighed it is so hard to compete with youth i fear that the feet of mr norgate will be nimbler than my brain tonight  she nodded sympathetically  you are immersed in affairs of course she murmured au revoir mr norgate give my love to anna some day i hope that i shall welcome you both in rome     chapter xxxii   norgate pushed his way through a confused medley of crates which had just been unloaded and made his way up the warehouse to selingmans office selingman was engaged for a few minutes but presently opened the door of his sanctum and called his visitor in  well my young friend he exclaimed you have brought news sit down this is a busy morning we have had large shipments from germany i have appointments with buyers most of the day yet i can talk to you for a little time you were at the ball last night  i was permitted to escort the baroness von haase norgate replied  selingman nodded ponderously  i ask you no questions he said the baroness works on a higher plane i know more than you would believe though i know why the dear lady went to rome i know why she was at the ball i know in what respect you were probably able to help her but i ask no questions we work towards a common end but we work at opposite ends of the pole curiosity alone would be gratified if you were to tell me everything that transpired  you keep yourself marvellously wellinformed as to most things dont you mr selingman norgate remarked  platitudes young man platitudes selingman declared words of air what purpose have they you know who i am i hold in my hand a thousand strings any one that i pull will bring an answering message to my brain come what is it you wish to say to me  i am doing my work for you norgate remarked and doing it extraordinarily well i do not object to a certain amount of surveillance but i am getting fed up with boko  who the hell is boko selingman demanded  i must apologise norgate replied a nickname only he is a little redfaced man who looks like a childrens toy and changes his clothes about seven times a day he is with me from the moment i rise to the last thing at night he is getting on my nerves i am fast drifting into the frame of mind when one looks under the bed before one can sleep  young man selingman said a month ago you were a person of no importance today so far as i am concerned you are a treasurecasket you hold secrets you have a great value to us every one in your position is watched it is part of our system if the man for whom you have found so picturesque a nickname annoys you he shall be changed that is the most i can promise you  you dont trust me altogether then norgate observed coolly  selingman tapped on the table in front of him with his pudgy forefinger  norgate he declared solemnly trust is a personal matter i have no personal feelings i am a machine all the work i do is done by machinery the machinery of thought the machinery of action these are the only means by which sentiment can be barred and the curious fluctuations of human temperament guarded against if you were my son or if you had dropped straight down from heaven with a letter of introduction from the proper quarters you would still be under my surveillance  that seems to settle the matter norgate confessed so i suppose i mustnt grumble yours is rather a bloodless philosophy  perhaps selingman assented you see me as i sit here a merchant of crockery and i am a kind person if i saw suffering i should pause to ease it if a wounded insect lay in my path i should step out of my way to avoid it but if my dearest friend my nearest relation seemed likely to me to do one fraction of harm to the great cause i should without one seconds compunction arrange for their removal as inevitably and with as little hesitation as i leave this place at one oclock for my luncheon  norgate shrugged his shoulders  one apparently runs risks in serving you he remarked  what risks selingman asked keenly  the risk of being misunderstood of making mistakes  pooh selingman exclaimed i do not like the man who talks of risks let us dismiss this conversation i have work for you  norgate assumed a more interested attitude  i am ready he said go on please  a movement is on foot selingman proceeded to establish manufactories in this country for the purpose of producing my crockery a very large company will be formed a great part of the money towards which is already subscribed we have examined several sites with a view to building factories but i have not cared at present to open up direct negotiations a rumour of our enterprise is about and the price of the land we require would advance considerably if the prospective purchaser were known the land is situated half an acre at willesden threequarters of an acre at golders hill and an acre at highgate i wish you to see the agents for the sale of these properties i have ascertained indirectly the price which you will find against each lot with the agents name selingman continued passing across a folded slip of foolscap you will treat in your own name and pay the deposit yourself try and secure all three plots today so that the lawyers can prepare the deeds and my builder can make some preparatory plans there during the week  norgate accepted the little bundle of papers with some surprise enclosed with them was a thick wad of banknotes  there are two thousand pounds there for your deposits selingman continued if you need more telephone to me but understand i want to start to work laying the foundations within the next few days  ill do the best i can norgate promised but this is rather a change for me isnt it will boko come along  selingman smiled for a moment but immediately afterwards his face was almost stern  young man he said from the moment you pledged your brains to my service every action of your day has been recorded from one of my pigeonholes i could draw out a paper and tell you where you lunched yesterday where you dined the day before whom you met and with whom you talked and so it will be until our work is finished  so long as i know norgate sighed rising to his feet ill try to get used to him  norgate found no particular difficulty in carrying out the commissions entrusted to him the sale of land is not an everyday affair and he found the agents exceedingly polite and prompt the man with whom he arranged the purchase of about three quarters of an acre of building land at golders green on the conclusion of the transaction exhibited some little curiosity  queer thing he remarked but i sold half an acre a month or two ago to a man who came very much as you come today might have been a foreigner said he was going to put up a factory to make boots and shoes he is not going to start to build until next year but he wanted a very solid floor to stand heavy machinery look here  the agent climbed upon a pile of bricks and norgate followed his example there was a boarded space before them with scaffolding poles all around but no other signs of building and the interior consisted merely of a perfectly smooth concrete floor  thats the queerest way of setting about building a factory i ever saw the man pointed out  norgate who was not greatly interested assented the agent escorted him back to his taxicab  of course its not my business he admitted and you neednt say anything about this to your principals but i hope they dont stop with laying down concrete floors of course money for the property is the chief thing we want but we do want factories and the employment of labour and the sooner the better this fellowreynolds he said his name waspays up for the property all right has that concrete floor prepared and clears off  raising the money to build perhaps norgate remarked i dont think theres any secret about my peoples intentions they are going to build factories for the manufacture of crockery  the agent brightened up  well thats a new industry anyway crockery eh  its a big german firm in cannon street norgate explained they are going to make the stuff here that ought to be better for our people  the young man nodded  i expect theyre afraid of tariff reform he suggested those germans see a long way ahead sometimes  i am beginning to believe that they do norgate assented as he stepped into the taxi     chapter xxxiii   norgate walked into the club rather late that afternoon selingman and prince lenemaur were talking together in the little drawingroom they called him in and a few minutes later the prince took his leave  well thats all arranged norgate reported i have bought the three sites there was only one thing the fellow down at golders hill was anxious about  and that  he hoped you werent just going to put down a concrete floor and then shut the place up  mr selingmans amiable imperturbability was for once disturbed  what did the fellow mean he enquired  havent an idea norgate replied but he made me stand on a pile of bricks and look at a strip of land which some one else had bought upon a hill close by i suppose they want the factories built as quickly as possible and workpeople around the place  i shall have two hundred men at work tomorrow morning selingman remarked if that agent had not been a very ignorant person he would have known that a concrete floor is a necessity to any factory where heavy machinery is used  is it norgate asked simply  any other question selingman demanded  none at all  then we will go and play bridge  they cut into the same rubber selingman however was not at first entirely himself he played his cards in silence and he once very nearly revoked mrs benedek took him to task  dear man she said we rely upon you so much and today you fail to amuse us what is there upon your mind let us console you if we can  dear lady it is nothing selingman assured her my company is planning big developments in connection with our business the details afford me much food for thought my attention i fear sometimes wanders forgive me i will make amends when the day comes that my new factories start work i will give such a party as was never seen i will invite you all we will have a celebration that every one shall talk of and meanwhile behold i will wander no longer i declare no trumps  selingman for a time was himself again when he cut out however he fidgeted a little restlessly around the room and watched norgate share the same fate with an air of relief he laid his hand upon the latters arm  come into the other room norgate he invited i have something to say to you  norgate obeyed at once but the room was already occupied a little blond lady was entertaining a soldier friend at tea she withdrew her head from somewhat suspicious proximity to her companions at their entrance and greeted selingman with innocent surprise  how queer that you should come in just then mr selingman she exclaimed we were talking about germany captain fielder and i  selingman beamed upon them both he was entirely himself again he looked as though the one thing in life he had desired was to find mrs barlow and her military companion in possession of the little drawingroom  my country is flattered he declared especially he added with a twinkle in his eyes as the subject seemed to be proving so interesting  she made a little grimace at him  seriously mr selingman she continued captain fielder and i have been almost quarrelling he insists upon it that some day or other germany means to declare war upon us i have been trying to point out that before many years have passed england and france will have drifted apart germany is the nearest to us of the continental nations isnt she by relationship and race  mrs barlow selingman pronounced yours is the most sensible allusion to international politics which i have heard for many years you are right if i may be permitted to say so he added captain fielder is wrong germany has no wish to fight with any one the last country in the world with whom she would care to cross swords is england  if germany does not wish for war captain fielder persisted why does she keep such an extraordinary army why does she continually add to her navy why does she infest our country with spies and keep all her preparations as secret as possible  of these things i know little selingman confessed i am a manufacturer and i have few friends among the military party but this we all believe and that is that the german army and navy are our insurance against trouble from the east they are there so that in case of political controversy we shall have strength at our back when we seek to make favourable terms as to using that strength god forbid  the little lady threw a triumphant glance across at her companion  there captain fielder she declared you have heard what a typical wellinformed cultivated german gentleman has to say i rely much more upon mr selingman than upon any of the german reviews or official statements of policy  captain fielder was bluntly unconvinced  mr selingman without doubt he agreed may represent popular and cultivated german opinion the only thing is whether the policy of the country is dictated by that class do you happen to have seen the afternoon papers  not yet mr selingman admitted is there any news  there is the full text captain fielder continued of austrias demands upon servia i may be wrong but i say confidently that those demands which are impossible of acceptance which would reduce servia in fact to the condition of a mere vassal state are intended to provoke a state of war  mr selingman shook his head  i have seen the proposals he remarked they were in the second edition of the morning papers they are onerous without a doubt but remember that as you go further east all diplomacy becomes a matter of barter they ask for so much first because they are prepared to take a great deal less  it is my opinion captain fielder pronounced that these demands are couched with the sole idea of inciting russias intervention there is already a report that servia has appealed to st petersburg it is quite certain that russia as the protector of the slav nations can never allow servia to be humbled to this extent  even then mr selingman protested goodhumouredly austria is not germany  there are very few people captain fielder continued who do not realise that austria is acting exactly as she is bidden by germany tomorrow you will find that russia has intervened if vienna disregards her there will be mobilisation along the frontiers it is my private and very firm impression that germany is mobilising today and secretly  mr selingman laughed goodhumouredly  well well he said let us hope it is not quite so bad as that  you are frightening me captain fielder mrs barlow declared i am going to take you off to play bridge  they left the room selingman looked after them a little curiously  your military friend he remarked is rather a pessimist  well we havent many of them norgate replied nine people out of ten believe that a war is about as likely to come as an earthquake  selingman glanced towards the closed door  supposing he said dropping his voice a little supposing i were to tell you young man that i entirely agreed with your friend supposing i were to tell you that possibly by accident he has stumbled upon the exact truth what would you say then  norgate shrugged his shoulders  well he observed weve agreed havent we that a little lesson would be good for england it might as well come now as at any other time  it will not come yet mr selingman went on but i will tell you what is going to happen  his voice had fallen almost to a whisper his manner had become portentous  within a week or two he said germany and austria will have declared war upon russia and servia and france italy will join the alliesthat you yourself know as for england her time has not come yet we shall keep her neutral all the recent information which we have collected makes it clear that she is not in a position to fight even if she wished to nevertheless to make a certainty of it we shall offer her great inducements we shall be ready to deal with her when calais ostend boulogne and havre are held by our armies now listen do you flinch  the two men were still standing in the middle of the room selingmans brows were lowered his eyes were keen and hardset he had gripped norgate by the left shoulder and held him with his face to the light  speak up he insisted it is now or never if you mean to go through with this youre not funking it eh  not in the least norgate declared  for the space of almost thirty seconds selingman did not remove his gaze all the time his hand was like a vice upon norgates shoulder  very well he said at last you represent rather a gamble on my part but i am not afraid of the throw come back to our bridge now it was just a moments impulsei saw something in your face you realise i supposebut there i wont threaten you come back and well drink a mixed vermouth together the next few days are going to be rather a strain     chapter xxxiv   norgates expression was almost one of stupefaction he looked at the slim young man who had entered his sittingroom a little diffidently and for a moment he was speechless  well im hanged he murmured at last hardy you astonish me  the clothes are a perfect fit sir the man observed and i think that we are exactly the same height  norgate took a cigarette from an open box tapped it against the table and lit it he was fascinated however by the appearance of the man who stood respectfully in the background  talk about clothes making the man he exclaimed why hardy do you realise your possibilities you could go into my club and dine order jewels from my jeweller i am not at all sure that you couldnt take my place at a dinnerparty  the man smiled deprecatingly  not quite that i am sure sir if i may be allowed to say so though when you were good enough to give me the blue serge suit a short time ago and a few of your old straw hats two or three gentlemen stopped me under the impression that i was you i should not have mentioned it sir but for the present circumstances  and no wonder norgate declared if this werent really a serious affair hardy i should be inclined to make a little humorous use of you that isnt what i want now though listen put on one of my black overcoats and a silk hat get the man to call you a taxi up to the door and drive to smiths hotel you will enquire for the suite of the baroness von haase the baroness will allow you to remain in her rooms for half an hour at the end of that time you will return here change your clothes and await any further orders  very good sir the man replied  help yourself to cigarettes norgate invited passing the box across do the thing properly sit well back in the taxicab although im hanged if i think that my friend boko stands an earthly plenty of money in your pocket  plenty thank you sir  the man left the room and norgate after a brief delay followed his example a glance up and down the courtyard convinced him that boko had disappeared he jumped into a taxi gave an address in belgrave square and within a quarter of an hour was ushered into the presence of mr spencer wyatt who was seated at a writingtable covered with papers  mr norgate isnt it the latter remarked briskly i had mr hebblethwaites note and i am very pleased to give you five minutes sit down wont you and fire away  did mr hebblethwaite give you any idea as to what i wanted norgate asked  better read his note the other replied pushing it across the table with a little smile  norgate took it up and read  my dear spencer wyatt  a young friend of mine francis norgate who has been in the diplomatic service for some years and is home just now from berlin under circumstances which you may remember has asked me to give him a line of introduction to you which will secure him an interview during today here is that line norgate is a young man for whom i have a great friendship i consider him possessed of unusual intelligence and many delightful gifts but like many others of us he is a crank you can listen with interest to anything he may have to say to you unless he speaks of germany thats his weak point on any other subject he is as sane as the best of us  many thanks certainly i am coming to the review we are all looking forward to it immensely  ever yours  john w hebblethwaite  norgate set down the letter  there are two points of view mr spencer wyatt he said as to germany mr hebblethwaite believes that i am an alarmist i know that i am not this isnt any ordinary visit of mine i have come to see you on the most urgent matter which any one could possibly conceive i have come to give you the chance to save our country from the worst disaster that has ever befallen her  mr spencer wyatt looked at his visitor steadily his eyebrows had drawn a little closer together he remained silent however  i talk about the things i know of norgate continued by chance i have been associated during the last few weeks with the head of the german spies who infest this country i have joined his ranks i have become a double traitor i do his work but every report i hand in is a false one  do you realise quite what you are saying mr norgate  realise it norgate repeated my god do you think i come here to say these things to you for dramatic effect or from a sense of humour or as a lunatic every word i shall say to you is the truth at the present moment there isnt a soul who seriously believes that england is going to be drawn into what the papers describe as a little eastern trouble i want to tell you that that little eastern trouble has been brought about simply with the idea of provoking a european war germany is ready to strike at last and this is her moment not a fortnight ago i sat opposite the boy henriote in a café in soho my german friend handed him the money to get back to his country and to buy bombs its all part of the plot austrias insane demands are part of the plot they are meant to drag russia in russia must protest she must mobilise germany is secretly mobilising at this moment she will declare war against russia strike at france through belgium she will appeal to us for our neutrality  these are wonderful things you are saying mr norgate  i am telling you the simple truth norgate went on and the history of our country doesnt hold anything more serious or more wonderful shall i come straight to the point i promised to reach it within five minutes  take your own time the other replied my work is unimportant enough by the side of the things you speak of you honestly believe that germany is provoking a war against russia and france  i know it norgate went on she believesgermany believesthat italy will come in she also believes from false information that she has gathered in this country that under no circumstances will england fight it isnt about that i came to you weve become a slothful slack pleasureloving people but i still believe that when the time comes we shall fight the only thing is that we shall be taken at a big disadvantage we shall be open to a raid upon our fleet do you know that the entire german navy is at kiel  mr wyatt nodded manoeuvres he murmured  their manoeuvre norgate continued earnestly is to strike one great blow at our scattered forces mr spencer wyatt i have come here to warn you i dont understand the workings of your department i dont know to whom you are responsible for any step you might take but i have come to warn you that possibly within a few days probably within a week certainly within a fortnight england will be at war  mr wyatt glanced down at hebblethwaites letter  you are rather taking my breath away mr norgate  i cant help it sir norgate said simply i know that what i am telling you must sound like a fairy tale i beg you to take it from me as the truth  but mr spencer wyatt remarked if you have come into all this information mr norgate why didnt you go to your friend hebblethwaite why havent you communicated with the police and given this german spy of yours into charge  i have been to hebblethwaite and i have been to scotland yard norgate told him firmly and all that i have got for my pains has been a snub they wont believe in german spies mr wyatt you are a man of a little different temperament and calibre from those others i tell you that all of them in the cabinet have their heads thrust deep down into the sand they wont listen to me they wouldnt believe a word of what i am saying to you but its true  mr spencer wyatt leaned back in his chair he had folded his arms he was looking over the top of his desk across the room his eyebrows were knitted his thoughts had wandered away for several moments there was silence then at last he rose to his feet unlocked the safe which stood by his side and took out a solid chart dotted in many places with little flags each one of which bore the name of a ship he looked at it attentively  thats the position of every ship we own at six oclock this evening he pointed out its true we are scattered we are purposely scattered because of the review on monday morning i go down to the admiralty and i give the word every ship you see represented by those little flags moves in one direction  in other words norgate remarked it is a mobilisation  exactly  norgate leaned forward in his chair  youre coming to what i want to suggest he proceeded listen you can do it if you like go down to the admiralty tonight give that order set the wireless going mobilise the fleet tonight  mr wyatt looked steadfastly at his companion his fingers were restlessly stroking his chin his eyes seemed to be looking through his visitor  but it would be a week too soon he muttered  risk it norgate begged you have always the review to fall back upon the mobilisation to be effective should be unexpected mobilise tomorrow i am telling you the truth sir and youll know it before many days are passed even if i have got hold of a mares nest you know theres trouble brewing england will be in none the worse position to intervene for peace if her fleet is ready to strike  mr spencer wyatt rose to his feet he seemed somehow an altered man  look here he announced gravely i am going for the gamble if i have been misled there will probably be an end of my career i tell you frankly i believe in you i believe in the truth of the things you talk about i risked everything only a few weeks ago on my belief ill risk my whole career now keep your mouth shut dont say a word until tomorrow you will be the only man in england who knows it i am going to mobilise the fleet tonight shake hands mr norgate youre either the best friend or the worst foe ive ever had my coat and hat he ordered the servant who answered his summons tell your mistress if she enquires that i have gone down to the admiralty on special business     chapter xxxv   anna passed her hand through norgates arm and led him forcibly away from the shop window before which they had been standing  my mind is absolutely made up she declared firmly i adore shopping i love bond street and i rather like you but i will have no more trifles as you call them if you do not obey i shall gaze into the next tobacconists window we pass and go in and buy you all sorts of unsmokable and unusable things and oh dear here is the count i feel like a child who has played truant from school what will he do to me francis  dont worry dear norgate laughed were coming to the end of this tutelage you know  count lanyoki who had stopped his motorcar came across the street towards them he was as usual irreproachably attired he wore white gaiters patent shoes and a grey tall hat his black hair a little thin at the forehead was brushed smoothly back his moustache also black but streaked with grey was twisted upwards he had as always the air of having just left the hands of his valet  dear baroness he exclaimed as he accosted her london has been searched for you at the embassy my staff are reduced to despair telephones notes telegrams and personal calls have been in vain since lunchtime yesterday it seemed to us that you must have found some other sphere in which to dwell  perhaps i have anna laughed i am so sorry to have given you all this trouble but yesterdaywell let me introduce if i may my husband mr francis norgate we were married by special license yesterday afternoon  the counts amazement was obvious diplomatist though he was it was several seconds before he could collect himself and rise to the situation he broke off at last however in the midst of a string of interjections and realised his duties  my dear baroness he said my dear lady let me wish you every happiness and you sir he added turning to norgate you must have without a doubt my most hearty congratulations there that is said and now to more serious matters baroness have you not always considered yourself the ward of the emperor  she nodded  his majesty has been very kind to me she admitted at the same time i feel that i owe more to myself than i do to him his first essay at interfering in my affairs was scarcely a happy one was it  perhaps not the count replied and yet think what you have done you have married an englishman  i thought english people were quite popular in vienna anna reminded him  the count hesitated that he declared is scarcely the question what troubles me most is that fortyeight hours ago i brought you a dispatch from the emperor  you brought anna pointed out what really amounted to an order to return at once to vienna well you see i have disobeyed it  they were standing at the corner of clifford street and the count with a little gesture led the way into the less crowded thoroughfare  dear baroness he continued as they walked slowly along i am placed now in a most extraordinary position the emperors telegram was of serious import it cannot be that you mean to disobey his summons  well i really couldnt put off being married could i anna protested especially when my husband had just got the special license besides i do not wish to return to vienna just now  the count glanced at norgate and appeared to deliberate for a moment  the state of affairs in the east he said is such that it is certainly wiser for every one just now to be within the borders of their own country  you believe that things are serious anna enquired you believe then that real trouble is at hand  i fear so the count acknowledged it appears to us that servia has a secret understanding with russia or she would not have ventured upon such an attitude as she is now adopting towards us if that be so the possibilities of trouble are immense almost boundless that is why baroness the emperor has sent for you that is why i think you should not hesitate to at once obey his summons  anna looked up at her companion her eyes wide open a little smile parting her lips  but count she exclaimed you seem to forget a few days ago all that you say to me was reasonable enough but today there is a great difference is there not i have married an englishman henceforth this is my country  there was a moments silence the count seemed dumbfounded he stared at anna as though unable to grasp the meaning of her words  forgive me baroness he begged i cannot for the moment realise the significance of this thing do you mean me to understand that you consider yourself now an englishwoman  i do indeed she assented there are many ties which still bind me to austriaties count she proceeded looking him in the face of which i shall be mindful yet i am not any longer the baroness von haase i am mrs francis norgate and i have promised to obey my husband in all manner of ridiculous things at the same time may i add something which will perhaps help you to accept the position with more philosophy my husband is a friend of herr selingmans  the count glanced quickly towards norgate there was some relief in his facea great deal of distrust however  baroness he said my advice to you for your own good entirely is with all respect to your husband that you shorten your honeymoon and pay your respects to the emperor i think that you owe it to him i think that you owe it to your country  anna for a moment was grave again  just at present she pronounced i realise one debt only and that is to my husband i will come to the embassy tomorrow and discuss these matters with you count but whether my husband accompanies me or not i have now no secrets from him  the position then the count declared is intolerable may i ask whether you altogether realise baroness what this means the emperor is your guardian all your estates are subject to his jurisdiction it is his command that you return to vienna  anna laughed again she passed her fingers through norgates arm  you see she explained as they stood for a moment at the corner of the street i have a new emperor now and he will not let me go                                        selingman frowned a little as he recognised his visitor nevertheless he rose respectfully to his feet and himself placed a chair by the side of his desk  my dear count he exclaimed i am very glad to see you but this is an unusual visit i would have met you somewhere or come to the embassy have we not agreed that it was well for herr selingman the crockery manufacturer  that is all very well selingman the count interrupted but this morning i have had a shock it was necessary for me to talk with you at once in bond street i met the baroness von haase for twentyfour hours london has been ransacked in vain for her this you may not know but i will now tell you she has been our trusted agent the trusted agent of the emperor in many recent instances she has carried secrets in her brain messages to different countries there is little that she does not know the last twentyfour hours as i say i have sought for her the emperor requires her presence in vienna i meet her in bond street this morning and she introduces to me her husband an english husband mr francis norgate  he drew back a little with outstretched hands selingmans face however remained expressionless  married already he commented well that is rather a surprise  a surprise to be frank it terrifies me the count cried heaven knows what that woman could tell an englishman if she chose and her manneri did not like it the only reassuring thing about it was that she told me that her husband was one of your men  quite true selingman assented he is it is only recently that he came to us but i do not mind telling you that during the last few weeks no one has done such good work he is the very man we needed  you have trusted him  i trust or i do not trust selingman replied that you know i have employed this young man in very useful work i cannot blindfold him he knows  then i fear treachery the count declared  have you any reason for saying that selingman asked  the count lit a cigarette with trembling fingers  listen he said always my friend you undervalue a little the english race you undervalue their intelligence their patriotism their poise towards the serious matters of life i know nothing of mr francis norgate save what i saw this morning he is one of that type of englishmen cleanbred wellborn full of reserve taciturn yet i would swear honourable i know the type and i do not believe in such a man being your servant  the shadow of anxiety crossed selingmans face  have you any reason for saying this he repeated  no reason save the instinct which is above reason the count replied quickly i know that if the baroness and he put their heads together we may be under the shadow of catastrophe  selingman sat with folded arms for several moments  count he said at last i appreciate your point of view you have i confess disturbed me yet of this young man i have little fear i did not approach him by any vulgar means i took as they say here the bull by the horns i appealed to his patriotism  to what the count demanded incredulously  to his patriotism selingman repeated i showed him the decadence of his country decadence visible through all her institutions through her political tendencies through her young men of all classes i convinced him that what the country needed was a bitter tonic a kind but chastening hand i convinced him of this he believes that he betrays his country for her ultimate good as i told you before he has brought me information which is simply invaluable he has a position and connections which are unique  the count drew his chair a little nearer  you say that he has done you great service he said well you must admit for yourself that the day is too near now for much more to be expected could you not somehow guard against his resolution breaking down at the last moment think what it may mean to himthe sound of his national anthem at a critical moment the clash of arms in the distance the call of france across the channel a weekeven half a weeks extra preparation might make much difference  selingman sat for a short time deep in thought then he drew out a box of palelooking german cigars and lit one  count he announced solemnly i take off my hat to you leave the matter in my hands     chapter xxxvi   norgate set down the telephone receiver and turned to anna who was seated in an easychair by his side  selingman is downstairs he announced i rather expected i should see something of him as i didnt go to the club this afternoon you wont mind if he comes up  the man is a nuisance anna declared with a little grimace i was perfectly happy francis sitting here before the open window and looking out at the lights in that cool violet gulf of darkness i believe that in another minute i should have said something to you absolutely ravishing then your telephone rings and back one comes to earth again  norgate smiled as he held her hand in his  we will get rid of him quickly dearest he promised  there was a knock at the door and selingman entered his face wreathed in smiles he was wearing a long dinner coat and a flowing black tie he held out both his hands  so this is the great news that has kept you away from us he exclaimed my congratulations norgate you can never say again that the luck has left you baroness may i take advantage of my slight acquaintance to express my sincere wishes for your happiness  they wheeled up a chair for him and norgate produced some cigars the night was close they were on the seventh story overlooking the river and a pleasant breeze stole every now and then into the room  you are well placed here selingman declared myself i too like to be high up  these are really just my bachelor rooms norgate explained but under the circumstances we thought it wiser to wait before we settled down anywhere is there any news tonight  there is great news selingman announced gravely there is news of wonderful import in a few minutes you will hear the shouting of the boys in the strand there you shall hear it first from me germany has found herself compelled to declare war against russia  they were both speechless norgate was carried off his feet the reality of the thing was stupendous  russia has been mobilising night and day on the frontiers of east prussia selingman continued germany has chosen to strike the first blow now listen both of you i am going to speak in these few minutes to norgate here very serious words i take it that in the matters which lie between him and me you baroness are as one with him  it is so norgate admitted  to be frank then selingman went on you norgate during these momentous days have been the most useful of all my helpers here the information which i have dispatched to berlin emanating from you has been more than importantit has been vital it has been so vital that i have a long dispatch tonight begging me to reaffirm my absolute conviction as to the truth of the information which i have forwarded let us for a moment recapitulate you remember your interview with mr hebblethwaite on the subject of war  distinctly norgate assented  it was your impression selingman continued gathered from that conversation that under no possible circumstances would mr hebblethwaite himself or the cabinet as a whole go to war with germany in support of france is that correct  it is correct norgate admitted  nothing has happened to change your opinion  nothing  to proceed then selingman went on some little time ago you called upon mr bullen at the house of commons you promised a large contribution to the funds of the irish party a sum which is to be paid over on the first of next month on condition that no compromise in the home rule question shall be accepted by him even in case of war and further that if england should find herself in a state of war no nationalists should volunteer to fight in her ranks is this correct  perfectly norgate admitted  the information was of great interest in berlin selingman pointed out it is realised there that it means of necessity a civil war  without a doubt  you believe selingman persisted that i did not take an exaggerated or distorted view of the situation as discussed between you and mr bullen when i reported that civil war in ireland was inevitable  it is inevitable norgate agreed  selingman sat for several moments in portentous silence  we are on the threshold of great events he announced the cabinet opinion in berlin has been swayed by the two factors which we have discussed it is the wish of germany and her policy to end once and for all the eastern disquiet to weaken russia so that she can no longer call herself the champion of the slav races and uphold their barbarism against our culture france is to be dealt with only as the ally of russia we want little more from her than we have already but our great desire is that england of necessity and of her own choice should remain for the present neutral her time is to come later italy germany and austria can deal with france and russia to a mathematical certainty what we desire to avoid are any unforeseen complications i leave you tonight and i cable my absolute belief in the statements deduced from your work you have nothing more to say  nothing norgate replied  selingman was apparently relieved he rose a little later to his feet  my young friend he concluded in the near future great rewards will find their way to this country there is no one who has deserved more than you there is no one who will profit more that reminds me there was one little question i had to ask a friend of mine has seen you on your way back and forth to camberley three or four times lately you lunched the other day with the colonel of one of your lancer regiments how did you spend your time at camberley  for a moment norgate made no reply the moonlight was shining into the room and anna had turned out all the lights with the exception of one heavilyshaded lamp her eyes were shining as she leaned a little forward in her chair  boko again i suppose norgate grunted  certainly boko selingman acknowledged  i was in the yeomanry when i was younger norgate explained slowly i had some thought of entering the army before i took up diplomacy colonel chalmers is a friend of mine i have been down to camberley to see if i could pick up a little of the new drill  for what reason selingman demanded  need i tell you that norgate protested whatever my feeling for england may be at the present moment however bitterly i may regret the way she has let her opportunities slip the slovenly political condition of the country yet i cannot put away from me the fact that i am an englishman if trouble should come even though i may have helped to bring it about even though i may believe that it is a good thing for the country to have to meet trouble i should still fight on her side  but there will be no war selingman reminded him you yourself have ascertained that the present cabinet will decline war at any cost  the present government without a doubt norgate assented i am thinking of later on when your first task is over  selingman nodded gravely  when that day comes he said as he rose and took up his hat it will not be a war if your people resist it will be a butchery better to find yourself in one of the baroness castles in austria when that time comes it is never worth while to draw a sword in a lost cause i wish you good night baroness i wish you good night norgate  he shook hands with them both firmly but there was still something of reserve in his manner norgate rang for his servant to show him out they took their places once more by the window  war norgate murmured his eyes fixed upon the distant lights  anna crept a little nearer to him  francis she whispered that man has made me a little uneasy supposing they should discover that you have deceived them before they have been obliged to leave the country  they will be much too busy norgate replied to think about me  annas face was still troubled i did not like that mans look she persisted when he asked you what you were doing at camberley perhaps he still believes that you have told the truth but he might easily have it in his mind that you knew too many of their secrets to be trusted when the vital moment came  norgate leaned over and drew her towards him  selingman has gone he murmured it is only outside that war is throbbing dearest i think that my vital moments are now     chapter xxxvii   mr hebblethwaite permitted himself a single moment of abstraction he sat at the head of the table in his own remarkably wellappointed diningroom his gueststhere were eighteen or twenty of them in allrepresented in a single word successsuccess social as well as political his excellently cooked dinner was being served with faultless precision his epigrams had never been more pungent the very distinguished peeress who sat upon his right and whose name was a household word in the enemys camp had listened to him with enchained and sympathetic interest for a single second he permitted his thoughts to travel back to the humble beginnings of his political career he had a brief flashlight recollection of the suburban parlour of his early days the hard fight at first for a living then for some small place in local politics and then larger and more daring schemes as the boundary of his ambitions became each year a little further extended beyond him now was only one more step to be taken the last goal was well within his reach  the woman at his right recommenced their conversation which had been for a moment interrupted  we were speaking of success she said success often comes to one covered by the tentacles and parasites of shame and yet even in its grosser forms it has something splendid about it but success that carries with it no apparent drawback whatever is of course the most amazing thing of all i was reading that wonderful article of professor wilsons last month he quotes you very extensively his analysis of your character was in its way interesting directly i had read it however i felt that it lacked one thingsimplicity i made up my mind that the next time we talked intimately i would ask you to what you yourself attributed your success  hebblethwaite smiled graciously  i will not attempt to answer you in epigrams he replied i will pay a passing tribute to a wonderful constitution an invincible sense of humour which i think help one to keep ones head up under many trying conditions but the real and final explanation of my success is that i embraced the popular cause i came from the people and when i entered into politics i told myself and every one else that it was for the people i should work i have never swerved from that purpose it is to the people i owe whatever success i am enjoying today  the duchess nodded thoughtfully  yes she admitted you are right there shall i proceed with my own train of thought quite honestly  i shall count it a compliment he assured her earnestly even if your thoughts contain criticisms  you occupy so great a position in political life today she continued that one is forced to consider you especially in view of the future as a politician from every point of view now by your own showing you have been a specialist you have taken up the cause of the people against the classes you have stripped many of us of our possessionsthe duke you know hates the sound of your nameand by your legislation you have without a doubt improved the welfare of many millions of human beings but that is not all that a great politician must achieve is it there is our empire across the seas  imperialism he declared has never been in the foreground of my programme but i call myself an imperialist i have done what i could for the colonies i have even abandoned on their behalf some of my pet principles of absolute freedom in trade  you certainly have not been prejudiced she admitted whether your politics have been those of an imperialist from the broadest point of viewwell we wont discuss that question just now we might perhaps differ but there is just one more point zealously and during the whole of your career you have set your face steadfastly against any increase of our military power they say that it is chiefly due to you and mr busby that our army today is weaker in numbers than it has been for years you have set your face steadily against all schemes for national service you have taken up the stand that england can afford to remain neutral whatever combination of powers on the continent may fight now tell me do you see any possibility of failure from the standpoint of a great politician in your attitude  i do not he answered on the contrary i am proud of all that i have done in that direction for the reduction of our armaments i accept the full responsibility it is true that i have opposed national service i want to see the people develop commercially the withdrawing of a million of young men even for a month every year from their regular tasks would not only mean a serious loss to the manufacturing community but it would be apt to unsettle and unsteady them further it would kindle in this country the one thing i am anxious to avoidthe military spirit we do not need it duchess we are a peaceloving nation civilised out of the crude lust for conquest founded upon bloodshed i do believe that geographically and from every other point of view england with her navy can afford to fold her arms and if other nations should at any time be foolish enough to imperil their very existence by fighting for conquest or revenge then we who are strong enough to remain aloof can only grow richer and stronger by the disasters which happen to them  there was a momentary silence the duchess leaned back in her chair and mr hebblethwaite always the courteous host talked for a while to the woman on his left the duchess however reopened the subject a few minutes later  i come you must remember mr hebblethwaite she observed from long generations of soldiers and you as you have reminded me from a long race of yeomen and tradespeople therefore without a doubt our point of view must be different that perhaps is what makes conversation between us so interesting to me a conflict in europe sooner or later appears inevitable with england preserving a haughty and insular neutrality which from her present military condition would be almost compulsory the struggle would be between russia france italy germany and austria russia is an unknown force but in my mind i see austria and italy with perhaps one german army holding her back for many months perhaps indefinitely on the other hand i see france overrun by the germans very much as she was in 1870 i adore the french and i have little sympathy with the germans but as a fighting race i very reluctantly feel that i must admit the superiority of the germans very well then with ostend calais boulogne and havre seized by germany as they certainly would be and turned into naval bases do you still believe that englands security would be wholly provided for by her fleet  mr hebblethwaite smiled  duchess he said sooner or later i felt quite sure that our conversation would draw near to the german bogey the picture you draw is menacing enough i look upon its probability as exactly on the same par as the overrunning of europe by the yellow races  you believe in the sincerity of germany she asked  i do he admitted firmly there is a military element in germany which is to be regretted but the germans themselves are a splendid cultured and peaceloving people who are seeking their future not at the point of the sword but in the countinghouses of the world if i fear the germans it is commercially and from no other point of view  i wish i could feel your confidence the duchess sighed  i have myself recently returned from berlin mr hebblethwaite continued busby as you know has been many times an honoured guest there at their universities and in their great cities he has had every opportunity of probing the tendencies of the people his mind is absolutely and finally made up not in all history has there ever existed a race freer from the lust of bloodthirsty conquest than the german people of today  mr hebblethwaite concluded his sentence with some emphasis he felt that his words were carrying conviction some of the conversation at their end of the table had been broken off to listen to his pronouncements at that moment his butler touched him upon the elbow  mr bedells has just come up from the war office sir he announced he is waiting outside in the meantime he desired me to give you this  the butler who had served an archbishop and resented often his own presence in the establishment of a radical cabinet minister presented a small silver salver on which reposed a hastily twisted up piece of paper mr hebblethwaite with a little nod unrolled it and glanced towards the duchess who bowed complacently with the smile still upon his lips a confident light in his eyes mr hebblethwaite held out the crumpled piece of paper before him and read the hurriedly scrawled pencil lines  germany has declared war against russia and presented an ultimatum to france i have other messages  mr hebblethwaite was a strong man he was a man of immense selfcontrol yet in that moment the arteries of life seemed as though they had ceased to flow he sat at the head of his table and his eyes never left those pencilled words his mind fought with them discarded them only to find them still there hammering at his brain traced in letters of scarlet upon the distant walls war the great unbelievable tragedy the one thousandtoone chance in life which he had ever taken his hand almost fell to his side there was a queer little silence no one liked to ask him a question no one liked to speak it was the duchess at last who murmured a few words when the silence had become intolerable  it is bad news she whispered  it is very bad news indeed mr hebblethwaite answered raising his voice a little so that every one at the table might hear him i have just heard from the war office that germany has declared war against russia you will perhaps under the circumstances excuse me  he rose to his feet there was a queer singing in his ears the feast seemed to have turned to a sickly debauch all that pinnacle of success seemed to have fallen away the faces of his guests even as they looked at him seemed to his conscience to be expressing one thing and one thing onlythat same horrible conviction which was deadening his own senses he and the otherscould it be truehad they taken up lightly the charge and care of a mighty empire and dared to gamble upon instead of providing for its security he thrust the thought away and the natural strength of the man began to reassert itself if they had done ill they had done it for the peoples sake the people must rally to them now he held his head high as he left the room     chapter xxxviii   norgate found himself in an atmosphere of strange excitement during his two hours waiting at the house of commons on the following day he was ushered at last into mr hebblethwaites private room hebblethwaite had just come in from the house and was leaning a little back in his chair in an attitude of repose he glanced at norgate with a faint smile  well young fellow he remarked come to do the usual i told you so business i suppose  dont be an ass norgate most irreverently replied there are one or two things i must tell you and tell you at once i may have hinted at them before but you werent taking things seriously then first of all is mr bullen in the house  of course  could you send for him here just for a minute norgate pleaded i am sure it would make what i am going to say sound more convincing to you  hebblethwaite struck a bell by his side and despatched a messenger  how are things going norgate asked  france is mobilising as fast as she can hebblethwaite announced we have reports coming in that germany has been at it for at least a week secretly they say that austrian troops have crossed into poland there isnt anything definite yet but its war without a doubt war just as wed struck the right note for peace russia was firm but splendid austria was wavering just at the critical moment like a thunderbolt came germanys declaration of war heres mr bullen now go ahead norgate  mr bullen came into the room recognised norgate and stopped short  so youre here again young man are you he exclaimed i dont know why youve sent for me hebblethwaite but if you take my advice you wont let that young fellow go until youve asked him a few questions  mr norgate is a friend of mine hebblethwaite said i think you will find  friend or no friend the irishman interrupted he is a traitor and i tell you so to his face  that is exactly what i wished you to tell mr hebblethwaite norgate remarked nodding pleasantly i just want you to recall the circumstances of my first visit here  you came and offered me a bribe of a million pounds mr bullen declared if i would provoke a civil war in ireland in the event of england getting into trouble i wasnt sure whom you were acting for then but i am jolly certain now that young fellow is a german spy hebblethwaite  mr hebblethwaite knew that quite well admitted norgate coolly i came and told him so several times i think that he even encouraged me to do my worst  look here norgate hebblethwaite intervened im certain you are driving at something serious lets have it  quite right i am norgate assented i just wanted to testify to you that mr bullens reply to my offer was the patriotic reply of a loyal irishman i did offer him that million pounds on behalf of germany and he did indignantly refuse it but the point of the whole thing ismy report to germany  and that mr hebblethwaite asked eagerly  i reported mr bullens acceptance of the sum norgate told them i reported that civil war in ireland was imminent and inevitable and would come only the sooner for any continental trouble in which england might become engaged  mr hebblethwaites face cleared  i begin to understand now norgate he muttered good fellow  mr bullen was summoned in hot haste by one of his supporters and hurried out norgate drew his chair a little closer to his friends  look here hebblethwaite he said you wouldnt listen to me you knowi dont blame youbut i knew the truth of what i was saying i knew what was coming the only thing i could do to help was to play the double traitor i did it my chief who reported to berlin that this civil war was inevitable will get it in the neck but theres more to follow the baroness von haase and i were associated in an absolutely confidential mission to ascertain the likely position of italy in the event of this conflict i know for a fact that italy will not come in with her allies  do you mean that mr hebblethwaite asked eagerly  absolutely certain norgate assured him  hebblethwaite half rose from his place with excitement  i ought to telephone to the war office he declared it will alter the whole mobilisation of the french troops  france knows norgate told him quietly my wife has seen to that she passed the information on to them just in time to contract the whole line of mobilisation  youve been doing big things young fellow mr hebblethwaite exclaimed excitedly go on tell me at once what was your report to germany  i reported that italy would certainly fulfil the terms of her alliance and fight norgate replied furthermore i have convinced my chief over here that under no possible circumstances would the present cabinet sanction any war whatsoever i have given him plainly to understand that you especially are determined to leave france to her fate if war should come and to preserve our absolute neutrality at all costs  go on hebblethwaite murmured finish it anyhow  there is very little more norgate concluded i have a list here of properties in the outskirts of london all bought by germans and all having secret preparations for the mounting of big guns you might just pass that on to the war office and they can destroy the places at their leisure there isnt anything else hebblethwaite as i told you ive played the double traitor it was the only way i could help now if i were you i would arrest the masterspy for whom i have been working most of the information he has picked up lately has been pretty bad and i fancy hell get a warm reception if he does get back to berlin but if ever there was a foreigner who abused the hospitality of this country selingmans the man  well see about that presently mr hebblethwaite declared leaning back let me think over what you have told me it comes to this norgate youve practically encouraged germany to risk affronting us  i cant help that norgate admitted germany has gone into this war firmly believing that italy will be on her side and that we shall have our hands occupied in civil war and in any case that we should remain neutral i am not asking you questions hebblethwaite i dont know what the position of the government will be if germany attacks france in the ordinary way but one thing i do believe and that is that if germany breaks belgian neutrality and invades belgium there isnt any english government which has ever been responsible for the destinies of this country likely to take it lying down we are shockingly unprepared or else of course thered have been no war at all we shall lose hundreds of thousands of our young men because theyll have to fight before they are properly trained but we must fight or perish and we shall fighti am sure of that hebblethwaite  we are all englishmen hebblethwaite answered simply  the door was suddenly opened spencer wyatt pushed his way past a protesting doorkeeper hebblethwaite rose to his feet he seemed to forget norgates presence  youve been down to the admiralty he asked quickly do you know  spencer wyatt pointed to norgate his voice shook with emotion  i know hebblethwaite he replied but theres something that you dont know we were told to mobilise the fleet an hour ago my god what chance should we have had germany means scrapping and look where our ships are or ought to be  i know it hebblethwaite groaned  well they arent there spencer wyatt announced triumphantly a week ago that young fellow came to me he told me what was impending i half believed it before he began when he told me his story i gambled upon it i mistook the date for the grand review i signed the order for mobilisation at the admiralty seven days ago we are safe hebblethwaite ive been getting wireless messages all day yesterday and today we are at cromarty and rosyth our torpedo squadron is in position our submarines are off the german coast it was just the toss of a coinpapers and a country life for me or our fleet safe and a great start in the war this is the man who has done it  its the best news ive heard this week hebblethwaite declared with glowing face if our fleet is safe the country is safe for a time if this thing comes weve a chance ill go through the country ill start the day wars declared ill talk to the people ive slaved for they shall come to our help well have the greatest citizen army who ever fought for their native land ive disbelieved in fighting all my life if we are driven to it well show the world what peaceloving people can do if the weapon is forced into their hands norgate the country owes you a great debt another time wyatt ill tell you more than you know now what can we do for you young fellow  norgate rose to his feet  my work is already chosen thanks he said as he shook hands i have been preparing for some time     chapter xxxix   the cardrooms at the st jamess club were crowded but very few people seemed inclined to play they were standing or sitting about in little groups a great many of them were gathered around the corner where selingman was seated he was looking somewhat graver than usual but there was still a confident smile upon his lips  my little friend he said patting the hand of the fair lady by his side reassure yourself your husband and your husbands friends are quite safe for england there will come no fighting believe me that is a true word  but the impossible is happening all the time mrs barlow protested who would have believed that without a single word of warning germany would have declared war against russia  mr selingman raised his voice a little  let me make the situation clear he begged listen to me if you will because i am a patriotic german but also a lover of england a sojourner here and one of her greatest friends germany has gone to war against russia why you will say upon a trifling pretext my answer to you is this there is between the teuton and the slav an enmity more mighty than anything you can conceive of it has been at the root of all the unrest in the balkans many a time germany has kept the peace at the imminent loss of her own position and prestige but one knows now that the struggle must come the russians are piling up a great army with only one intention they mean to wrest from her keeping certain provinces of austria to reduce germanys one ally to the condition of a vassal state to establish the slav people there and throughout the balkan states at the expense of the teuton germany must protect her own it is a struggle mind you which concerns them alone if only there were common sense in the world every one else would stand by and let germany and austria fight with russia on the one great issueslav or teuton  but theres france little mrs barlow reminded him she cant keep out of it she is russias ally  alas my dear madam selingman continued you point out the tragedy of the whole situation if france could see wisdom if france could see truth she would fold her arms with you others keep her country and her youth and her dignity but i will be reasonable she is as you say boundbound by her alliance to russia and she will fight very well germany wants no more from france than what she has germany will fight a defensive campaign she will push france back with one hand in as friendly a manner as is compatible with the ethics of war on the east she will move swiftly she will fight russia and believe me the issue will not be long doubtful she will conclude an honourable peace with france at the first opportunity  then you dont think we shall be involved at all some one else asked  if you are selingman declared it will be your own doing and it will simply be the most criminal act of this generation germany has nothing but friendship for england i ask you what british interests are threatened by this inevitable clash between the slav and the teuton it is miserable enough for france to be dragged in it would be lunacy for england therefore though it is true that serious matters are pending though alas i must return at once to see what help i can afford my country never for a moment believe any of you that there exists the slightest chance of war between germany and england  then i dont see mrs barlow sighed why we shouldnt have a rubber of bridge  let us selingman assented it is a very reasonable suggestion it will divert our thoughts here is the afternoon paper let us first see whether there is any further news  it was mrs paston benedek who opened it she stared at the first sheet for a moment with eyes which were almost dilated then she looked around her voice sounded unnatural  look she cried francis norgatemr francis norgate has committed suicide in his rooms  it is not possible selingman exclaimed  they all crowded around the paper the announcement was contained in a few lines only mr francis norgate had been discovered shot through the heart in his sittingroom at the milan court with a revolver by his side there was a letter addressed to his wife who had left the day before for paris no further particulars could be given of the tragedy the little group of men and women all looked at one another in a strange questioning manner for a moment the war cloud seemed to have passed even from their memories it was something newer and in a sense more dramatic this norgateone of themselves norgate who had played bridge with them day after day had been married only a week or so agodead under the most horrible of all conditions and baring only a few weeks before there was an uneasiness about which no one could put into words vague suspicions strange imaginings  its only three weeks some one muttered since poor baring shot himself what the devil does it mean norgatewhy the fellow was full of common sense  he was fearfully cut up some one interposed about that berlin affair  but he was just married mrs paston benedek reminded them married to the most charming woman in europerich too and noble i saw them only two days ago together they were the picture of happiness this is too terrible i am going into the other room to sit down please forgive me mr selingman will you give me your arm  she passed into the little drawingroom almost dragging her companion she closed the door behind them her eyes were brilliant the words came hot and quivering from her lips  listen she ordered tell me the truth was this suicide or not  why should it not be selingman asked gravely norgate was an englishman after all he must have felt that he had betrayed his country he has given us as you know very valuable information the thought must have preyed upon his conscience  dont lie to me she interrupted tell me the truth now or never come near me again never ask me another question dont be surprised to find the whole circle of your friends here broken up and against you its only the truth i ask for if a thing is necessary do i not know that it must be done but i will hear the truth there was that about barings death which i never understood but thisthis shall be explained  selingman stood for a moment or two with folded arms  dear lady he said soothingly you are not like the others you have earned the knowledge of the truth you shall have it i did not mistrust francis norgate but i knew very well that when the blow fell he would waver these englishmen are all like that they can lose patience with their illgoverned country they can go abroad write angry letters to the times declare that they have shaken the dust of their native land from their feet but when the pinch comes they fall back norgate has served me well but he knew too much he is safer where he is  he was murdered then she whispered  selingman nodded very slightly  it is seldom he declared that we go so far believe me it is only because our great empire is making its move stretching out for the great world war that i gave the word what is one mans life when millions are soon to perish  she sank down into an easychair and covered her face with her hands  i am answered she murmured only i know now i was not made for these things i love scheming but i am a woman     chapter xl   mr selingmans influence over his fellows had never been more marked than on that gloomiest of all afternoons they gathered around him as he sat on the cushioned fender a cup of tea in one hand and a plateful of buttered toast by his side  today he proclaimed i bring good news yesterday i must admit things looked black and the tragedy to poor young norgate made us all miserable  i should have said things looked worse one of the men declared throwing down an afternoon paper the cabinet council is still sitting and there are all sorts of rumours in the city  i was told by a man in the war office mrs barlow announced that england would stand by her treaty to belgium and that germany has made all her plans to invade france through belgium  rumours of course there must be selingman agreed but i bring something more than rumour i received today by special messenger from berlin a dispatch of the utmost importance germany is determined to show her entire friendliness towards england she recognises the difficulties of your situation she is going to make a splendid bid for your neutrality much as i would like to i cannot tell you more this however i know to be the basis of her offer you in england could help in the fight solely by means of your fleet it is germanys suggestion that in return for your neutrality she should withdraw her fleet from action and leave the french northern towns unbombarded you will then be in a position to fulfil your obligations to france whatever they may be without moving a stroke or spending a penny it is a triumph of diplomacy thata veritable triumph  it does sound all right mrs barlow admitted  it has relieved my mind of a mighty burden selingman continued setting down his empty plate and brushing the crumbs from his waistcoat i feel now that we can look on at this world drama with sorrowing eyes indeed but free from feelings of hatred and animosity i have had a trying day i should like a little bridge let us  selingman did not finish his sentence the whole room for a moment seemed to become a study in still life a woman who had been crossing the floor stood there as though transfixed a man who was dealing paused with an outstretched card in his hand every eye was turned on the threshold it was norgate who stood there norgate metamorphosed in khaki uniforman amazing spectacle mrs barlow was the first to break the silence with a piercing shriek then the whole room seemed to be in a turmoil selingman alone sat quite still there was a grey shade upon his face and the veins were standing out at the back of his hands  so sorry to startle you all norgate said apologetically of course you havent seen the afternoon papers it was my valet who was found dead in my roomsa most mysterious affair he added his eyes meeting selingmans the inquest is to be this afternoon  your valet selingman muttered  a very useful fellow norgate continued strolling to the fireplace and standing there but with a very bad habit of wearing my clothes when i am away i was down in camberley for three days and left him in charge  they showered congratulations upon him but in the midst of them the strangeness of his appearance provoked their comment  what does it mean mrs benedek asked patting his arm have you turned soldier  in a sense i have norgate admitted but only in the sense that every ablebodied englishman will have to do in the course of the next few months directly i saw this coming i arranged for a commission  but there is to be no war mrs barlow exclaimed mr selingman has been explaining to us this afternoon what wonderful offers germany is making so that we shall be able to remain neutral and yet keep our pledges  mr selingman norgate said quietly is under a delusion germany it is true has offered us a shameless bribe i am glad to be able to tell you all that our ministry whatever their politics may be have shown themselves men an english ultimatum is now on its way to berlin war will be declared before midnight  selingman rose slowly to his feet his face was black with passion he pushed a man away who stood between them he was face to face with norgate  so you he thundered suddenly reckless of the bystanders are a double traitor you have taken pay from germany and deceived her you knew after all that your government would make war when the time came is that so  i was always convinced of it norgate replied calmly i also had the honour of deceiving you in the matter of mr bullen i have been the means owing to your kind and thoughtful information of having the fleet mobilised and ready to strike at the present moment and there are various little pieces of property i know about mr selingman around london where we have taken the liberty of blowing up your foundations there may be a little disappointment for you too in the matter of italy the money you were good enough to pay me for my doubtful services has gone towards the establishment of a red cross hospital as for you selingman i denounce you now as one of those who worked in this country for her ill one of those pests of the world working always in the background dishonourably and selfishly against the country whose hospitality you have abused if i have met you on your own ground well i am proud of it you are a german spy selingman  selingmans hand fumbled in his pocket scarcely a soul was surprised when norgate gripped him by the wrist and they saw the little shining revolver fall down towards the fender  you shall suffer for these words selingman thundered you young fool you shall bite the dust you and hundreds of thousands of your cowardly fellows when the german flag flies from buckingham palace  norgate held up his hand and turned towards the door two men in plain clothes entered  that may be a sight norgate said calmly which you at any rate will not be permitted to see i have had some trouble in arranging for your arrest as we are not yet under martial law but i think you will find your way to the tower of london before long and i hope it will be with your back to the light and a dozen rifles pointing to your heart  a third man had come into the room he tapped selingman on the shoulder and whispered in his ear  i demand to see your warrant the latter exclaimed  the officer produced it selingman threw it on the floor and spat upon it he looked around the room in the further corner of which two men and a woman were standing upon chairs to look over the heads of the little crowd  take me where you will he snarled you are a rotten treacherous cowardly race you english and i hate you all you can kill me first if you will but in two months time you shall learn what it is like to wait hand and foot upon your conquerors  he strode out of the room a guard on either side of him and the door closed one woman had fainted mrs paston benedek was swaying back and forth upon the cushioned fender sobbing hysterically norgate stood by her side  i have forgotten the names he announced pointedly of many of that fellows dupes i am content to forget them i am off now he went on his tone becoming a little kinder i am telling you the truth its war you men had better look up any of the forces that suit you and get to work we shall all be needed there is work too for the women any quantity of it my wife will be leaving again for france next week with the first red cross ambulance corps i dare say she will be glad to hear from any one who wants to help  i shall be a nurse mrs paston benedek decided i am sick of bridge and amusing myself  the costume is quite becoming mrs barlow murmured glancing at herself in the lookingglass and i adore those poor dear soldiers  well ill leave you to it norgate declared good luck to you all  they crowded around him shaking him by the hand still besieging him with questions about selingman he shook his head goodhumouredly and made his way towards the door  theres nothing more to tell you he concluded selingman is just one of the most dangerous spies who has ever worked in this country but the war itself was inevitable weve known that for years only we wouldnt believe it well all meet again perhaps in the work later on  late that night norgate stood hand in hand with anna at the window of their little sittingroom down in the strand the newsboys were shouting the ominous words the whole of london was stunned the great war had come  its wonderful dear anna whispered that we should have had these few days of so great happiness i feel brave and strong now for our task  norgate held her closely to him  weve been in luck he said simply we were able to do something pretty soon i have had the greatest happiness in life a man can have now i am going to offer my life to my country and pray that it may be spared for you but above all whatever happens he added leaning a little further from the window towards where the curving lights gleamed across the black waters of the thames above all whatever may happen to us we are face to face with one splendid thinga great country to fight for and a just cause i saw hebblethwaite as i came in he is a changed man talks about raising an immense citizen army in six months both his boys have taken up commissions hebblethwaite himself is going around the country recruiting they are his people after all he has given them their prosperity at the expense alas of our safety its up to them now to prove whether the old spirit is there or not we shall need two million men hebblethwaite believes we shall get them long before the camps are ready to receive them if we do it will be his justification  and if we dont anna murmured  norgate threw his head a little further back  most pictures he said have two sides but we need only look at one i am going to believe that we shall get them i am going to remember the only true thing that fellow selingman ever said that our lesson had come before it is too late i am going to believe that the heart and conscience of the nation is still a live thing if it is dear the end is certain and i am going to believe that it is
