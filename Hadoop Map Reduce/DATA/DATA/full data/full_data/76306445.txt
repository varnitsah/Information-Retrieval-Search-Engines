southern waters is a complete story in itself but forms the eleventh volume of a line known by the general title of the rover boys series for young americans  eleven volumes just think of it what a great number to write about one set of young people and their doings when i started out as i have mentioned before i thought to pen three volumes possibly four i was not at all sure that the boys and girls would wish any of them but no sooner had i given them the rover boys at school than there was a demand for the rover boys on the ocean and then the rover boys in the jungle and then year after year there followed the rover boys out west on the great lakes in the mountains on land and sea in camp on the river and on the plains where we last met them  in the present tale the scene is shifted to the lower mississippi and then the gulf of mexico as before sam tom and dick are introduced along with a number of their friends and all have a variety of adventures and not a little fun while on the gulf the boys discover a deserted steam yacht board the craft and try to ascertain who is the owner and this leads to a mystery which i leave the pages that follow to unfold  once again i take the opportunity to thank the thousands of young folks all over our broad land who have signified their appreciation of my efforts to afford them amusement and at the same time teach a moral were it possible i should like nothing better than to write to each and shake everyone by the hand but that is out of the question so i can simply pen my thanks and subscribe myself  affectionately and sincerely yours  arthur m winfield     the rover boys in southern waters    chapter i  the rover boys and their friends  the houseboat is gone  tom what do you mean  i mean just what i say sam the houseboat is gonevanished missing disappeared drifted away stolen ejaculated tom rover excitedly  tom dont go on in such a crazy fashion do you mean to say the houseboat isnt where we left it  it is notand it is nowhere in sight on the river returned tom rover come we must tell dick and the others about this  but we left the dora in charge of that big planter last night insisted the youngest of the rover boys he said he would take good care of the craft  well he is gone too i hunted high and low for the houseboat and for that planter but without success  maybe the boat drifted away with the planter on board tom the current has been pretty strong since those heavy rains  she was tied up good and tight answered tom rover his usually merry face wearing a troubled look i cant understand it  i must say i didnt like that planters manner much he looked to be rather a sly one come on let us find dick and the others at once went on sam rover if the houseboat has been stolen we want to know it right away so we can get on the trail of the thief  true for you sam tom rover heaved a short sigh my what a lot of troubles we have had since we started on this houseboat trip  yesbut we have had lots of sport too  the two brothers were standing near the bank of the broad mississippi river just below the town of shapette in louisiana the party to which they belonged had reached the town on their journey down the father of waters the day before and an hour later the houseboat had been tied up at a bend in the stream and left in charge of a planter who had appeared and volunteered for the task the planter had given his name as gasper pold and had stated that his plantation lay half a mile inland on higher ground he had mentioned several people in shapette as being his close friendsamong others the principal storekeeperand the boys had thought it all right to get him to look after the houseboat while they paid a visit to a sugar plantation where one of their party had a distant relative living  to my old readers the rover boys sam tom and dick need no special introduction sam was the youngest funloving tom next and coolheaded and clever dick the oldest  when at home the three boys lived with their father anderson rover and their uncle randolph and aunt martha in a pleasant portion of new york state called valley brook near the village of dexters corners from that home they had gone as already related in the rover boys at school to putnam hall an ideal place of learning where they made many friends and also some enemies  a term at school had been followed by a brief trip on the atlantic ocean and then a journey to the jungles of africa where the lads went in a hunt for their father who had become lost then they had gone west to establish a family claim to a valuable mine and afterwards taken two welldeserved outings one on the great lakes and the other in the mountains  from the mountains the rover boys had expected to go back to putnam hall but a scarlet fever scare caused a temporary closing of that institution of learning and the lads took a trip to the pacific coast and were cast away on the ocean as told of in the rover boys on land and sea the seventh volume of this series but all came back safely and returned to the hall there to do their duty and have considerable fun as set forth in the rover boys in camp  the boys uncle randolph rover had taken an elegant houseboat for debt this craft was located on the ohio river and in a volume called the rover boys on the river i related how sam tom and dick resolved to take a trip on the craft during their summer vacation on this outing they were accompanied by songbird powell a school chum given to the making of doggerel which he persisted in calling poetry fred garrison who had stood by the rovers through thick and thin and hans mueller a german youth who had not yet fully mastered the english language to make the trip more interesting the boys invited an old friend mrs stanhope to accompany them and also mrs laning her sister with mrs stanhope was a daughter dora who dick rover thought was the best and sweetest girl in the whole world and with mrs laning were her daughters grace and nellie warm friends of tom and sam  the trip on the houseboat started well enough but soon came trouble through the underhanded work of dan baxter a big youth who had been the rovers bitter enemy ever since they had gone to putnam hall and another boy named lew flapp these young rascals ran off with the houseboat and two of the girls and it took hard work to regain the craft and come to the girls rescue lew flapp was made a prisoner and sent east to stand trial for some of his numerous misdeeds but dan baxter escaped  we dont want to see any more of baxter sam had said but this wish was not to be gratified floating down the mississippi the houseboat got damaged in a big storm and had to be laid up for repairs this being so all on board decided to take a trip inland and accordingly they set out the ladies and girls by way of the railroad and the boys on horseback  as already told in the rover boys on the plains this trip was full of mystery and peril dan baxter turned up most unexpectedly and our friends visited a mysterious ranch only to learn that it was a rendezvous for a band of counterfeiters through a government detective the counterfeiters were rounded up only one man sack todd escaping dan baxter also got away but later on he was traced to a big swamp where his horse was found stuck fast in the slimy ooze it was thought by some that baxter had lost his life trying to find his way through the swamp but of this the rovers were somewhat doubtful  after the capture of the counterfeiters the boys and their chums had gone on to meet the ladies and the girls and had spent a full week at the ranch of a friend having the best times possible horseback riding hunting and helping to roundup cattle then the whole party had gone back to the mississippi embarked on the dora as the houseboat was named and floated down the mighty stream once more  this sort of thing is simply grand fred garrison had remarked as he stood on the forward deck of the craft yet an hour later he had changed his tune the houseboat had gone whirling in a bend of the stream struck a snag and hurled poor fred overboard he was hauled up by sam and dick rover and then it was ascertained that the houseboat was leaking and would have to be laid up again for repairs  they had stopped at the town of shapette a small place and there they found a carpenter who promised to do what they wanted when the houseboat was laid up the captain had come to them with a letter  my brother in cairo is dead said captain starr i shall have to leave you and look after his children  the captain was an eccentric individual and the rovers did not like him much so they were perfectly willing to let him go they decided to look around for somebody else to manage the houseboat and in the meantime run the craft themselves  with the party as cook and general housekeeper was alexander pop a colored man who had once been a waiter at putnam hall but who was now attached to the rover household the boys had expected to leave aleck as he was called in charge of the dora while they visited a nearby sugar plantation but the colored man had begged to be taken along jes fo de change as he expressed it as aleck had remained on the houseboat during the entire time the boys were on the plains dick agreed to take him along and thus for the time being the dora had been left in the sole care of the planter  after the visit to the sugar plantation the party had ridden to shapette to do a little shopping before returning to the houseboat there tom and sam had left the others to make certain that the dora was in proper trim to continue the trip down the mississippi on the way sam stopped at a plantation house to get a drink of water and when he rejoined his brother it was to learn the dismaying news that the houseboat and the man left in charge of the craft had mysteriously disappeared    chapter ii  about a missing houseboat  let us go down the river and see if the dora is behind yonder trees suggested sam after he had had time to digest what his brother had said  all right if you say so answered tom but i feel it in my bones it wont do any good  the two brothers ran along the wet and slippery bank of the river which at this point sprawled out into almost a lake they had to walk around several wet places and were pretty well out of wind by the time they gained the patch of wood the youngest rover had pointed out they ran to a point where they could get a clear view of the stream for a full mile  gonejust as i told you said tom laconically  oh tom do you really think that planter stole the houseboat  i dont know what to think to tell the truth we have fallen in with all kinds of evil characters since we began this trip  even if we go back to dick and the others and tell them what good will it do  i dont really know but i am going to tell dick just as fast as i can  there seemed really nothing else to do and with heavy hearts sam and tom retraced their steps to where the dora had been tied up and started to return to town  this will certainly worry the ladies and the girls a good deal observed sam as they hurried along if the houseboat is gone we cant continue the trip  they wont be worried any more than we are sam its hard lines all around if that planter really stole the boat he ought to suffer for it  just what i say  the brothers soon came in sight of shapettea small settlement where half of the inhabitants were of french extraction as they reached one of the streets they heard a cheerful whistle  thats dick said sam he wont whistle so happily when he learns the news  hullo came from dick rover as he caught sight of his brothers what brings you back so soon  thought you were going to stay on the houseboat until we got there added fred garrison who with hans mueller accompanied the eldest rover  there is no houseboat to stay on answered tom  what  the houseboat is goneand so is that planter who said hed take care of her  mine cracious me burst out hans mueller you tont tole me alretty  tom you dont mean dick paused  the houseboat is gone clean and clear dick  and that planter gasper pold  is gone too returned sam and so is that carpenter who said hed repair the craft  this is certainly too bad tell me the particulars and dicks face grew decidedly serious  there isnt much to tell said tom we got there looked around made a search and here we are no boat in sight no person to be seen just nothing and nobody  but the houseboat must be somewhere tom  i agree with you but not being a secondsight mind reader i cant tell you where  alexander pop who was with the boys had listened closely with his eyes rolling in wonder  fo de ian sakes he ejaculated dats de wuss news is heard in a long time seems lak da was no end of troubles fo dis crowd  well if this doesnt beat the dutch murmured fred garrison  yah und it beats der irish too alretty came from hans mueller chust ven ve dink der sthars vos shinin it begins to rain eh aint dot so  youve struck the nail on the head hans answered sam i thought wed have plain sailing from today and now it looks as if wed have no sailing at all  boys spoke up dick sharply if that houseboat has been stolen we must get the craft back  so say i dick answered tom but how are you going to begin about it  that remains to be seen of one thing i am pretty certainif the houseboat went anywhere it went down the stream only a powerful tug or steamboat could pull such a boat up this mighty river  thats trueand we must look down the mississippi for the craft said fred  where is songbird asked tom  i left him with the ladies and the girls they will be along presently in a carriage answered dick  there wont be any use of the ladies and girls going down to the river so long as the dora is missing said sam theyll have to stay in town or go back to that sugar plantation until we learn about the craft  it was decided that sam should join the other crowd and acquaint them with the news he found them at one of the stores where mrs stanhope was buying some embroidery silk  have you got tired of waiting for us sam asked grace laning who was the first to see the youngest rover  oh ive got bad news grace and then he told the girl of what had occurred in the midst of which the others came up  missing again ejaculated songbird powell too bad whats to be done  we dont know yet  the ladies were much alarmed and so were the girls sam did what he could to quiet their fears yet he felt unhappy himself  i did not like the looks of that planter at all declared dora stanhope he had the face of a sneak i was going to speak to dick about it and i am sorry now that i didnt  i presume we shall have to remain here until you find the houseboat came from mrs laning  either here or at the sugar plantation answered sam  what will you do  i dont know yetprobably go down the river and look for the dora she is so large they cant hide her very well  maybe the current of the river carried her away and the planter got scared and left suggested songbird youll remember she broke away once before  she couldnt break awayshe was tied up good and tight answered sam decidedly  well if you cannot find the houseboat well have to go home from here instead of from new orleans said mrs stanhope that will shorten our trip somewhat but not a great deal but i hope for your uncles sake that you get his property back  well do that or know the reason why answered sam  whats this trouble about your houseboat asked the storekeeper who had caught part of the conversation  its missing  so you said too bad  do you know the planter who had charge of the craft went on sam he was tall and thin and went by the name of gasper pold  what did you leave your boat with that man you should have known better didnt you know pold was an old lottery sharp  we did not  well he is and has cheated many a poor white man and nigger out of his hardearned savings hes in bad flavor around here and some of the citizens were just about to ask him to leave or run the risk of tar and feathers  well he has left and taken our houseboat with him said sam bitterly what about solly jackson the carpenter who was going to do some repairs for us  oh sollys a fairly good kind but years ago he used to work the lottery ticket game with pold hes an old bachelor and never has much to say about anything  has he any regular shop  oh no hes a comedaygoday sort of fellow boards around and like that  then he must be in with gasper pold said the youngest rover theyve cleared out together with our property  hum might be so lad have much on board the craft  yes a great many thingsfurniture a piano books and all of our clothing  hum quite a haulif they can get away with it maybe you had better notify the authorities  we certainly willif we cant find the houseboat said sam and then after a few words more with the ladies and the girls he started off to rejoin tom and dick and songbird powell went with him    chapter iii  a friend in need  it was ten oclock in the morning when the discovery was made that the houseboat was missing and by the middle of the afternoon the rover boys and their chums were certain that the craft had been stolen by gasper pold and solly jackson  a negro boy who went by the name of washevidently short for washingtongave them more information than anybody else this boy who had been fishing near the woods below shapette stated that he had seen the two men go aboard the houseboat early in the morning accompanied by a young man who was a stranger the three had cast off the ropes poled the houseboat far out into the stream and then drifted out of sight down the mighty mississippi  i thought dat it was werry funny da should be gwine away said the young darkey but i didnt dare to go show myself fo i know dat gasper pold is a bad aig when hes riled up yes sah  you didnt know the young man who went along asked dick  no sahneber see him afoah sah  how did he look  he looked putty much lak a tramp yes sah he was putty dirty too he was  some tramp they got to help them was toms comment the question is where will they go with the houseboat  i dont think theyll dare to go to any of the big towns said dick theyll be afraid well telegraph ahead to catch them more than likely theyll land at some outoftheway spot and cart our valuables off in a wagon then possibly theyll cast the houseboat adrift or set fire to her  if thats the case whats to do questioned fred garrison i hate to sit still and do nothing  yah let us go after dem fellers mit pitchforks alretty added hans vehemently such robbers ought to peen electrocutioned mit a rope aint dot so  you mean hung hans said sam they certainly ought to be punished    well swing them high i do declare   and let them dance on naught but air   and when theyve danced and hour so slick   well cut them down and bury them quick  came softly from songbird who could not resist the temptation to burst into verse  great shoestrings songbird to think youd make up poetry on such a subject cried fred  couldnt help iti havent composed anything today was the calm answer  maype songpird been komposing boultry ven he been in his coffin remarked hans  all of which doesnt answer the question what are we going to do said sam  i wonder if i can charter a small tug or steamboat to go down the river after the houseboat came from dick  there isnt much to be had in the town answered fred garrison still we can try  the rovers with their friends returned to shapette here they ran into the chief of police who also acted as a sort of detective  boat stolen is it possible burst out that official never heard of such a thing befo sah never i am sorry sah exceedingly sorry sah have you any idea who is guilty sah  i have answered dick and told what he knew  a bad man sah that gasper poldought to have been arrested long ago sah yes sah but nobody would make a complaintall afraid of a shootingvery quick man to draw a pistol yes sah  thats interesting said tom hell be a fine man to confront if we catch up to him  the chief of police said he would do anything he could but in the end refused to leave shapette and so did nothing the rovers soon learned that all he was good for was to talk and they left him in disgust  we must take this trail up ourselves said sam and the quicker the better  they walked down to the river front and after a number of inquiries found out that to charter a tug or small steamboat was just then out of the question for no craft of that sort was near but they learned that a young man of the vicinity named harold bird who was the owner of several valuable plantations in that district owned a new gasoline launch of good size which was housed at a place a mile away  i am going to see harold bird said dick perhaps hell lend us his launch  they found out where the young man lived and visited the plantation in a carriage it was a beautiful place with an old family mansion surrounded by grounds laid out with exquisite taste  evidently these folks have money observed tom  oh some of these planters are immensely wealthy answered sam  as they drove into the grounds they saw a young man playing with a bird dog on the lawn he smiled at them pleasantly  is this mr harold bird asked dick  yes was the reply what can i do for you  let me introduce myself mr bird i am dick rover and these are my brothers sam and tom these are my friends fred garrison and john powell  is it possible exclaimed harold bird why i was reading about you only yesterday in the newspaper you are the young fellows who helped to round up that gang of counterfeiters at red rock ranch it was certainly a stirring piece of work you deserve a great deal of credit and then the young southerner shook hands all around  mr bird we are in trouble went on dick and we thought that perhaps you would be able to help us out  i will certainly do anything that i possibly can for you come sit down and tell me what is wrong  the young southerner led the way to the broad veranda and all took seats then dick and the others told about the missing houseboat and of how they had wanted to charter a tug or a steamboat to go in pursuit  i could not find a vessel of any kind said dick but some folks told me that you had a big gasoline launch and i thought perhaps you would let us have that of course well pay you for  never mind about pay mr rover i shall be glad to be of service to you i will let you have my launch on one condition  and that is  that you will take me with you i love excitement and this pursuit of those rascals is just to my taste we can take one of my best dogs along so if we find they have landed anywhere we can readily trace them  but the danger said sam  why should i be afraid if you are not of course you will go well armed  indeed we will said tom more than likely theyll be well armed too  after that a long talk ensued and harold bird had the servants treat the boys to light refreshments he was a capital fellow with a winning though rather sad smile and all liked him from the start  ive seen a bit of adventure myselfvisiting mexico and europe and climbing high mountains he said but i havent had such stirring times as you it is very quiet here and i shall enjoy the change  are you alone here may i ask said fred curiously  yes excepting for my overseer and the servants the estate was left to me by my mother who died three years ago  it must be rather lonely murmured songbird  it is exceedingly lonely at times and that is why i travel a great dealthat and for another reason and the face of the young man clouded for the time evidently he had something on his mind but what it was he did not just then mention  he told them how he had come to buy the gasoline launch and said it was big enough to take on board a party of twelve or fifteen with comfort it was decided to take some provisions along for there was no telling how long the chase would last  it was evening before all arrangements were completed and the whole party went to town there they met the ladies and the girls and harold bird was introduced  i should consider it an honor to have you remain at my plantation while we are off on this search for the houseboat said the young southerner you can stay there as long as you please and make yourselves thoroughly at home  as there was no good hotel in the town this invitation relieved mrs stanhope and mrs laning a great deal and they said they would accept the offer and thanked the young man very much carriages were obtained and inside of two hours the ladies and the girls were at lee hall as harold bird called his place there were rooms in plenty for all and each was made to feel perfectly at home it was decided that aleck pop should also remain at the plantation for the time being  the hospitality in the south is certainly marvelous said dora to dick when i left home i never thought i should be treated so well  you are right dora the whole world over you will find no greater gentleman than one from our south  and what a beautiful plantation cried nellie what grand walks and trees and flowers  and what a fine lot of colored servants came from grace really they wont let me do a thing for myself  i should think mr bird would be very happy said mrs laning for at that moment the owner of the estate was not present  youd think so answered dick but do you know notwithstanding his smiling face he appears at times to be very sad  i thought so said mrs stanhope he acts as if he had something on his mind  yes and something that worried him a great deal added tom  they were right harold bird had a great deal to worry him and what it was we shall learn as our tale proceeds    chapter iv  harold birds strange tale  early in the morning the rovers and their friends were ready to take their departure dick came down in the garden at sunrise and was soon joined by dora and they took a short walk together  oh dick you must keep out of danger said dora promise me you will be careful  i will be careful dora he answered as he looked down into the depths of her clear eyes i will be carefulfor your sake he added in almost a whisper  if something shshould happen to you she faltered  ill take care of myself dont fear dora he made reply and then as they were all alone he drew her up to him dora may i he asked softly and tenderly  she did not answer but looked up at him innocently and confidingly he bent over and kissed her and gave her hand a little squeeze  we understand each other dont we dora he whispered  of course we do she whispered in return  and some day youll be mrs dick rover  oh dick  but you will be wont you  iisupposeoh and then dora broke from dicks hold as fred garrison and hans mueller appeared around a bend of the pathway  breakfast is waiting sang out fred hurry up if we are to start that search  all right answered dickwell be in right away  see i vos bick me a peautiful roses put in hans mueller coming closer dick of you tont peenvot you call himjealousness yah i gif him to dora and he passed over the flower  oh thank you hans replied dora and she placed the flower in her hair then she gave dick a look that meant a good deal and they understood each other perfectly and both went in to breakfast feeling very happy  in the meantime sam and tom had been out on a side veranda with grace and nellie tom was as full of fun as ever and kept the two girls in a roar of laughter yet both girls grew serious when the time for parting came  you look out for yourself said grace remember those men are bad characters to meet  yes i shouldnt want you to get hurt for the world added nellie and when she shook hands with tom there was something like a tear in her eye  then came goodbyes all around and the carriage that was to take dick and the others to the town drove around to the door the party climbed in and in a moment more were off the girls and ladies waving their handkerchiefs and the boys swinging their caps and hats  yo boys dun take good care ob yoselves said aleck who stood by with a look of concern on his ebony face if yo come back killed dis coon will neber fogive himself  come back as soon as you can called out dora  dont worrywe may be back in a day or two answered dick but it was destined to be many a long day ere the two parties should meet again  down at the riverside they found the launch in charge of a negro and all ready for the start the provisions were stored in two lockers on board and another locker held their firearms and some raincoats  hurrah here is news cried dick after perusing a telegram that had been handed to him youll remember i telegraphed to benton the town below here well here is word that the houseboat was seen passing benton yesterday at about five oclock and headed towards the west shore that ought to give us something to work on  it will answered harold bird come the sooner we get started the better  all stepped aboard of the venus as the launch was named and soon the gasoline motor was buzzing away at a good rate of speed then the power was turned on the screw harold bird took his station at the wheel and away they sped from the landing and out onto the broad mississippi  hurrah for a life on der oceans vafe und a ship on der rollings deeps sang out hans who sat near the bow  gosh hans is getting poetic said tom thats right hansy my boy keep it up and youll soon put songbird out of business  what i want to know is came from fred if we strike a sunken snag is this launch safe  as safe as any craft of her size answered harold bird but i shant strike a snag if i can help it i am not running at full speed and if youll notice i am keeping where the water is fairly clear  which isnt saying a great deal came from sam i never saw a river as muddy as the mississippi  i know one other stream that is worse and thats the missouri said harold bird and as that flows into the mississippi it makes the latter almost as bad  as soon as they were well on their way dick brought out the firearms which had been brought along and examined them with care  you certainly have some fine weapons said he referring to the pistols brought by harold bird do you do much shootingi mean with a gun  i never go shooting at all was the young southerners reply and once again the boys saw that strange look of sadness come over his face  funny you wouldnt care to go out said songbird carelessly must be quite some game around here  there is plenty of game but harold bird heaved a deep sigh i presume i may as well tell you my story for you are bound to hear it sooner or later he went on about four years ago my father went out hunting in the forest to the north of our plantation he was out with two friends but about the middle of the day the party separated and my father found himself alone then he saw something that to him looked like a wildcat on a big rock he fired quickly and when he drew closer he saw to his horror that he had shot and killed a manan old hunter named blazen  the shock of the discovery made my father faint and when the others came up they found him working over the dead body of blazen in a vain endeavor to bring the hunter back to life a doctor was called but nothing could be done for blazen for the shot had killed him instantly taking him squarely in the heart of course it was an accident but my father couldnt get over it he raved and wept by turns and at last the doctors had to place him in confinement for fear that he would try to do himself some injury my mother was prostrated by the news and you can imagine how i felt myself  it was certainly terrible said dick and the others nodded in silence  blazen was an old bachelor with no relatives so there were few to mourn over his death we saw to it that he was given a decent burial and advertised for his heirs but nobody appeared in the meantime my father grew melancholy and the doctors thought he might become insane they advised a trip to new scenes and my mother and i took him to europe and then to kingston jamaica where an old friend of the family had a plantation one day my father disappeared  disappeared echoed sam and tom  yes disappeared utterly and forever we hunted high and low for him and offered a big reward for any information it was useless we have never seen him or heard a word of him since  and what do you think became of him questioned songbird powell  i cannot imagine excepting that he may have thrown himself into the bay and drowned himself he had a habit of going down to the water and gazing out to sea by the hour  too bad murmured dick mr bird i sympathize deeply with you  and so do i came from the other boys  the disappearance of my father made my mother ill and it was all i could do to get her back home there we procured the best of medical skill but it did little good she had always had heart trouble and this grew rapidly worse until she died leaving me utterly alone in the world  harold bird stopped speaking and wiped the tears from his eyes all of his listeners were deeply affected it was several seconds before anybody spoke  i dont wonder you dont care to go hunting said sam id feel the same way  i have never visited the forest since the time the tragedy took place answered harold bird at first i thought to sell off the stretch of land to a lumber company but now i have changed my mind and i intend to give it to the heirs of blazen if any appear  is it a valuable tract asked fred  the lumber company offered me twenty thousand dollars for it  if your father was drowned it is queer that you never heard anything of his body said fred  bodies of drowned people are not always recovered answered the young southerner but he must have been drowned for if he had been alive we surely would have heard something of him the reward we offered set hundreds of people to hunting for him  it is certainly a mystery said dick i suppose youd give a good deal to have it cleared up  id give half of what i am worth answered harold bird earnestly    chapter v  stuck in the mud  noon found our friends at the town of bentona place of some importance in the cotton trade without delay dick sought out the man who had had to do with the telegrams  i cant tell you much more than what i put in the message said the man i saw the houseboat out yonder and headed in that direction i was watching her when a fog came up and hid her from view  i think i can follow her put in harold bird anyway we can try  did those fellows steal the houseboat questioned the benton man  they did  then i hope you catch them  our friends did not stop to get dinner but took their lunch on board of the venus the river at benton was broad and deep and consequently harold bird turned on full speed sending the launch forward with such a rush that the water often came in a shower of spray over the bow  i may be mistaken but i have an idea that those rascals headed for lake sico said the young southerner gasper pold used to hang around that lake and most likely there are men there who would aid him in disposing of whatever is on the dora of value  where is lake sico asked sam  about fifteen miles from here it is a very broad and shallow sheet of water and is reached by a narrow and tortuous bayou all of four miles long one end of the lake is a perfect wilderness of bushes and brakean ideal hidingplace for the houseboat  then perhaps we had better explore the lake said tom  there is only one objection answered dick if the houseboat is not there well be losing a lot of valuable time  is the entrance to the bayou very narrow asked tom for if it is the houseboat would be apt to strike the mud shore and leave marks  yes it is narrow and well look for marks by all means answered the young southerner  as they were moving with the stream it did not take the launch long to reach the bayou that connected the lake with the mississippi but close to the bayou entrance the swirling waters had cast up a ridge or bar of mud and on this the launch slid and stuck fast  hullo were stuck cried tom  and we are up out of the water too came from his younger brother  cant we back asked fred  ill try it returned harold bird  the screw of the launch was reversible and he made the change in power the water was churned up into a muddy foam but that was all the venus did not budge an inch  one of the joys of a life on der rollings deeps grumbled tom imitating hans songbird cant you compose an ode in honor of the occasion  certainly i can said songbird promptly and started  as firm as a rock our launch now rests upon her bed of mud as safe as a ship on a golden sea  or a clothespin in a tub finished tom songbird give us something better or none at all  say vot has a clothesbin in a dub to do mit being stuck here alretty questioned hans innocently  why hansy old boy thats easy cried tom a clothespin is for sticking something fast and we are stuck fast now cant you see the joke as the blind astronomer said to the deaf musician  yah dots so but ve aint stuck on no clothespins answered hans soberly ve vos stuck on der mississippies rifer aint it  score one for hans came with a laugh from sam hans what do you think we ought to do  dake a rope py der shore und bull der poat loose  thats the talk said songbird hans can carry the rope ashore the water is only a foot deep  and the mud is about sixteen feet deep put in dick quickly dont try it unless you want to sink out of sight  for several minutes all sat still in the launch viewing the situation with considerable dismay  this is something i didnt bargain for said fred but we may as well make the best of it  let us try to shove her off suggested dick  on board the launch were three poles of good size each fixed so that a small square board could be fastened to one end dick took one of these poles and tom and sam seized the others  now hans fred and songbird get in the stern said dick  thats the talk and ill try to back her at the same time cried harold bird all ready  in a minute they were ready to try the experiment and the power was turned on as the screw churned the water and mud once more the three rovers pushed on the poles with all their might  hurrah shes moving cried fred  he was right the venus was slowly but surely leaving the bank of mud suddenly she gave a twist and then ran backwards rapidly and then the power was shut off again  free at last cried tom now whats the next move  we must find the proper channel into the bayou answered the owner of the launch  dick and tom went to the front with their poles and the power was turned to a slow speed forward the rovers felt their way in the water with the poles calling to turn to the right or the left as the case required by this means they soon left the treacherous mud bars behind and reached a point where forward progress was more certain  now then let us look around and see if we can find any traces of the dora said dick  the houseboat couldnt have come over that spotshe would have been stuck sure said fred  years ago solly jackson used to be a riverman said harold bird he would probably know exactly how to get the houseboat into the bayou gasper pold couldnt run the craft himself so he had to take in a fellow like solly  as the gasoline launch entered the bayou all kept their eyes on the alert and presently songbird set up a shout  look over yonderthere are some sort of marks on the bank  he was right and they turned the launch in the direction indicated advancing slowly there was a sharp cut in the mud and also several pole holes which looked to be rather fresh a few feet further on they came to a piece of a pole painted blue  that settles it exclaimed dick they certainly brought the houseboat in here our poles were painted blue and that is a piece of one  the very one i cracked in the storm added sam  i can explain it said harold bird they got the houseboat around the mud bars but the force of the current combined with the current in the bayou swung the craft up against this bank then they had to pole the houseboat off  but how did they go on against the current from the lake asked songbird  pulled and poled the houseboat just wait and see if i am not right  they waited and soon reached a point where one bank of the bayou was fairly firm here they could see footprints and the shaving of a rope as it had passed over the edge of the bank  we are on the right track said dick now all we have to do is to locate the houseboat and corner the rascals who stole her  all cried fred i should say that was enough  especially if they offer to fight added sam  it is a pity we cant come on them unawares said tom but that is impossible for you cant run the launch without making a noise  maybe you dont besser git out dem bistols alretty came from hans of da tont gif ub ve plow der heads off aint it  yes we may as well get out the firearms said dick the sight of the pistols may have a good effect perhaps the rascals will give up without fighting  the pistols were gotten out and all of the youths saw to it that they were in perfect condition for immediate use as he looked at the weapons harold bird shuddered  i suppose you hate the sight of themafter what happened to your father said dick in a low tone  i do i sincerely trust there is no bloodshed answered the young southerner  it was nightfall by the time the launch was clear of the bayou in front of them lay the calm waters of lake sicoa shallow expanse with mud flats at one side and a wilderness of trees bushes and wild canebrake at the other they shut off the power and listened not a sound broke the stillness  talk about solitude was toms comment here is where you can chop it out with an ax  its enough to make one shiver added fred  just then the dog harold bird had brought along set up a mournful howl  even the dog doesnt like it said songbird let us go onid rather hear the puffpuff of the gasoline motor than listen to such stillness  i thought a poet craved solitude said dick this ought to fill you with inspiration  i think it will fill us with chills and fever said fred ugh how damp it is now the sun is going down  there is a mist creeping up said harold bird too bad i was in hope it would remain clear  soon the darkness of night settled over the lake the mist continued to roll over them until they were completely enveloped and could no longer see where they were going  it cant be helped said the owner of the launch well have to wait until daylight if i light the acetylene gas lamp it will simply put those rascals on guard  vot is ve going to dosthay on der poat all night asked hans  we can either do that or go ashorejust as you wish  let us move towards shore said dick it will be more pleasant under some overhanging trees or bushes  this was agreed to and they steered for the bank of the lake which was not far away none of them dreamed of what that night was to bring forth    chapter vi  fighting bob cats  it was certainly a dismal and dreary outlook and it did not help matters much to run the launch under the wide overhanging boughs of several trees growing at the edge of the lake they were in something of a cove so the view was shut off on three sides  i wish we had brought along some extra blankets said sam if it is raw now what will it be by midnight  hadnt we better build a little campfire questioned fred it will make it ever so much more pleasant  i do not advise a fire answered harold bird if those rascals should see it theyd come here to investigate and then try to slip away from us in the darkness  you are right put in dick we must keep dark until we have located themotherwise the game will be up  to protect themselves still more from the mist and cold they brought out four rubber blankets of good size these were laced into one big sheet and raised over the launch like an awning then all huddled beneath to make themselves as comfortable as possible  dont you think somebody ought to remain on guard asked tom we dont want those fellows to carry us off and us not know it  da cant vos carry me off dot vay said hans who could never see the funny side of a remark i vould kick i tole you  as there are seven of us why not have everybody stand guard for just an hour suggested sam if we turn in at ten that will carry us through to five in the morningwhen we ought to continue our hunt  providing the mist will let us smiled harold bird but i think your plan a good one he added  lots were drawn and fred went on guard first to be followed by hans and tom at ten oclock all of the crowd but fred turned in to get as much sleep as possible  i tole you vot remarked hans as he tried to make his head feel easy on one of the seats dis tont vos so goot like mine ped at putnam hall  not by a good deal answered songbird dear old putnam hall after all the pleasures we have had i shall be glad to get back to that institution again  the rover boys had been through so much excitement during their lives they did not think the present situation unusual and so all went to sleep without an effort harold bird remained awake nearly an hour thinking of the new friends he had made and of the strange fate of his father the young southerner was of a somewhat retiring disposition and it astonished even himself when he realized how he had opened his heart to the rovers and their chums  i feel as if i had known them for years instead of hours he told himself there is a certain attractiveness about sam tom and dick i cannot understand yet i do not wonder that they have a host of friends who are willing to do almost anything for them  when tom went on guard he was still sleepy and he did a large amount of yawning before he could get himself wideawake he sat up in the bow of the launch the others resting on the cushions on the sides and stern all was as silent as a tomb and the mist was now so thick that he could not see a distance of six yards in any direction  ugh what a disagreeable night he muttered as he gave a shiver id give as much as a toothpick and a bottle of hairoil if it was morning and the sun was shining  a quarter of an hour went byto tom it seemed ten times as long as thatand then of a sudden the lad heard a movement at the bottom of the launch the dog harold bird had brought along arose stretched himself and listened intently  what is it dandy asked tom patting the animal on the head what do you hear  for reply the dog continued to listen then the hair on his back began to rise and he set up a short sharp bark  he certainly hears something reasoned tom can any of those men be in this vicinity  the bow of the launch was close to a sprawling tree branch and to look beyond the rubber covering tom crawled forward and stepped on the branch the dog followed to the extreme bow of the boat and gave another short sharp bark  he hears something that is certain mused the boy but what it can be is a puzzle to me  tom tried to pierce the darkness and mist but it was impossible he strained his ears but all he could hear was the occasional dropping of water from one leaf to another over his head  maybe i had better arouse the others he murmured for the barking of the dog had apparently not disturbed them i am sure the dog wouldnt bark unless there was a reason for it would you dandy  tom looked at the animal and saw the dog had his nose pointed up in the tree next to that which the launch was under he peered in the direction and gave a start  was he mistaken or had he caught the glare of a pair of shining eyes fastened upon him tom was naturally a brave boy yet a strange shiver took possession of him the dog now bristled furiously and gave two sharp barks in quick succession  hullo whats up came from dick who was awakened  i believe there is some wild animal up yonder tree spotting us answered tom i think i just caught a glimpse of its eyes  this announcement caused dick to rouse up and taking his pistol he crawled to the bow of the launch and joined his brother on the tree limb just then the dog started to bark furiously  there he is cried tom and raised the pistol he had in his pocket there could be no mistake about those glaring eyes and taking hasty aim he fired  the report of the firearm had not yet died away when there came the wild and unmistakable screech of a wounded bob cata wildcat well known in certain portions of our southern states at the same time the dog began to bark furiously and everybody on board the launch was aroused  whats the matter  who fired that shot  vos dose rascals here to fight mit us alretty  its a bob cat cried dick tom just fired at it  look out its coming down yelled tom and that instant the bob cat unable to support itself longer on the tree limb fell with a snarl on the rubber covering of the launch carrying it down upon those underneath  the next few minutes things happened so rapidly that it is almost impossible to describe them the bob cat rolled over and over clawing at the rubber cloth and ripping it to shreds the boys tried to get another shot but did not dare to fire for fear of hitting each other but the dog leaped in and caught the bob cat by the back of the neck and an instant later cat and canine went whirling over the side of the boat into the waters of the lake  they are overboard cried sam  make a light somebody yelled songbird it isnt safe in the dark  the acetylene gas lamp of the launch was ready for use and striking a match harold bird lit it the sharp rays were turned on the water and there dog and bob cat could be seen whirling around in a mad struggle for supremacy  bang went dicks pistol he had taken quick but accurate aim and the bob cat was hit in the side it went under with a yelp letting go of the dog as it did so dandy gave a final nip and then turned and swam back to the launch and was helped aboard by his master  wonder if the bob cat is dead asked fred in a voice that he tried in vain to steady  hasnt come up again came laconically from songbird he had taken the lamp from harold bird and was sending the rays over the surface of the lake in several directions  they watched for several minutes and then made out the dead form of the bob cat floating among the bushes on the opposite side of the little cove  done forand i am glad of it murmured tom and he wiped the cold perspiration from his forehead  i dont know if we are out of the woods or not said the owner of the launch where there is one bob cat there are often more  in that case i think we had better move the boat away from the shore answered dick it may not be as comfortable as under the trees but it will be safer  at that moment the gas lamp began to flicker and die down  here give the lamp to me said the launch owner and taking the lamp he shook it and tried to turn more water on the carbide but the water would not run for some reason and a few seconds later the light went out  in the darkness the boys started to untie the launch as they did this they heard a movement in the tree directly over their heads and then came the cry of a bob cat calling its mate  theres another yelled sam say we had better get out as fast as we can  the gasoline launch was just shoved away from the tree limb when the bob cat above made a leap and landed on the bow of the craft it glared a moment at the boys its two eyes shining like balls of fire and then started to make a leap  bang crack bang went three pistols in rapid succession and as the reports died away the bob cat fell in a heap on the bottom of the launch snarling viciously then dandy still exhausted from his fight in the water leaped on the beast and held it down while tom finished it with a bullet in the ear  is it dead asked songbird after a painful silence  i guess so light a match somebody  several matches were lit and then an old oil lantern which chanced to be on board the bob cat was indeed dead and near it lay the dog with a deep scratch in its foreshoulder  noble dandy you did what you could said harold bird affectionately  very gingerly tom and dick picked up the carcass of the bob cat and threw it overboard by this time the launch had drifted a good fifty feet from shore and there they anchored  keep that lantern lit said fred i cant stand the darkness after such doings  if those thieves are around they must have heard the shots said sam so a light wont make much difference  i am going to examine the gas lamp said the young southerner and did so a bit of dirt had gotten into the feed pipe of the lamp and when this was cleaned out with a thin wire the light worked as well as ever  it was some time after the excitement before any of the crowd could get to sleep again then hans got a nightmare and yelled bop cats fire murder and other things as loudly as he could and that put further rest out of the question and all waited anxiously for the coming of morning    chapter vii  the houseboat in the bushes  with the coming of morning the mist cleared away as if by magic and soon the warm sunshine put all on board of the gasoline launch in better spirits  how is the dog questioned dick of the owner of the canine  he has been pretty well mauled up but i think hell come around with proper attention answered the young southerner he is a valuable animalvaluable to me because he was a pet of my fatherand id hate to lose him  all were hungry and ate their morning lunch with considerable satisfaction washing it down with some coffee made on a small oil stove that had been brought along  well i dont see anything of the houseboat announced dick as he stood on a seat and took a long and careful look around not a craft or a building of any kind in sight  some negroes used to live on the north shore of the lake said harold bird but the floods last year made them vacate in a hurry  it was decided to move around the shore of the lake slowly scanning every cove and inlet with care that the houseboat was hidden somewhere on that expanse of water none of the party had any doubt  you could take quite a trip in this launch said sam to harold bird as they moved along the more i see of the craft the better i like her may i ask what she is worth  i gave two thousand dollars for her i bought her in new orleans and brought her up the river myself the folks around here dont know much about gasoline launches but i think shes as nice a craft as anybody would wish  how much water does she draw  only two and a half feet when loaded downso you see we can get over some pretty shallow spots if it is necessary  they were moving along a scantilywooded stretch of shore when tom let out a short cry  stop  whats up tom asked several  i saw somebody just nowback of yonder bushes he stepped out and then stepped back again  was it one of the men we are after asked sam  i dont knowhe got out of sight before i had a good look at him  well have to investigate said dick and to this the others agreed with all possible haste the launch was run to the shore and sam tom and dick got out followed by harold bird the dog came also limping along painfully  find him dandy find him said the young southerner in a low tone and the dog seemed to understand he put his nose to the ground ran around for several minutes and then started off through the bushes  do you think he has struck the trail asked tom  i am sure of it was harold birds positive reply  the young southerner called to the dog and dandy went forward more slowly so that they could keep him in sight they passed through one patch of bushes and then came to a clear space beyond which was a field of wild sugarcane  hardly had the dog struck the cleared spot when from a distance came the report of a pistol dandy leaped up in the air came down in a heap and lay still  somebody has shot the dog cried sam what a shame  harold bird said nothing but ran to where the canine lay dandy was breathing his last and in a minute it was all over  poor fellow murmured the young southerner and there were tears in his eyes first the bob cats and now a pistol bullet oh if i can only catch the rascal who fired that shot ill make him suffer for this  the fellow killed the dog so the animal could not trail him said dick it was certainly a dirty trick  it shows that the man is a criminal put in tom he would not be afraid of us if he was honest  and therefore it must have been gasper pold or solly jackson said sam  what will you do with the dog asked dick after an awkward pause  take him back to the boat and bury him answered the young southerner i dont want the wild beasts to feed on him  hadnt we better follow up that man first  we can do so if you wish  they passed on and looked around that vicinity with care it must be confessed that they were afraid of being shot at but nothing of the sort occurred at one point they saw some footsteps but these came to an end in a creek flowing into the lake  as the ground in that vicinity was very treacherous there was nothing to do but to return to the launch and this they did harold bird and dick carrying the dead dog between them all were sorry that the canine was dead for they realized that the animal had done its best for them against the bob cats  they had no spade but with some flat sticks managed to scoop out a hole of respectable depth and in this they buried the canine over the spot the young southerner placed a peculiar stick to mark the spot  he was a fine dog and was once the pet of my father he said some day i may place a monument over his grave  they left the vicinity and continued on their trip around the lake scanning every indentation of the shore for a possible glimpse of the dora there were many winding places so it was noon before the task was half completed  this is growing to be a longer hunt than i anticipated remarked fred i thought finding the houseboat would be dead easy  lunch was had and once again they went on the search this time at a point where a bayou joined lake sico to a smaller lake here they had to move with care for the bayou was filled with the hidden roots of trees long since thrown down by storms  of ve tont look out ve peen caught in dem dree roots observed hans looking down into the water say tont da look like vater snakes  they certainly do and they are almost as dangerousfor the launch  soon came a grinding tinder the boat and the screw came to a standstill a tree root had caught fast and further progress was out of the question until the screw could be cleared  ill go over and do the job cried tom i know how and the others being willing he divested himself of most of his clothing leaped overboard and was soon at work it was no light task as he had to cut the root in several places with a jackknife  we had better land and look around said harold bird id hate to get the screw caught again and break it for then wed certainly be in a pickle  could the houseboat get through here questioned fred  yes they could pole her through with hard work answered dick  they turned the gasoline launch to shore and tied fast then all began to leap out  this wont do cried dick somebody ought to remain on the launch  i would like to go with you and look for the houseboat answered harold bird i think the launch will be safe where she is  if you want me to stay ill do it if songbird will stay with me said fred  ill stay said songbird promptly  so it was arranged and leaving the two in charge of the gasoline launch all the others of the party set off on their search for the missing houseboat  walking along the shore of the small lake was decidedly treacherous and more than once one or another would slip down in the mud and slime  hellup cried hans who had dragged behind and looking back they saw the german lad in a bog hole up to his knees hellup oder i vos trowned alretty  cant you crawl out questioned dick running back  no der mud vos like glue gasped hans  tom came back also and between them they managed to pull hans from the sticky ooze which was plastered over his trousers and shoes the german lad gazed at himself ruefully  now aint dot a nice mess he observed vosnt i a beach  yes but a pretty muddy one laughed dick but never mind now come on you can clean up when we get back  the party soon reached a spot where the bushes grew in water several inches deep here to avoid sinking in the mud they had to make a wide detour  listen cried sam presently and held up his hand  what did you hear asked harold bird  i heard something as if somebody was walking through the brush yonder  maybe it was the men we are after cried dick come on  they continued to move forward until some fallen trees all but barred their further progress then they came to a small rise of grounda veritable island in this swampand reaching the highest point gazed around them  what is that asked sam pointing with his hand to a round black object showing above some bushes at a distance  why that looks like the smokestack of the houseboat cried tom he meant the stack to the chimney for several rooms of the houseboat were furnished with stoves to be used when the weather was chilly  well soon make certain said dick forward everybody  be careful cautioned harold bird remember you have desperate characters with whom to deal  isnt everybody armed asked sam i brought my pistol  all were armed and each took out his weapon and carried it in his hand they wanted no shooting but after the killing of the dog decided to take no chances  it was no light task to reach the spot where the smokestack had been seen they had another creek to cross and then had to crawl through some extrathick bushes but beyond was a stretch of clear water and there they saw safely tied to two trees the object of their search the missing houseboat    chapter viii  in the swamp  there she is  she seems to be all right  shall we go on board  such were the cries from the rovers and their friends as they came in sight of the dora the view of the houseboat filled them all with pleasure  wait said harold bird dont show yourselves  dick at least understood and held the others back  keep out of sightwe want to investigate first he said in a low tone there is no use in our running our heads into the lions mouth  mine cracious vos der a lion aroundt here demanded hans turning pale  maybe youll find a lion if you dont keep quiet answered sam with a snicker  after that but little was said gradually they drew so close that they could see from one end of the dora to the other not a person was in sight  really does look as if the craft was deserted was harold birds comment perhaps they got scared when they saw what a crowd was following them  i move two of us go on board and the rest stay here said tom then if there is trouble the crowd to stay behind can come to the rescue  thats a good scheme answered his elder brother supposing sam and i go you can lead the rescuing party if it becomes necessary  this was also agreed to and a minute later dick and sam with their pistols in hand crawled from the bushes and made for the side of the houseboat a gangplank was out and they saw the footprints of several men and also two horses  i dont like those much said dick pointing to the hoofprints a horse here means that he was used for carrying some stuff away  as nobody came to stop them they walked on board of the dora and looked into the gallery that being the nearest apartment the cook stove was still there just as aleck pop had left it but the pots and kettles were scattered in all directions and some of the best of the utensils were missing  this looks as if the houseboat had been looted cried dick and ran from the galley to the dining room and then to the living room while sam made his way to several of the staterooms  nobody but themselves was on board the houseboat and they soon announced that fact to the others in the bushes and they came forward on a run  did they steal anything demanded tom  steal anything repeated sam they have taken about everything they could lay their hands on  everything is gone but the stove piano and bedding said dick and just to show their meanness they hacked the top of the piano with a hatchet  what dick said was almost wholly true the rascals had stolen everything of value that they could possibly carry leaving behind little outside of the things already mentioned not only was the piano mutilated but also the chairs the diningroom table and the berths in the stateroom all of the lanterns but one were missing and the small rowboat resting on the rear deck of the houseboat had its side stove in from an axblow  the fiends muttered dick as he gazed at the wreckage what they couldnt carry they tried to ruin  what could you expect from fellows who would shoot my pet dog returned harold bird  i tell you dick rover those men ought to be landed in jail  well well land them there cried dick earnestly  do you mean that  i certainly do  i will aid you all i can answered the young southerner heartily  after that all made a thorough examination of the houseboat to learn if they could find out anything concerning the thieves muddy footprints were visible in every apartment but they told little  i think we are simply wasting time here said tom presently the best we can do is to follow up those footprints outside and see where they lead to  dots so said hans dis muss is so bad like it vill pe lund vill get no petter py looking at him aint dot so  all right come on said sam and led the way off the houseboat i dont believe those chaps intend to come back they took all they wanted  to follow the footprints was no easy task and before long they found themselves going through a swamp where the walking was extremely treacherous  i dont like this said sam they may have known the way but we dont and if we dont look out well get in so deep well be helpless  yah let us go back said hans who had not forgotten his experience in the bog hole a feller cant schwim in vater mit mud up to his neck alretty  again they had to turn back as they did this dick fancied he heard a faraway cry for help  did you hear that he asked of tom what  i heard somebody call i think  so did i put in harold bird listen  they listened but the cry or whatever it was was not repeated soon they were back to the side of the houseboat once more  do you think that call came from fred or songbird asked sam  it might be sam answered dick maybe we had better get back to the launch  yes yes let us go back by all means exclaimed harold bird if your friends are in trouble we ought to aid them  as rapidly as they could do so they started back for the spot where the gasoline launch had been left once they lost their way and got into a swamp from which it was next to impossible to get out  well have to go back cried sam after he had moved in several directions only to find himself worse off than before  be careful warned harold bird if you arent carefulstop  all of the boys halted for the command was out of the ordinary the young southerner was looking straight ahead of him  what is it questioned tom in a low tone thinking some of the enemy might be near  am i right and is that a snake ahead asked harold bird it looks like a snake and still it may be nothing but the dead limb of a tree  say i tont vonts me no snakes in mine ejaculated hans trying to retreat  all the boys gazed at the object ahead with interest then tom broke off a stick near him and threw it at the object the latter did not budge  must be a tree limb said tom but it looked enough like a snake to frighten anybody  i am not sure yet answered harold bird you must remember that some of our southern snakes are very sluggish and only move when they are hungry or harassed  well give the limb or whatever it is a wide berth said sam  they started to move to one side but tom was curious and chancing to see a stone among some bushes hurled it at the object hitting it directly in the center  up came an uglylooking head the object whipped around swiftly and the next instant the boys found themselves confronted by a swamp snake all of six feet long and as thick as a mans wrist  mine cracious burst from hans lips it vos a snake annahow look out he vill eat us up alife  we must get out of here cried sam oh tom why didnt you leave it alone  i didnt really think it was a snake answered the funloving rover somebody shoot it  queer as it was nobody had thought to use his pistol but as tom spoke dick pointed his weapon at the snake that was crawling rapidly over the tree roots towards them the puff of smoke was followed by a writhing of the reptile and they saw that it had been hit although not fatally wounded  wait ill give him another shot cried sam who now had his pistol out and as the head of the snake came up over a tree root the youngest rover fired pointblank his aim was true and the head of the snake went down and the body whirled this way and that in its death agonies  is hehe dead faltered tom  next door to it answered harold bird that last shot took him directly in the throat i do not think he will bother us any more  they saw the body of the snake sink down in the water beneath the upper roots of the tree and then continued to retreat making their way to what looked like safer ground they were now completely turned around with only the sun to guide them in their course  this is no joke said dick gazing around in perplexity if we are not careful well become hopelessly lost  i think somebody had better climb a tree and look around said tom ill go up if somebody will boost me  the others were willing and soon the funloving youth was climbing a tall tree which stood somewhat apart from the others he went up in rapid fashion and before long was close to the top  can you see anything called up sam after what seemed to be a long pause  hello cried tom why there is the small lake and yes the launch is moving from the shore  the launch ejaculated harold bird do you mean my gasoline launch  it must be yoursor some craft very much like it answered tom there it is out of sight now behind the trees  tom waited for fully a minute but the launch did not reappear  who was on board questioned dick as his brother came down  i couldnt make out  which is the way to the spot where we tied up asked the young southerner impatiently we must investigate this without delay  over that way answered tom pointing the direction out with his hand come i think i saw a good way to go  then all of the party struck out to reach the landingplace without delay they felt that something unusual had occurred but what they could not surmise    chapter ix  two young prisoners  left to themselves fred garrison and songbird powell hardly knew what to do to pass away the time with all of the others away the spot where the gasoline launch had been tied up appeared to be unusually lonely  i can tell you what i shouldnt care to be caught all alone at night in such a spot as this said fred with something of a shiver it is about as dismal as any place ive seen  right you are murmured songbird and then continued    the lonely waters washed the lonely shore   where they had washed full many a moon before   i listened pensivelynot a sound   was there to break the tomblike silence all around  great mackerel songbird cried fred dont go on like that its enough to give a fellow the creeps but the wouldbe poet only continued    i listened for a single bird   but not a note my ear there heard i looked up in the calm clear sky  and nervous enough was i to fly finished fred and went on songbird if youve got to make up poetry give us something cheerful cant you make up something abouterabout circus clowns or apple pie orer  circus clowns or apple pie snorted the wouldbe poet in deep disgust well you are the limit fred garrison no i cant make up poetry about circus pie or apple cloi mean apple clowns or circus pshaw you know what i mean  i didnt mention mixed pickles observed fred demurely but if you can mixwhats that  he stopped short and straightened up on the launch seat and so did songbird both had heard voices at a distance  they must be coming back said songbird it didnt take them long  they listened and set up a call but no answer came back then they looked around searchingly  thats funny murmured fred  i dont think its funny was the low answer something is wrong  help my foot is caught came presently in a muffled voice hello the launch help me somebody quick  who is that calling asked songbird  somebody of our crowd and in trouble answered fred and leaped ashore with songbird at his heels  the call had come from a thicket about a hundred feet away and in that direction dashed the two unsuspecting youths never dreaming of the plan laid to trap them as they ran into the thicket four persons came behind them and in a trice each was thrown violently forward on the ground and held there  whawhat does this mean gasped fred as soon as he could get his breath  it means that you are prisoners came in the voice of gasper pold keep quiet now it will be best for you  blindfold em and be quick about it came in a low tone from one of the others of the party  dan baxter exclaimed songbird recognizing that voice is it possible i thought you died in the swamp  hang the luck muttered the former bully of putnam hall i didnt want them to know i was here  by this time the two boys had had their hands tied behind them then they were allowed to rise  dont you make a noise if you value your lives came from another of the men and to their surprise they saw that it was sack todd one of the head counterfeiters of red rock ranch and the only man who had escaped from the authorities at the time the noted gang was rounded up how slick an individual this chap was those who have read the rover boys on the plains already know  the boys now saw that the fourth person who had attacked them and made them prisoners was the carpenter solly jackson the fellow took small part in the proceedings and was apparently under the thumb of gasper pold  what is the meaning of this outrage asked songbird  youll find out quick enough answered dan baxter with a chuckle so you thought i perished in the swamp eh ha ha i thought id fool you  did you get away with sack todd asked fred  not exactlybut we soon metafter that fight was overand here we are to fix you for interfering with our business went on the big bully  look here baxter we cant stop to talk now broke in gasper pold those other fellows will be back soon weve got to make the best possible use of our time  tie em to the trees said sack todd quick now and then well be off you say you can run the launch he asked turning to the former bully of putnam hall  sure i canused to do that sort of thing at home years ago replied dan baxter  without ceremony fred and songbird were tied fast to two trees near by the ropes being passed from their wrists directly around each tree then the men and baxter departed taking with them several heavy bundles which they had been carrying  that stuff they have must be from the houseboat said fred when he and songbird were left alone in the forest they are going to run off with it on the launch  i reckon you are right songbird gave a groan gosh they tied my wrists together so tightly the blood wont circulate  they are firstclass rascals and dan baxter is as bad as any of them was the answer isnt it strange that he should escape from that swamp and after losing his horse too  after that the two prisoners listened intently and soon heard the puttputt of the gasoline launch as the power was turned on gradually the sound grew fainter and fainter  they are off sighed fred perhaps now well never see the launch again  this will make harold bird angry fred first his pet dog and now his new launch hell want to land those rascals in jail just as much as we do  half an hour went bythe young prisoners thought it must be four times that longand still nobody came near them each tried to free himself from his bonds but without avail fred cut one wrist and songbird scraped off the skin and that was all  its no use sighed the wouldbe poet well have to stay here till the others get back  what fools we were to be deceived into thinking one of our party was in trouble i thought that cry for help didnt seem just right we walked right into the trap  i was afraidmy gracious me look  at this exclamation both boys looked into the forest they were facing and there they saw a sight that almost made the blood freeze in their veins crouching down between some bushes was a bob cat larger than either of those that had been killed the night before  oh cried songbird scat  at the cry the bob cat turned and disappeared into the bushes like a flash but then they heard it leap into a tree and the rustling of the branches told them only too plainly that it was approaching closer and closer  this isis awful groaned fred it will surely pounce down and tear us to pieces help help somebody help  songbird joined in the cry and the forest rang loudly with the sounds of their voices then they stopped to get their breath  i see himhe is almost over our heads gasped songbird help help he yelled at the top of his lungs  whats the trouble came from close at hand and dick rover burst into view with tom and sam at his heels and each with his revolver drawn not far behind were hans and harold bird  a bob cat look out for him cried fred  protect us put in songbird we are helpless  see they are tied to the trees exclaimed tom what does this mean  i see the bob cat said sam rover and without ado fired up into the tree down came the beast spitting viciously and clawing the air to fall at toms feet bang went toms pistol and then all of the others fired and almost as quick as i can tell it the beast lay dead where it had fallen then the boys looked around for other bob cats but none showed themselves  oh how thankful i am that you came said fred as he was being released  and you didnt arrive a minute too soon either said songbird that bob cat was getting ready to spring on us it was a narrow escape  who made you prisoners asked dick but i suppose it was that gasper pold and his tools  yes and who do you think his tools are answered fredsolly jackson sack todd  sack todd exclaimed sam  yes and dan baxter  baxter came from the others  the young rascal you told me about said harold bird  exactly and all of them have run away with your launch put in songbird they went quite a while ago  i was afraid of it answered the young southerner of course they must have steered for lake sico  yes and as they have had a good start they must be a long way off by now added tom    chapter x  the chase on the river  the whole party walked down to where the launch had been tied up and fred and songbird told their story and then heard of what had happened to the houseboat  what rascals murmured fred we must do our level best to catch them  i am going to catch them if i have to follow them a thousand miles exclaimed harold bird impulsively  thats the talk came from dick we are bound to catch them sooner or later if we stick to the chase  yet though he spoke so hopefully the outlook just then was dismal enough the gasoline launch had a good start and they had nothing at hand with which to follow the craft and those on board  id hate to see the launch wrecked said tom but id like to see those fellows blow themselves up  well in that case i could almost stand the loss of the boat answered the young southerner with a faint smile  they sat down and talked the matter over for quarter of an hour fred and songbird in the meantime bathing their wrists and having them bound up with handkerchiefs not only was the launch gone but their food also  i saw a few things left on the dora said dick canned stuff and like that which they forgot to take or ruin that will give us something to eat  we might find a trail out of the swamp to some plantation suggested harold bird but that would take time and i think we ought to be following the launch  how asked fred  ve cant schwim put in hans  go back for the houseboat and follow them in that it will be slow but it will likewise be sure  well do it answered dick  this time all set out for the houseboat they followed the first trail that had been taken and remembering the bad spots covered the distance without serious mishap by this time all were hungry and while hans and fred set to work to make a fire in the cook stove and prepare the best meal possible under the circumstances the others turned the houseboat down the inlet and out into the small lake it was hard work poling the big craft along but once in the little lake they were delighted to find that the current was fairly strong towards the big lake and the mississippi they used both poles and sweeps and worked like trojans  dinner is ready called fred at last and one after another took a seat and ate the canned corn tomatoes and salmon which had been made ready they also had a few crackers and a pot of rather weak coffee but they were sincerely thankful that matters were not worse  the worst of it is we are not the only sufferers said dick to harold bird the ladies and the girls who have been traveling with us have lost all their valuablesthat is such things as happened to be left on the dora just what is missing they will have to tell us  well as i said before i shall do all in my power to bring them to justice i should think youd be more than anxious to have this dan baxter locked up  yes  you say he has been your enemy for years  yes when my brothers and i started to go to a boarding school called putnam hall in new york state we ran across this baxter he was annoying miss stanhope and her two cousins grace and nellie we had a row then and there and ever since that time he has been our bitter enemy and has tried in a thousand ways to make trouble for us not only that but his father was a bitter enemy of my father and was locked up but strange to say arnold baxter has reformed while dan seems to go from bad to worse  then you dont think dan will reform  hardly if he does it will be the surprise of my life answered the eldest rover  the meal slim as it was put all on board the houseboat in better humor and as he washed the dishes hans hummed a little german ditty to himself soon the small lake was left behind and they found themselves skirting the upper shore of lake sico nothing was in sight on the broad bosom of this body of water  can the launch be in hiding in some cove asked sam we dont want any more tricks played on us  it is possible answered harold bird still i think our wisest course will be to get to the river as soon as possible if the launch has passed out we may find somebody who has seen her  all worked with vigor and by nightfall they gained the bayou leading to the mighty river beyond as they came out they saw a lumber barge tied up not far away  ahoy there shouted dick using his hands for a speaking trumpet  ahoy came the answering shout from a man on the barge  have you seen anything of a gasoline launch around here  yes  when  about an hour ago  coming from the bayou  yes  which way did she head  down the river  are you sure of that dillard called out harold bird  hullo mr bird that you  i say are you sure the launch went down the river  positive sirwe watched her out of sight was she your boat  she was  stolen  yes  you dont say so hope you get her back  who was on board  four men so far as we could see we werent very close to her  we are on the right trail cried tom now the question is how can we follow her down the river  on the houseboat of course answered his elder brother if we stop to do anything else well lose too much time  but that launch can run away from us  perhaps but you must remember that theyll have to be cautious because the craft is strange to them they wont dare to run full speed for fear of blowing up or of striking a snag  i vish da struck a hundred of dem snags alretty cried hans  then again they may tie up as soon as they think they can leave the river with safety i think we can follow in the houseboat as well as in anything  yes let us stick to the houseboat came from the young southerner but wait pole her over to the barge perhaps we can buy some food  yes let us get food by all means added sam  they were soon beside the lumber barge which had a comfortable cabin and sleeping quarters as harold bird knew the owner well there was little difficulty in obtaining provisions and at a reasonable price then off those on the dora pushed and soon the current of the broad mississippi carried them out of sight down the stream  we must keep a good lookout said dick as night came on we dont want to miss them in the dark  and we dont want to run into anything either added sam  dis aint kvite der life on der oceans vaves vot i like observed hans i dink me after all a sail ship oder a steamer been besser hey  yes a sailboat or a steamer would be better just now answered tom but we have got to put up with what we happen to have as the dog said who got lockjaw from swallowing a bunch of keys  did dot dog git dot lockjaw from dem keys asked hans innocently  sure he did hans you see they didnt fit the lock to his stomach so he couldnt digest them  poor dog vot vos his name  why his name waserpickerbut he couldnt pick the lock so he died  is he teat yet  is he deadsay hans what do you mean  oh it tont madder answered the german boy and walked away leaving tom wondering if the joke had been turned on him or not  on and on swept the houseboat over the broad bosom of the mississippi fortunately for our friends it proved a clear night with countless stars bespangling the heavensthey had managed to find two lanterns fit for use and each was lit and placed in position most of the boys remained on the forward deck watching anxiously dick was at the rudder steering as harold bird directed  it was not long before something dark loomed up along shore and they knew they had struck one of the numerous levees or artificial banks along the mississippi put there to prevent the country from being inundated during the freshets the levee was very high and looked strong enough to withstand almost any pressure that could be brought to bear against it  and yet they sometimes give way and cause a terrible amount of drainage said harold bird in reply to sams question i have seen the river spread out for miles and houses and barns carried off to nobody knew where over night  well i dont think the launch would tie up at the levee do you  it is not likely i have an idea those fellows will try to get down to new orleans  after that an hour passed without anything unusual happening twice they passed river steamboats one of them sweeping quite close to the houseboat  why dont you put out more lightswant to be run down came the cry  havent any more lights answered tom and then the two boats swept apart so no more could be said  a mile more was passed when fred set up a cry  i see a light ahead flashing from side to side he said and pointed it out  it is the acetylene gas lamp ejaculated harold bird and it must be aboard of the launch    chapter xi  what the rockets revealed  all of those on board of the houseboat watched the flashing light with keen interest that it came from the gasoline launch none of them doubted  if we can only catch up to them said tom and do it on the sly  we want to be on guardthey may be ready to do some shooting returned sam  does you dink da vill shoot inquired hans anxiously  i dont think they will kill more than three or four of us answered tom by way of a joke  vat screamed hans not me by chiminatics i tont vos vant to been shot dree oder seven dimes alretty  i doubt if theyll do any shooting answered harold bird  i cant believe that said dick with a shake of his head that sack todd is a bad one and baxter can be very wicked at times we certainly want to be on guard against any underhanded work  the launch had been running somewhat across the river but was now headed straight down the mississippi  we dont seem to be gaining said fred after a silence of several minutes it appears to be just as far ahead as when we first saw it  we are certainly not gaining much answered the young southerner but i think we are gaining a little  harold bird was right they were gaining probably one rod in twenty thus in a little over half an hour they saw that the launch was almost within hailing distance the acetylene gas light was thrown ahead and to the right and left and lit up the surface of the river for a considerable distance against the rays of the lamp they could make out four persons in the launch  they must be the four we are after said dick i wish they would turn into shore at some town then wed have an easier time of it rounding them up  i have an idea cried sam why not follow them until they do land somewhere and go to sleep well have a better chance to capture all of them than in a fight out here here if we get into a row somebody may fall overboard and be drowned  yes let us follow them until they stop somewhere came from songbird who had no desire to fight out there on the bosom of the swiftlyflowing mississippi  this decided on they did not attempt to catch up to the launch but getting near enough to keep the craft in plain view held back just a trifle  do you suppose they see us asked fred  they may see the houseboat but they dont know what craft it is or who is on board answered dick  presently the launch stopped running and merely drifted with the current those in the houseboat saw the gas lamp turned toward the shore  i think they are making preparations to land said harold bird  a moment later the acetylene lamp was turned back and the sharp rays fell full upon the dora and those on the forward deck  hi there is the houseboat cried dan baxter who was following the rays of light with his eyes  thats so returned gasper pold they must be following us  how did they do it so quickly questioned solly jackson  thats a puzzle but it certainly is the houseboat and there are three or four of the crowd on board said sack todd  those on the launch were amazed to think they had been followed so quickly and for the moment knew not what to do then sack todd drew his pistol  hi there he yelled keep your distance if you know when you are well off  they know us right enough murmured tom and they mean to fight  go aheadwe cant afford to land around here said gasper pold to baxter who had been running the motor of the launch and soon the power was turned on and the launch started down the river faster than ever  they are running away from us ejaculated dick oh what luck  stop yelled sam stop or well fire at you  thats the talk said harold bird  if you do any firing so will we came back from one of the persons on the venus  then of a sudden the acetylene gas lamp was either turned off or its rays were hidden for the launch was almost lost in the darkness of the night  they were trying to hide said fred and it looks as if they would succeed he added as the launch seemed to fade utterly from view  if we only had that gas lampto keep them in view sighed sam  are you certain there is nothing of the kind on board questioned songbird didnt you buy some rockets when we stopped at  sure i did shouted dick just the thingif they are still on board and they may befor i put them in a closet we dont often use  dick started on a hunt and soon put in an appearance with several rockets such as are generally used on a ship as a signal of distress  theyll be good in more ways than one said tom they will keep those rascals in sight and also let folks know that we need help  py golly ve vill haf a regular fourth of chuly hey came from hans  a rocket was placed in position at the bow end of the houseboat and the eldest rover touched it off it sizzed for an instant and then shot forward over the water in the direction of the gasoline launch making the scene light for the time being it came down just over the venus bow  hi stop that or well fire at you came from the launch and then a pistol rang out and the ball whistled over the deck of the dora  are they really shooting at us asked songbird nervously while hans sought the shelter of the cabin in a hurry  i reckon not answered harold bird that was simply meant as a warning  those on the houseboat waited for several minutes and then imagining the launch was turning to the shore dick prepared another rocket  get behind the woodwork he said they may take it into their heads to aim at us when this goes up  all sheltered themselves and with a rush the second rocket flew skyward it had not been aimed at the launch yet it cut the water within a yard of the venus side much to the alarm of those on board  they are trying to shoot us with rockets yelled dan baxter  take that said sack todd and fired pointblank at the houseboat the bullet hit a pane of glass in the cabin window and there was a jingle followed by a yell from hans  sthop dot tont kill me i aint vos tone noddings alretty of you schoot me again i vos haf you but in prison for a hundred years aint it  are you hit hans questioned dick running to the german boy  putty near dick dot pullet knocked owit der glass chust ven i vos going to look owit  they have hit on something came from harold bird who had remained outside behind a barrel  hit queried sam  yes they are stuck fast and we are drifting right on top of them  the news proved true the launch had gotten caught on a sunken tree trunk and was helpless on the bosom of the river the propeller whirling madly the houseboat was less than two hundred feet away and coming forward as swiftly as the current could carry her  look out dont smash uswe are stuck yelled dan baxter  sheer off came from solly jackson sheer off or well all be wrecked  it was a position of unexpected and extreme peril and those on the houseboat realized it as well as those on the launch yet what to do our friends did not exactly know  out with the sweepson this side called out dick and ran for the biggest sweep he could find jam over the rudder he called to songbird who was at the tiller  the rudder went over in a jiffy and out went three long sweeps this served to swing the houseboat over several points but not enough to take her entirely out of the course of the launch  we are going to hit as sure as fate cried sam  yes and we may all go to the bottom answered fred    chapter xii  stuck on a snag  it was certainly a moment of intense anxiety both for those on the launch and on the houseboat and for the time being the fight between the two factions came to an end a smashup out there in that swiftlyflowing current might make it necessary for everybody to swim for his life  cant you back the boat asked sack todd of dan baxter we must get out somehow  dan baxter worked over the motor for a few seconds and just as the houseboat swung closer started the launch backwards all expected a crash but it did not come  the dora is stuck called out dick we have hit something under water  the eldest rover was right and slowly the houseboat began to swing around in the meantime the launch backed away made a halfcircle and began to move again down the mississippi  they are loose called out sam  yes and we are fast answered harold bird but i am rather glad we didnt run into the launch and smash her completely  the moving of the launch had caused the sunken tree trunk to turn partly over and in this position two immense limbs caught the dora tightly so that although the houseboat swung broadside to the current she could get no further  they are getting away from us cried tom as the venus disappeared from view  dont you dare to follow us any further called out a voice from the darkness if you do it will be at your peril  it doesnt look as if we were going to follow them right away grumbled tom  vos dose rascallions gone alretty questioned hans coming cautiously from the cabin  yes  dots goot  the lanterns were lowered over the side of the houseboat and after several minutes of inspection our friends located the source of the trouble  if we had the power to back away from that tree wed be all right observed dick but as we havent such power i do not know what we are going to do  maybe well have to wait until morning said tom then some passing boat can pull us away  and in the meantime those rascals will have a good chance to outwit us said sam bitterly its a shame  let us try to get the sweeps between the tree limbs and the houseboat suggested harold bird perhaps we can thus pry ourselves loose  all were willing to try the plan and while the young southerner took one sweep dick took another with sam and tom to help them  it was no easy matter to get the sweeps into position for there was danger of one or another slipping overboard to protect themselves each of the workers wound a rope around his waist and made the end fast to a stanchion  now then all together cried dick when the sweeps were finally in proper position and they strained with all their might then came a crack as one sweep broke and harold bird and sam were hurled flat on their backs on the deck  never mind better luck next time said songbird as he brought another sweep forward  they adjusted the new sweep with care and pulled on it gradually at first the houseboat refused to budge but presently it swung around a little and then more and more  hurrah we are getting her yelled tom now then all together as the tomcat said to the boys with the brickbats  they strained and the houseboat came loose but alas at that moment both sweeps slipped and slowly but surely the dora swung into her former position and became jammed tighter than before  another failure sighed dick  im about out of breath said sam with a gasp  let me try it said fred and he hans and songbird set to work with the others helping but it was of no avail the houseboat could not be moved sufficiently to clear herself of the sunken tree trunk with its immense limbs  well there is one thing to be thankful for said dick as they rested from their labors that trunk might have gone through our sides or bottom and sunk us  during the next hour two steamboats passed them but not near enough to be asked for help they cleaned their lanterns and hung them high up so as to avoid a collision  its queer that no craft came out to learn why the rockets were sent up said dick  perhaps they thought some celebration was going on answered harold bird  its nearly two oclock and i am dead tired announced tom any objections to my going to sleep  not if you can get to sleep answered his older brother  half of us might as well turn in while the other half remain on guard said sam and so it was arranged two hours later the guard was changed so that all got some muchneeded rest although a sound sleep was out of the question  with the coming of morning the youths looked around eagerly for some craft to give them assistance yet it was a good hour before a steamboat came down the river and stopped at their call  whats wanted  we want to be towed down the river said dick well pay you for the job  are you stuck  yes but you can easily pull us back and out  where do you want to go  those on the houseboat had already talked the matter over and decided to move on at least as far as baraville about twenty miles from new orleans dick had once heard sack todd speak of the place and knew the man was acquainted there and had also heard solly jackson say he had once lived in that locality  ill tow you to baraville if you wish it said the captain of the small steamboat it will cost you ten dollars  all right but get there as fast as you can answered dick we are in a big hurry  a line was thrown out and made fast and in a few minutes the houseboat was freed from the sunken tree then steamboat and houseboat swung around and the journey to baraville was begun it did not take long and by halfpast ten oclock the dora was tied up at the town levee much to the astonishment of many colored folks who had never seen such a craft  the rovers first movement was to ask if the launch had stopped there and from a colored riverman they learned that the venus had come in very early in the morning and had left again after those on board had gotten breakfast and a box of thingswhat the negro did not know  i heah dem folks talk erbout new orleans said the colored man i dun spect da gone dat way fo certainly i do  did you see the launch leave asked sam  i suah didan a mighty poerful smell dat boat did leab behind it  that was the gasoline said fred laughing  i spect it was yes sah answered the colored man  if they went to new orleans then we ought to go tooand be quick about it said dick  dont you want to send some word to the ladies and the girls first asked harold bird  to be sure we can send a telegram for all and then send letters too  this was done and the ladies and girls were told not to be alarmedthat all were satisfied everything would come out right in the end  no use of worrying them said tom they can worry after all the trouble is over and at this quaint remark the others had to smile  how to get down the river was at first a problem but it was soon settled by dick and harold bird it was decided to leave the houseboat in the care of a trustworthy person at baraville and then charter the small steamboat for the trip to new orleans as the captain wanted to go down the river anyway he made the charge for the charter very small and before noon the craft was on her journey  fortunately for our friends the weather remained fine and had they not been worried over the outcome of what was before them they would have enjoyed the brief trip on the small steamboat very much the captain had heard of the capture of the counterfeiters and was surprised to learn that the rover boys had been the ones to aid in the roundup  youve got courage said he i admire what you did but if i were you id fight shy of that sack todd hell certainly have it in for you for having broken up that gang  i only want to lay my hands on him thats all answered dick i am not afraid of him  and that gasper pold is a bad one too went on the captain i heard about him down in new orleans he cheated a lot of people with lottery tickets and policyplaying once and they got after him hotfooted and he had to clear out and lay low for awhile  well in one way the folks who are foolish enough to invest in lottery tickets or play policy deserve to lose their money put in sam  you are right ladgambling is nothing short of a curse and nobody ought to stand for it why on this very river men have been ruined by gambling and some have committed suicide and others have become murderers all because of cardsand drink one is as bad as the other and both as bad as can be  of course they dont gamble as they used to came from harold bird the times have changed a great deal for the better    chapter xiii  the capture of solly jackson  the rover boys and their friends from putnam hall had never been as far south as new orleans before and they viewed the city and its approaches with deep interest the levees were piled high with cotton molasses and other commodities and more activity was shown than they had witnessed since leaving the ohio  the small steamboat had a regular landingplace but under orders from dick and harold bird the captain took her up and down the levees and also to the other side of the stream all on board kept their eyes open for a possible view of the launch but nothing was seen of the venus  it is possible that she has gone further said tom wonder if we cant find out from some of the rivermen  we can try anyway returned sam it doesnt cost money to ask questions  they spent the remainder of that day in hunting for some trace of the launch and then put up at one of the leading hotels over sunday they rested soundly and after dinner felt as tom put it a hundred per cent better and some extra then they took another walk and made more inquiries  the captain of the small steamboat had no charter for the next few days so he was anxious to remain in their employ and he took them along the waterfront again early monday morning during this trip they fell in with another captain who told them he had seen the venus on sunday afternoon with four men on board puffing down the river  i was interested in the launch so i noticed her particularly said he two of the men had quite some liquor aboard and i was thinking they might fall overboard but they didnt then he described how the party was dressed and our friends came to the conclusion that they must be pold todd jackson and baxter  where could they be going to next asked fred  that remains for us to find outif we can answered dick all i can think of to do is to follow them  cant we telegraph ahead to stop the launch and arrest those on board questioned songbird  yes we can do that  the authorities were consulted and the telegrams sent then off our friends hurried and were soon on the way down the mississippi once more  about ten miles below new orleans is the entrance to lake borge canal an artificial waterway connecting the mississippi with lake borge which opens through mississippi sound into the gulf of mexico the captain of the small steamboat had an idea the men who had stolen the launch were making for this canal and he was not mistaken arriving at the canal entrance our friends learned that the launch had been taken through very early in the morning  well this ends the search so far as i am concerned said the steamboat captain i suppose you want to go on somehow  cant we send word to the other end of the canal asked sam  yes we can telephone to the station there answered harold bird and this was done without delay  want the launch venus do you came back over the wire she went through some hours ago  where did she go to  somewhere on the lake  this was all the satisfaction they could get and bidding the steamboat captain goodbye after paying him off the rovers and their friends looked around for some means of getting to lake borge a distance of seven or eight miles  a barge was going through and they were soon on board they urged the owner to hurry and offered him big pay and as a consequence before noon they reached the lake here they ran into an old fisherman who told them that the persons in the launch had had a quarrel with two officers of the law and had sailed off in the direction of bay st louis  this is certainly getting to be a long chase remarked tom first thing we know well be following them all the way across the gulf of mexico  well i am willing answered dick promptly  and so am i added harold bird i intend to bring them to justice if i possibly can  again there was a consultation and the old fisherman told them how they might reach bay st louis a town of considerable importance on mississippi sound the trip took some time and on the way they looked around eagerly for some sight of the launch but the craft did not appear  at bay st louis came a surprise the launch had entered the harbor on fire and those on board had had to swim for their lives the craft had been running at full speed had struck a mud scow and gone under and was now resting in eight feet of water and mud  was she burnt very much asked harold bird of the person who gave this information  i dont think she was was the answer she went down before the flames got very far  and what of the rascals who ran or rather swam away asked dick  they came ashore went to a hotel where they dried their clothing and got something to eat and then went off to get the launch raised  i dont believe they intended to raise the launch said sam promptly that was only a bluff  exactly what i think put in tom those fellows know theyll be followed sooner or later and theyll try to make themselves scarce  what to do next our friends scarcely knew they went to several points along the sound front but could gain no information of value  weve lost them said songbird dismally all our long chase for nothing  they were moving from one dock to another when they saw a man sitting on some bales of cotton sleeping soundly and snoring lustily  why isnt that the carpenter who was going to repair the dora cried sam  sure it is answered tom here is luck  i wonder if those other rascals are near questioned fred  they looked all around but soon reached the conclusion that solly jackson was alone then they shook the fellow and roused him he had evidently been drinking but he was now almost sober  whats the matter he demanded sleepily lemme alone pold  wake up you rascal cried dick youre not on the launch  whats the reason i aint stammered solly jackson oh she got on fire didnt she well let her burn and he attempted to go to sleep again  youll wake up cried harold bird and between them he and dick shook the fellow until he was thoroughly aroused when he realized his position he was greatly alarmed  oh gentlemen its all a mistake he whined ieri didnt run off with the launch or the houseboat either all a mistake i tell you  it was a mistake answered dick grimly and youll find it so when you are behind the prison bars  whewhere are the others  that is what we want to know said tom where did you leave them  aint they here  no where were you with them last  solly jackson scratched his head thoughtfully  at the tavern i had several drinks and thats the last i knew  did they bring you here and leave you asked sam  i reckon they didi dont know exactly but gentlemen i didnt steal the boats and things really i didnt it was gasper pold did the trick  you aided him said tom  he said at first he had bought the houseboat and was going to take her to new orleans he wanted me to go along and finish the repairs and i didnt find out what was really up till we got to the lake sico bayou then he told me that if i didnt stick to him hed shoot me  when did sack todd and dan baxter join you asked sam  just before we left i dont know where they came from but pold knew sack todd well and todd brought in the young fellow then they hid the houseboat in the bushes and stole what they could and afterwards ran off with the launch  yes but you helped the others to make us prisoners came from songbird severely  i did it because i had topold said hed shoot me if i went back on him mr birdsolly jackson turned to the young southerneryou know i aint no bad man like pold an that sort  i know you are weakminded and weakkneed answered harold bird in disgust but you stood in with those rascals and you must take the consequences  its mighty hard on a fellow as aint done nothin  where did the other fellows go demanded tom  i dont knowreckon they left me when i went to sleep here  didnt they mention any place demanded dick sternly come if you expect us to be easy on you you must tell us all you know  they did answered solly jackson after scratching his head again gasper pold said he thought of going to tampa florida where he has several friends that young baxter said hed like to go to tampa and sack todd said he might go along then they talked of going over to mobile to get a steamer there for tampa but pold said it wouldnt do as all the steamboat landings and railroad offices might be watched so then pold said he would look around and see if he couldnt find some boat that was going to tampa from here  a steamer queried harold bird  either that or a sailing vessel he didnt much care which he said a sailing vessel might be safer especially if they could ship without those on shore knowing it  this was practically all that solly jackson could tell them as he grew more sober he seemed truly repentant of his misdeeds he said gasper pold had plied him with liquor before running away with the dora and that had he been perfectly sober he should never have aided in such a rascally bit of work that he had been nothing more than a tool from start to finish there could be little doubt he agreed to go with them and do all he could to locate his former companions and also do what he could towards having the gasoline launch raised and put in order    chapter xiv  on a gulf steamer  well now for a life on the ocean wave came from tom  und a houses on der rollings deeps put in hans  and may the enemy be captured in short order came from harold bird  all well enough to hope that but i am afraid we have some work before us perhaps something we wont like said dick seriously those men know that the prison is staring them in the face and they will do all in their power to escape if cornered they may put up a stiff fight  well we can put up a fight too answered sam  the conversation took place on the forward deck of the mascotte a gulf steamer running from mobile to tampa and other points on the florida coast two days had passed since the boys had arrived at bay st louis and in that time they had accomplished several things of more or less importance  it had been an easy matter to obtain all possible information from solly jackson and for the time being the fellow was in the hands of the law awaiting further developments he had promised if the others were captured that he would give evidence against them and in return for this dick and harold bird said they would be easy on the carpenter when he came up for trial  the gasoline launch had been raised without much trouble and towed to a shipyard where she was to undergo repairs the craft was not damaged a great deal but would need a new gasoline tank and some new seats fortunately the gasoline supply had been low at the time the fire broke out otherwise those on board would have been blown skyhigh  after numerous inquiries tom and sam rover had learned that pold todd and dan baxter had taken passage for tampa on a schooner named the dogstar the vessel carried a light load of lumber consigned to a firm that was erecting a new winter hotel on tampa bay and expected to make a fairly quick passage across the gulf  the rovers and their friends had taken the train from bay st louis to mobile after first sending messages to mrs stanhope mrs laning and the girls at mobile they had just been in time to catch the mascotte and had been equally fortunate in securing several vacant staterooms  well head them off this time said tom yet this was by no means certain it depending somewhat on the quickness of the trip made by the lumber schooner the mascotte was by no means a firstclass steamer and it had been a question the day before the voyage was undertaken if she had not better be laid up for repairs to her engine and boilers but of this our friends knew nothing  as soon as the trip was begun dick and harold bird had an interview with the captain of the steamer and told the latter how anxious they were to get track of the dogstar to their dismay however the captain proved to be anything but agreeable and said he could not bother himself over their personal affairs even when offered pay to do so  hes a regular lemon said tom i dont think hed do a favor for anybody  and this steamer is a tub answered sam i shouldnt wish to travel very far in her  yet with it all the boys felt in pretty fair spirits as they gathered on the deck and talked matters over but in less than an hour they were in open rebellion  they went to the dining room for dinner and were served with food that was scarcely fit to eat as they had paid for firstclass accommodations all found fault  waiter bring me some meat that isnt burnt said sam  and bring me some that is fresh added harold bird  and bring me a cup of coffee that is worth more than ten cents a pound came from songbird this is nothing but mud  even this bread is next door to being sour said fred  yah dis vos der vorst tinner vot i efer see alretty was hans comment i vos make a kick py der cabtain aint it  sorry genmen said the waiter but dat meat am de best we have an dar aint no udder kind ob coffee an bread sah  whose fault is it the cooks or the captains asked tom  at this question the waiter shrugged his shoulders then he leaned over and whispered into toms ear  wish yo would make a kicki hates to serve sech fooddeed i does  the boys left the table half hungry and so did the other passengers dick walked up to one of the others  dont you think we ought to make them serve us with better food he asked flatly  i do sir was the answer of the passenger but the cook said it was the best he had he said we might go to the captain or to anybody we please he is going to leave the boat when we arrive at tampa  without more ado dick harold bird and about a dozen others sought out captain fretwood who was in his private cabin  what is it demanded the officer eying the crowd sourly  we have come to complain of the food served at dinner said dick it was so poor we could not eat it  oh the food is all right answered the captain in an overbearing tone  no it is not all right put in harold bird  we paid for firstclass accommodations and we want firstclass food put in tom with spirit  thats the talk came from several in the crowd  see here i am not to be dictated to by a lot of boys cried captain fretwood angrily we are giving you good food and that is all there is to it  its a fraud cried sam  a downright imposition added songbird  our tickets read first cabin with meals said fred those meals arent good enough for steerage passengers unless you give us something better  ha do you threaten me on my own ship bellowed the captain  we certainly do said dick as fred glanced at him questioningly  i can put you in irons for it young man  no you cant we are not going to touch you or any of your crew but unless you serve us with firstclass food from now on i for one shall make a complaint against you as soon as we land and have you arrested  at this announcement the face of the captain of the mascotte grew purple with rage he stepped forward as if to strike dick but the latter stood his ground looked the irate officer full in the eyes and the man paused  we have had trouble enough without your adding to it said harold bird we ask only that which is due us  the young man is perfectly right said an elderly passenger the food is horrible if he makes a complaint to the authorities i shall sustain him  so will i added several  all right have your own way grumbled the captain i see you are bound to get me in a hole if the food wasnt good it was the fault of the cook  he says it is your fault and he is going to leave you at the end of this trip  bah well well see if he cant serve the food properly cooked ill be glad to get rid of him  after that an allaround discussion ensued lasting quarter of an hour led by the boys the passengers were very outspoken and as a consequence the next meal was fairly good although not exactly firstclass  we tuned him up thats certain said sam  i am glad you did said a passenger sitting opposite i was afraid i should be starved to death before we reached land  hell have it in for us said fred every time he looks at me he glares like a wild beast  well keep our eyes open said dick but i dont think hell do anything he knows we were in the right i reckon hes more of a talker than anything else and in this surmise the eldest rover was correct  during the afternoon a heavy mist swept over the gulf and the speed of the mascotte had to be slackened two men were placed on watch besides the pilot but they could see little  this is going to delay us still more said tom and he was right about six oclock they came near crashing into another steamboat and after that the forward movement was almost checked entirely  all on board felt it would be a night of more or less peril and consequently the trouble over the meals was forgotten the captain paced the deck nervously and the pilot and other watchers strained their eyes to pierce the gloom  i must say i dont feel much like turning in remarked sam i cant tell why it is either  i feel myself as if something unusual was in the air answered tom  boys said dick to his brothers if anything should happen stick together  to be sure came from sam and tom  but do you think something will really happen added the youngest rover  i dont know what to think i know this steamer is worse than an old tub and i know that the mist is getting so thick you can cut it with a knife  i wish we were on shore again dick  so do i  py chiminatics came from hans owit on der deck you cant see your face before your nose alretty  of course you know what this means hans answered tom who was bound to have a little fun in spite of the seriousness of the situation  vot does dot mean  you know they have great earthquakes down here and great volcanoes  vell vot of dot  when it gets so misty as this then look out for a fearful earthquake and a great volcanic eruption  you tont tole me gasped the german youth say i tont vont no earthkvakes not much i tont  maybe it wont do much harmonly sink the ship put in sam taking his cue from tom  sink der ship den ve peen all drowned aint it say sam how kvick you dink dem earthkvakes come hey  oh some time tonight answered the youngest rover  mine cracious ve peen all killed asleep groaned hans say i dink i tont go py der ped not me he added earnestly  at that moment came a cry from the deck it was followed by a thump and a crash that threw all of the boys flat on the floor of the cabin of the steamer    chapter xv  the castaways of the gulf  it vos der earthkvake yelled hans as he scrambled to his feet der oceans vos all busted up alretty safe me and he ran for the cabin doorway  we must have struck something in the fog cried dick as he too arose oh  another crash had come heavier than the first and the mascotte careened far over to port then came wild screams from the deck followed by orders delivered in rapid succession all in a moment the passengers were in a panic asking what had been struck and if the steamer was going down  the rovers and their friends tried to make their way on deck but another shock threw fred and songbird back into the cabin and partly stunned them then harold bird ran to his stateroom to get a pocketbook containing his money  out on the deck all was misty the lights gleaming faintly through the darkness to one side loomed up another steamer of the tramp variety heavily laden with a miscellaneous cargo from central american ports  the mascotte is going down was the cry as the steamer gave a suspicious lurch then came another crash and before he knew it dick rover went spinning over the side into the dark and misty waters of the gulf  it was certainly a time of extreme peril and had not poor dick kept his wits about him he must surely have been drowned down he went over his head and it was fully quarter of a minute before he came to the surface once more spluttering and clashing the water from his eyes he looked around felt something hard hit him and then went under once more  he knew he was near the bottom of some ship and held his breath as long as possible when he again arose it was to gasp for air now he was free of the ship and the rolling waters of the gulf of mexico lay all around him  his first impulse was to cry out for help and again and again he raised his voice but the confusion on board the mascotte and the other steamer was so great that nobody heard him or at least paid any attention  dick strained his eyes and could make out the steamer lights dimly he was about to yell again when something floated near and struck him down once again but as he came up he caught at the object and held fast to it it was a large crate empty and with considerable difficulty he climbed on top  this is better than nothing he thought and then catching his breath he set up a long and lusty cry in the meantime watching with a sinking heart the lights of both steamers as they faded from view  a quarter of an hour passedit seemed much longer to poor dickand the lights disappeared entirely his heart sank like lead in his bosom  they wont come back for me now he reasoned perhaps the steamboat is sinking and the others have enough to do to think of saving themselves  the crate dick was upon was not extra large and it merely allowed him to keep his head and shoulders out of water fortunately the night was not cold so he suffered little from his involuntary bath but he realized the seriousness of his situation and was correspondingly sober  i must be a good way from land he reasoned ill have my own troubles saving myself even if the mist clears away  another quarter of an hour went by and then dick thought he heard voices he strained his ears  i think dick went overboard too although i am not sure came in sams tones  yah i dink dot answered hans mueller und i dink tom he falls ofer also alretty  hullo there cried dickis that you sam  who calls came the answering query it is i dick rover  dick came from sam and hans  where are you  this way called sam and kept on calling until dick drew closer and at last made out his brother and the german boy clinging to another crate  this is luckyas far as it goes said sam are you hurt  not at all and you  i got a scratch on my wrist that is all and hans says he twisted his left ankle a little but we are glad we werent drowned  what of the others  i am almost sure tom went overboard i think the others remained on the steamer  was she sinking  i think she was i heard somebody say there was a big hole stove in her near the port bow  after that the three youths pulled the two crates together a grass rope was fastened to one of the affairs and they used this in joining the two and then the castaways made themselves as comfortable as possible on their improvised raft  the thought that tom might have been drowned cast a gloom over sam and dick and also made hans feel bad consequently but little was said for the next few hours all kept their eyes strained for the sight of some friendly light but none came to view  how many miles do you think we are from shore asked sam presently  i havent any idea answered dick at least fifty or a hundred  ve vill nefer see der land again groaned hans i vish ve had gone to dot dampa py railroad drain aint it  well even railroad trains occasionally have smashups answered dick philosophically  at last it began to grow light and with the coming of morning the mist lifted a trifle so that they were able to see around them a gentle breeze was blowing causing the bosom of the gulf to ruffle up sam climbed up to the top of the crates  see anything queried his brother  well i never ejaculated the youngest rover if that doesnt beat the nation  he pointed off to their left and then all lookedand actually laughed and well might they do so  there on the waters rode a rude raft made of several empty boxes and crates on the top of this affair stood a campstool and on the stool sat tom rover making himself as comfortable as possible  tom the others yelled in concert and the funloving rover looked around eagerly  hello you he called back how many  three answered sam dick hans and myself  good enough  you certainly seem to be taking it easy said dick as the two rude rafts floated close to each other  well why not take it easy if it doesnt cost any more demanded tom coolly i either had to sit on the chair or in the water and i preferred to sit on the chair  do you know anything about the others tom  no but i am afraid they are drowned and now the funloving rover became serious what makes you think that asked sam  i think the steamer went down with nearly everybody on board  dot is terrible burst out hans poor fred und poor songpird vot vill der folks say ven da hear dot and he shook his head dubiously  and poor harold bird added dick he had taken a strong liking to the young southerner  as it grew lighter those on the bosom of the gulf looked vainly for some sign of land or a sail but hour after hour passed and nothing came to view but the waters under them and the mist and sky overhead  i am more than hungry grumbled tom i didnt get half enough to eat on that steamer and now i could lay into almost anything  ditto here answered his younger brother  der poat must haf gone town said hans of not den da vould look aroundt and pick us ub hey  i dont believe captain fretwood would put himself out to look for us answered dick he hated our whole crowd and would gladly get rid of us  a little later sam shifted his position and chanced to place a hand in one of his coat pockets  heres luck he cried not much but something and he drew forth a thick cake of sweet chocolate done up in tinfoil and paper  oh its salted and will make us thirsty said dick  the chocolate was examined and found to be in fairly good condition and despite the salt they could not resist the temptation to divide the cake and eat it up as my readers must know chocolate is very nourishing and they felt much better after the brief lunch although very thirsty  i bought that on the train from bay st louis to mobile explained the youngest rover sorry now i didnt get half a dozen  and a bottle of lemon soda with it added tom who was bound to have a little fun no matter how serious the outlook  slowly the morning wore away about eleven oclock it looked as if the sun might come out but soon it clouded over as before and then the mist began to crawl up  this is terrible sighed sam at last dick what can we do  i dont know sam if we knew in what direction the land lay we might make some effort to reach it  we couldnt paddle the rafts fifty or a hundred miles  i am in hope that some steamer or sailing vessel will come this way and pick us up answered dick  then a silence fell on the little crowd matters were growing serious indeed and all wondered how the adventure would end    chapter xvi  a deserted steam yacht  dick am i mistaken or do i see a vessel over yonder  tom asked the question as he suddenly straightened up and took a long look over to where the mist had temporarily lifted  it certainly does look like a ship of some sort answered dick gazing forward with equal eagerness  shall ve call owid asked hans  it is too far off  is she coming this way asked sam who had gotten so much salt water in his eyes that he could not see very well  i am not sure if it is a ship said tom but it is certainly something  let us try to paddle closer suggested his older brother and all set to work tom using the folded campstool and the others some bits of boards from the crates  very slowly they approached the object until they felt certain it was a vessel a steam yacht as they made out a few minutes later but no smoke curled from the funnel of the craft nor could they make out anybody on the deck  yacht ahoy yelled dick when he felt that his voice might be heard  to this hail there was no answer and although the boys strained their eyes to the utmost they saw nobody moving on the craft ahead  yacht ahoy screamed tom using his hands as a trumpet yacht ahoy  still there was no answer nor did a soul show himself the curiosity of the castaways was aroused to the highest pitch and as vigorously as they could they paddled to the side of the steam yacht the craft was not a large one but seemed to be of good build and in firstclass trim the wheel was lashed fast causing her to ride fairly well in the faint breeze not a sail was set  ahoy ahoy yelled all of the boys in concert  vos you teat alretty asked hans of you vos vy tont you tole somepoty  gracious do you think all on board are dead cried sam  either that or else the owners belong to a deaf and dumb asylum responded tom  the castaways continued to call out and in the meantime brought their rude raft close to the side of the steam yacht as the vessel slipped past them slowly they threw a bit of rope to the rudder post and made fast  everybody must be below and asleep said dick although i never before heard of such strange proceedings  nor i came from sam but the question is are we going on board or not  are we of course we are burst out tom they couldnt keep me off with a pitchfork i want a drink of water if nothing else and i am bound to have it  aboard the yacht yelled dick again why dont you show yourselves and say something are you all deaf  still no answer and the boys looked at each other in amazement  am i dreaming demanded tom  maybe the ship is aaphantom whispered sam and gave a little shiver  well i am going on board even if its the flying dutchman himself cried tom bravely  flying dutchmans queried hans der vos no dutchmans vot fly vos dare  tom is speaking of a phantom ship with a phantom crew i guess said sam tom how are you going to get on deck he added to his brother  this was a question tom could not answer at once the rail of the steam yacht was some feet above their heads and how to reach it was a problem  you can take the ropes from the rafts suggested dick perhaps we wont want them any longer  they took the ropes tied them together and tom threw one end upward after several failures he got the rope around the rail and the end down within reach and then he went up hand over hand in true sailor fashion for tom had been a firstclass climber from early childhood always getting into mischief as his aunt martha had been wont to say  dont you fellows want to come up asked the funloving rover as soon as he was safe  certainly we do answered dick go on hans and sam i can wait till last  it was not so easy for hans to get up and tom at the top and dick at the bottom had to aid him then sam went up like a monkey and the eldest rover followed and the crates and boxes with the campstool were allowed to drift away  once on board the steam yacht the rovers and hans looked around with keen curiosity not a soul was on deck in the upper cabin or in the tiny wheelhouse  this is enough to give a fellow the creeps declared sam i must say i almost hate to go below  just the way i feel added tom perhaps weve run into some great tragedy  everything on deck is in applepie order was dicks comment it certainly is a mystery but i am going below  wait dick cried sam would it not be as well to arm yourself  perhaps was the reply and then all of the boys procured belaying pins or whatever was handy with which to ward off a possible attack  maybe they had a lion on board and he ate the whole crew up suggested tom  say of der vos a lion began hans drawing back  oh tom is fooling interrupted dick they dont carry a menagerie on a vessel like this why this is a gentlemans pleasure yacht  well then bring on the gentleman responded the irrepressible tom i shouldnt like anything better than to be introduced to him  they had almost passed to the last step of the companionway when sam called a sudden halt  boys perhaps after all we had better keep out of that cabin he said  why sam  this may be a pest ship the whole crew may have died of yellow fever or something like that  at this announcement all looked at each other with added alarm showing in their faces a pest ship the idea filled them with horror  if its thatand weve caught the fever began tom  oh i vish i vos home oder at school groaned hans beginning to shake from head to foot of ve catch der yellow fefer ve peen all teat in a veek  for several seconds there was silence then dick walked down the last step of the companionway and threw the door below open with a bang  i am going to find out what this means muttered the eldest rover if we are to catch the fever maybe weve got it already and he walked into the cabin and one after another the others followed  all was in as good order as on deck on the table lay several books and magazines one opened and turned face downward as if just placed there  somebody has been reading murmured sam what did he stop for he picked up the magazine and read the heading of one of the articles famous suicides of modern history ugh what delightful literature to read just the thing for the young ladies department of a public library  dick had moved forward to one of the staterooms with caution he opened the door and peeped in the apartment was empty but the berth looked as if it had recently been used  hullo somebody has been camping out in here he called the bed is mussed up and heres a suit of clothes hanging on the wall  and a pair of slippers on the floor added sam over his shoulder  gradually the boys grew bolder and traveled from one stateroom to another and then to the dining room and the cooks galley not a person was to be found anywhere in the galley some cooking had been done and several pans and pots were dirty but that was all  water cried tom coming to a cooler he got the cup and took a long drink and the others followed  and something to eat added sam with satisfaction owner or no owner i am going to have a square meal just as soon as this inspection is over  i dink i sthart now commented hans reaching for a box of crackers he helped himself and passed them around and soon all were munching  from the cooks galley they visited the engine room the machinery appeared to be in perfect order the bunkers were halffull of coal and the firebox was still somewhat warm but the place was totally deserted  this is a deserted steam yacht said dick at last i do not think there is a soul on board we are in absolute possession    chapter xvii  in undisputed possession  it was a remarkable state of affairs and it took the rover boys and the german youth a full hour to comprehend it during that time they explored the steam yacht from end to end and then sat down to eat such a meal as they could fix up hastily they had canned meat and vegetables coffee and biscuits and some canned fruit  dick how do you solve this mystery asked tom while they were eating  i cant solve it at all answered his brother it is beyond me  by the papers we found downstairs i should say the yacht might belong to a man named roger leland put in sam but that doesnt help us out any for none of us ever heard of that individual  if there had been a storm we might think the persons on board had been swept away went on dick but we havent had a heavy storm for some time  and the yacht hasnt run into anything for she isnt damaged in the least  if we take her into port we can claim salvage said sam  certainly sam and heavy salvage too came from tom but i must say id let a dollar or two of that salvage slip right now just to know the explanation of this mystery why its like a romance  its a grand good thing for us said dick if we hadnt found this steam yacht we might have died of hunger and thirst  yah dots so answered hans of you blease dom i takes me anudder cub of coffee hey  hans that makes four youve had already  vell i vos alful try answered the german youth complacently  the best of it is the yacht seems to be fairly well stocked with food and water was dicks comment after a pause well not starve to death even if it takes a week to reach port  why we ought to reach port in a couple of days cried sam some of these steam yachts can run very fast  so they canwith a competent engineer but who is going to be the engineer and who the pilot  oh we can pilot her declared tom loftily its as easy as licking cream as the cat said  maype you vos run us on der rocks put in hans  i dont think there are many rocks out herebut well have to consult the chart said dick oh i think we can pilot her to some port but i must confess i dont know much about running an engine  well make her go somehow answered tom even if i have to shove the piston rod myself and at this remark both of his brothers had to laugh  the more they thought of it the more wonderful did the situation appear to be it was so wonderful that for the balance of that day they allowed the craft to drift as before tom and sam started up a fairsized fire under the boiler after making certain that the latter was more than halffull of water they knew enough about an engine to locate the safety valve and saw that this was in working order  now if we get up steam we wont be blown skyhigh anyway said sam  while sam and tom were experimenting in the engine room dick and hans tried to make themselves familiar with the wheel and the things on deck and the oldest rover studied the chart found in the cabin and the compass  i think we are about here said dick when all came together in the cabin and he traced a circle on the chart with a lead pencil now if that is so then well have to steer directly southeast to reach tampa bay  hurrah for captain dick cried tom dick you get your diploma as soon as we land  well isnt that right  it certainly is according to the map answered sam  so all you and tom have got to do is to furnish the powerand not blow us upand then you get your diplomas too  vot do i got asked hans  oh you get a big limburger cheese cried tom  vell dots putty goot too answered the youth of teutonic extraction  well arrange it this way said dick tom can be engineer sam fireman myself pilot and hans can be admiral and crew combined  vot does dot crew to asked hans eagerly  oh the crew swabs the deck and keelhauls the anchor answered tom in between times you thread the yardarm too  vell den i vill haf mine hands full aint it  you eat so much you ought to do some work said sam if you dont work youll get as fat as a barrel  with the coming of night our young friends looked to the lanterns of the steam yacht and refilled those which were empty at an oil barrel stored in the bow of the craft then they lit up and also lit up the cabin  i think we may as well cook ourselves a real dinner for this evening said dick no makeshift affair either  all were willing and an hour and a half later they sat down to the table and ate as good a meal as the stores of the steam yacht afforded evidently the craft belonged to some person of good taste for the eatables were of the very best  there that puts new life into a fellow declared dick after the repast was over if i only knew what had become of the mascotte and the other fellowsknew that our friends were safeid feel quite happy  oh dont speak of the mascotte answered sam with a shiver i cant bear to think that fred and songbird have been drowned  let us hope for the best said tom with a sigh and for the moment all traces of fun disappeared from his countenance  thinking it might be a good plan to cast anchor over night they attempted to do so but although they let out all the rope and chain no bottom could be found  the water is certainly deep here said dick after the anchor had been brought up again i dont think there is any danger of striking rocks  not unless the steam yacht sinks a mile or two said tom with a grin  it was decided that one person should remain on watch during the night to report any vessel that might pass and to watch the fire under the boiler dick said he would stay up and tom told his brother to call him at two in the morning  and call me at four said sam i want to do my share  the night proved to be as misty as that previously passed and although first dick and then sam and tom kept their eyes on the alert nothing was seen or heard of any other vessel once dick fancied he heard the faraway toot of a foghorn but the sound whatever it was was not repeated  by morning it was raining at first only a few drops came down but then it began to pour so that all were glad to remain under shelter hans and sam prepared breakfast while tom looked after the engine and the fire and dick kept watch on deck  it is going to be a corker was dicks comment when he came in for something to eat the rain is so thick now you cant see a dozen yards in any direction  let us hope that the rain will clear away the mist said sam then perhaps well have some sunshine for a change  its all right if only it doesnt start to blow answered tom but you must remember that they have some pretty fierce storms down here  the rain continued to come down as hard as ever and kept up until near noon in the meantime however sam and tom got up enough steam to run the yacht at a low rate of speed  we can try her that way first said tom then if its o k well give her a hundred pounds or so  now tom be careful of that engine pleaded dick it wont do to monkey too much  oh ill be careful dick i dont want to be blown up any more than you do  remember the old saying the more haste the less speed warned the big brother  it was with a peculiar thrill that dick took his place in the wheelhouse and rang the bell for the engine to start tom below was equally excited as he turned on the power there was a peculiar hissing and bubbling but the propeller did not turn  whats the matter called down dick through the speaking tube didnt you hear my signal  he listened for a reply but instead of toms voice he heard the fierce hissing of steam then of a sudden came a yell from tom  shut off that steam sam quick or ill be scalded to death    chapter xviii  in peril of steam  as quickly as he could dick rushed from the wheelhouse and toward the companionway leading to the engine room  vots der madder bawled hans who was at the rail waiting for the steam yacht to start  toms in trouble ejaculated the eldest rover and went down the stairs four steps at a time with the german youth behind him  the engine room was full of steam so that for the moment dick could see little a pipe running along one side of the engine had burst and tom was hemmed in a corner to get out he would have to pass through the furious outpouring of steam which might scald him to death  not far away was sam frantically trying to turn the steam off but the youngest rovers knowledge of engines and marine machinery was limited and while he fussed around the steam in the narrow engine room kept growing thicker and thicker  get down on the floor tom yelled dick as he took in the situation maybe you can crawl out  tom did as urged and like a snake he attempted to crawl from his position of peril but when he was only halfway he got stuck  ii cant make it he panted trying to worm along iim too big  can you go backi see a door behind you said dick  tom went back and as he did this dick ran out of the engine room and to one of the coal bunkers here was the door the eldest rover had seen it was closed and barred and somewhat rusty and he had to exert all his strength to make it budge  quick quick came faintly from tom i cant stand this much longer  this way out tom called dick as the door at last flew open in the cloud of steam that rushed into the coal bunker dick saw his brother faintly and caught him by the arm and pulled him forward in a moment more both were safe  sam are you all right yelled dick rushing again to the engineroom door proper  whewheres tom  safe  oh then ill come out and sam staggered into the fresh air  mine cracious vos der ship going to plow up gasped hans who had stood looking on with his hair standing on end  i dont think so answered dick the steam will soon blow itself away you didnt have very much pressure did you tom  no but it was too much when the pipe burst gosh i was afraid i was going to be boiled alive and he shuddered  its about gone now came from sam who was watching at the doorway it isnt hissing nearly as much as it did he was right and presently the hissing ceased entirely then sam dick and hans opened all the portholes and doors to let out the steam and soon the scare was over but tom felt shaky in the legs as he termed it for some hours afterwards  i suppose i should have tested all those pipes and valves as soon as i had just a little steam said the funloving rover there is where i wasnt a good engineer well one thing is certain nothing gave way but the single pipe  and that could happen on any steamer answered dick any engine is liable to a breakdown of this kind the question is are we machinists enough to repair the break if we are not then well have to let the steam power go and hoist some sails  oh that would be slow work cried sam let us try to fix the pipe i saw some extra pieces in the tool room maybe one of them will fit  with the engine room cleared of steam they inspected the split pipe it was a piece exactly two feet long and they looked over the pieces in the tool room and found one just half an inch shorter  i think that will do said dick we wont be able to couple it on quite so tightly as the other was but we can pack it well and i guess it will last till we reach some port  the tool room was supplied with the necessary wrenches and all of the boys spent two hours in fitting in the new piece of pipe then they inspected the other pipes and the engine but everything appeared to be in firstclass shape  the fire had been allowed to die down while the repairs were going on and was not started up again until the work had been completed  say dont i look like a nigger demanded tom as he put down some tools if i dont i feel black from head to foot  you are certainly pretty grimy answered sam with a laugh but i am that myself  well all have to go in for a good wash said dick  vy tont you chump oferpoard demanded hans who was pretty dirty himself  say just the thing ejaculated tom a swim wouldnt go bad on such a hot day as this let us go in by all means  sam was delighted at the suggestion for the calm waters of the gulf looked very inviting dick did not care so much for a swim but said he would go in if the others did  dare vos a whole lot of pathing suits in von of der lockers said hans i vill git dem  he soon appeared with the suits and in less than ten minutes all of the boys were ready for a plunge the waters of the gulf appeared to be unusually calm and nothing disturbed the surface  here goes cried tom and poised on the rail he made a splendid dive and disappeared like a flash sam and dick immediately followed hans remained on the rail grinning  why dont you come in hans yelled sam as he came up and commenced to swim about  i dink you vos chumps alretty answered the german boy calmly  chumps returned dick  dots it  why  you chump oferpoard und you tont know how you vos going to git pack aint it and now hans laughed outright  well i never cried tom we forgot to throw even a rope down  we certainly would have had a time getting on deck was dicks comment hans throw an end of the rope ladder down  dot vos vot i dink mineselluf answered the german youth and did as requested then he too took a dive coming up and blowing like a porpoise  it was certainly good sport and the four boys enjoyed it thoroughly with the aid of the rope ladder it was easy to climb on the deck of the steam yacht and they did a good deal of diving and running around they also had a race tom offering a pint of ice cream to the first one around the ship dick won this race with all of the others in a bunch at his heels he was just reaching the end when tom caught him by the ankle and held him fast  hi you let go yelled dick and then turning he promptly sent his brother downward so that tom had to let go  wish i had a plate of ice cream murmured sam when they were all resting on the rail of the steam yacht wouldnt it be fine  oxactly came from hans ven i gits me to a hotel again i vos order a plate a foot high mit vanilla strawperry chocolate orange ice lemon  dont hans cried tom reproachfully you hurt my feelings so and with a comical grin he placed one hand over his stomach just think of strawberry ice cream  or strawberries with cream my but it makes a fellows mouth water came from sam  the boys remained in and out of the water the best part of two hours it was so inviting all hated to think of dressing again they had a game of tag and kept poor hans it for a long while until in fact the german youth was out of breath and had to give it up  i tont run me no more py golly panted hans of you vonts to been caught you caught yourselfs alretty and at this remark all of the others roared  i shouldnt mind our situation a bit if only we were certain the others were safe remarked dick when they were dressing but when i think of fred songbird and harold bird he did not finish but shook his head sorrowfully  it makes a fellow sick doesnt it returned sam oh i do hope they are safe  ill tell you one thing came from tom walking up at this moment this swim has made me as hungry as a bear  tom did you ever know the time you werent hungry demanded his elder brother  sure answered the funloving rover with a broad grin  when demanded both of the others  directly after a good square meal answered tom and then dodged hurriedly to escape the shoe dick hurled at him    chapter xix  the storm on the gulf  boys we are going to have a corker of a storm if ever there was one  i believe you dick my how the black clouds are rolling up  and just when we were doing so nicely too  the three rover boys had come to the deck in a bunch directly after the bath and a hearty meal  it was dick who had noticed the black clouds rolling up so suddenly and had called the attention of the others  how kvick der veader can change sighed hans ven ve vos in schwimming i dink it vos lofely for a veek aint it  the boys had a good fire under the boiler and had tested the engine to find it now in good working order from one of the new joints the steam bubbled the least bit but not sufficiently to do any harm or cause alarm dick had tried the wheel to find it in the best of order it thrilled him to take hold of the spokes and make the steam yacht answer to his will  i dont wonder some men wish to be pilots he had said its great to have a big steamer do just as you want her to then he had run the vessel around in the form of the figure 8 just to get the knack of it as he said  shall we start for land in such a storm as this asked sam it might drive us up on the rocks somewhere  were a good way from land sam let us see what the storm will do first  the black clouds increased rapidly until the whole sky was overcast then a strong wind sprang up and the gulf was covered with whitecaps as far as the eye could reach  its coming cried sam as the big raindrops began to fall we may as well get out of the wet  i think ill run before the storm said dick we must either do that or face it the yacht is beginning to roil  yah i feel dot sighed hans who had begun to turn pale  hans are you getting seasick demanded sam  i tont know put i clink me my stomach vos going inside owid alretty  youre certainly seasick said dick with a grin better lie down for a while  oh my groaned the german youth and rushed first to the rail of the steam yacht and then to the cabin he was indeed sick and that was the last the others saw of him while the storm lasted  soon came a whistling wind and then the rain fell in torrents the sea was lashed into a white foam and the waves became higher and higher crashing against the stern of the mermaid as she ran before them at one moment the steam yacht would be on the top of the waves the next she would sink down and down in the trough of the sea  you dont think well be wrecked do you asked sam as he left his duty as fireman and came to the wheelhouse where dick stood with all the windows down trying to peer forth through the fury of the elements  not at all sambut this is something fierce and no mistake  poor hans is down and out i heard him rolling on his berth and groaning with distress  well leave him alone hell be sick as long as the storm lasts most likely and youll only make matters worse by looking at him  with the coming of night the storm appeared to increase it was pitchblack on every side and dick did not dare to run the mermaid at more than quarter speedjust enough to keep her from swinging around broadside to the storm all the lanterns were lit and hung up sam doing this with an oilsilk coat around hima garment found in one of the staterooms yet he came in pretty wet  its a screamer he announced to tom as he dried himself by the boiler never knew they could have such storms down here  they have storms all over the world answered tom what is dick doing  running before the wind  he just told me to slow down more yet  well he cant see a thing ahead and he doesnt want to run into anything  and hans  down the sickest ever  too bad i know what it is to be sick better leave him alone  thats what dick said  as but little steam was needed sam had no call to urge on his fire beneath the boiler and he and tom sat down near the speaking tube to talk occasionally to dick  thus two hours went by nobody had the least desire to go to sleep even though the long swim had made each boy rather tired the fury of the elements made them nervous  this puts me in mind of the time we were on the pacific called down dick through the speaking tube he referred to the adventures they had had as related in the rover boys on land and sea  well we dont want to be cast away on a lonely island as we were then said sam  there are no islands around here answered tom i looked on the chart to make sure  in that case we cant hit anything i am thinking  back her yelled dick through the speaking tube and then jingled the bell  tom leaped for the engine and reversed it there was a pause and they felt the steam yacht swing half around then after a wait dick ordered the speed ahead  what was wrong asked tom at the tube  light right ahead was the answer we cleared it by fifty feet but i was scared i can tell you that  what kind of a light  a steamertramp i reckon shes way behind now  sam ran on deck to get a view of the stranger but the fury of the storm shut out the sight  i suppose you didnt see much of her dick he said going into the wheelhouse  i saw enough was the grim response i thought we were going to have a smashup sure and i reckon the other pilot thought the same  did you see anybody on board  not a soul she came up like a ghost with only two lights showing and by the time i had backed and turned she was gone but it nearly gave me nervous collapse added the amateur pilot  the wind was now so heavy that it sent the rain against the pilot house in solid sheets dick could not see ahead at all and he requested sam to go to the bow to keep the best lookout possible  if you see anything wrong yell to me he said and be careful that you dont tumble overboard and then he spoke to tom through the tube and asked the amateur engineer to play fireman also for the time being  wrapped in the raincoat and with a cap pulled far down over his head sam took up his station near the bow clinging to the rail for protection he knew their safety depended in good part on keeping a sharp lookout and he eyed the darkness ahead closely so far there had been little lightning and scarcely any thunder but now the rumbling increased until there came a crash and a flare that made all on the mermaid jump  did that hit us yelled tom up the tube  no but it was pretty close answered dick  where is sam now  at the forward rail i can see nothing from the wheelhouse  if it gets much worse you had better come below and let the boat run itself dick  i cant do that tomi must stick to my post  another halfhour went by and there was no let up in the fury of the storm poor sam was almost exhausted and tying the wheel fast for the time being dick went to him  better come in he said if youll take the wheel ill stay out here just keep her straight before the storm  all right panted poor sam and made his way back to the wheelhouse step by step and holding on to whatever was handy to keep from being swept overboard  sam had interested himself in steering from the start and knew how to handle a wheel moderately well he looked at the compass and saw that they were running almost due east varying a little to the southward he untied the wheel and kept to the course with but little trouble  dick has gone on the lookout he explained to tom and then he added youve got the best job tonight  id come up if you could run the engine was toms reply  no you had better attend to that tom  doesnt the storm seem to be letting up  not a particle if anything it is growing worse  it must be a hurricane  it isor next door to it answered the youngest of the rovers  the thunder and lightning appeared to draw closer until the steam yacht was literally surrounded by the electrical display the flashes of lightning were so blinding that for the moment afterward neither sam nor dick could see anything sam tried to keep the windows of the pilot house fairly clean but the effort was a dismal failure  presently came one awful flash and crash that caused sam to sink back in a heap on one of the pilothouse cushions he felt that the steam yacht must have been struck and every nerve in his body tingled and quivered only after a strong effort was he able to pull himself together and clutch the wheel once more  dick must have felt that he murmured i wish  another flash of lightning but less vivid interrupted his meditations he looked out of the front window towards where dick had been standing then he gave a cry of alarm  his big brother had disappeared    chapter xx  a night of anxiety  had the lightning struck dick and knocked him overboard  such was the terrifying question which sam asked himself as he stared out of the pilothouse window into the darkness before him another flash of lightning lit up the scene and he made certain that his big brother was nowhere in sight  tom tom he yelled down the tube frantically  what now sam  dick is gonestruck by lightning i guess come up  at this alarming information tom left the engine room at a bound and came on deck almost as soon as it can be told he met sam running toward the bow  where was dick he screamed to make himself heard above the roaring and shrieking of the wind  at the forward rail on the lookout he was standing there just before that awful crash came and i havent seen him since  no more was said by either but holding fast to whatever came to hand the two rovers worked their way forward until they reached the rail where dick had been standing they now saw that the foretopmast had come down hitting the rail and breaking it loose for a distance of several feet  the mast must have hit dick and knocked him overboard said tom with a quiver in his voice  oh tom sam could say no more but his heart sank  the two boys stared around helplessly not knowing what to do dick was very dear to them and they could not bear to think that he was lost and forever  suddenly as another flash of lightning lit up the scene sam caught sight of something dark lying just a few feet away he rushed over to see dick lying in a heap his head under his forearm  dick dick he cried are you killed  there was no answer and now both tom and sam knelt beside their brother and raised him up his face was pale and the blood was flowing from a cut over the left temple  the topmast hit him when it came down said tom let us carry him to the cabin  they raised their brother up and not without difficulty took him to the companionway and down to the cabin here they placed him on the couch and sam got some water and bathed his wounded forehead they saw he was not dead but unconscious from the blow received  i must look to the enginei dont want the mermaid to blow up said tom and rushed offto get back in less than three minutes by this time dick was gasping and groaning and soon he opened his eyes  dick said sam softly dont worry you are safe  sam ththe mast came down on mme  we know it we found you in a heap on the deck i was afraid you had been knocked overboard it was that awful flash of lightning did it i think  yes  dick could say little more just then and did not try sam and tom made him as comfortable as possible and found he had suffered only from the fall of the topmast and not the lightning stroke itself  if hans felt a little better he might look after dick but he is still as sick as ever said tom he declares we are all going to the bottom and he doesnt care if we do  thats the way with folks who are real seasick answered sam they feel so utterly miserable they dont care what happens  leaving dick on the couch in the cabin sam returned to the wheelhouse and tom to the engine room the steam yacht had been drifting and the waves were dashing over a portion of her deck as quickly as possible sam brought the craft around and now headed her up to the storm which made her ride better than ever  for some reason neither sam nor tom thought of the disagreeableness of the situation after that both were overjoyed to think that dick had escaped serious injury the foretopmast lay on the forward deck still but as it was not in the way it was allowed to remain there for the time being  thus the whole of the night wore away and with the coming of morning the storm gradually died down but the waves still ran high and it was noon ere the sun came out to cheer them up  i am thankful that is over said sam breathing a deep sigh of relief i never want to go through such a night again  nor i answered tom it takes all the fun out of a chap  dick got up a handkerchief tied around his forehead he still felt a trifle weak but that was all  i will take the wheel he said to sam if you want to do something you can get breakfastand be sure and make plenty of hot coffee for we need it to make us less sleepy  as the storm went down hans came forth from his stateroom pale and so woebegone that tom had to turn away to hide a smile  vos dot storm ofer alretty asked hans sinking in a chair  just about answered dick  oh such a night dick i tont forgot him of i lif a dousand years aint it  we shant forget it either hans  dick i durn me insides owit more as fifty dimes yes went on the german youth earnestly  weve had our own troubles too said the eldest rover and then related what had occurred hans was glad dick had escaped falling overboard but was still too weak to take a great deal of interest  the wheel was lashed fast and the engine slowed down and all hands went to breakfast it was by no means an elaborate meal yet it made all but hans feel much better the german youth had little appetite and ate sparingly  der kvicker ve git py land on der besser vill i like him said he  maybe you wont be seasick after such a dose said sam hopefully  during the night all of the rovers had become more or less soaked and they were anxious to find a complete change of clothing so that their own might be thoroughly dried  sam you can hunt around for some things said dick ill go back to the wheel and you tom had better go back to the engine hans will you help sam  sure i vill dot answered the german boy  sam knew where there were several lockers containing both outer clothing and underwear and he proceeded to these followed by hans they soon had one locker open and hauled forth what it contained  this underwear will about fit dick and tom he said its rather big for me though  vell maype der udder closets got someding schmaller in dem suggested hans and opened up a second locker  here they found a variety of things including socks shoes collars cuffs and even fancy neckties  whoever was on board of this steam yacht left everything behind him when he went away was the comment of the youngest rover  they next opened a locker filled with outer clothing including linen coats and panama hats as the weather was growing warmer this just suited the boys  hello here is a pretty big suit observed sam hauling it forth and holding it up the man who wore that must have been a pretty large fellow even dick would get lost in that suit  dots so exclaimed hans vait i try on dot coats ha ha aint he schmall alretty and hans began to roar for the coat came to his knees and the sleeves hid his hands from sight  youve got to grow hans before you can fill that said sam laughing  vell maype i grow some day  you will if you eat plenty of sauerkraut and limburger cheese and sam grinned broadly  i vos eat vot i blease sam rofer  hans took off the coat and in doing so turned the garment over from out of one of the pockets there fell a flat cardcase of red morocco leather  hello youve dropped something hans  so i tit answered the german youth and flinging aside the coat he picked up the leather cardcase  has it got any cards in it questioned sam with sudden interest  dot vos vot i vos going to see now vait i vill oben him went on hans backing away as the youngest rover reached out for the case  well do hurry hans you are so slow cried sam impatiently  vots der use of hurrying ven you got lots of dime hey  i want to see what is in the case  maype der tont been noddings in him  hans will you open it please  yah  well then do so  with great deliberation the german youth opened the leather cardcase out of it fluttered a small card photograph sam picked it up gave one look and let out a cry of astonishment  well i never    chapter xxi  the picture in the cardcase  who is it questioned hans trying to gain possession of the photograph but instead of answering sam started from the cabin  i must show this to dick and tom he cried come along  yah put began the german boy and then stopped for there was nobody to talk to sam being already out of sight  dick look what i found cried the youngest rover as he dashed into the pilot house  a fortune asked dick with a smile  no a picture just look  dick did as requested and gave a start  you found this on the yacht he cried yes in the pocket of a big coat hanging in one of the lockers it was in a cardcase  this is certainly queer it looks exactly like harold bird doesnt it  it certainly is harold i wonderoh look  sam had turned the picture over on the back were these words written in a strong masculine hand  to father from harold merry xmas  why harold must have given this to his father said dick thoughtfullyand if so  do you think the coat belonged to mr bird broke in sam  perhaps did you find anything else  ve titnt look came from hans who stood in the doorway so dot vos a picture of harold pird alretty dot vos kveer  it is astonishing said dick sam see if you can find anything else  sam went back and hans with him and while they were gone dick through the speaking tube acquainted tom with the discovery made  maybe mr bird was on this steam yacht called up tom  sam and hans went over the stuff in the lockers with care they found some cards bearing the name of james morrison and a short note about a meeting of a yacht club addressed to barton knox  those men must have been on the mermaid said sam perhaps they were part owners frequently several men or a whole club own a yacht like this in common  vell she tont vos a common poat was hans comment she vos a peauty  sam was on the point of giving up the search when he saw something sticking from a crack next to the wall he pulled the object forth and saw it was the photograph of a big heavyset man with rather a handsome face he turned it over and gave a short gasp for on the back was written in pencil  sharwell lee bird murderer  what a horrible thing to write murmured the youngest rover it makes a fellow shiver to read it  of he killed dot man ven he vos hunting he vos sure a murderer sam  not exactly hans he didnt mean to shoot the fellow it was accidental  yah put der mans vos teat aint it  yes and the death of the poor fellow drove mr bird insane i must show this to dick and to tom too  sam took the second picture and all on board the steam yacht discussed the discovery for some time but they could reach no conclusion saving that mr bird had likely been on the vessel at one time and had left his coat and the two pictures behind him  perhaps he was on this vessel after he disappeared from kingston said tom if so the question is where did he go after that  we must tell harold of this the first chance we get said sam  providing he is alive answered dick remember we are not at all sure that the mascotte outlived that crash in the fog  the middle of the afternoon found the mermaid steaming on her course at a good rate of speed tom had now become fairly familiar with the engine and he allowed the steam to run up some pounds higher than before hans fell to tending the fire and sam took turns with dick at the wheel  we ought to sight some kind of land by tomorrow said the eldest rover but of course there is no telling where we will fetch up exactly  somewhere on the coast of florida and not very many miles from tampa bay i reckon returned sam by the way dick dont you think the rascals on the dogstar have had ample time in which to make their escape  perhaps so but the storm may have crippled them and we may overtake them even yet a sailing vessel cant make the speed a steamer or a steam yacht can  twice during the afternoon they saw vessels at a distance one a steamer and the other a bark and both bound westward neither came close enough to be hailed and our friends did not think it wise to raise any signals of distress  the yacht is running all right now said dick we may as well take her into port and get the salvage money the amount will be a good round sum  do you know i shouldnt mind owning a steam yacht like this myself said tom to whom he was speaking couldnt we take some dandy trips off the coast of new england and elsewhere  we certainly could tom but you must remember that we ought to go back to school if we dont well never get through its about time i was thinking of college  i hate to think of leaving putnam hall dick why the place is just like a second home to me  it is to all of us but we are growing older and must either go to college or get into business  the sun was setting when dick went on deck again hans was preparing supper and sam was at his station in the pilot house the waters of the gulf were growing calm and the scene was a beautiful one  this is something like remarked the eldest rover as he drew in a deep breath of fresh air doesnt look like the storm of last night eh sam  no dick this is just splendid  whats that ahead asked the big brother casting his eye on a dark speck directly in the track of the steam yacht  i dont knowi didnt see it before  the object whatever it was was a long way ahead and by the time they drew closer it was too dark to see clearly but dick saw enough to make him cry out in astonishment  a rowboat and full of men  the eldest rover was indeed right it was a large rowboat and it contained six persons four of whom were at the oars and the others in the stern the rowboat contained in addition a keg of water and several small boxes and tins  ship ahoy came hoarsely over the water as the steam yacht drew closer to the small craft  ahoy called back dick and ran forward while sam signaled to tom to stop the engine  can you take us on board was the question from a man in the rowboat weve lost our ship and we are played out  certainly we can take you on board answered dick wait a minute and ill throw you a rope ladder  thank you very much called back the man  the steam yacht was brought to a standstill and the ladder thrown out soon the rowboat came tip to the ladder and one after another those aboard the small craft mounted to the deck of the mermaid the three rovers and hans were at hand to see who they were  dan baxter  sack todd  such were the cries that came from sam and tom two of the new arrivals were indeed the persons named and a third was gasper pold  did you come from the dogstar demanded dick  we did answered dan baxter sullenly evidently he was much chagrined over this unexpected meeting  have you been following us in this steam yacht asked sack todd with a sickly grin on his hard face  we were certainly following you answered tom but we didnt start out in this vessel we  tom said dick warningly and then tom shut up instantly  whos the captain here demanded one of the men from the rowboat  i suppose i am for the present answered dick  you and the man a burly fellow took a step back in astonishment  yes who are you  i am sid jeffers first mate of the dogstar we sprung several bad leaks in that storm last night and made up our mind the schooner was going down so we got out the boats and i and two men and these three chaps manned one of them we lost sight of the ship in the darkand here we are were mighty hungry and wed like something to eat and if youve got any liquor on board let us have it by all means concluded sid jeffers    chapter xxii  an unexpected meeting on the water  it was plainly to be seen that the first mate of the dogstar was in no wise an agreeable person to meet and the rovers and hans were sorry that he and the others had come aboard the steam yacht the two sailors from the lumber schooner were also rough men and probably under the thumb of the mate  we can give you what is on board of the mermaid said dick a little stiffly i have not looked for liquor so i cant say if there is any on the vessel or not  captain and dont know whats aboard exclaimed sid jeffers  while he was speaking sack todd and dan baxter had been looking around the deck in the semidarkness  where are the rest of the people on this boat demanded the excounterfeiter  i dont see anybody declared dan baxter say do you know what i think he cried suddenly i think these fellows are all alone  humph muttered sack todd if they are he did not finish but smiled quietly to himself  where can we get something to eat demanded the first mate after a rather awkward pause  in the galley or the cabin as you please said dick but you will have to prepare it yourselves we have no cook on board  oh thats it eh well guirk can cook pretty good and he can do the trick for us eh guirk  aye aye answered one of the sailors just show me the victuals an the stove an ill be after doing the rest in jig time im hungry enough to eat most anything  dick led the way to the galley and the crowd from the small boat followed one sailor stopping long enough to tie the rowboat astern  nobody else on board eh said sid jeffers turning suddenly on dick  no not at present answered the eldest rover boldly  where are you bound  for tampa bay  what vessel is this  the steam yacht mermaid  did you charter her  no we found her answered dick resolved to tell the plain truth  found her came from the mate and also from dan baxter  yes  where  out here in the gulf  who was on board questioned sack todd  nobody  nobody came from all the newcomers  do you mean to say there wasnt a soul on this boat when you found her asked dan baxter in high curiosity  that is the truth said tom she was drifting around abandoned we simply climbed on board and took possession  out in the middle of the gulf asked the first mate incredulously  yes  ve vos shipwrecked and vos mighty glad to got on board said hans  oh thats it cried sid jeffers and a gleam of intelligence shot from his eyes mighty lucky you was and no error a ship like this is worth a pile of money but let us have something to eat and to drink first and then we can talk matters over a fellow cant powwow well on an empty stomach  he spoke a few words in a low tone to his two men and they passed into the galley where hans and sam showed them the food that was on board in the meantime sid jeffers went on a hunt for liquor and finding a bottle took a long drink and then passed it over to sack todd and the others  dick i dont like this at all whispered tom as soon as he could get the chance  neither do i tom i never expected to meet this crowd out here  there are six of them while we number only four went on the funloving rover  come with me answered dick softly sam you take charge for a while he added to his youngest brother  dick led the way to the main cabin of the mermaid and to a case which was screwed fast to the wall inside were several pistols and below were several boxes of ammunition  i reckon i understand you said tom we had better arm ourselves at once there is no telling what those fellows will take it into their heads to do  let us four arm ourselves and then hide all the other pistols said dick then if they are not armed well have them at something of a disadvantage  they took four pistolsone for sam and another for hanswith the necessary cartridges and then all of the remaining weapons were hidden at the bottom of one of the berths this accomplished they went on deck again and called sam and hans  they are having a big time eating and drinking said sam as he took the weapon handed to him i feel sure we will have trouble sooner or later pold todd and baxter wont want to run the risk of being arrested as soon as we land and that mate and his men may side with them  that isnt the only thing said dick they know this steam yacht is valuable the party to bring the vessel in to port will get big money didnt the mate speak of it that shows how his mind was running  our friends talked the matter over for some time but the conversation did not relieve their worry they felt that there was serious trouble ahead of them and that it might break out at any moment  you know the old school whistle said dick if anybody gets into trouble whistle and then the others can come to his aid and so it was agreed  not knowing what else to do dick went to the pilot house followed by hans while tom returned to the engine room and sam to his job as fireman soon the engine was started up once more and the steam yacht headed again for the western coast of florida it proved to be a clear night and though there was no moon the stars shone brightly in the heavens  a full hour went by during which time the party from the dogstar made themselves at home aboard the mermaid they feasted on the best the steam yacht afforded and several of the men drank a gooddeal of liquor  this is like falling into the softest kind of a snap declared sack todd after he and gasper pold had been talking in a corner for some time they dont own this steam yacht any more than we do  right you are answered the other  and if they calculate to take us to tampa and hand us over to the officers of the law why  not much todd i am not going to prison just yet  can you trust jeffers you seem to know him pretty well  i think i can jeffers is closehe likes moneyand he sees big money in this steam yacht  thats an idea now what of the two sailors  i think guirk and the other fellow will do what the first mate tells them toespecially if he promises them good wages for the job  and what of baxter remember he used to go to school with the rovers  i dont know what to make of him sometimes i think he is all right and then again i dont feel like trusting him  thats my way of it too we dont want anybody we cant trust in this  oh hell have to do as we say  hello whats up there shouted sid jeffers from the bench where he was sitting finishing some liquor before him  we want to talk certain things over said gasper pold come here  in a cautious manner sack todd and gasper pold sounded the first mate of the illfated dogstar they said if they could get control of the steam yacht it might mean big money to all concerned  but what will you do with those rover boys and the dutch lad asked jeffers  oh we can either cast them adrift somewhere or else put them off on a deserted shore answered sack todd then i can turn this steam yacht over to a friend of minean utter stranger to themand he can get the salvage on the craft for us and we can divide up  this plan to make money appealed strongly to the first mate and he finally agreed to aid the others in gaining possession of the craft then the two sailors were instructed by jeffers and they agreed to do as ordered leaving the consequences on the mates shoulders finally dan baxter was consulted  i dont care what you do so long as we can get away from the officers of the law said the bully but dont kill anybodyi wont stand for that he added showing that his hard heart had at least one soft spot in it    chapter xxiii  the enemy tries to take possession  say boy come down in the cabin i want to talk to you  it was sack todd who spoke and he addressed hans who had left the pilot house to look over the stern to see if the rowboat was still safe  vot you vonts of me asked hans in surprise  i want to ask you a few questions returned todd smoothly  hans was a trifle suspicious and yet he saw no direct reason for refusing to comply with sack todds request he followed the excounterfeiter across the deck and down the companionway  i want to ask your opinion of this letter said sack todd as he laid a written sheet on the table we cant understand it at all i know you are a pretty smart boy and maybe you can help us  flattered by the compliment paid him the german youth took up the letter and scanned it by the light of the swinging lamp as he did so sack todd closed the cabin door and motioned to gasper pold and dan baxter who stood behind an angle of the wall  almost before he could realize it poor hans was a prisoner his arms were held tightly by someone while someone else thrust a gag into his mouth and fastened it by means of a cloth running to the back of his neck  sthop tont choke me he gasped and that was all he was allowed to utter then his arms were fastened and his feet secured  now into the stateroom with him cried gasper pold and the three evildoers lifted the prisoner up carried him into one of the staterooms and threw him on the berth then the door was closed and locked  thats number one declared sack todd and an easy job too  if you can bag the others as easily it will be a grand job was dan baxters comment  we must get one of those chaps up from below next said gasper pold baxter you can go down and tell one of them his brother in the wheelhouse wants to see him well catch him on the stairs  all right said the former bully of putnam hall  he hurried down to the engine room and then to the nearest coal bunker where sam was shoveling coal  sam he called out to make himself heard  hullo dan baxter what do you want  dick wants you on deck at once  what for  i dont knowi think hans has a fit that dutch boy always was a queer stick muttered dan baxter  all right ill go up answered the youngest rover and dropping his shovel he hurried through the engine room  sam called tom warningly but his brother did not hear him on account of the noise made by the machinery  all unconscious of the trap laid for him poor sam started to go on deck when he was hurled backward in a dark corner of a passageway somebody came down on top of him a gag was forced into his mouth and a rope was brought into use  letlet up he managed to say help and then his wind was completely cut off for the moment until the gag was secured  but though gagged the youngest rover was game and did not give up he squirmed and kicked and landed a blow on gasper pold and another on dan baxter in return the former bully of putnam hall kicked him in the side and then the men tied him up hands and feet  where will you put him asked baxter  put him in another of the stateroomsfor the present answered sack todd after we have got them all we can put them somewhere else  shall we search him went on dan baxter who was anxious to know what sam might be carrying  not nowwe havent time  poor sam was placed in a stateroom next to that occupied by hans and then the evildoers hurried off to see what they could do in the way of capturing dick they expected to take the eldest rover unawares but in this they were mistaken  in the meantime tom full of suspicion from the very start called up the speaking tube to his brother  i say dick whats the mater with dutchy  hans nothing that i know of returned dick why  dan baxter was just down here and said you wanted sam quickthat something was wrong with hans  i didnt send for sam cried dick excitedly he looked around him in the gloom hans isnt here he went on down the tube  well look outi think something is wrong shouted back tom got your pistol handy  dick felt in his pocket and found the weapon where he had placed it then he looked around again but the deck of the mermaid appeared to be deserted  im going to see what has become of sam he shouted down the tube ill tie the wheel fast  keep out of trouble shouted back tom if i dont hear from you pretty quick ill be up myself he added  with his hand on his pistol dick left the wheelhouse and walked slowly and cautiously toward the waist of the steam yacht as he rounded a corner of the cabin he heard a murmur of voices and the next moment he found himself confronted by pold todd the mate of the dogstar and dan baxter  the evildoers were taken somewhat by surprise and halted in confusion in the semidarkness dick saw that one carried a gag and cloth and the two others ropes  there he is faltered dan baxter before he had time to think  no you dont cried dick stepping back several paces what were you going to do he demanded  we want to talk to you answered sack todd smoothly  what do you want stand back i dont want any of you to come closer  see here mr rover its all right came from gasper pold we aint going to harm you we only want to have a little peaceable palaver  where is my brother sam and where is hans mueller  they are both in the cabin i was going to ask you to join us in a general talk said sack todd catching his cue from gasper pold as to how best to proceed  we want to find out where you are taking us put in the mate of the dogstar  you are acting very queerly said dick he had backed up close to one of the small cabin windows which was open sam hans he yelled suddenly and at the top of his lungs  of course there was no reply and satisfied that something was indeed wrong he retreated still further  stop him yelled gasper pold dont let him get below to where his brother is  he meant tom and dick instantly made up his mind that the best thing he could do would be to get to the engine room and warn his funloving brother of their peril he made a turn sent sack todd and dan baxter sprawling and an instant later was diving out of sight down the ladder leading to the machinery  dick i thought something was wrong and i was coming up came from tom what of sam and hans  i dont know they are after me have you your pistol  yes and ill use it too if they bother me answered tom determinedly  stop where you are cried dick looking up the iron ladder my brother and i have pistols and we shall use them if you attempt to follow down here  look out yelled dan baxter in alarm and tumbled back to a safe place theyll shoot sure i know em  at these words all at the top of the iron ladder hesitated in the meantime both tom and dick held their pistols up so that the shining barrels could be dimly seen  they are armed hang the luck muttered sack todd and they tell me they can shoot too  look here we dont want any shooting said gasper pold we want this affair conducted peaceablelike  i know what you want said tom boldly you want to make us prisoners  like as not sam and hans are already prisoners said dick if they were not wed surely hear something from them  they are prisoners answered dan baxter  and you might as well give in it wont do you any good to hold outwe are six to two remember  baxter did you plan this asked tom  oh im not saying who planned it we have simply made up our minds to take command of the steam yacht thats all  the yacht was a derelict put in sid jeffers we have as much right to her as you have  not at allwe found her answered dick  but you couldnt have brought her safely in to port put in gasper pold we are going to do thatand get the salvage money he added triumphantly    chapter xxiv  in the engine room  after the bold declaration of gasper pold there was an awkward pause dick and tom did not know what to do and neither did the party at the top of the engineroom ladder  are you going to give in or not demanded sack todd at length  why should we give in asked dick  because if you do well treat you well  and if we dont came from tom  then youll have to take the consequences as baxter says we are six to two so it is all nonsense for you to think you can hold out against us  supposing we do give in what are you going to do with us asked dick curiously but with no present intention of submitting to the evildoers  oh well treat you fairly enough put in gasper pold well give you all you want to eat and drink and put you off at some safe place along the coast  come do you submit demanded the mate of the dogstar  what do you say dick whispered tom so faintly that the others could not hear  i dont want to give in to them  neither do i but it looks pretty shaky doesnt it  yes they have us cornered  we are armed and if there is to be any shooting we can do our share of it resumed sack todd but there is no need to go to such an extreme better submit quietly and let that end it we wish you no harm but we are bound to have our way  let sam and hans come down and well talk it over said dick struck by a sudden idea  you had better come up and then you can talk it over in the cabin said sack todd and whispered something to his companion the rovers could not hear  not yet said dick firmly  all right suit yourself but if you wont come up you can stay there throw over the hatch fellows  there was a hatch to fit over the opening to the engine room and without further words this was thrown into place and secured from the deck  dick we are prisoners cried tom  it certainly looks like it answered the eldest rover soberly  there is another doorbut it is locked from the other side i think  they listened and heard the men and baxter walk away from the hatchway then all became quiet for tom had stopped the engine  for over half an hour the two rover boys remained in the engine room of the mermaid doing little but walk around with the hatch closed it was very hot down there and dick who had his coat on was glad to discard that garment they could get little or no fresh air and both wondered how long they could stand the confinement  i wouldnt care so much if only i knew sam and hans were safe remarked dick but for all we know they may have been killed  oh i dont think that answered his brother i dont think dan baxter is quite so wicked  presently there came a noise above and the hatch was raised the next instant sam came tumbling down the iron ladder followed by hans  now you fellows can talk it over as long as you like said gasper pold when you come to terms let us know by blowing the steam whistle  and then the hatch was put down and fastened as before  sam are you all right asked dick and tom in a breath  oh yes after a fashion answered the youngest rover but they handled me pretty roughly  and you hans  i dink i vos peen putty vell hammered alretty py chimanatics i vish i could drow dem all oferpoard aint it  we are in a box in more ways than one said tom  what did they do to you questioned dick and then sam and hans told their stories adding that they had been taken from the staterooms but a few minutes before brought on deck unbound and ungagged and sent down the iron ladder as already mentioned  i was afraid first they were going to throw us overboard said sam i think sack todd is equal to it and that gasper pold is about as bad  the four youths talked the situation over for a good hour but could reach no satisfactory conclusion they did not wish to submit to the others and yet they realized that they were in a box as tom said  i know one thingi want a drink of water said sam i am as dry as a salt fish  yah i vont me a trink too added hans  well youll have to go without answered tom i am dry myself i was going to get some fresh water just before the trouble began but i didnt have the chance  i know what theyll dotheyll starve us out exclaimed sam i see their game plainly  i am going to whistle for water said tom with something of his usual grin nothing like being stylish  he pulled the cord and the whistle gave a loud toot he repeated this several times when they heard footsteps and the hatch was raised about a foot  ready to submit asked sack todd peering down on them  we want some drinking water answered tom  oh pshaw said the man in disgust  will you give us a bucket of fresh water or not asked dick  maybeill see said todd and dropped the hatch into place once more  i dont believe hell give us a thing was sams comment he knows if he doesnt well have to give up sooner or later  of ve only had apout two dozen policemans here sighed the german youth  in the meanwhile sack todd told the others about the water  are you going to give it to them questioned dan baxter  dont think i will was the answer  you cant let them die of thirst went on the former bully of putnam hall with some little show of feeling  ive got an idea came from gasper pold is there a medicine cabinet on board generally such a vessel carries one  yes there is one in the cabin answered sid jeffers what do you want of it  we might put some dope in the drinking water that will fix em  what you wouldnt poison them cried dan baxter and gave a little shiver  oh well only put them to sleep answered gasper pold but with a look on his face that baxter did not like  the men went to the cabin and the former bully of putnam hall followed here the medicine cabinet was found filled with various liquids and powders and gasper pold looked them over with care  i worked in a drug store when i was a young man he explained and i took a good bit of interest in dopes and poisons  dan baxter heard him say this and to the credit of the bully it made him shudder he was no friend to the rovers yet he did not wish to see them lose their lives he paused for a moment then turned and ran on deck  nobody was in sight for the sailors from the dogstar were asleep below he ran for a bucket filled it with water and took it to the hatchway which he opened feverishly  hullo there he whispered  baxter is it you queried dick coming to the ladder  yes take this bucket of water quick its clean and good dont drink what the others bring you  but baxter began tom  i cant stay be careful of what they give you to eat and drink thats all and the next moment the bucket was passed to dick the hatch closed down and baxter fairly ran back to where he had left the men  what can this mean asked dick staring at his companions  dick be careful warned sam it may be some plot of baxters  maype ve tont besser trink dot vater suggested hans i tont vont to vake up teat in der morning aint it  can the water be poisoned asked tom  they poured some in a glass and held it close to the light it looked good and dick tasted it cautiously  baxter said to beware of what the others gave us to eat and to drink said sam evidently something is in the air  all sniffed of the water and tasted it yet each was afraid to take a regular drink while they were deliberating they heard the hatch being raised again then sack todd and gasper pold appeared once more    chapter xxv  one plot and another  weve got the water for you said sack todd we dont know as you deserve it but we dont want to be mean  as he spoke he and gasper pold held down a jug containing not more than two quarts  not a very big supply grumbled tom well want a good deal more down here this is a regular sweatbox  you dont have to stay any longer than you wish answered the excounterfeiter with a sickly grin  ven do ve git somedings to eat asked hans  in the morning  this was all those above said and soon the hatch was shut down and fastened and todd and pold walked slowly away  they didnt seem to care much whether we surrendered or not remarked sam  that makes me more suspicious than ever answered dick boys dan baxter may have been acting on the square after all  catch dan doing that retorted tom why it isnt in him dick  i dont know about that he is bad i know but he may not be as much of a villain as these men are i am going to examine the contents of this jug  all gathered around while dick cleaned out the tumbler and then filled it with the liquid from the jug the water looked fairly clear although presently something like oil began to float on top dick put his tongue to this and found it sweetishbitter  this has certainly been dosed said the eldest rover i wouldnt take a drink of it for a good deal  then baxter must have told the truth said sam i think i know how the matter stands baxter got scared at what the men wanted to do and so started in to head them off i believe ill take a small drink of that other water  he did so and the others followed nobody however drinking more than half a tumbler of the liquid this served to quench the worst of their thirst  later on if the water doesnt affect us we can drink more said tom if dan baxter really did mean well its a great credit to him no matter how bad he is otherwise  all sat down and talked in low tones the night was now well advanced yet nobody felt like sleeping suddenly dick leaped up considerably excited  ive got it fellows maybe we can outwit them at their own game he cried  how asked the others  perhaps that water was drugged and was given to us to put us to sleep if we pretend to be overcome it may throw them off their guard and that will give us another chance to gain possession of the vessel what do you say if we lie down and pretend to be asleep when they open the hatch  all right i am willing answered tom there is no excitement in being cooped up in this hot place tell you what ill do to force matters you lie down and begin to snore and ill pull the whistle then when they come ill demand to know what is wrong with you and pitch over myself then we can see what happens next  so it was arranged and half an hour later sam dick and hans stretched out on the engineroom floor as if completely dead to the world then tom gave the whistle half a dozen sharp tugs this brought todd pold jeffers and dan baxter to the hatchway in a hurry  whats the row demanded gasper pold looking down curiously  my brothers came thickly from tom as he reeled around what did youyoudo to them my headliketop youmustmustoh and then tom sank down on a bench slipped to the floor and lay beside sam  hes poisoned shrieked dan baxter and his face grew as white as a sheet  shut up muttered sack todd the dose wont kill him  reckon they are all laid out was gasper polds comment as he peered down the hatchway ill go down and make sure and he passed down the iron ladder pistol in hand  how about it came from the mate of the dogstar  stiff as corpses was the brutal answer i tell you that dope did the business  are any of them dead asked dan baxter hoarsely  i dont think so was the careless answer no they are all breathing went on pold  sack todd came down followed by the mate of the dogstar and all gazed coldly at the four youths lying on the hard floor around the machinery dan baxter remained at the top of the ladder shaking as if with the palsy  how long do you calculate theyll remain in this condition asked todd turning to pold  ten or twelve hours at least was the answer and maybe they wont get over it for twentyfour  any bad effects  well sometimes that dope paralyzes a mans tongue for six months or a year  phew thats pretty rough  once in a great while the paralysis doesnt go away at all  in that case these boys will have it in for youif they ever get their hands on you said sid jeffers with a wicked leer  the men talked among themselves for several minutes and then agreed to take the boys up on deck and place them in two of the staterooms off the cabin  theyll have to have more air than here said gasper pold otherwise theyll surely die on our hands  dan baxter was called on to assist and did so with his knees fairly shaking together he thought that our friends had surely drank of the dosed water and were in a stupor next to death  and if they die theyll say i was as guilty as the rest he groaned to himself oh i wish i was out of this  it was no easy matter to get the three rovers and hans on deck and to the staterooms here our friends were placed two on a berth and for the time being left to themselves  boys we have had a narrow escape whispered dick when he at last thought it safe to speak  thats the truth came from sam and we have dan baxter to thank for it he added i cant understand that part of it  i think i can answered tom baxter is bad enough but he didnt go in for poisoning us i am glad to know he isnt quite so heartless as that  dem fellers ought to be all hung aint it was hans comment  the question is what are we to do next asked tom  that question is not so easily answered returned his elder brother i know what i should like to do  what dick asked sam  id like to make all of the gang prisoners  exactly exclaimed tom in a low voice but can it be done  i dont know for the present let us play possum and find out  vot kind of a game vos dot possum asked hans innocently i tont dink we got dime to play some games he added seriously  dick means to lay low explained sam  vot lay under der peds  no keep quiet and watch out  oh all right i done me dot kvick enough said hans and fell back on the berth and shut his eyes  you fellows keep quiet while i investigate said the eldest rover it is so late some of the crowd may have gone to sleep if so we may have a chance to capture the others first  so it was arranged and making certain that his pistol was still in his pocket dick slid from the berth tiptoed his way to the stateroom door and opening it slowly and cautiously peered out  one look into the cabin of the mermaid told him the apartment was empty there were two more staterooms connected as were those the boys were occupying with a heart that beat rather violently dick stepped to the door of one of these staterooms from within came a deep and regular snoring  somebody is asleep in there he mused who can it be  with great care he peered into the room on the berth rested one of the sailors from the dogstar and on the floor rested the other both evidently much the worse for liquor  the door to the second stateroom was wide open and dick caught sight of a form on the berth in there it was dan baxter the bully was not asleep but was tossing about as if in either mental or physical distress as dick looked at him he suddenly started up turned around and stared  dick rover he screamed are you alive or is it aa ghost    chapter xxvi  turning the tables  be quiet baxter said dick softly but firmly dont you dare to make another sound  ii thought you werewereasleep faltered the former bully of putnam hall that you  that he had drank the poisoned water eh  yees  we did not we took your advice and left it alone  then when they brought you up out of the engine room  we were shamming thats all but i havent got time to explain everything baxter where are the others  on deck or down in the engine room i guessall but the two beasts in there and baxter pointed to the overcome sailors  what brought you in here were you going to sleep  sleep ii couldnt sleep dick honestly i couldnt  why  because iibut whats the use you wont believe me and dan baxter hung his head for a moment  maybe i will tell me why  i came away from them because i was sick of their doings thats why ii am sick of all of itsick in body and in mind too  you didnt want to see us doped as they call it  no no  and that is why you warned us and gave us that good water  yes  dan youre a little bit more of a real man than i thought you were i thought you were willing to do anything against me and my brothers  well i was once but nowbut whats the use of talking you wont believe me and why should you ive been against you ever since we first met  thats the straight truth dan and youve done some pretty mean and desperate things  i dont know why i did them dickhonestly i dont lots of times i knew you and your brothers were right and i was wrong but the old nick got in me and iwell you know how i acted now im an outcastnobody decent wants to have anything to do with me even my own father dan baxter stopped short  see here dan i havent time to talk now said dick after a short and painful pause i didnt expect this of you the whole question just now is this are you going to fight or keep quiet  are you going to fight those others  yes if it becomes necessary  i dont want to fight any more  then will you keep quiet  i will but dick  well  if you capture those men are you going to hand them over to the police  certainly  and hand me over too and again dan baxter hung his head  dont you deserve it  i suppose so and still ieri thought you might give me another chance oh thats what i want another chance you know how my father has reformed i want to reform too i want to go away somewhere and begin all over again  dan come with me  where to  to the others you can talk with them while i take a look on deck  the former bully of putnam hall demurred but dick insisted and soon the pair had joined sam tom and hans  talk to him said dick ill be back soon and then he left and made his way up the companionway to the deck of the steam yacht  his heart was in a strange tumult that dan baxter should want to reform was a surprise of which he had never dreamed could the former bully be playing a part  hes sly enough he reasoned and yet his eyes had a look in them that i never saw before he looked like a worried wild animal that doesnt know how to turn or what to do hes down here all alone among strangers and evidently he has found out that sack todd and the rest arent his sort well if he wants to reform i shant put anything in his way but i am not going to give him too much ropejust yet  having gained the deck of the vessel dick looked around cautiously it was a dark night the stars being hidden by clouds he crept along slowly  well youll have to give me a pointer or two about the engine dick heard sack todd exclaim i thought i knew how to run it but i reckon i was mistaken  oh why not let that go just now growled the mate of the dogstar in return weve got to make sure of those boys first and get some sleep too  it wont take but a few minutes to explain about the engine said gasper pold i ran one once for six weeks  seems to me you have dabbled in a little bit of everything observed sack todd  so i have  the three men were near the pilot house but came away and started for the hatchway leading down into the engine room they had to pass close to where dick was crouching and the eldest rover hardly dared to breathe so fearful was he of discovery  presently dick saw the three men go down the iron ladder one after another as they did this a sudden idea came into his head  ill do it he told himself and sneaked forward with the silence and quickness of a cat  the hatch still lay beside the opening with the hooks that had been used to fasten it down it was heavy and dick wondered if he could move and fasten it quick enough  i wish sam or tom was here to help me he thought  as he started to raise the hatch a sudden puff of wind made the mast creak loudly this alarmed the men below and sack todd started up the ladder  we ought to have somebody on guard he said so loudly that dick heard him i dont trust that baxter very much  all right answered gasper pold you go to the cabin and  he broke off short as a cry came from sack todd the excounterfeiter had caught sight of dick as the latter was raising the hatch to drop it in place  hi yelled sack todd and then let out a scream as the hatch hit him on the head  down you go answered dick and leaped on top of the hatch to force it into place one of sack todds fingers was caught and pinched and he let out another yell but he kept his footing on the iron ladder and thus held the hatch up several inches  whats up came from sid jeffers  they are trying to shut the hatch help me  what roared gasper pold and sprang up beside the excounterfeiter  tom sam hans yelled dick at the top of his lungs help quick  he continued to call out and at the same time did all in his power to force the hatch into place he was sprawled on top and no sooner did he get one end down than the other bobbed up then he heard gasper pold cry out  look out i am going to fire  dont hit me cautioned sack todd  if you fire so will i answered dick and youll get the worst of it  hang the luck we didnt disarm them muttered pold  by this time tom was coming up on deck followed by sam hans was told to remain behind to keep his eyes on dan baxter  as soon as sam and tom saw the situation they leaped to dicks assistance tom saw sack todds shoulder under the hatch and gave it a vigorous kick this caused the man to lose his balance on the iron ladder and he went down a step at the same time gasper pold fired  oh i am hit groaned the excounterfeiter and fell in a heap on the head of sid jeffers then the hatch came into place with a thud and in a twinkling the three rovers secured it  we have them we have them cried sam in delight good for you dick that was a clever move  run down and make certain that other door is fast said dick and away went sam with tom at his heels they came back in less than two minutes  its fast said tom weve got them in as tight a box as they had us    chapter xxvii  dan baxters repentance  the three rover boys could scarcely believe their senses here they were once more in full possession of the mermaid so far as the deck and cabin were concernedand those who had sought to make them prisoners were prisoners themselves  this is where the biter got bit remarked tom say i feel so good i could almost dance  sack todd got shot said dick id like to know if it is serious  well i am not very sorry for him said sam hes a thoroughly bad egg  we want to make certain of dan baxter went on the eldest rover he may fool hans  they walked toward the cabin and ran down the companionway at the lower doorway they paused and then tom grinned  on one side of the room was dan baxter with his hands in the air on the other side was hans with a pistol in each hand  tont dare to mofe hans was saying of you do i vos put oxactly fourteen shots into your poty aint it  i am not moving grumbled baxter didnt i tell you i am sick of the whole thing dutchy i dont want to fight or anything  tan paxter you chust remember dot old saying beoples vot lif in glass houses tont got no right to tell fish stories answered hans gravely  hans thats a good one roared tom coming forward say youre a whole regiment in yourself aint you  yah i vos so goot like ten or sefenteen soljers alretty answered the german youth proudly paxter he tont got avay from me not much  hans lowered his pistols and dan baxter was glad enough to put down his hands dick glanced into the staterooms and saw that the two sailors were still sleeping heavily  well throw them down into the hold said the eldest rover that will keep them out of mischief when they awake  vot apout dem men asked hans anxiously  all prisoners answered sam  prisoners ejaculated dan baxter  yes dan they are prisoners down in the engine room answered dick weve given them the same dose they gave us  then you are in possession once more  yesas far as it goes and i want to talk to you as soon as weve disposed of these sailors added dick  shall i help you carry them out  do you want to  if you wish it  mind you i dont want any trick played dan  i wont play any trick dicki give you my word  this is a serious situation and we dont propose to take any more chances we are on top and we mean to stay on top added the eldest rover  while hans held a lantern the three rovers and dan baxter carried the two sailors through the cabin and out on the deck tom was working with the former bully of putnam hall and declared afterward that he never felt so queer in his life but baxter worked with a will and did his full share of lifting  the hatch to the hold was not far off and the men were put down without great trouble then the hatch was closed and fastened  now dan you are the only enemy we have who is at liberty said dick turning to the big youth i want to know exactly what you propose to do  what i do will depend a good deal on what you do was the somewhat low answer i know i am in your power but id like you to remember one thingabout how i warned you not to drink the drugged water and how i brought you some good water  i am not going to forget that  thats a point to your credit dan said sam  if it hadnt been for that ieri dont know where youd be now as i said before ive been pretty badbut not quite as bad as that  do you think we ought to let you go for what you did for us asked tom who never wanted to beat about the bush  i dont know as you ought to do thatbut id like you to do it id like to have the chance to go awayfar awayand strike out fresh my father wants me to do ithes written me three letters about it he wants me to go to the hawaiian islands or the philippines or to australia he saysbut i dont suppose you are interested in what he writes  i am answered dick promptly  he spoke of what you did for him and he says iwell i ought to be ashamed to keep up the old enmity after what happenedafter you saved his life ieri guess hes rightand i am sick of it all  well i hope you stay sick of iti mean sick of doing wrong said sam  maybe i willi dont know and i am not going to promise but i am sick enough of being here among such rough men as sack todd and gasper pold and that crowd of counterfeiters that was captured i havent had any real comfort for months  i dont believe a criminal ever feels real comfortable said tom how can he when he knows the officers of the law are constantly after him  there is something in that when i go to bed i generally dream of being caught and dragged to prison and those men always wanted me to drink and i dont care much for liquor  then cut it outcut it out by all means said dick you cant do better  and there is another thing went on dan baxter i dont feel welleverything i eat lately goes against me and sometimes im in a regular fever i ought to rest somewhere i suppose and have a good doctor attend me but i cant do anything to make me feel better chasing around like this  after that dan baxter told a good deal more about himselfhow he had been knocking around in all sorts of questionable places and how the dissipation had grown very distasteful to him it had certainly ruined his health and his eyes had a hollow feverish look in them that made his appearance rather pitiable  you are certainly run down said dick and unless you take extra good care of yourself youll be flat on your back with some serious illness but the question still is dan what are we to do with you  i know what id like you to do  what  let me land somewhere where i am not known so that the officers of the law cant get hold of me do that and ill promise to go far away and never trouble you again  i dont think that would be right said tom we might be willing but we cant assist a criminal to escapethats a crime in itself  then you wont let me go  tom is right we cant do it legally personally id be willing to let you go said dick  so would iif you really wanted to do better came from sam  yah i tont stand in nopodys vay added hans i vos glad to see a man make a goot poy of himselluf  there was an awkward pause twice dan baxter started to speak and checked himself they almost looked for one of his former wild outbreaks but it did not come he hung his head low  all righthave your way he whispered hoarsely and dropped into a chair i am done fighting ill take my medicine no matter how bitter it is  perhaps we can make matters a little easy for you said dick in a gentle tone i am sure none of us want to see you sufferif you want to reform  of course well be easy said sam and tom and hans nodded  well if youll dowhats that  dan baxter broke off short and all in the cabin listened there was a thud and a crash followed by another crash  they are trying to break out of the engine  room yelled dick come we must stop them and he started for the deck and all of the crowd went after him    chapter xxviii  hatchway and door  the news that the men were trying to break out of the engine room was true gasper pold and sid jeffers had gotten a long piece of iron pipe and with this they were hammering at the hatch one of the fastenings was already off and the others much weakened  stop cried dick rushing up stop or well open fire on you  we are bound to get out and you cant stop us yelled back gasper pold and started to mount the iron ladder with a long wrench this instrument he placed under a corner of the hatch and began to pry the wooden barrier upward  not so fast sang out tom and rushing up he sprawled over the hatch and caught the end of the wrench one good wrench deserves another he muttered his love of fun coming to the surface even in such a pitch of excitement and with that he gave the wrench a wrench that brought it from polds grip and allowed the hatch to fall into place  all aboard sang out tom and dick sam and hans leaped on top of the hatch nothing like holding em down  let us up roared sid jeffers and a moment later a pistol shot rang out and a bullet came crashing through the hatch but its force was so spent it merely bounced against hans trouser leg  i vos hit i vos hit shrieked the german youth dancing around i vos a teat boy alretty  hans are you really hit asked dick in alarm  yah buti guess it tont vos much added hans sheepishly as he realized that no damage had been done  here hold it down with this cried dan baxter and came forward with two capstan bars these were placed across the hatch and the four boys took their stations at the ends of the bars thus they managed to get out of firing range of those below  this is certainly growing interesting was dicks comment as there was a moments suspension of hostilities i hardly know what to do next  if you dont let us up well blow up the ship yelled gasper pold he was in a terrible fury  if you blow up the ship youll go up with her answered sam  gracious vill da do dot asked hans in alarm  no theyll not be so foolish answered tom they value their worthless hides too much  youve nearly killed sack todd and well have you arrested for it went on gasper pold  youll be nearly killed if you dont look out answered dick we are in possession and we mean to keep in possession  you cant run the boat without the engine  yes we can for the sails are ready for use we wont have to run though by morning we expect to sight some other vessel and then well get help  what have you done with those two sailors asked sid jeffers  put them where they cant do any harm  where is baxter asked pold  that is for you to find out  i am here said the former bully of putnam hall  helping that crowd  yes i dont want anything more to do with you or with sack todd either  the young skunk muttered the mate of the dogstar i told you i didnt like his looks  say dick rover let us talk this matter over said gasper pold calming down a little if youll be reasonable i am sure we can come to terms that will be satisfactory all around  i dont think so  this craft is worth a lot of money so the mate of the dogstar says and there is no reason why all of us shouldnt make a neat pile out of her  do you want us to go in partnership with you asked tom in disgust  thats it and if you will well say nothing about your hurting sack todd  is he bad asked sam  he is bad enough we want to get out so that he can have proper attention and medicine  better give him some of that doctored water suggested tom grimly  dont get fresh young man  i think you are the one who is fresh retorted tom do you think we are going to train with such fellows as you not much  then you wont make terms  no came from the three rovers  at this the men at the foot of the iron ladder muttered something that our friends could not catch the rascals were furious and wanted to do some more shooting but did not dare fearing shots in return  will you let sack todd have some water asked pold presently  there is good water in the bucket answered dick  thats gone  then youll have to wait until later for more  todd has got to have water  at this announcement the boys looked questioningly at each other  it may be true said dick i shouldnt want the man to die just because we had refused him water  it may be a trick just to get the hatch open again put in dan baxter if i were you i wouldnt trust them i know that crowd better than you do  you can have water in the morning called down dick in the meantime you keep quiet and do what you can for todd if you dont keep quiet youll get the worst of it  wait till i get my hands on you came in the hoarse voice of sack todd ill pulverize you  hes a long way from being dead by his voice said dick i reckon he was playing off on us and this was largely true sack todds wound was painful but by no means serious  it must be confessed that the boys hardly knew how to proceed but presently dick remembered where he had seen some hooks and nails and he sent dan baxter for these when they were brought he calmly proceeded to fasten the extra hooks to the hatch and then hook them fast to the deck  what are you doing now yelled gasper pold and when he was told he muttered things i do not care to mention on these pages  now sam and tom you remain on guard here while the rest of us go and secure that door below said dick  it is secure said tom  yes i know but some extra cross bars wont do any harm  want me to help asked baxter  you can come along said dick not altogether willing to leave the former bully out of sight  he hurried to the door in question one leading from the back of the engine room into something of a storeroom the door was fastened by two ordinary bolts  ill soon fix that said the eldest rover dan you hold the lantern hans bring that piece of board here  the board was brought and dick began to nail it fast directly over the door he had still another nail to drive when there came an unexpected crash on the other side  all together yelled the voice of gasper pold now then with a will  another mighty crash followed and then a third with this the door flew from its hinges and over it came hurling hans flat on his back then dick found himself confronted by pold jeffers and sack todd each with a weapon ready for use    chapter xxix  an exciting time all around  weve got him down with him roared sack todd as he leaped over the fallen door and made a grab for dick  for the instant dick did not know what to do then he stepped backward and at the same time attempted to draw his pistol  no you dont yelled gasper pold and aimed a blow at dicks head with an iron bar he carried  had the blow landed as intended the eldest rover might have had his skull crushed in but as the iron bar was descending dan baxter made a quick jump to polds side gave him a shove and hurled him flat  stop it cried the former bully of putnam hall do you hear do you want to kill somebody  so youre against us eh yelled sack todd well well fix you  he tore a pistol from his pocket and started to aim it at baxter but the latter was now on the alert and whirling around he caught sack todd by the coat collar with one hand and with the other raised the pistol up into the air it went off but the bullet merely plowed its way into the woodwork of the ship  by this time hans had managed to scramble from beneath the fallen door the german youth had not been hurt very much but his dutch blood was up and throwing prudence to the wind he sailed in vigorously hitting pold a blow in the stomach with his fist and kicking the mate of the dogstar in the shin with his heavy shoe then he caught hold of polds iron bar and began to wrestle for its possession  you dink i vos noddings put a poy hey he snorted i show you aint it you pig loafer and he ran pold up against a partition and got the iron bar directly under the rascals throat so that the fellow was in danger of strangling  sid jeffers had now turned his attention to dick and blows were given and taken freely between the pair the noise made was considerable and this finally reached the ears of sam and tom  something is wrong cried tom ill go and see if you want me back whistle as loudly as you can and he was off like a shot  the sight that met toms gaze at first almost stupefied him he came upon sack todd and dan baxter fighting hand to hand in a passageway leading to the deck sack todd had fired one shot which had grazed dans left cheek but now the youth had the man against the wall and was banging his head against it again and again  you will shoot me eh cried baxter youre a villain if ever there was one sack todd i am bad enough but im not as dirty and black as you take that and that and that  hi let up youll smash my head roared the excounterfeiter but dan baxter paid no attention until one blow caused sack todd to lose consciousness and sink down in a heap  tom had already passed on and was in time to aid dick coming up to the side of sid jeffers he hit the mate of the dogstar a stinging blow in the ear and then another in the chin dick at the same time struck the rascal in the eye and jeffers staggered back tripped over the fallen door and landed heavily on the floor at once tom sat down on him pulling out his pistol as he did so  now keep quiet or something worse will happen he said and the mate of the dogstar understood and subsided  with the fall of sack todd dan baxter turned back to aid the others he saw sid jeffers go down and then ran toward hans  you might as well give up he said to gasper pold theyve got the best of your crowd  yes and you helped them said pold sullenly just wait ill fix you for this  the noise continuing sam had left his post and arrived on the scene he ran off for a rope and with this sack todd was bound hands and feet seeing this gasper pold and the mate of the dogstar retreated again into the engine room  put up that door cried dick and without delay it was raised and put in place and then fastened in such a manner that it was next to impossible to budge it then they ran on deck and fastened down the hatch after that they gave todd their attention  when he came to his senses the excounterfeiter raved wildly and demanded that he be set free he was particularly bitter against dan baxter  ill fix you he said wait till we get into court ill have a fine story to tell about you to this baxter did not reply although he turned very pale  seeing they could do little with sack todd the rovers decided to put him down in the hold with the sailors and this was done then the party with baxter gathered on deck to discuss the situation  talk about a strenuous night exclaimed tom i dont think it could be more strenuous than it has been  dan i want to say right now that you have helped us a great deal said dick turning to the big youth but for you we might have lost that battle  dot is so said hans you vos tone splendidly alretty  with two of the enemy in possession of the engine room it was of course impossible to run the machinery of the steam yacht and this being so our friends decided to wait until daylight before attempting to make another move  it is after three oclock said dick we may as well get what rest we can we can take turns at remaining on guard and so it was decided but it must be said that nobody got much sleep so great was the general excitement  while he was on guard dick had a long private talk with dan baxter and for once the former bully of putnam hall opened his heart completely he had been knocking around from pillar to post so long that he was utterly discouraged and scarcely cared what happened since his father had reformed and he had lost the companionship of lew flapp he had been traveling among strangers and not a one of them had proved worth knowing as he expressed it  i was a great big fool that i didnt turn over a new leaf when my father did he said i had a chance then to do something for myself now i am so deep in the mud i dont know how ill ever get out  i am certainly sorry for you danespecially after what you did for our crowd tonight if you really want to turn over a new leaf i am willing to help you all i can but you know how the law standswe cant let you go after what has happened in the past if you come up for trial though ill be as easy as i can on you and i know the others will be easy too perhaps as you are young youll get off with a light sentence and then youll have a chance to reform after that  at this dan baxter hung his head  its a terrible disgraceto go to prison he answered in a low tone but my father had to go through it and i guess i am worse than he is he heaved a deep sigh well ill try to stand it  if it gets as far as that when you come out dan you come straight to me and ill help you  will you do that dick asked the former bully eagerly and for the instant his face brightened  i will and there is my hand on it and then the two who had been enemies for so many years shook hands after that dan baxter continued to talk about himself he seemed anxious to unburden his heart and dick allowed him to proceed and listened with interest to the recital  as soon as it was daylight the rovers hans and baxter went on deck to decide upon the allimportant question of what to do next dick had inspected the sails and found them in trim for use and presently they set sail and once more the steam yacht was headed for tampa bay there was a stiff breeze blowing and although the craft made no such speed as when under steam she went along right well and they were all content  about the middle of the forenoon they heard a thumping on the hatch over the engine room pold and jeffers wanted something to eat and to drink and wanted to make terms but they told the rascals they would have to wait until land or some vessel was sighted they also got a call from sack todd and the sailors who had revived from their stupor but decided to let these fellows wait also  the sailors have done us no harm said dick but a waiting spell will do them good after such a beastly spree  it was one oclock and hans was preparing dinner for all on deck when tom gave a cry  a small steamer is approaching he said hadnt we better signal her  by all means answered dick let us steer directly for her too and this was done  the vessel approaching proved to be nothing more than a regular gulf tug carrying eight people as it came closer sam who had a spyglass gave a shout  what do you think there are fred and songbird and yes there is harold bird too oh how glad i am that they are safe    chapter xxx  homeward boundconclusion  the report was true the tug contained fred songbird and harold bird and as soon as these three made out who were on board of the mermaid they set up a cheer then the sails on the steam yacht were lowered and the tug came alongside in a minute more fred was scrambling on deck followed by the others  alive all of you cried fred oh this is the best news yet  and we are glad to see you alive too cried tom we were afraid the mascotte had been lost  well we came close to it said songbird and when we got in to port some of the passengers had the captain arrested for ill treatment but we didnt wait for that we were wild to know what had become of you and so we chartered this tug and began a hunt you were lucky to be picked up by such a nice craft as this  we werent picked upwe picked ourselves up answered dick  why what do you mean asked harold bird in puzzled tones  we found this steam yacht on the water desertednot a soul on board  you dont mean it ejaculated fred whats her name  the mermaid  creation shouted harold bird why thats the steam yacht was advertised in all the newspapers some weeks ago she was missing and the club that owns her offered a reward of five thousand dollars for information leading to her return  well we picked her up as a derelict said tom and well claim salvage accordingly but how did she disappear  its a long story she was left in charge of an old man and he went off and got intoxicated then a storm came up and they found the old man in a rowboat and the steam yacht missing she must have blown and drifted far away on the gulf but its queer she wasnt sighted before  maybe she was but nobody thought she was deserted said sam and his idea was probably true  thus far dan baxter had kept in the background when he came forward there was more astonishment and our friends had to tell about the arrival of sack todd and the others and of what had been done since  i want you to understand that dan helped us a great deal said dick to fred and songbird he isnt the fellow he was he has changed so you would hardly know he was the same person i think he is really on the right track at last  it seems too wonderful to be true was freds comment  dan baxter was much interested in meeting harold bird and while the others were talking in one part of the deck he called the young southerner to one side  mr bird you know who i am and i suppose you have no use for me began the former bully i am sorry i went in with those men who stole your gasoline launch if i had my choice again i shouldnt do such a thing i am very sorry and i am glad you got your boat back but i want to speak to you about something else i was going to write you a letter when i got the chance but id rather tell you what i know  what you know repeated harold bird somewhat puzzled  yes since i have been traveling with gasper pold and sack todd i have learned a great deal and much of it concerns yourself and your father  my father gasped the young southerner  yes  what do you know of him is he alive  i think he isat least gasper pold said he was  pold what does he know about it where is my father  as near as i know your father is in mexico at a place called troxapocca he is somewhat out of his mind and pold told sack todd he was working around a hotel there doing all sorts of odd jobs he goes by the name of bangswhy i dont know  is it possible i must look into this without delay  and then there is something else i want to tell you i heard todd and pold talking about it when they thought they were alone todd accused pold of having killed an old man a hunter in the woods because the old hunter had vowed to expose one of polds lottery swindles it came out in the talk that pold had really done the deed and had put the dead hunter on a rock where he was shot at by your father your father didnt hit the body but he thought he did and thinking he had killed this old man was what made your father crazy  i know it i know it cried harold bird what a vile deed to do and did pold admit his guilt  he did but he warned sack todd to keep quiet about it that was one of the things that turned me against that gang they were altogether too bad for me from that moment on i was sorry i had gone in with them  this fairly staggers me baxter youyou must help me prove thisafter i have found my father or before  i will mr birdill do all i can to make things right again answered dan baxter earnestly  when the others heard of dan baxters revelation they were almost as much astonished as harold bird they were glad to learn that there was now a likelihood of clearing the young southerners father of the crime of which he had been accused and all trusted he would soon be able to locate mr bird and nurse him back to mental and physical health  those on the tug were called on board and then sack todd was allowed to come on deck followered by the two sailors all were made prisoners then gasper pold and sid jeffers came up and were handcuffed  gasper pold was amazed to find himself confronted by harold bird and when accused of the shooting of the old hunter broke down utterly he thought sack todd had exposed him and a bitter war of words between the pair followed  you have done me a splendid service baxter said the young southerner after the excitement was over i shall not forget you when the proper time comes if you need legal aid ill see to it that you have a firstclass lawyer  thank you answered the former bully humbly i only did my duty which i should have done long ago  it was found that the mermaid belonged to persons living at mobile and accordingly the steam yacht and the tug were headed for that port the run did not take more than twentyfour hours and when the mermaid appeared she created considerable excitement one of the owners james morrison soon came to take charge in the name of the yacht club and he assured dick and the others that the club would pay anything that was fair for the return of the vessel  we have found one thing that bothered us said dick perhaps you can explain it in a locker we found a picture of harold bird and also a picture of his father  i know nothing of them i did not know mr bird at all  i will have harold show you his fathers photograph perhaps youll recognize him  the picture was shown and james morrison uttered a cry of astonishment  i know that man but his name was not bird it was bangs he worked on the yacht for awhilequeer sort of stickand he left rather suddenly  it was mr bird he went crazy over some personal trouble and harold has been looking all over for him he was last heard of in mexico but this clears up the mystery of the photographs dick added   and now let me add a few words more and then bring to a close this tale of the rover boys in southern waters  as soon as they arrived at mobile the rover boys sent telegrams to their folks at home and also to the ladies and girls at the bird plantation telling of the safety of the entire party  sack todd gasper pold sid jeffers and the two sailors were locked up nobody attempted to have dan baxter arrested nor did the former bully of putnam hall try to run away  i have made up my mind to take my medicine and i am going to do it he said almost stubbornly  what a change in him was toms comment the fellows at putnam hall wont believe it when we tell them  here is the whole thing in a nutshell said sam dan has found out that there is absolutely no happiness or satisfaction in being dishonest even when he had money he didnt enjoy ithe told me so himself he said there was many a day when he would have preferred being with the old crowd even without a cent in his pocket  as soon as he could harold bird set off for mexico a week later he sent dick rover a telegram stating that he had found his father and was taking him home it may be added here that cleared of the suspicion that had hung over his name mr bird speedily recovered from his insanity and became the prosperous planter he had been in years gone by  when sack todd gasper pold and sid jeffers were brought to trial dan baxter was a witness against each one for the shooting of the old hunter pold received a life sentence in prison and for their various misdeeds todd and the mate of the dogstar received ten and twenty years respectively solly jackson was also a witness against todd and pold and was not prosecuted  what are you going to do about dan baxter asked songbird of dick one day  i am going to do nothing answered dick firmly if you want to prosecute him you can do so  he expects to be placed on trial  well hell have to find somebody else to prosecute him  i shant do anything dick why he isnt the same chap he used to be hes as meek as any fellow i ever met  in the end nobody prosecuted dan baxter and he was allowed to go his own way the rovers talked the matter over and one day they sent for the former bully and asked him how much money he had on hand  ive got exactly two dollars and a quarter was the answer i am looking for work but i havent found anything yet and baxters face grew red and he hung his head  we have made up a purse for you dan said dick kindly those folks who owned the yacht gave us ten thousand dollars for bringing her in safely i have had a talk with our crowd and we are going to stake you for a fresh start  so speaking dick handed out a new pocketbook but dan baxter put his hands behind him  thank you very very much he said huskily but i dont want you toto give me a centnot a cent understand if you want to make me a loan well and good but i shant take it if its a gift  well well call it a loan then said tom who stood by  and you can pay up whenever you please added sam  dan baxter took the pocketbook and opened it  why ifs full of bills he gasped  yes a thousand dollars dan we want you to make a good start while you are at it explained dick  the face of the former bully became a study his eyes grew moist and his lips quivered he had to turn away for a moment for he could not control himself  youre the best fellows in the worldthe very best he murmured presently a thousand dollars and you were going to give it to menot loan it to me ill never forget that never if i live to be a hundred but i am not going to take all that moneyits too much of a temptation let me have a hundred as a loan and thats all  this he stuck to and in the end the hundred dollars was counted out and baxter placed it in his pocket  this will take me to philadelphia he said there i can get hold of some money that is rightfully mine and then ill return the loan after thatwell after that i am going far away to try to make a man of myself  we wish you luck dan answered dick gravely  indeed we do added sam and tom  there was an awkward silence then dan baxter pulled himself up hesitated and held out his hand  i dont know when well meet again he said goodby  goodby said each of the others and shook hands warmly  the former bully walked to the doorway and there hesitated again  please do me one favor he said his face growing red when you meet the stanhopes and the lanings tell them i am very sorry for what i did and that i wouldnt do it again for the whole world and tell captain putnam that too and then he went out closing the door softly behind him they listened to his footsteps and as they died away each heaved a deep sigh  i am sorry for him said dick  i pity him from the bottom of my heart came from sam  and so do i added tom poor chap i hope he does make a man of himself it was a long time before they saw dan baxter again  what to do with the houseboat they did not know but soon came a message from their uncle randolph stating they might sell the craft they found a ready purchaser at a fair price and then joined the stanhopes and the lanings at the bird plantation  oh how glad i am that you are safe cried dora to dick when they met it seems an age since you went away  so it doeswith so much happening answered the eldest of the rover boys  are we going home now asked sam  well have to answered tom we ought to be at our studies this minute  yes because you love study so cried nellie mischievously   two days later found them on a river steamer that was to take them up the mississippi as far as st louis where they were to take the limited express for new york  well i suppose our good times and our adventures are over now said sam but he was mistaken good times and strange adventures still awaited them and what some of these were will be told in the next volume of this series to be entitled the rover boys on the farm or last days at putnam hall  the whole party remained in st louis one day then they sped eastward on the limited and the following evening found them on their way to valley brook farm the stanhopes and lanings having decided to stop off there for at least a day or two  it will feel fine to get home again said sam as the train rolled into the oak run station hurrah here we are at last  and there are father aunt martha and uncle randolph to meet us exclaimed tom  hullo everybody called out dick and tumbled out of the train to kiss his aunt and shake hands all around home again and glad of it  and we are glad to see you all answered his father and then there was general rejoicing and here we will take our leave    the end
