16621840	the lady of the barge complete                                    by                                w w jacobs                                     1911     contents       the lady of the barge     the monkey’s paw     bill’s paper chase     the well     cupboard love     in the library     captain rogers     a tiger’s skin     a mixed proposal     an adulteration act     a golden venture     three at table     illustrations       you villain she said in a choking voice     what’s that cried the old woman     mrs driver fell back before the emerging form of mr bodfish     burleigh with a feeling of nausea drew back toward the door     gunn placed a hand which lacked two fingers on his breast     don’t you think major brill is somewhat hasty in his conclusions     he saw another tatterdemalion coming toward him     you say you’re a doctor     the second officer leaned forward     you get younger than ever mrs pullen     the lady of the barge   the master of the barge arabella sat in the stern of his craft with his right arm leaning on the tiller a desultory conversation with the mate of a schooner who was hanging over the side of his craft a few yards off had come to a conclusion owing to a difference of opinion on the subject of religion the skipper had argued so warmly that he almost fancied he must have inherited the tenets of the seventhday baptists from his mother while the mate had surprised himself by the warmth of his advocacy of a form of wesleyanism which would have made the members of that sect open their eyes with horror he had moreover confirmed the skipper in the error of his ways by calling him a bargee the ranks of the baptists receiving a defender if not a recruit from that hour  with the influence of the religious argument still upon him the skipper as the long summer’s day gave place to night fell to wondering where his own mate who was also his brotherinlaw had got to lights which had been struggling with the twilight now burnt bright and strong and the skipper moving from the shadow to where a band of light fell across the deck took out a worn silver watch and saw that it was ten o’clock  almost at the same moment a dark figure appeared on the jetty above and began to descend the ladder and a strongly built young man of twentytwo sprang nimbly to the deck  ten o’clock ted said the skipper slowly it ’ll be eleven in an hour’s time said the mate calmly  that ’ll do said the skipper in a somewhat loud voice as he noticed that his late adversary still occupied his favourite strained position and a fortuitous expression of his mother’s occurred to him don’t talk to me i’ve been arguing with a son of belial for the last halfhour  bargee said the son of belial in a dispassionate voice  don’t take no notice of him ted said the skipper pityingly  he wasn’t talking to me said ted but never mind about him i want to speak to you in private  fire away my lad said the other in a patronizing voice  speak up said the voice from the schooner encouragingly i’m listening  there was no reply from the bargee the master led the way to the cabin and lighting a lamp which appealed to more senses than one took a seat on a locker and again requested the other to fire away  well you see it’s this way began the mate with a preliminary wriggle there’s a certain young woman—  a certain young what shouted the master of the arabella  woman repeated the mate snappishly you’ve heard of a woman afore haven’t you well there’s a certain young woman i’m walking out with i—  walking out gasped the skipper why i never ’eard o’ such a thing  you would ha’ done if you’d been better looking p’raps retorted the other well i’ve offered this young woman to come for a trip with us  oh you have ’ave you said the skipper sharply and what do you think louisa will say to it  that’s your look out said louisa’s brother cheerfully i’ll make her up a bed for’ard and we’ll all be as happy as you please  he started suddenly the mate of the schooner was indulging in a series of whistles of the most amatory description  there she is he said i told her to wait outside  he ran upon deck and his perturbed brotherinlaw following at his leisure was just in time to see him descending the ladder with a young woman and a small handbag  this is my brotherinlaw cap’n gibbs said ted introducing the new arrival smartest man at a barge on the river  the girl extended a neatly gloved hand shook the skipper’s affably and looked wonderingly about her  it’s very close to the water ted she said dubiously  the skipper coughed we don’t take passengers as a rule he said awkwardly we ’ain’t got much convenience for them  never mind said the girl kindly i sha’nt expect too much  she turned away and following the mate down to the cabin went into ecstasies over the spacesaving contrivances she found there the drawers fitted in the skipper’s bunk were a source of particular interest and the owner watched with strong disapprobation through the skylight her efforts to make him an applepie bed with the limited means at her disposal he went down below at once as a wet blanket  i was just shaking your bed up a bit said miss harris reddening  i see you was said the skipper briefly  he tried to pluck up courage to tell her that he couldn’t take her but only succeeded in giving vent to an inhospitable cough  i’ll get the supper said the mate suddenly you sit down old man and talk to lucy  in honour of the visitor he spread a small cloth and then proceeded to produce cold beef pickles and accessories in a manner which reminded miss harris of white rabbits from a conjurer’s hat captain gibbs accepting the inevitable ate his supper in silence and left them to their glances  we must make you up a bed for’ard lucy said the mate when they had finished  miss harris started where’s that she inquired  other end o’ the boat replied the mate gathering up some bedding under his arm you might bring a lantern john  the skipper who was feeling more sociable after a couple of glasses of beer complied and accompanied the couple to the tiny forecastle a smell compounded of bilge tar paint and other healthy disinfectants emerged as the scuttle was pushed back the skipper dangled the lantern down and almost smiled  i can’t sleep there said the girl with decision i shall die o’ fright  you’ll get used to it said ted encouragingly as he helped her down it’s quite dry and comfortable  he put his arm round her waist and squeezed her hand and aided by this moral support miss harris not only consented to remain but found various advantages in the forecastle over the cabin which had escaped the notice of previous voyagers  i’ll leave you the lantern said the mate making it fast and we shall be on deck most o’ the night we get under way at two  he quitted the forecastle followed by the skipper after a polite but futile attempt to give him precedence and made his way to the cabin for two or three hours’ sleep  there’ll be a row at the other end ted said the skipper nervously as he got into his bunk louisa’s sure to blame me for letting you keep company with a gal like this we was talking about you only the other day and she said if you was married five years from now it ’ud be quite soon enough  let loo mind her own business said the mate sharply she’s not going to nag me she’s not my wife thank goodness  he turned over and fell fast asleep waking up fresh and bright three hours later to commence what he fondly thought would be the pleasantest voyage of his life  the arabella dropped slowly down with the tide the wind being so light that she was becalmed by every tall warehouse on the way off greenwich however the breeze freshened somewhat and a little later miss harris looking somewhat pale as to complexion and untidy as to hair came slowly on deck  where’s the lookingglass she asked as ted hastened to greet her how does my hair look  all wavy said the infatuated young man all little curls and squiggles come down in the cabin there’s a glass there  miss harris with a light nod to the skipper as he sat at the tiller followed the mate below and giving vent to a little cry of indignation as she saw herself in the glass waved the amorous ted on deck and started work on her disarranged hair  at breakfasttime a little friction was caused by what the mate bitterly termed the narrowminded oldfashioned ways of the skipper he had arranged that the skipper should steer while he and miss harris breakfasted but the coffee was no sooner on the table than the skipper called him and relinquishing the helm in his favour went below to do the honours the mate protested  it’s not proper said the skipper me and ’er will ’ave our meals together and then you must have yours she’s under my care  miss harris assented blithely and talk and laughter greeted the ears of the indignant mate as he steered he went down at last to cold coffee and lukewarm herrings returning to the deck after a hurried meal to find the skipper narrating some of his choicest experiences to an audience which hung on his lightest word  the disregard they showed for his feelings was maddening and for the first time in his life he became a prey to jealousy in its worst form it was quite clear to him that the girl had become desperately enamoured of the skipper and he racked his brain in a wild effort to discover the reason  with an idea of reminding his brotherinlaw of his position he alluded two or three times in a casual fashion to his wife the skipper hardly listened to him and patting miss harris’s cheek in a fatherly manner regaled her with an anecdote of the mate’s boyhood which the latter had spent a goodly portion of his life in denying he denied it again hotly and miss harris conquering for a time her laughter reprimanded him severely for contradicting  by the time dinner was ready he was in a state of sullen apathy and when the meal was over and the couple came on deck again so far forgot himself as to compliment miss harris upon her appetite  i’m ashamed of you ted said the skipper with severity  i’m glad you know what shame is retorted the mate  if you can’t be’ave yourself you’d better keep a bit for’ard till you get in a better temper continued the skipper  i’ll be pleased to said the smarting mate i wish the barge was longer  it couldn’t be too long for me said miss harris tossing her head  be’aving like a schoolboy murmured the skipper  i know how to behave myself said the mate as he disappeared below his head suddenly appeared again over the companion if some people don’t he added and disappeared again  he was pleased to notice as he ate his dinner that the giddy prattle above had ceased and with his back turned toward the couple when he appeared on deck again he lounged slowly forward until the skipper called him back again  wot was them words you said just now ted he inquired  the mate repeated them with gusto  very good said the skipper sharply very good  don’t you ever speak to me again said miss harris with a stately air because i won’t answer you if you do  the mate displayed more of his schoolboy nature wait till you’re spoken to he said rudely this is your gratefulness i suppose  gratefulness said miss harris with her chin in the air what for  for bringing you for a trip replied the mate sternly  you bringing me for a trip said miss harris scornfully captain gibbs is the master here i suppose he is giving me the trip you’re only the mate  just so said the mate with a grin at his brotherinlaw which made that worthy shift uneasily i wonder what loo will say when she sees you with a lady aboard  she came to please you said captain gibbs with haste  ho she did did she jeered the mate prove it only don’t look to me to back you that’s all  the other eyed him in consternation and his manner changed  don’t play the fool ted he said not unkindly you know what loo is  well i’m reckoning on that said the mate deliberately i’m going for’ard don’t let me interrupt you two so long  he went slowly forward and lighting his pipe sprawled carelessly on the deck and renounced the entire sex forthwith at teatime the skipper attempted to reverse the procedure at the other meals but as miss harris steadfastly declined to sit at the same table as the mate his good intentions came to naught  he made an appeal to what he termed the mate’s better nature after miss harris had retired to the seclusion of her bedchamber but in vain  she’s nothing to do with me declared the mate majestically i wash my hands of her she’s a flirt i’m like louisa i can’t bear flirts  the skipper said no more but his face was so worn that miss harris when she came on deck in the early morning and found the barge gliding gently between the grassy banks of a river attributed it to the difficulty of navigating so large a craft on so small and winding a stream  we shall be alongside in ’arf an hour said the skipper eyeing her  miss harris expressed her gratification  p’raps you wouldn’t mind going down the fo’c’sle and staying there till we’ve made fast said the other i’d take it as a favour my owners don’t like me to carry passengers  miss harris who understood perfectly said certainly and with a cold stare at the mate who was at no pains to conceal his amusement went below at once thoughtfully closing the scuttle after her  there’s no call to make mischief ted said the skipper somewhat anxiously as they swept round the last bend and came into view of coalsham  the mate said nothing but stood by to take in sail as they ran swiftly toward the little quay the pace slackened and the arabella as though conscious of the contraband in her forecastle crept slowly to where a stout middleaged woman who bore a strong likeness to the mate stood upon the quay  there’s poor loo said the mate with a sigh  the skipper made no reply to this infernal insinuation the barge ran alongside the quay and made fast  i thought you’d be up said mrs gibbs to her husband now come along to breakfast ted ’ll follow on  captain gibbs dived down below for his coat and slipping ashore thankfully prepared to move off with his wife  come on as soon as you can ted said the latter why what on earth is he making that face for  she turned in amazement as her brother making a pretence of catching her husband’s eye screwed his face up into a note of interrogation and gave a slight jerk with his thumb  come along said captain gibbs taking her arm with much affection  but what’s ted looking like that for demanded his wife as she easily intercepted another choice facial expression of the mate’s  oh it’s his fun replied her husband walking on  fun repeated mrs gibbs sharply what’s the matter ted  nothing replied the mate  touch o’ toothache said the skipper come along loo i can just do with one o’ your breakfasts  mrs gibbs suffered herself to be led on and had got at least five yards on the way home when she turned and looked back the mate had still got the toothache and was at that moment in all the agonies of a phenomenal twinge  there’s something wrong here said mrs gibbs as she retraced her steps ted what are you making that face for  it’s my own face said the mate evasively  mrs gibbs conceded the point and added bitterly that it couldn’t be helped all the same she wanted to know what he meant by it  ask john said the vindictive mate  mrs gibbs asked her husband said he didn’t know and added that ted had been like it before but he had not told her for fear of frightening her then he tried to induce her to go with him to the chemist’s to get something for it  mrs gibbs shook her head firmly and boarding the barge took a seat on the hatch and proceeded to catechise her brother as to his symptoms he denied that there was anything the matter with him while his eyes openly sought those of captain gibbs as though asking for instruction  you come home ted she said at length  i can’t said the mate i can’t leave the ship  why not demanded his sister  ask john said the mate again  at this mrs gibbs’s temper which had been rising gave way altogether and she stamped fiercely upon the deck a stamp of the foot has been for all time a roughandready means of signalling the forescuttle was drawn back and the face of a young and pretty girl appeared framed in the opening the mate raised his eyebrows with a helpless gesture and as for the unfortunate skipper any jury would have found him guilty without leaving the box the wife of his bosom with a flaming visage turned and regarded him  illustration you villain she said in a choking voice  you villain she said in a choking voice  captain gibbs caught his breath and looked appealingly at the mate  it’s a little surprise for you my dear he faltered it’s ted’s young lady  nothing of the kind said the mate sharply  it’s not how dare you say such a thing demanded miss harris stepping on to the deck  well you brought her aboard ted you know you did pleaded the unhappy skipper  the mate did not deny it but his face was so full of grief and surprise that the other’s heart sank within him  all right said the mate at last have it your own way  hold your tongue ted shouted mrs gibbs you’re trying to shield him  i tell you ted brought her aboard and they had a lover’s quarrel said her unhappy spouse it’s nothing to do with me at all  and that’s why you told me ted had got the toothache and tried to get me off to the chemist’s i s’pose retorted his wife with virulence do you think i’m a fool how dare you ask a young woman on this barge how dare you  i didn’t ask her said her husband  i s’pose she came without being asked sneered his wife turning her regards to the passenger she looks the sort that might you brazenfaced girl  here go easy loo interrupted the mate flushing as he saw the girl’s pale face  mind your own business said his sister violently  it is my business said the repentant mate i brought her aboard and then we quarrelled  i’ve no doubt said his sister bitterly it’s very pretty but it won’t do  i swear it’s the truth said the mate  why did john keep it so quiet and hide her for then demanded his sister  i came down for the trip said miss harris that is all about it there is nothing to make a fuss about how much is it captain gibbs  she produced a little purse from her pocket but before the embarrassed skipper could reply his infuriated wife struck it out of her hand the mate sprang instinctively forward but too late and the purse fell with a splash into the water the girl gave a faint cry and clasped her hands  how am i to get back she gasped  i’ll see to that lucy said the mate i’m very sorry—i’ve been a brute  you said the indignant girl i would sooner drown myself than be beholden to you  i’m very sorry repeated the mate humbly  there’s enough of this playacting interposed mrs gibbs get off this barge  you stay where you are said the mate authoritatively  send that girl off this barge screamed mrs gibbs to her husband  captain gibbs smiled in a silly fashion and scratched his head where is she to go he asked feebly  wh’at does it matter to you where she goes cried his wife fiercely send her off  the girl eyed her haughtily and repulsing the mate as he strove to detain her stepped to the side then she paused as he suddenly threw off his coat and sitting down on the hatch hastily removed his boots the skipper divining his intentions seized him by the arm  don’t be a fool ted he gasped you’ll get under the barge  the mate shook him off and went in with a splash which half drowned his adviser miss harris clasping her hands ran to the side and gazed fearfully at the spot where he had disappeared while his sister in a terrible voice seized the opportunity to point out to her husband the probably fatal results of his illdoing there was an anxious interval and then the mate’s head appeared above the water and after a breathingspace disappeared again the skipper watching uneasily stood by with a lifebelt  come out ted screamed his sister as he came up for breath again  the mate disappeared once more but coming up for the third time hung on to the side of the barge to recover a bit a clothed man in the water savours of disaster and looks alarming miss harris began to cry  you’ll be drowned she whimpered  come out said mrs gibbs in a raspy voice she knelt on the deck and twined her fingers in his hair the mate addressed her in terms rendered brotherly by pain  never mind about the purse sobbed miss harris it doesn’t matter  will you make it up if i come out then demanded the diver  no i’ll never speak to you again as long as i live said the girl passionately  the mate disappeared again this time he was out of sight longer than usual and when he came up merely tossed his arms weakly and went down again there was a scream from the women and a mighty splash as the skipper went overboard with a lifebelt the mate’s head black and shining showed for a moment the skipper grabbed him by the hair and towed him to the barge’s side and in the midst of a considerable hubbub both men were drawn from the water  the skipper shook himself like a dog but the mate lay on the deck inert in a puddle of water mrs gibbs frantically slapped his hands and miss harris bending over him rendered first aid by kissing him wildly  captain gibbs pushed her away he won’t come round while you’re akissing of him he cried roughly  to his indignant surprise the drowned man opened one eye and winked acquiescence the skipper dropped his arms by his side and stared at him stupidly  i saw his eyelid twitch cried mrs gibbs joyfully  he’s all right said her indignant husband ’e ain’t born to be drowned ’e ain’t i’ve spoilt a good suit of clothes for nothing  to his wife’s amazement he actually walked away from the insensible man and with a boathook reached for his hat which was floating by mrs gibbs still gazing in blank astonishment caught a seraphic smile on the face of her brother as miss harris continued her ministrations and in a pardonable fit of temper the overwrought woman gave him a box on the ear which brought him round at once  where am i he inquired artlessly  mrs gibbs told him she also told him her opinion of him and without plagiarizing her husband’s words came to the same conclusion as to his ultimate fate  you come along home with me she said turning in a friendly fashion to the bewildered girl they deserve what they’ve got—both of ’em i only hope that they’ll both get such awful colds that they won’t find their voices for a twelvemonth  she took the girl by the arm and helped her ashore they turned their heads once in the direction of the barge and saw the justly incensed skipper keeping the mate’s explanations and apologies at bay with a boathook then they went in to breakfast     the monkey’s paw   i  without the night was cold and wet but in the small parlour of laburnam villa the blinds were drawn and the fire burned brightly father and son were at chess the former who possessed ideas about the game involving radical changes putting his king into such sharp and unnecessary perils that it even provoked comment from the whitehaired old lady knitting placidly by the fire  hark at the wind said mr white who having seen a fatal mistake after it was too late was amiably desirous of preventing his son from seeing it  i’m listening said the latter grimly surveying the board as he stretched out his hand check  i should hardly think that he’d come tonight said his father with his hand poised over the board  mate replied the son  that’s the worst of living so far out bawled mr white with sudden and unlookedfor violence of all the beastly slushy outoftheway places to live in this is the worst pathway’s a bog and the road’s a torrent i don’t know what people are thinking about i suppose because only two houses in the road are let they think it doesn’t matter  never mind dear said his wife soothingly perhaps you’ll win the next one  mr white looked up sharply just in time to intercept a knowing glance between mother and son the words died away on his lips and he hid a guilty grin in his thin grey beard  there he is said herbert white as the gate banged to loudly and heavy footsteps came toward the door  the old man rose with hospitable haste and opening the door was heard condoling with the new arrival the new arrival also condoled with himself so that mrs white said tut tut and coughed gently as her husband entered the room followed by a tall burly man beady of eye and rubicund of visage  sergeantmajor morris he said introducing him  the sergeantmajor shook hands and taking the proffered seat by the fire watched contentedly while his host got out whiskey and tumblers and stood a small copper kettle on the fire  at the third glass his eyes got brighter and he began to talk the little family circle regarding with eager interest this visitor from distant parts as he squared his broad shoulders in the chair and spoke of wild scenes and doughty deeds of wars and plagues and strange peoples  twentyone years of it said mr white nodding at his wife and son when he went away he was a slip of a youth in the warehouse now look at him  he don’t look to have taken much harm said mrs white politely  i’d like to go to india myself said the old man just to look round a bit you know  better where you are said the sergeantmajor shaking his head he put down the empty glass and sighing softly shook it again  i should like to see those old temples and fakirs and jugglers said the old man what was that you started telling me the other day about a monkey’s paw or something morris  nothing said the soldier hastily leastways nothing worth hearing  monkey’s paw said mrs white curiously  well it’s just a bit of what you might call magic perhaps said the sergeantmajor offhandedly  his three listeners leaned forward eagerly the visitor absentmindedly put his empty glass to his lips and then set it down again his host filled it for him  to look at said the sergeantmajor fumbling in his pocket it’s just an ordinary little paw dried to a mummy  he took something out of his pocket and proffered it mrs white drew back with a grimace but her son taking it examined it curiously  and what is there special about it inquired mr white as he took it from his son and having examined it placed it upon the table  it had a spell put on it by an old fakir said the sergeantmajor a very holy man he wanted to show that fate ruled people’s lives and that those who interfered with it did so to their sorrow he put a spell on it so that three separate men could each have three wishes from it  his manner was so impressive that his hearers were conscious that their light laughter jarred somewhat  well why don’t you have three sir said herbert white cleverly  the soldier regarded him in the way that middle age is wont to regard presumptuous youth i have he said quietly and his blotchy face whitened  and did you really have the three wishes granted asked mrs white  i did said the sergeantmajor and his glass tapped against his strong teeth  and has anybody else wished persisted the old lady  the first man had his three wishes yes was the reply i don’t know what the first two were but the third was for death that’s how i got the paw  his tones were so grave that a hush fell upon the group  if you’ve had your three wishes it’s no good to you now then morris said the old man at last what do you keep it for  the soldier shook his head fancy i suppose he said slowly i did have some idea of selling it but i don’t think i will it has caused enough mischief already besides people won’t buy they think it’s a fairy tale some of them and those who do think anything of it want to try it first and pay me afterward  if you could have another three wishes said the old man eyeing him keenly would you have them  i don’t know said the other i don’t know  he took the paw and dangling it between his forefinger and thumb suddenly threw it upon the fire white with a slight cry stooped down and snatched it off  better let it burn said the soldier solemnly  if you don’t want it morris said the other give it to me  i won’t said his friend doggedly i threw it on the fire if you keep it don’t blame me for what happens pitch it on the fire again like a sensible man  the other shook his head and examined his new possession closely how do you do it he inquired  hold it up in your right hand and wish aloud said the sergeantmajor but i warn you of the consequences  sounds like the arabian nights said mrs white as she rose and began to set the supper don’t you think you might wish for four pairs of hands for me  her husband drew the talisman from pocket and then all three burst into laughter as the sergeantmajor with a look of alarm on his face caught him by the arm  if you must wish he said gruffly wish for something sensible  mr white dropped it back in his pocket and placing chairs motioned his friend to the table in the business of supper the talisman was partly forgotten and afterward the three sat listening in an enthralled fashion to a second instalment of the soldier’s adventures in india  if the tale about the monkey’s paw is not more truthful than those he has been telling us said herbert as the door closed behind their guest just in time for him to catch the last train we sha’nt make much out of it  did you give him anything for it father inquired mrs white regarding her husband closely  a trifle said he colouring slightly he didn’t want it but i made him take it and he pressed me again to throw it away  likely said herbert with pretended horror why we’re going to be rich and famous and happy wish to be an emperor father to begin with then you can’t be henpecked  he darted round the table pursued by the maligned mrs white armed with an antimacassar  mr white took the paw from his pocket and eyed it dubiously i don’t know what to wish for and that’s a fact he said slowly it seems to me i’ve got all i want  if you only cleared the house you’d be quite happy wouldn’t you said herbert with his hand on his shoulder well wish for two hundred pounds then that ’ll just do it  his father smiling shamefacedly at his own credulity held up the talisman as his son with a solemn face somewhat marred by a wink at his mother sat down at the piano and struck a few impressive chords  i wish for two hundred pounds said the old man distinctly  a fine crash from the piano greeted the words interrupted by a shuddering cry from the old man his wife and son ran toward him  it moved he cried with a glance of disgust at the object as it lay on the floor  as i wished it twisted in my hand like a snake  well i don’t see the money said his son as he picked it up and placed it on the table and i bet i never shall  it must have been your fancy father said his wife regarding him anxiously  he shook his head never mind though there’s no harm done but it gave me a shock all the same  they sat down by the fire again while the two men finished their pipes outside the wind was higher than ever and the old man started nervously at the sound of a door banging upstairs a silence unusual and depressing settled upon all three which lasted until the old couple rose to retire for the night  i expect you’ll find the cash tied up in a big bag in the middle of your bed said herbert as he bade them goodnight and something horrible squatting up on top of the wardrobe watching you as you pocket your illgotten gains  he sat alone in the darkness gazing at the dying fire and seeing faces in it the last face was so horrible and so simian that he gazed at it in amazement’ it got so vivid that with a little uneasy laugh he felt on the table for a glass containing a little water to throw over it his hand grasped the monkey’s paw and with a little shiver he wiped his hand on his coat and went up to bed  ii  in the brightness of the wintry sun next morning as it streamed over the breakfast table he laughed at his fears there was an air of prosaic wholesomeness about the room which it had lacked on the previous night and the dirty shrivelled little paw was pitched on the sideboard with a carelessness which betokened no great belief in its virtues  i suppose all old soldiers are the same said mrs white the idea of our listening to such nonsense how could wishes be granted in these days and if they could how could two hundred pounds hurt you father  might drop on his head from the sky said the frivolous herbert  morris said the things happened so naturally said’ his father that you might if you so wished attribute it to coincidence  well don’t break into the money before i come back said herbert as he rose from the table i’m afraid it’ll turn you into a mean avaricious man and we shall have to disown you  his mother laughed and following him to the door watched him down the road and returning to the breakfast table was very happy at the expense of her husband’s credulity all of which did not prevent her from scurrying to the door at the postman’s knock nor prevent her from referring somewhat shortly to retired sergeantmajors of bibulous habits when she found that the post brought a tailor’s bill  herbert will have some more of his funny remarks i expect when he comes home she said as they sat at dinner  i dare say said mr white pouring himself out some beer but for all that the thing moved in my hand that i’ll swear to  you thought it did said the old lady soothingly  i say it did replied the other there was no thought about it i had just— what’s the matter  his wife made no reply she was watching the mysterious movements of a man outside who peering in an undecided fashion at the house appeared to be trying to make up his mind to enter in mental connection with the two hundred pounds she noticed that the stranger was well dressed and wore a silk hat of glossy newness three times he paused at the gate and then walked on again the fourth time he stood with his hand upon it and then with sudden resolution flung it open and walked up the path mrs white at the same moment placed her hands behind her and hurriedly unfastening the strings of her apron put that useful article of apparel beneath the cushion of her chair  she brought the stranger who seemed ill at ease into the room he gazed at her furtively and listened in a preoccupied fashion as the old lady apologized for the appearance of the room and her husband’s coat a garment which he usually reserved for the garden she then waited as patiently as her sex would permit for him to broach his business but he was at first strangely silent  i—was asked to call he said at last and stooped and picked a piece of cotton from his trousers i come from ’maw and meggins’  the old lady started is anything the matter she asked breathlessly has anything happened to herbert what is it what is it  her husband interposed there there mother he said hastily sit down and don’t jump to conclusions you’ve not brought bad news i’m sure sir and he eyed the other wistfully  i’m sorry— began the visitor  is he hurt demanded the mother wildly  the visitor bowed in assent badly hurt he said quietly but he is not in any pain  oh thank god said the old woman clasping her hands thank god for that thank—  she broke off suddenly as the sinister meaning of the assurance dawned upon her and she saw the awful confirmation of her fears in the other’s perverted face she caught her breath and turning to her slowerwitted husband laid her trembling old hand upon his there was a long silence  he was caught in the machinery said the visitor at length in a low voice  caught in the machinery repeated mr white in a dazed fashion yes  he sat staring blankly out at the window and taking his wife’s hand between his own pressed it as he had been wont to do in their old courtingdays nearly forty years before  he was the only one left to us he said turning gently to the visitor it is hard  the other coughed and rising walked slowly to the window the firm wished me to convey their sincere sympathy with you in your great loss he said without looking round i beg that you will understand i am only their servant and merely obeying orders  there was no reply the old woman’s face was white her eyes staring and her breath inaudible on the husband’s face was a look such as his friend the sergeant might have carried into his first action  i was to say that maw and meggins disclaim all responsibility continued the other they admit no liability at all but in consideration of your son’s services they wish to present you with a certain sum as compensation  mr white dropped his wife’s hand and rising to his feet gazed with a look of horror at his visitor his dry lips shaped the words how much  two hundred pounds was the answer  unconscious of his wife’s shriek the old man smiled faintly put out his hands like a sightless man and dropped a senseless heap to the floor  iii  in the huge new cemetery some two miles distant the old people buried their dead and came back to a house steeped in shadow and silence it was all over so quickly that at first they could hardly realize it and remained in a state of expectation as though of something else to happen —something else which was to lighten this load too heavy for old hearts to bear  but the days passed and expectation gave place to resignation—the hopeless resignation of the old sometimes miscalled apathy sometimes they hardly exchanged a word for now they had nothing to talk about and their days were long to weariness  it was about a week after that the old man waking suddenly in the night stretched out his hand and found himself alone the room was in darkness and the sound of subdued weeping came from the window he raised himself in bed and listened  come back he said tenderly you will be cold  it is colder for my son said the old woman and wept afresh  the sound of her sobs died away on his ears the bed was warm and his eyes heavy with sleep he dozed fitfully and then slept until a sudden wild cry from his wife awoke him with a start  the paw she cried wildly the monkey’s paw  he started up in alarm where where is it what’s the matter  she came stumbling across the room toward him i want it she said quietly you’ve not destroyed it  it’s in the parlour on the bracket he replied marvelling why  she cried and laughed together and bending over kissed his cheek  i only just thought of it she said hysterically why didn’t i think of it before why didn’t you think of it  think of what he questioned  the other two wishes she replied rapidly  we’ve only had one  was not that enough he demanded fiercely  no she cried triumphantly we’ll have one more go down and get it quickly and wish our boy alive again  the man sat up in bed and flung the bedclothes from his quaking limbs good god you are mad he cried aghast  get it she panted get it quickly and wish—oh my boy my boy  her husband struck a match and lit the candle get back to bed he said unsteadily you don’t know what you are saying  we had the first wish granted said the old woman feverishly why not the second  a coincidence stammered the old man  go and get it and wish cried his wife quivering with excitement  the old man turned and regarded her and his voice shook he has been dead ten days and besides he—i would not tell you else but—i could only recognize him by his clothing if he was too terrible for you to see then how now  bring him back cried the old woman and dragged him toward the door do you think i fear the child i have nursed  he went down in the darkness and felt his way to the parlour and then to the mantelpiece the talisman was in its place and a horrible fear that the unspoken wish might bring his mutilated son before him ere he could escape from the room seized upon him and he caught his breath as he found that he had lost the direction of the door his brow cold with sweat he felt his way round the table and groped along the wall until he found himself in the small passage with the unwholesome thing in his hand  even his wife’s face seemed changed as he entered the room it was white and expectant and to his fears seemed to have an unnatural look upon it he was afraid of her  wish she cried in a strong voice  it is foolish and wicked he faltered  wish repeated his wife  he raised his hand i wish my son alive again  the talisman fell to the floor and he regarded it fearfully then he sank trembling into a chair as the old woman with burning eyes walked to the window and raised the blind  he sat until he was chilled with the cold glancing occasionally at the figure of the old woman peering through the window the candleend which had burned below the rim of the china candlestick was throwing pulsating shadows on the ceiling and walls until with a flicker larger than the rest it expired the old man with an unspeakable sense of relief at the failure of the talisman crept back to his bed and a minute or two afterward the old woman came silently and apathetically beside him  neither spoke but lay silently listening to the ticking of the clock a stair creaked and a squeaky mouse scurried noisily through the wall the darkness was oppressive and after lying for some time screwing up his courage he took the box of matches and striking one went downstairs for a candle  at the foot of the stairs the match went out and he paused to strike another and at the same moment a knock so quiet and stealthy as to be scarcely audible sounded on the front door  the matches fell from his hand and spilled in the passage he stood motionless his breath suspended until the knock was repeated then he turned and fled swiftly back to his room and closed the door behind him a third knock sounded through the house  illustration what’s that cried the old woman  what’s that cried the old woman starting up  a rat said the old man in shaking tones—a rat it passed me on the stairs  his wife sat up in bed listening a loud knock resounded through the house  it’s herbert she screamed it’s herbert  she ran to the door but her husband was before her and catching her by the arm held her tightly  what are you going to do he whispered hoarsely  it’s my boy it’s herbert she cried struggling mechanically i forgot it was two miles away what are you holding me for let go i must open the door  for god’s sake don’t let it in cried the old man trembling  you’re afraid of your own son she cried struggling let me go i’m coming herbert i’m coming  there was another knock and another the old woman with a sudden wrench broke free and ran from the room her husband followed to the landing and called after her appealingly as she hurried downstairs he heard the chain rattle back and the bottom bolt drawn slowly and stiffly from the socket then the old woman’s voice strained and panting  the bolt she cried loudly come down i can’t reach it  but her husband was on his hands and knees groping wildly on the floor in search of the paw if he could only find it before the thing outside got in a perfect fusillade of knocks reverberated through the house and he heard the scraping of a chair as his wife put it down in the passage against the door he heard the creaking of the bolt as it came slowly back and at the same moment he found the monkey’s paw and frantically breathed his third and last wish  the knocking ceased suddenly although the echoes of it were still in the house he heard the chair drawn back and the door opened a cold wind rushed up the staircase and a long loud wail of disappointment and misery from his wife gave him courage to run down to her side and then to the gate beyond the street lamp flickering opposite shone on a quiet and deserted road     bill’s paper chase   sailormen ’ave their faults said the night watchman frankly i’m not denying of it i used to ’ave myself when i was at sea but being close with their money is a fault as can seldom be brought ag’in ’em  i saved some money once—two golden sovereigns owing to a ’ole in my pocket before i got another ship i slept two nights on a doorstep and ’ad nothing to eat and i found them two sovereigns in the lining o’ my coat when i was over two thousand miles away from the nearest pub  i on’y knew one miser all the years i was at sea thomas geary ’is name was and we was shipmates aboard the barque grenada homeward bound from sydney to london  thomas was a man that was getting into years sixty i think ’e was and old enough to know better ’e’d been saving ’ard for over forty years and as near as we could make out ’e was worth a matter o’ six ’undered pounds he used to be fond o’ talking about it and letting us know how much better off ’e was than any of the rest of us  we was about a month out from sydney when old thomas took sick bill hicks said that it was owing to a ha’penny he couldn’t account for but walter jones whose family was always ill and thought ’e knew a lot about it said that ’e knew wot it was but ’e couldn’t remember the name of it and that when we got to london and thomas saw a doctor we should see as ’ow ’e was right  whatever it was the old man got worse and worse the skipper came down and gave ’im some physic and looked at ’is tongue and then ’e looked at our tongues to see wot the difference was then ’e left the cook in charge of ’im and went off  the next day thomas was worse and it was soon clear to everybody but ’im that ’e was slipping ’is cable he wouldn’t believe it at first though the cook told ’im bill hicks told him and walter jones ’ad a grandfather that went off in just the same way  i’m not going to die says thomas how can i die and leave all that money  it’ll be good for your relations thomas says walter jones  i ain’t got any says the old man  well your friends then thomas says walter softlike  ain’t got any says the old man ag’in  yes you ’ave thomas says walter with a kind smile i could tell you one you’ve got  thomas shut his eyes at ’im and began to talk pitiful about ’is money and the ’ard work ’e’d ’ad saving of it and byandby ’e got worse and didn’t reckernise us but thought we was a pack o’ greedy drunken sailormen he thought walter jones was a shark and told ’im so and try all ’e could walter couldn’t persuade ’im different  he died the day arter in the morning ’e was whimpering about ’is money ag’in and angry with bill when ’e reminded ’im that ’e couldn’t take it with ’im and ’e made bill promise that ’e should be buried just as ’e was bill tucked him up arter that and when ’e felt a canvas belt tied round the old man’s waist ’e began to see wot ’e was driving at  the weather was dirty that day and there was a bit o’ sea running consequently all ’ands was on deck and a boy about sixteen wot used to ’elp the steward down aft was lookin’ arter thomas me and bill just run down to give a look at the old man in time  i am going to take it with me bill says the old man  that’s right says bill  my mind’s—easy now says thomas i gave it to jimmy—to—to—throw overboard for me  wot says bill staring  that’s right bill says the boy he told me to it was a little packet o’ banknotes he gave me tuppence for doing it  old thomas seemed to be listening ’is eyes was open and ’e looked artful at bill to think what a clever thing ’e’d done  nobody’s goin’to spendmy money ’e says nobody’s  we drew back from ’is bunk and stood staring at ’im then bill turned to the boy  go and tell the skipper ’e’s gone ’e says and mind for your own sake don’t tell the skipper or anybody else that you’ve thrown all that money overboard  why not says jimmy  becos you’ll be locked up for it says bill you’d no business to do it you’ve been and broke the law it ought to ha’ been left to somebody  jimmy looked scared and arter ’e was gone i turned to bill and i looks at ’im and i says what’s the little game bill  game said bill snorting at me i don’t want the pore boy to get into trouble do i pore little chap you was young yourself once  yes i says but i’m a bit older now bill and unless you tell me what your little game is i shall tell the skipper myself and the chaps too pore old thomas told ’im to do it so where’s the boy to blame  do you think jimmy did says bill screwing up his nose at me that little varmint is walking about worth six ’undered quid now you keep your mouth shut and i’ll make it worth your while  then i see bill’s game all right i’ll keep quiet for the sake of my half i says looking at ’im  i thought he’d ha’ choked and the langwidge ’e see fit to use was a’most as much as i could answer  very well then ’e says at last halves it is it ain’t robbery becos it belongs to nobody and it ain’t the boy’s becos ’e was told to throw it overboard  they buried pore old thomas next morning and arter it was all over bill put ’is ’and on the boy’s shoulder as they walked for’ard and ’e says poor old thomas ’as gone to look for ’is money he says wonder whether ’e’ll find it was it a big bundle jimmy  no says the boy shaking ’is ’ead they was six ’undered pound notes and two sovereigns and i wrapped the sovereigns up in the notes to make ’em sink fancy throwing money away like that bill seems a sin don’t it  bill didn’t answer ’im and that afternoon the other chaps below being asleep we searched ’is bunk through and through without any luck and at last bill sat down and swore ’e must ha’ got it about ’im  we waited till night and when everybody was snoring ’ard we went over to the boy’s bunk and went all through ’is pockets and felt the linings and then we went back to our side and bill said wot ’e thought about jimmy in whispers  he must ha’ got it tied round ’is waist next to ’is skin like thomas ’ad i says  we stood there in the dark whispering and then bill couldn’t stand it any longer and ’e went over on tiptoe to the bunk ag’in he was tremblin’ with excitement and i wasn’t much better when all of a sudden the cook sat up in ’is bunk with a dreadful laughing scream and called out that somebody was ticklin’ ’im  i got into my bunk and bill got into ’is and we lay there listening while the cook who was a terrible ticklish man leaned out of ’is bunk and said wot ’e’d do if it ’appened ag’in  go to sleep says walter jones you’re dreamin’ who d’you think would want to tickle you  i tell you says the cook somebody come over and tickled me with a ’and the size of a leg o’ mutton i feel creepy all over  bill gave it up for that night but the next day ’e pretended to think jimmy was gettin’ fat an’ ’e caught ’old of ’im and prodded ’im all over he thought ’e felt something round ’is waist but ’e couldn’t be sure and jimmy made such a noise that the other chaps interfered and told bill to leave ’im alone for a whole week we tried to find that money and couldn’t and bill said it was a suspicious thing that jimmy kept aft a good deal more than ’e used to and ’e got an idea that the boy might ha’ ’idden it somewhere there at the end of that time ’owever owing to our being short’anded jimmy was sent for’ard to work as ordinary seaman and it began to be quite noticeable the way ’e avoided bill  at last one day we got ’im alone down the fo’c’sle and bill put ’is arm round ’im and got im on the locker and asked ’im straight out where the money was  why i chucked it overboard he says i told you so afore what a memory you’ve got bill  bill picked ’im up and laid ’im on the locker and we searched ’im thoroughly we even took ’is boots off and then we ’ad another look in ’is bunk while ’e was putting ’em on ag’in  if you’re innercent says bill why don’t you call out—eh  because you told me not to say anything about it bill says the boy but i will next time loud i will  look ’ere says bill you tell us where it is and the three of us’ll go shares in it that’ll be two ’undered pounds each and we’ll tell you ’ow to get yours changed without getting caught we’re cleverer than you are you know  i know that bill says the boy but it’s no good me telling you lies i chucked it overboard  very good then says bill getting up i’m going to tell the skipper  tell ’im says jimmy i don’t care  then you’ll be searched arter you’ve stepped ashore says bill and you won’t be allowed on the ship ag’in you’ll lose it all by being greedy whereas if you go shares with us you’ll ’ave two ’undered pounds  i could see as ’ow the boy ’adn’t thought o’ that and try as ’e would ’e couldn’t ’ide ’is feelin’s he called bill a rednosed shark and ’e called me somethin’ i’ve forgotten now  think it over says bill mind you’ll be collared as soon as you’ve left the gangway and searched by the police  and will they tickle the cook too i wonder says jimmy savagely  and if they find it you’ll go to prison says bill giving ’im a clump o’ the side o’ the ’ead and you won’t like that i can tell you  why ain’t it nice bill says jimmy holding ’is ear  bill looked at ’im and then ’e steps to the ladder i’m not going to talk to you any more my lad ’e says i’m going to tell the skipper  he went up slowly and just as ’e reached the deck jimmy started up and called ’im bill pretended not to ’ear and the boy ran up on deck and follered ’im and arter a little while they both came down again together  did you wish to speak to me my lad says bill ’olding ’is ’ead up  yes says the boy fiddling with ’is fingers if you keep your ugly mouth shut we’ll go shares  ho says bill i thought you throwed it overboard  i thought so too bill says jimmy very softly and when i came below ag’in i found it in my trousers pocket  where is it now says bill  never mind where it is says the boy you couldn’t get it if i was to tell you it’ll take me all my time to do it myself  where is it says bill ag’in i’m goin’ to take care of it i won’t trust you  and i can’t trust you says jimmy  if you don’t tell me where it is this minute says bill moving to the ladder ag’in i’m off to tell the skipper i want it in my ’ands or at any rate my share of it why not share it out now  because i ’aven’t got it says jimmy stamping ’is foot that’s why and it’s all your silly fault arter you came pawing through my pockets when you thought i was asleep i got frightened and ’id it  where says bill  in the second mate’s mattress says jimmy i was tidying up down aft and i found a ’ole in the underneath side of ’is mattress and i shoved it in there and poked it in with a bit o’ stick  and ’ow are you going to get it says bill scratching ’is ’ead  that’s wot i don’t know seeing that i’m not allowed aft now says jimmy one of us’ll ’ave to make a dash for it when we get to london and mind if there’s any ’ankypanky on your part bill i’ll give the show away myself  the cook came down just then and we ’ad to leave off talking and i could see that bill was so pleased at finding that the money ’adn’t been thrown overboard that ’e was losing sight o’ the difficulty o’ getting at it in a day or two ’owever ’e see it as plain as me and jimmy did and as time went by he got desprit and frightened us both by ’anging about aft every chance ’e got  the companionway faced the wheel and there was about as much chance o’ getting down there without being seen as there would be o’ taking a man’s false teeth out of ’is mouth without ’is knowing it jimmy went down one day while bill was at the wheel to look for ’is knife wot ’e thought ’e’d left down there and ’ed ’ardly got down afore bill saw ’im come up ag’in ’olding on to the top of a mop which the steward was using  we couldn’t figure it out nohow and to think o’ the second mate a little man with a large fam’ly who never ’ad a penny in ’is pocket sleeping every night on a six ’undered pound mattress sent us pretty near crazy we used to talk it over whenever we got a chance and bill and jimmy could scarcely be civil to each other the boy said it was bill’s fault and ’e said it was the boy’s  the on’y thing i can see says the boy one day is for bill to ’ave a touch of sunstroke as ’e’s leaving the wheel one day tumble ’eadfirst down the companionway and injure ’isself so severely that ’e can’t be moved then they’ll put ’im in a cabin down aft and p’raps i’ll ’ave to go and nurse ’im anyway he’ll be down there  it’s a very good idea bill i says  ho says bill looking at me as if ’e would eat me why don’t you do it then  i’d sooner you did it bill says the boy still i don’t mind which it is why not toss up for it  get away says bill get away afore i do something you won’t like you bloodthirsty little murderer  i’ve got a plan myself he says in a low voice after the boy ’ad ’opped off and if i can’t think of nothing better i’ll try it and mind not a word to the boy  he didn’t think o’ nothing better and one night just as we was making the channel ’e tried ’is plan he was in the second mate’s watch and byandby ’e leans over the wheel and says to ’im in a low voice this is my last v’y’ge sir  oh says the second mate who was a man as didn’t mind talking to a man before the mast how’s that  i’ve got a berth ashore sir says bill and i wanted to ask a favour sir  the second mate growled and walked off a pace or two  i’ve never been so ’appy as i’ve been on this ship says bill none of us ’ave we was saying so the other night and everybody agreed as it was owing to you sir and your kindness to all of us  the second mate coughed but bill could see as ’e was a bit pleased  the feeling came over me says bill that when i leave the sea for good i’d like to ’ave something o’ yours to remember you by sir and it seemed to me that if i ’ad your—mattress i should think of you ev’ry night o’ my life  my wot says the second mate staring at ’im your mattress sir says bill if i might make so bold as to offer a pound for it sir i want something wot’s been used by you and i’ve got a fancy for that as a keepsake the second mate shook ’is ’ead i’m sorry bill ’e says gently but i couldn’t let it go at that  i’d sooner pay thirty shillin’s than not ’ave it sir says bill ’umbly  i gave a lot of money for that mattress says the mate ag’in i forgit ’ow much but a lot you don’t know ’ow valuable that mattress is  i know it’s a good one sir else you wouldn’t ’ave it says bill would a couple o’ pounds buy it sir  the second mate hum’d and ha’d but bill was afeard to go any ’igher so far as ’e could make out from jimmy the mattress was worth about eighteen pence—to anybody who wasn’t pertiklar  i’ve slept on that mattress for years says the second mate looking at ’im from the corner of ’is eye i don’t believe i could sleep on another still to oblige you bill you shall ’ave it at that if you don’t want it till we go ashore  thankee sir says bill ’ardly able to keep from dancing and i’ll ’and over the two pounds when we’re paid off i shall keep it all my life sir in memory of you and your kindness  and mind you keep quiet about it says the second mate who didn’t want the skipper to know wot ’e’d been doing because i don’t want to be bothered by other men wanting to buy things as keepsakes  bill promised ’im like a shot and when ’e told me about it ’e was nearly crying with joy  and mind ’e says i’ve bought that mattress bought it as it stands and it’s got nothing to do with jimmy we’ll each pay a pound and halve wot’s in it  he persuaded me at last but that boy watched us like a cat watching a couple of canaries and i could see we should ’ave all we could do to deceive ’im he seemed more suspicious o’ bill than me and ’e kep’ worrying us nearly every day to know what we were going to do  we beat about in the channel with a strong ’eadwind for four days and then a tug picked us up and towed us to london  the excitement of that last little bit was ’orrible fust of all we ’ad got to get the mattress and then in some way we ’ad got to get rid o’ jimmy bill’s idea was for me to take ’im ashore with me and tell ’im that bill would join us arterwards and then lose ’im but i said that till i’d got my share i couldn’t bear to lose sight o’ bill’s honest face for ’alf a second  and besides jimmy wouldn’t ’ave gone  all the way up the river ’e stuck to bill and kept asking ’im wot we were to do ’e was ’alf crying and so excited that bill was afraid the other chaps would notice it  we got to our berth in the east india docks at last and arter we were made fast we went below to ’ave a wash and change into our shoregoing togs jimmy watched us all the time and then ’e comes up to bill biting ’is nails and says  how’s it to be done bill  hang about arter the rest ’ave gone ashore and trust to luck says bill looking at me we’ll see ’ow the land lays when we draw our advance  we went down aft to draw ten shillings each to go ashore with bill and me got ours fust and then the second mate who ’ad tipped ’im the wink followed us out unconcernedlike and ’anded bill the mattress rolled up in a sack  ’ere you are bill ’e says  much obliged sir says bill and ’is ’ands trembled so as ’e could ’ardly ’old it and ’e made to go off afore jimmy come on deck  then that fool of a mate kept us there while ’e made a little speech twice bill made to go off but ’e put ’is ’and on ’is arm and kept ’im there while ’e told ’im ’ow he’d always tried to be liked by the men and ’ad generally succeeded and in the middle of it up popped master jimmy  he gave a start as he saw the bag and ’is eyes opened wide and then as we walked forward ’e put ’is arm through bill’s and called ’im all the names ’e could think of  you’d steal the milk out of a cat’s saucer ’e says but mind you don’t leave this ship till i’ve got my share  i meant it for a pleasant surprise for you jimmy says bill trying to smile  i don’t like your surprises bill so i don’t deceive you says the boy where are you going to open it  i was thinking of opening it in my bunk says bill the perlice might want to examine it if we took it through the dock come on jimmy old man  yes all right says the boy nodding ’is ’ead at ’im i’ll stay up ’ere you might forget yourself bill if i trusted myself down there with you alone you can throw my share up to me and then you’ll leave the ship afore i do see  go to blazes says bill and then seeing that the last chance ’ad gone we went below and ’e chucked the bundle in ’is bunk there was only one chap down there and arter spending best part o’ ten minutes doing ’is hair ’e nodded to us and went off  half a minute later bill cut open the mattress and began to search through the stuffing while i struck matches and watched ’im it wasn’t a big mattress and there wasn’t much stuffing but we couldn’t seem to see that money bill went all over it ag’in and ag’in and then ’e stood up and looked at me and caught ’is breath painful  do you think the mate found it ’e says in a ’usky voice  we went through it ag’in and then bill went halfway up the fo’c’s’le ladder and called softly for jimmy he called three times and then with a sinking sensation in ’is stummick ’e went up on deck and i follered ’im the boy was nowhere to be seen all we saw was the ship’s cat ’aving a wash and brushup afore going ashore and the skipper standing aft talking to the owner  we never saw that boy ag’in he never turned up for ’is box and ’e didn’t show up to draw ’is pay everybody else was there of course and arter i’d got mine and come outside i see pore bill with ’is back up ag’in a wall staring ’ard at the second mate who was looking at ’im with a kind smile and asking ’im ’ow he’d slept the last thing i saw of bill the pore chap ’ad got ’is ’ands in ’is trousers pockets and was trying ’is hardest to smile back     the well   i  two men stood in the billiardroom of an old country house talking play which had been of a halfhearted nature was over and they sat at the open window looking out over the park stretching away beneath them conversing idly  your time’s nearly up jem said one at length this time six weeks you’ll be yawning out the honeymoon and cursing the man—woman i mean— who invented them  jem benson stretched his long limbs in the chair and grunted in dissent  i’ve never understood it continued wilfred carr yawning it’s not in my line at all i never had enough money for my own wants let alone for two perhaps if i were as rich as you or croesus i might regard it differently  there was just sufficient meaning in the latter part of the remark for his cousin to forbear to reply to it he continued to gaze out of the window and to smoke slowly  not being as rich as croesus—or you resumed carr regarding him from beneath lowered lids i paddle my own canoe down the stream of time and tying it to my friends’ doorposts go in to eat their dinners  quite venetian said jem benson still looking out of the window it’s not a bad thing for you wilfred that you have the doorposts and dinners—and friends  carr grunted in his turn seriously though jem he said slowly you’re a lucky fellow a very lucky fellow if there is a better girl above ground than olive i should like to see her  yes said the other quietly  she’s such an exceptional girl continued carr staring out of the window she’s so good and gentle she thinks you are a bundle of all the virtues  he laughed frankly and joyously but the other man did not join him strong sense—of right and wrong though continued carr musingly do you know i believe that if she found out that you were not—  not what demanded benson turning upon him fiercely not what  everything that you are returned his cousin with a grin that belied his words i believe she’d drop you  talk about something else said benson slowly your pleasantries are not always in the best taste  wilfred carr rose and taking a cue from the rack bent over the board and practiced one or two favourite shots the only other subject i can talk about just at present is my own financial affairs he said slowly as he walked round the table  talk about something else said benson again bluntly  and the two things are connected said carr and dropping his cue he half sat on the table and eyed his cousin  there was a long silence benson pitched the end of his cigar out of the window and leaning back closed his eyes  do you follow me inquired carr at length  benson opened his eyes and nodded at the window  do you want to follow my cigar he demanded  i should prefer to depart by the usual way for your sake returned the other unabashed if i left by the window all sorts of questions would be asked and you know what a talkative chap i am  so long as you don’t talk about my affairs returned the other restraining himself by an obvious effort you can talk yourself hoarse  i’m in a mess said carr slowly a devil of a mess if i don’t raise fifteen hundred by this day fortnight i may be getting my board and lodging free  would that be any change questioned benson  the quality would retorted the other the address also would not be good seriously jem will you let me have the fifteen hundred  no said the other simply  carr went white it’s to save me from ruin he said thickly  i’ve helped you till i’m tired said benson turning and regarding him and it is all to no good if you’ve got into a mess get out of it you should not be so fond of giving autographs away  it’s foolish i admit said carr deliberately i won’t do so any more by the way i’ve got some to sell you needn’t sneer they’re not my own  whose are they inquired the other  yours  benson got up from his chair and crossed over to him what is this he asked quietly blackmail  call it what you like said carr i’ve got some letters for sale price fifteen hundred and i know a man who would buy them at that price for the mere chance of getting olive from you i’ll give you first offer  if you have got any letters bearing my signature you will be good enough to give them to me said benson very slowly  they’re mine said carr lightly given to me by the lady you wrote them to i must say that they are not all in the best possible taste  his cousin reached forward suddenly and catching him by the collar of his coat pinned him down on the table  give me those letters he breathed sticking his face close to carr’s  they’re not here said carr struggling i’m not a fool let me go or i’ll raise the price  the other man raised him from the table in his powerful hands apparently with the intention of dashing his head against it then suddenly his hold relaxed as an astonishedlooking maidservant entered the room with letters carr sat up hastily  that’s how it was done said benson for the girl’s benefit as he took the letters  i don’t wonder at the other man making him pay for it then said carr blandly  you will give me those letters said benson suggestively as the girl left the room  at the price i mentioned yes said carr but so sure as i am a living man if you lay your clumsy hands on me again i’ll double it now i’ll leave you for a time while you think it over  he took a cigar from the box and lighting it carefully quitted the room his cousin waited until the door had closed behind him and then turning to the window sat there in a fit of fury as silent as it was terrible  the air was fresh and sweet from the park heavy with the scent of newmown grass the fragrance of a cigar was now added to it and glancing out he saw his cousin pacing slowly by he rose and went to the door and then apparently altering his mind he returned to the window and watched the figure of his cousin as it moved slowly away into the moonlight then he rose again and for a long time the room was empty  it was empty when mrs benson came in some time later to say goodnight to her son on her way to bed she walked slowly round the table and pausing at the window gazed from it in idle thought until she saw the figure of her son advancing with rapid strides toward the house he looked up at the window  goodnight said she  goodnight said benson in a deep voice  where is wilfred  oh he has gone said benson  gone  we had a few words he was wanting money again and i gave him a piece of my mind i don’t think we shall see him again  poor wilfred sighed mrs benson he is always in trouble of some sort i hope that you were not too hard upon him  no more than he deserved said her son sternly good night  ii  the well which had long ago fallen into disuse was almost hidden by the thick tangle of undergrowth which ran riot at that corner of the old park it was partly covered by the shrunken half of a lid above which a rusty windlass creaked in company with the music of the pines when the wind blew strongly the full light of the sun never reached it and the ground surrounding it was moist and green when other parts of the park were gaping with the heat  two people walking slowly round the park in the fragrant stillness of a summer evening strayed in the direction of the well  no use going through this wilderness olive said benson pausing on the outskirts of the pines and eyeing with some disfavour the gloom beyond  best part of the park said the girl briskly you know it’s my favourite spot  i know you’re very fond of sitting on the coping said the man slowly and i wish you wouldn’t one day you will lean back too far and fall in  and make the acquaintance of truth said olive lightly come along  she ran from him and was lost in the shadow of the pines the bracken crackling beneath her feet as she ran her companion followed slowly and emerging from the gloom saw her poised daintily on the edge of the well with her feet hidden in the rank grass and nettles which surrounded it she motioned her companion to take a seat by her side and smiled softly as she felt a strong arm passed about her waist  i like this place said she breaking a long silence it is so dismal —so uncanny do you know i wouldn’t dare to sit here alone jem i should imagine that all sorts of dreadful things were hidden behind the bushes and trees waiting to spring out on me ugh  you’d better let me take you in said her companion tenderly the well isn’t always wholesome especially in the hot weather  let’s make a move  the girl gave an obstinate little shake and settled herself more securely on her seat  smoke your cigar in peace she said quietly i am settled here for a quiet talk has anything been heard of wilfred yet  nothing  quite a dramatic disappearance isn’t it she continued another scrape i suppose and another letter for you in the same old strain ’dear jem help me out’  jem benson blew a cloud of fragrant smoke into the air and holding his cigar between his teeth brushed away the ash from his coat sleeves  i wonder what he would have done without you said the girl pressing his arm affectionately gone under long ago i suppose when we are married jem i shall presume upon the relationship to lecture him he is very wild but he has his good points poor fellow  i never saw them said benson with startling bitterness god knows i never saw them  he is nobody’s enemy but his own said the girl startled by this outburst  you don’t know much about him said the other sharply he was not above blackmail not above ruining the life of a friend to do himself a benefit a loafer a cur and a liar  the girl looked up at him soberly but timidly and took his arm without a word and they both sat silent while evening deepened into night and the beams of the moon filtering through the branches surrounded them with a silver network her head sank upon his shoulder till suddenly with a sharp cry she sprang to her feet  what was that she cried breathlessly  what was what demanded benson springing up and clutching her fast by the arm  she caught her breath and tried to laugh  you’re hurting me jem  his hold relaxed  what is the matter he asked gently  what was it startled you  i was startled she said slowly putting her hands on his shoulder i suppose the words i used just now are ringing in my ears but i fancied that somebody behind us whispered ’jem help me out’  fancy repeated benson and his voice shook but these fancies are not good for you you—are frightened—at the dark and the gloom of these trees let me take you back to the house  no i’m not frightened said the girl reseating herself i should never be really frightened of anything when you were with me jem i’m surprised at myself for being so silly  the man made no reply but stood a strong dark figure a yard or two from the well as though waiting for her to join him  come and sit down sir cried olive patting the brickwork with her small white hand one would think that you did not like your company  he obeyed slowly and took a seat by her side drawing so hard at his cigar that the light of it shone upon his fare at every breath he passed his arm firm and rigid as steel behind her with his hand resting on the brickwork beyond  are you warm enough he asked tenderly as she made a little movement pretty fair she shivered one oughtn’t to be cold at this time of the year but there’s a cold damp air comes up from the well  as she spoke a faint splash sounded from the depths below and for the second time that evening she sprang from the well with a little cry of dismay  what is it now he asked in a fearful voice he stood by her side and gazed at the well as though half expecting to see the cause of her alarm emerge from it  oh my bracelet she cried in distress my poor mother’s bracelet i’ve dropped it down the well  your bracelet repeated benson dully your bracelet the diamond one  the one that was my mother’s said olive oh we can get it back surely we must have the water drained off  your bracelet repeated benson stupidly  jem said the girl in terrified tones dear jem what is the matter  for the man she loved was standing regarding her with horror the moon which touched it was not responsible for all the whiteness of the distorted face and she shrank back in fear to the edge of the well he saw her fear and by a mighty effort regained his composure and took her hand  poor little girl he murmured you frightened me i was not looking when you cried and i thought that you were slipping from my arms down—down—  his voice broke and the girl throwing herself into his arms clung to him convulsively  there there said benson fondly don’t cry don’t cry  tomorrow said olive halflaughing halfcrying we will all come round the well with hook and line and fish for it it will be quite a new sport  no we must try some other way said benson you shall have it back  how asked the girl  you shall see said benson tomorrow morning at latest you shall have it back till then promise me that you will not mention your loss to anyone promise  i promise said olive wonderingly but why not  it is of great value for one thing and—but there—there are many reasons for one thing it is my duty to get it for you  wouldn’t you like to jump down for it she asked mischievously listen  she stooped for a stone and dropped it down  fancy being where that is now she said peering into the blackness fancy going round and round like a mouse in a pail clutching at the slimy sides with the water filling your mouth and looking up to the little patch of sky above  you had better come in said benson very quietly you are developing a taste for the morbid and horrible  the girl turned and taking his arm walked slowly in the direction of the house mrs benson who was sitting in the porch rose to receive them  you shouldn’t have kept her out so long she said chidingly where have you been  sitting on the well said olive smiling discussing our future  i don’t believe that place is healthy said mrs benson emphatically i really think it might be filled in jem  all right said her son slowly pity it wasn’t filled in long ago  he took the chair vacated by his mother as she entered the house with olive and with his hands hanging limply over the sides sat in deep thought after a time he rose and going upstairs to a room which was set apart for sporting requisites selected a sea fishing line and some hooks and stole softly downstairs again he walked swiftly across the park in the direction of the well turning before he entered the shadow of the trees to look back at the lighted windows of the house then having arranged his line he sat on the edge of the well and cautiously lowered it  he sat with his lips compressed occasionally looking about him in a startled fashion as though he half expected to see something peering at him from the belt of trees time after time he lowered his line until at length in pulling it up he heard a little metallic tinkle against the side of the well  he held his breath then and forgetting his fears drew the line in inch by inch so as not to lose its precious burden his pulse beat rapidly and his eyes were bright as the line came slowly in he saw the catch hanging to the hook and with a steady hand drew the last few feet in then he saw that instead of the bracelet he had hooked a bunch of keys  with a faint cry he shook them from the hook into the water below and stood breathing heavily not a sound broke the stillness of the night he walked up and down a bit and stretched his great muscles then he came back to the well and resumed his task  for an hour or more the line was lowered without result in his eagerness he forgot his fears and with eyes bent down the well fished slowly and carefully twice the hook became entangled in something and was with difficulty released it caught a third time and all his efforts failed’ to free it then he dropped the line down the well and with head bent walked toward the house  he went first to the stables at the rear and then retiring to his room for some time paced restlessly up and down then without removing his clothes he flung himself upon the bed and fell into a troubled sleep  iii  long before anybody else was astir he arose and stole softly downstairs the sunlight was stealing in at every crevice and flashing in long streaks across the darkened rooms the diningroom into which he looked struck chill and cheerless in the dark yellow light which came through the lowered blinds he remembered that it had the same appearance when his father lay dead in the house now as then everything seemed ghastly and unreal the very chairs standing as their occupants had left them the night before seemed to be indulging in some dark communication of ideas  slowly and noiselessly he opened the hall door and passed into the fragrant air beyond the sun was shining on the drenched grass and trees and a slowly vanishing white mist rolled like smoke about the grounds for a moment he stood breathing deeply the sweet air of the morning and then walked slowly in the direction of the stables  the rusty creaking of a pumphandle and a spatter of water upon the redtiled courtyard showed that somebody else was astir and a few steps farther he beheld a brawny sandyhaired man gasping wildly under severe selfinfliction at the pump  everything ready george he asked quietly  yes sir said the man straightening up suddenly and touching his forehead bob’s just finishing the arrangements inside it’s a lovely morning for a dip the water in that well must be just icy  be as quick as you can said benson impatiently  very good sir said george burnishing his face harshly with a very small towel which had been hanging over the top of the pump hurry up bob  in answer to his summons a man appeared at the door of the stable with a coil of stout rope over his arm and a large metal candlestick in his hand  just to try the air sir said george following his master’s glance a well gets rather foul sometimes but if a candle can live down it a man can  his master nodded and the man hastily pulling up the neck of his shirt and thrusting his arms into his coat followed him as he led the way slowly to the well  beg pardon sir said george drawing up to his side but you are not looking over and above well this morning if you’ll let me go down i’d enjoy the bath  no no said benson peremptorily  you ain’t fit to go down sir persisted his follower i’ve never seen you look so before now if—  mind your business said his master curtly  george became silent and the three walked with swinging strides through the long wet grass to the well bob flung the rope on the ground and at a sign from his master handed him the candlestick  here’s the line for it sir said bob fumbling in his pockets  benson took it from him and slowly tied it to the candlestick then he placed it on the edge of the well and striking a match lit the candle and began slowly to lower it  hold hard sir said george quickly laying his hand on his arm you must tilt it or the string’ll burn through  even as he spoke the string parted and the candlestick fell into the water below  benson swore quietly  i’ll soon get another said george starting up  never mind the well’s all right said benson  it won’t take a moment sir said the other over his shoulder  are you master here or am i said benson hoarsely  george came back slowly a glance at his master’s face stopping the protest upon his tongue and he stood by watching him sulkily as he sat on the well and removed his outer garments both men watched him curiously as having completed his preparations he stood grim and silent with his hands by his sides  i wish you’d let me go sir said george plucking up courage to address him you ain’t fit to go you’ve got a chill or something i shouldn’t wonder it’s the typhoid they’ve got it in the village bad  for a moment benson looked at him angrily then his gaze softened not this time george he said quietly he took the looped end of the rope and placed it under his arms and sitting down threw one leg over the side of the well  how are you going about it sir queried george laying hold of the rope and signing to bob to do the same  i’ll call out when i reach the water said benson then pay out three yards more quickly so that i can get to the bottom  very good sir answered both  their master threw the other leg over the coping and sat motionless his back was turned toward the men as he sat with head bent looking down the shaft he sat for so long that george became uneasy  all right sir he inquired  yes said benson slowly if i tug at the rope george pull up at once lower away  the rope passed steadily through their hands until a hollow cry from the darkness below and a faint splashing warned them that he had reached the water they gave him three yards more and stood with relaxed grasp and strained ears waiting  he’s gone under said bob in a low voice  the other nodded and moistening his huge palms took a firmer grip of the rope  fully a minute passed and the men began to exchange uneasy glances then a sudden tremendous jerk followed by a series of feebler ones nearly tore the rope from their grasp  pull shouted george placing one foot on the side and hauling desperately pull pull he’s stuck fast he’s not coming pull  in response to their terrific exertions the rope came slowly in inch by inch until at length a violent splashing was heard and at the same moment a scream of unutterable horror came echoing up the shaft  what a weight he is panted bob he’s stuck fast or something keep still sir for heaven’s sake keep still  for the taut rope was being jerked violently by the struggles of the weight at the end of it both men with grunts and sighs hauled it in foot by foot  all right sir cried george cheerfully  he had one foot against the well and was pulling manfully the burden was nearing the top a long pull and a strong pull and the face of a dead man with mud in the eyes and nostrils came peering over the edge behind it was the ghastly face of his master but this he saw too late for with a great cry he let go his hold of the rope and stepped back the suddenness overthrew his assistant and the rope tore through his hands there was a frightful splash  you fool stammered bob and ran to the well helplessly  run cried george run for another line  he bent over the coping and called eagerly down as his assistant sped back to the stables shouting wildly his voice reechoed down the shaft but all else was silence     cupboard love   in the comfortable livingroom at negget’s farm half parlour and half kitchen three people sat at tea in the waning light of a november afternoon conversation which had been brisk had languished somewhat owing to mrs negget glancing at frequent intervals toward the door behind which she was convinced the servant was listening and checking the finest periods and the most startling suggestions with a warning ’ssh  go on uncle she said after one of these interruptions  i forget where i was said mr martin bodfish shortly  under our bed mr negget reminded him  yes watching said mrs negget eagerly  it was an odd place for an expoliceman especially as a small legacy added to his pension had considerably improved his social position but mr bodfish had himself suggested it in the professional hope that the person who had taken mrs negget’s gold brooch might try for further loot he had indeed suggested baiting the dressingtable with the farmer’s watch an idea which mr negget had promptly vetoed  i can’t help thinking that mrs pottle knows something about it said mrs negget with an indignant glance at her husband  mrs pottle said the farmer rising slowly and taking a seat on the oak settle built in the fireplace has been away from the village for near a fortnit  i didn’t say she took it snapped his wife i said i believe she knows something about it and so i do she’s a horrid woman look at the way she encouraged her girl looey to run after that young traveller from smithson’s the whole fact of the matter is it isn’t your brooch so you don’t care  i said— began mr negget  i know what you said retorted his wife sharply and i wish you’d be quiet and not interrupt uncle here’s my uncle been in the police twentyfive years and you won’t let him put a word in edgeways’  my way o’ looking at it said the expoliceman slowly is different to that o’ the law my idea is an’ always has been that everybody is guilty until they’ve proved their innocence  it’s a wonderful thing to me said mr negget in a low voice to his pipe as they should come to a house with a retired policeman living in it looks to me like somebody that ain’t got much respect for the police  the expoliceman got up from the table and taking a seat on the settle opposite the speaker slowly filled a long clay and took a spill from the fireplace his pipe lit he turned to his niece and slowly bade her go over the account of her loss once more  i missed it this morning said mrs negget rapidly at ten minutes past twelve o’clock by the clock and halfpast five by my watch which wants looking to i’d just put the batch of bread into the oven and gone upstairs and opened the box that stands on my drawers to get a lozenge and i missed the brooch  do you keep it in that box asked the expoliceman slowly  always replied his niece i at once came down stairs and told emma that the brooch had been stolen i said that i named no names and didn’t wish to think bad of anybody and that if i found the brooch back in the box when i went up stairs again i should forgive whoever took it  and what did emma say inquired mr bodfish  emma said a lot o’ things replied mrs negget angrily i’m sure by the lot she had to say you’d ha’ thought she was the missis and me the servant i gave her a month’s notice at once and she went straight up stairs and sat on her box and cried  sat on her box repeated the exconstable impressively oh  that’s what i thought said his niece but it wasn’t because i got her off at last and searched it through and through i never saw anything like her clothes in all my life there was hardly a button or a tape on and as for her stockings—  she don’t get much time said mr negget slowly  that’s right i thought you’d speak up for her cried his wife shrilly  look here— began mr negget laying his pipe on the seat by his side and rising slowly  keep to the case in hand said the exconstable waving him back to his seat again now lizzie  i searched her box through and through said his niece but it wasn’t there then i came down again and had a rare good cry all to myself  that’s the best way for you to have it remarked mr negget feelingly  mrs negget’s uncle instinctively motioned his niece to silence and holding his chin in his hand scowled frightfully in the intensity of thought  see a cloo inquired mr negget affably  you ought to be ashamed of yourself george said his wife angrily speaking to uncle when he’s looking like that  mr bodfish said nothing it is doubtful whether he even heard these remarks but he drew a huge notebook from his pocket and after vainly trying to point his pencil by suction took a knife from the table and hastily sharpened it  was the brooch there last night he inquired  it were said mr negget promptly lizzie made me get up just as the owd clock were striking twelve to get her a lozenge  it seems pretty certain that the brooch went since then mused mr bodfish  it would seem like it to a plain man said mr negget guardedly  i should like to see the box said mr bodfish  mrs negget went up and fetched it and stood eyeing him eagerly as he raised the lid and inspected the contents it contained only a few lozenges and some bone studs mr negget helped himself to a lozenge and going back to his seat breathed peppermint  properly speaking that ought not to have been touched said the exconstable regarding him with some severity  eh said the startled farmer putting his finger to his lips  never mind said the other shaking his head it’s too late now  he doesn’t care a bit said mrs negget somewhat sadly he used to keep buttons in that box with the lozenges until one night he gave me one by mistake yes you may laugh—i’m glad you can laugh  mr negget feeling that his mirth was certainly illtimed shook for some time in a noble effort to control himself and despairing at length went into the back place to recover sounds of blows indicative of emma slapping him on the back did not add to mrs negget’s serenity  the point is said the exconstable could anybody have come into your room while you was asleep and taken it  no said mrs negget decisively i’m a very poor sleeper and i’d have woke at once but if a flock of elephants was to come in the room they wouldn’t wake george he’d sleep through anything  except her feeling under my piller for her handkerchief corroborated mr negget returning to the sittingroom  mr bodfish waved them to silence and again gave way to deep thought three times he took up his pencil and laying it down again sat and drummed on the table with his fingers then he arose and with bent head walked slowly round and round the room until he stumbled over a stool  nobody came to the house this morning i suppose he said at length resuming his seat  only mrs driver said his niece  what time did she come inquired mr bodfish  here look here interposed mr negget i’ve known mrs driver thirty year a’most  what time did she come repeated the exconstable pitilessly  his niece shook her head it might have been eleven and again it might have been earlier she replied i was out when she came  out almost shouted the other  mrs negget nodded  she was sitting in here when i came back  her uncle looked up and glanced at the door behind which a small staircase led to the room above  what was to prevent mrs driver going up there while you were away he demanded  i shouldn’t like to think that of mrs driver said his niece shaking her head but then in these days one never knows what might happen never i’ve given up thinking about it however when i came back mrs driver was here sitting in that very chair you are sitting in now  mr bodfish pursed up his lips and made another note then he took a spill from the fireplace and lighting a candle went slowly and carefully up the stairs he found nothing on them but two caked rims of mud and being too busy to notice mr negget’s frantic signalling called his niece’s attention to them  what do you think of that he demanded triumphantly  somebody’s been up there said his niece it isn’t emma because she hasn’t been outside the house all day and it can’t be george because he promised me faithful he’d never go up there in his dirty boots  mr negget coughed and approaching the stairs gazed with the eye of a stranger at the relics as mr bodfish hotly rebuked a suggestion of his niece’s to sweep them up  seems to me said the consciencestricken mr negget feebly as they’re rather large for a woman  mud cakes said mr bodfish with his most professional manner a small boot would pick up a lot this weather  so it would said mr negget and with brazen effrontery not only met his wife’s eye without quailing but actually glanced down at her boots  mr bodfish came back to his chair and ruminated then he looked up and spoke  it was missed this morning at ten minutes past twelve he said slowly it was there last night at eleven o’clock you came in and found mrs driver sitting in that chair  no the one you’re in interrupted his niece  it don’t signify said her uncle nobody else has been near the place and emma’s box has been searched  thoroughly searched testified mrs negget  now the point is what did mrs driver come for this morning resumed the exconstable did she come—  he broke off and eyed with dignified surprise a fine piece of wireless telegraphy between husband and wife it appeared that mr negget sent off a humorous message with his left eye the right being for some reason closed to which mrs negget replied with a series of frowns and staccato shakes of the head which her husband found easily translatable under the austere stare of mr bodfish their faces at once regained their wonted calm and the exconstable in a somewhat offended manner resumed his inquiries  mrs driver has been here a good bit lately he remarked slowly  mr negget’s eyes watered and his mouth worked piteously  if you can’t behave yourself george—began began his wife fiercely  what is the matter demanded mr bodfish i’m not aware that i’ve said anything to be laughed at  no more you have uncle retorted his niece only george is such a stupid he’s got an idea in his silly head that mrs driver—but it’s all nonsense of course  i’ve merely got a bit of an idea that it’s a weddingring not a brooch mrs driver is after said the farmer to the perplexed constable  mr bodfish looked from one to the other but you always keep yours on lizzie don’t you he asked  yes of course replied his niece hurriedly but george has always got such strange ideas don’t take no notice of him  her uncle sat back in his chair his face still wrinkled perplexedly then the wrinkles vanished suddenly chased away by a huge glow and he rose wrathfully and towered over the matchmaking mr negget how dare you he gasped  mr negget made no reply but in a cowardly fashion jerked his thumb toward his wife  oh george how can you say so said the latter  i should never ha’ thought of it by myself said the farmer but i think they’d make a very nice couple and i’m sure mrs driver thinks so  the exconstable sat down in wrathful confusion and taking up his notebook again watched over the top of it the silent charges and countercharges of his niece and her husband  if i put my finger on the culprit he asked at length turning to his niece what do you wish done to her  mrs negget regarded him with an expression which contained all the christian virtues rolled into one  nothing she said softly i only want my brooch back  the exconstable shook his head at this leniency  well do as you please he said slowly in the first place i want you to ask mrs driver here to tea tomorrow—oh i don’t mind negget’s ridiculous ideas—pity he hasn’t got something better to think of if she’s guilty i’ll soon find it out i’ll play with her like a cat with a mouse i’ll make her convict herself  look here said mr negget with sudden vigour i won’t have it i won’t have no woman asked here to tea to be got at like that there’s only my friends comes here to tea and if any friend stole anything o’ mine i’d be one o’ the first to hush it up  if they were all like you george said his wife angrily where would the law be  or the police demanded mr bodfish staring at him  i won’t have it repeated the farmer loudly i’m the law here and i’m the police here that little tiny bit o’ dirt was off my boots i dare say i don’t care if it was  very good said mr bodfish turning to his indignant niece if he likes to look at it that way there’s nothing more to be said i only wanted to get your brooch back for you that’s all but if he’s against it—  i’m against your asking mrs driver here to my house to be got at said the farmer  o’ course if you can find out who took the brooch and get it back again anyway that’s another matter  mr bodfish leaned over the table toward his niece  if i get an opportunity i’ll search her cottage he said in a low voice strictly speaking it ain’t quite a legal thing to do o course but many o’ the finest pieces of detective work have been done by breaking the law if she’s a kleptomaniac it’s very likely lying about somewhere in the house  he eyed mr negget closely as though half expecting another outburst but none being forthcoming sat back in his chair again and smoked in silence while mrs negget with a carpetbrush which almost spoke swept the pieces of dried mud from the stairs  mr negget was the last to go to bed that night and finishing his pipe over the dying fire sat for some time in deep thought he had from the first raised objections to the presence of mr bodfish at the farm but family affection coupled with an idea of testamentary benefits had so wrought with his wife that he had allowed her to have her own way now he half fancied that he saw a chance of getting rid of him if he could only enable the widow to catch him searching her house it was highly probable that the exconstable would find the village somewhat too hot to hold him he gave his right leg a congratulatory slap as he thought of it and knocking the ashes from his pipe went slowly up to bed  he was so amiable next morning that mr bodfish who was trying to explain to mrs negget the difference between theft and kleptomania spoke before him freely the exconstable defined kleptomania as a sort of amiable weakness found chiefly among the upper circles and cited the case of a lady of title whose love of diamonds combined with great hospitality was a source of much embarrassment to her guests  for the whole of that day mr bodfish hung about in the neighbourhood of the widow’s cottage but in vain and it would be hard to say whether he or mr negget who had been discreetly shadowing him felt the disappointment most on the day following however the exconstable from a distant hedge saw a friend of the widow’s enter the cottage and a little later both ladies emerged and walked up the road  he watched them turn the corner and then with a cautious glance round which failed however to discover mr negget the exconstable strolled casually in the direction of the cottage and approaching it from the rear turned the handle of the door and slipped in  he searched the parlour hastily and then after a glance from the window ventured up stairs and he was in the thick of his selfimposed task when his graceless nephew by marriage who had met mrs driver and referred pathetically to a raging thirst which he had hoped to have quenched with some of her homebrewed brought the ladies hastily back again  i’ll go round the back way said the wily negget as they approached the cottage i just want to have a look at that pig of yours  he reached the back door at the same time as mr bodfish and placing his legs apart held it firmly against the frantic efforts of the exconstable the struggle ceased suddenly and the door opened easily just as mrs driver and her friend appeared in the front room and the farmer with a keen glance at the door of the larder which had just closed took a chair while his hostess drew a glass of beer from the barrel in the kitchen  mr negget drank gratefully and praised the brew from beer the conversation turned naturally to the police and from the police to the listening mr bodfish who was economizing space by sitting on the breadpan and trembling with agitation  he’s a lonely man said negget shaking his head and glancing from the corner of his eye at the door of the larder in his wildest dreams he had not imagined so choice a position and he resolved to give full play to an idea which suddenly occurred to him  i dare say said mrs driver carelessly conscious that her friend was watching her  and the heart of a little child said negget you wouldn’t believe how simple he is  mrs clowes said that it did him credit but speaking for herself she hadn’t noticed it  he was talking about you night before last said negget turning to his hostess not that that’s anything fresh he always is talking about you nowadays  the widow coughed confusedly and told him not to be foolish  ask my wife said the farmer impressively they were talking about you for hours he’s a very shy man is my wife’s uncle but you should see his face change when your name’s mentioned  as a matter of fact mr bodfish’s face was at that very moment taking on a deeper shade of crimson  everything you do seems to interest him continued the farmer disregarding mrs driver’s manifest distress he was asking lizzie about your calling on monday how long you stayed and where you sat and after she’d told him i’m blest if he didn’t go and sit in the same chair  this romantic setting to a perfectly casual action on the part of mr bodfish affected the widow visibly but its effect on the exconstable nearly upset the breadpan  but here continued mr negget with another glance at the larder he might go on like that for years he’s a wunnerful shy man—big and gentle and shy he wanted lizzie to ask you to tea yesterday  now mr negget said the blushing widow do be quiet  fact replied the farmer solemn fact i assure you and he asked her whether you were fond of jewellery  i met him twice in the road near here yesterday said mrs clowes suddenly perhaps he was waiting for you to come out  i dare say replied the farmer i shouldn’t wonder but what he’s hanging about somewhere near now unable to tear himself away  mr bodfish wrung his hands and his thoughts reverted instinctively to instances in his memory in which charges of murder had been altered by the direction of a sensible judge to manslaughter he held his breath for the next words  mr negget drank a little more ale and looked at mrs driver  i wonder whether you’ve got a morsel of bread and cheese he said slowly i’ve come over that hungry—  illustration mrs driver fell back before the emerging form of mr bodfish  the widow and mr bodfish rose simultaneously it required not the brain of a trained detective to know that the cheese was in the larder the unconscious mrs driver opened the door and then with a wild scream fell back before the emerging form of mr bodfish into the arms of mrs clowes the glass of mr negget smashed on the floor and the farmer himself with every appearance of astonishment stared at the apparition openmouthed  mr—bodfish he said at length slowly  mr bodfish incapable of speech glared at him ferociously  leave him alone said mrs clowes who was ministering to her friend can’t you see the man’s upset at frightening her she’s coming round mr bodfish don’t be alarmed  very good said the farmer who found his injured relative’s gaze somewhat trying i’ll go and leave him to explain to mrs driver why he was hidden in her larder it don’t seem a proper thing to me  why you silly man said mrs clowes gleefully as she paused at the door that don’t want any explanation now mr bodfish we’re giving you your chance mind you make the most of it and don’t be too shy  she walked excitedly up the road with the farmer and bidding him goodbye at the corner went off hastily to spread the news mr negget walked home soberly and hardly staying long enough to listen to his wife’s account of the finding of the brooch between the chest of drawers and the wall went off to spend the evening with a friend and ended by making a night of it     in the library   the fire had burnt low in the library for the night was wet and warm it was now little more than a grey shell and looked desolate trayton burleigh still hot rose from his armchair and turning out one of the gasjets took a cigar from a box on a sidetable and resumed his seat again  the apartment which was on the third floor at the back of the house was a combination of library study and smokeroom and was the daily despair of the old housekeeper who with the assistance of one servant managed the house it was a bachelor establishment and had been left to trayton burleigh and james fletcher by a distant connection of both men some ten years before  trayton burleigh sat back in his chair watching the smoke of his cigar through halfclosed eyes occasionally he opened them a little wider and glanced round the comfortable wellfurnished room or stared with a cold gleam of hatred at fletcher as he sat sucking stolidly at his brier pipe it was a comfortable room and a valuable house half of which belonged to trayton burleigh and yet he was to leave it in the morning and become a rogue and a wanderer over the face of the earth james fletcher had said so james fletcher with the pipe still between his teeth and speaking from one corner of his mouth only had pronounced his sentence  it hasn’t occurred to you i suppose said burleigh speaking suddenly that i might refuse your terms  no said fletcher simply  burleigh took a great mouthful of smoke and let it roll slowly out  i am to go out and leave you in possession he continued you will stay here sole proprietor of the house you will stay at the office sole owner and representative of the firm you are a good hand at a deal james fletcher  i am an honest man said fletcher and to raise sufficient money to make your defalcations good will not by any means leave me the gainer as you very well know  there is no necessity to borrow began burleigh eagerly we can pay the interest easily and in course of time make the principal good without a soul being the wiser  that you suggested before said fletcher and my answer is the same i will be no man’s confederate in dishonesty i will raise every penny at all costs and save the name of the firm—and yours with it—but i will never have you darken the office again or sit in this house after tonight  you won’t cried burleigh starting up in a frenzy of rage  i won’t said fletcher you can choose the alternative disgrace and penal servitude don’t stand over me you won’t frighten me i can assure you sit down  you have arranged so many things in your kindness said burleigh slowly resuming his seat again have you arranged how i am to live  you have two strong hands and health replied fletcher i will give you the two hundred pounds i mentioned and after that you must look out for yourself you can take it now  he took a leather case from his breast pocket and drew out a roll of notes burleigh watching him calmly stretched out his hand and took them from the table then he gave way to a sudden access of rage and crumpling them in his hand threw them into a corner of the room fletcher smoked on  mrs marl is out said burleigh suddenly  fletcher nodded  she will be away the night he said slowly and jane too they have gone together somewhere but they will be back at halfpast eight in the morning  you are going to let me have one more breakfast in the old place then said burleigh halfpast eight halfpast—  he rose from his chair again this time fletcher took his pipe from his mouth and watched him closely burleigh stooped and picking up the notes placed them in his pocket  if i am to be turned adrift it shall not be to leave you here he said in a thick voice  he crossed over and shut the door as he turned back fletcher rose from his chair and stood confronting him burleigh put his hand to the wall and drawing a small japanese sword from its sheath of carved ivory stepped slowly toward him  i give you one chance fletcher he said grimly you are a man of your word hush this up and let things be as they were before and you are safe  put that down said fletcher sharply  by — i mean what i say cried the other  i mean what i said answered fletcher  he looked round at the last moment for a weapon then he turned suddenly at a sharp sudden pain and saw burleigh’s clenched fist nearly touching his breastbone the hand came away from his breast again and something with it it went a long way off trayton burleigh suddenly went to a great distance and the room darkened it got quite dark and fletcher with an attempt to raise his hands let them fall to his side instead and fell in a heap to the floor  he was so still that burleigh could hardly realize that it was all over and stood stupidly waiting for him to rise again then he took out his handkerchief as though to wipe the sword and thinking better of it put it back into his pocket again and threw the weapon on to the floor  illustration burleigh with a feeling of nausea drew back toward the door  the body of fletcher lay where it had fallen the white face turned up to the gas in life he had been a commonplacelooking man not to say vulgar now burleigh with a feeling of nausea drew back toward the door until the body was hidden by the table and relieved from the sight he could think more clearly he looked down carefully and examined his clothes and his boots then he crossed the room again and with his face averted turned out the gas something seemed to stir in the darkness and with a faint cry he blundered toward the door before he had realized that it was the clock it struck twelve  he stood at the head of the stairs trying to recover himself trying to think the gas on the landing below the stairs and the furniture all looked so prosaic and familiar that he could not realize what had occurred he walked slowly down and turned the light out the darkness of the upper part of the house was now almost appalling and in a sudden panic he ran down stairs into the lighted hall and snatching a hat from the stand went to the door and walked down to the gate  except for one window the neighbouring houses were in darkness and the lamps shone tip a silent street there was a little rain in the air and the muddy road was full of pebbles he stood at the gate trying to screw up his courage to enter the house again then he noticed a figure coming slowly up the road and keeping close to the palings  the full realization of what he had done broke in upon him when he found himself turning to fly from the approach of the constable the wet cape glistening in the lamplight the slow heavy step made him tremble suppose the thing upstairs was not quite dead and should cry out suppose the constable should think it strange for him to be standing there and follow him in he assumed a careless attitude which did not feel careless and as the man passed bade him goodnight and made a remark as to the weather  ere the sound of the other’s footsteps had gone quite out of hearing he turned and entered the house again before the sense of companionship should have quite departed the first flight of stairs was lighted by the gas in the hall and he went up slowly then he struck a match and went up steadily past the library door and with firm fingers turned on the gas in his bedroom and lit it he opened the window a little way and sitting down on his bed tried to think  he had got eight hours eight hours and two hundred pounds in small notes he opened his safe and took out all the loose cash it contained and walking about the room gathered up and placed in his pockets such articles of jewellery as he possessed  the first horror had now to some extent passed and was succeeded by the fear of death  with this fear on him he sat down again and tried to think out the first moves in that game of skill of which his life was the stake he had often read of people of hasty temper evading the police for a time and eventually falling into their hands for lack of the most elementary common sense he had heard it said that they always made some stupid blunder left behind them some damning clue he took his revolver from a drawer and saw that it was loaded if the worst came to the worst he would die quickly  eight hours’ start two hundred odd pounds he would take lodgings at first in some populous district and let the hair on his face grow when the hueandcry had ceased he would go abroad and start life again he would go out of a night and post letters to himself or better still postcards which his landlady would read postcards from cheery friends from a sister from a brother during the day he would stay in and write as became a man who described himself as a journalist  or suppose he went to the sea who would look for him in flannels bathing and boating with ordinary happy mortals he sat and pondered one might mean life and the other death which  his face burned as he thought of the responsibility of the choice so many people went to the sea at that time of year that he would surely pass unnoticed but at the sea one might meet acquaintances he got up and nervously paced the room again it was not so simple now that it meant so much as he had thought  the sharp little clock on the mantelpiece rang out one followed immediately by the deeper note of that in the library he thought of the clock it seemed the only live thing in that room and shuddered he wondered whether the thing lying by the far side of the table heard it he wondered—  he started and held his breath with fear somewhere down stairs a board creaked loudly then another he went to the door and opening it a little way but without looking out listened the house was so still that he could hear the ticking of the old clock in the kitchen below he opened the door a little wider and peeped out as he did so there was a sudden sharp outcry on the stairs and he drew back into the room and stood trembling before he had quite realized that the noise had been made by the cat the cry was unmistakable but what had disturbed it  there was silence again and he drew near the door once more he became certain that something was moving stealthily on the stairs he heard the boards creak again and once the rails of the balustrade rattled the silence and suspense were frightful suppose that the something which had been fletcher waited for him in the darkness outside  he fought his fears down and opening the door determined to see what was beyond the light from his room streamed out on to the landing and he peered about fearfully was it fancy or did the door of fletcher’s room opposite close as he looked was it fancy or did the handle of the door really turn  in perfect silence and watching the door as he moved to see that nothing came out and followed him he proceeded slowly down the dark stairs then his jaw fell and he turned sick and faint again the library door which he distinctly remembered closing and which moreover he had seen was closed when he went up stairs to his room now stood open some four or five inches he fancied that there was a rustling inside but his brain refused to be certain then plainly and unmistakably he heard a chair pushed against the wall  he crept to the door hoping to pass it before the thing inside became aware of his presence something crept stealthily about the room with a sudden impulse he caught the handle of the door and closing it violently turned the key in the lock and ran madly down the stairs  a fearful cry sounded from the room and a heavy hand beat upon the panels of the door the house rang with the blows but above them sounded the loud hoarse cries of human fear burleigh halfway down to the hall stopped with his hand on the balustrade and listened the beating ceased and a man’s voice cried out loudly for god’s sake to let him out  at once burleigh saw what had happened and what it might mean for him he had left the hall door open after his visit to the front and some wandering bird of the night had entered the house no need for him to go now no need to hide either from the hangman’s rope or the felon’s cell the fool above had saved him he turned and ran up stairs again just as the prisoner in his furious efforts to escape wrenched the handle from the door  who’s there he cried loudly  let me out cried a frantic voice for god’s sake open the door there’s something here  stay where you are shouted burleigh sternly stay where you are if you come out i’ll shoot you like a dog  the only response was a smashing blow on the lock of the door burleigh raised his pistol and aiming at the height of a man’s chest fired through the panel  the report and the crashing of the wood made one noise succeeded by an unearthly stillness then the noise of a window hastily opened burleigh fled hastily down the stairs and flinging wide the hall door shouted loudly for assistance  it happened that a sergeant and the constable on the beat had just met in the road they came toward the house at a run burleigh with incoherent explanations ran up stairs before them and halted outside the library door the prisoner was still inside still trying to demolish the lock of the sturdy oaken door burleigh tried to turn the key but the lock was too damaged to admit of its moving the sergeant drew back and shoulder foremost hurled himself at the door and burst it open  he stumbled into the room followed by the constable and two shafts of light from the lanterns at their belts danced round the room a man lurking behind the door made a dash for it and the next instant the three men were locked together  burleigh standing in the doorway looked on coldly reserving himself for the scene which was to follow except for the stumbling of the men and the sharp catch of the prisoner’s breath there was no noise a helmet fell off and bounced and rolled along the floor the men fell there was a sobbing snarl and a sharp click a tall figure rose from the floor the other on his knees still held the man down the standing figure felt in his pocket and striking a match lit the gas  the light fell on the flushed face and fair beard of the sergeant he was bareheaded and his hair dishevelled burleigh entered the room and gazed eagerly at the halfinsensible man on the floora short thickset fellow with a white dirty face and a black moustache his lip was cut and bled down his neck burleigh glanced furtively at the table the cloth had come off in the struggle and was now in the place where he had left fletcher  hot work sir said the sergeant with a smile it’s fortunate we were handy  the prisoner raised a heavy head and looked up with unmistakable terror in his eyes  all right sir he said trembling as the constable increased the pressure of his knee i ’ain’t been in the house ten minutes altogether by — i’ve not  the sergeant regarded him curiously  it don’t signify he said slowly ten minutes or ten seconds won’t make any difference  the man shook and began to whimper  it was ’ere when i come he said eagerly take that down sir i’ve only just come and it was ’ere when i come i tried to get away then but i was locked in  what was demanded the sergeant  that he said desperately  the sergeant following the direction of the terrorstricken black eyes stooped by the table then with a sharp exclamation he dragged away the cloth burleigh with a sharp cry of horror reeled back against the wall  all right sir said the sergeant catching him all right turn your head away  he pushed him into a chair and crossing the room poured out a glass of whiskey and brought it to him the glass rattled against his teeth but he drank it greedily and then groaned faintly the sergeant waited patiently there was no hurry  who is it sir he asked at length  my friend—fletcher said burleigh with an effort we lived together he turned to the prisoner  you damned villain  he was dead when i come in the room gentlemen said the prisoner strenuously he was on the floor dead and when i see ’im i tried to get out s’ ’elp me he was you heard me call out sir i shouldn’t ha’ called out if i’d killed him  all right said the sergeant gruffly you’d better hold your tongue you know  you keep quiet urged the constable  the sergeant knelt down and raised the dead man’s head  i ’ad nothing to do with it repeated the man on the floor i ’ad nothing to do with it i never thought of such a thing i’ve only been in the place ten minutes put that down sir  the sergeant groped with his left hand and picking up the japanese sword held it at him  i’ve never seen it before said the prisoner struggling  it used to hang on the wall said burleigh he must have snatched it down it was on the wall when i left fletcher a little while ago  how long inquired the sergeant  perhaps an hour perhaps half an hour was the reply i went to my bedroom  the man on the floor twisted his head and regarded him narrowly  you done it he cried fiercely you done it and you want me to swing for it  that ’ll do said the indignant constable  the sergeant let his burden gently to the floor again  you hold your tongue you devil he said menacingly  he crossed to the table and poured a little spirit into a glass and took it in his hand then he put it down again and crossed to burleigh  feeling better sir he asked  the other nodded faintly  you won’t want this thing any more said the sergeant  he pointed to the pistol which the other still held and taking it from him gently put it into his pocket  you’ve hurt your wrist sir he said anxiously  burleigh raised one hand sharply and then the other  this one i think said the sergeant i saw it just now  he took the other’s wrists in his hand and suddenly holding them in the grip of a vice whipped out something from his pocket—something hard and cold which snapped suddenly on burleigh’s wrists and held them fast  that’s right said the sergeant keep quiet  the constable turned round in amaze burleigh sprang toward him furiously  take these things off he choked have you gone mad take them off  all in good time said the sergeant  take them off cried burleigh again  for answer the sergeant took him in a powerful grip and staring steadily at his white face and gleaming eyes forced him to the other end of the room and pushed him into a chair  collins he said sharply  sir said the astonished subordinate  run to the doctor at the corner hard as you can run said the other this man is not dead  as the man left the room the sergeant took up the glass of spirits he had poured out and kneeling down by fletcher again raised his head and tried to pour a little down his throat burleigh sitting in his corner watched like one in a trance he saw the constable return with the breathless surgeon saw the three men bending over fletcher and then saw the eyes of the dying man open and the lips of the dying man move he was conscious that the sergeant made some notes in a pocketbook and that all three men eyed him closely the sergeant stepped toward him and placed his hand on his shoulder and obedient to the touch he arose and went with him out into the night     captain rogers   a man came slowly over the old stone bridge and averting his gaze from the dark river with its silent craft looked with some satisfaction toward the feeble lights of the small town on the other side he walked with the painful forced step of one who has already trudged far his worsted hose where they were not darned were in holes and his coat and kneebreeches were rusty with much wear but he straightened himself as he reached the end of the bridge and stepped out bravely to the taverns which stood in a row facing the quay  he passed the queen anne—a mere beershop—without pausing and after a glance apiece at the royal george and the trusty anchor kept on his way to where the golden key hung out a gilded emblem it was the best house in riverstone and patronized by the gentry but he adjusted his faded coat and with a swaggering air entered and walked boldly into the coffeeroom  the room was empty but a bright fire afforded a pleasant change to the chill october air outside he drew up a chair and placing his feet on the fender exposed his tattered soles to the blaze as a waiter who had just seen him enter the room came and stood aggressively inside the door  brandy and water said the stranger hot  the coffeeroom is for gentlemen staying in the house said the waiter  the stranger took his feet from the fender and rising slowly walked toward him he was a short man and thin but there was something so menacing in his attitude and something so fearsome in his stony brown eyes that the other despite his disgust for illdressed people moved back uneasily  brandy and water hot repeated the stranger and plenty of it d’ye hear  the man turned slowly to depart  stop said the other imperiously what’s the name of the landlord here  mullet said the fellow sulkily  send him to me said the other resuming his seat and hark you my friend more civility or ’twill be the worse for you  he stirred the log on the fire with his foot until a shower of sparks whirled up the chimney the door opened and the landlord with the waiter behind him entered the room but he still gazed placidly at the glowing embers  what do you want demanded the landlord in a deep voice  the stranger turned a little weazened yellow face and grinned at him familiarly  send that fat rascal of yours away he said slowly  the landlord started at his voice and eyed him closely then he signed to the man to withdraw and closing the door behind him stood silently watching his visitor  you didn’t expect to see me rogers said the latter  my name’s mullet said the other sternly what do you want  oh mullet said the other in surprise i’m afraid i’ve made a mistake then i thought you were my old shipmate captain rogers it’s a foolish mistake of mine as i’ve no doubt rogers was hanged years ago you never had a brother named rogers did you  i say again what do you want demanded the other advancing upon him  since you’re so good said the other i want new clothes food and lodging of the best and my pockets filled with money  you had better go and look for all those things then said mullet you won’t find them here  ay said the other rising well well—there was a hundred guineas on the head of my old shipmate rogers some fifteen years ago i’ll see whether it has been earned yet  if i gave you a hundred guineas said the innkeeper repressing his passion by a mighty effort you would not be satisfied  reads like a book said the stranger in tones of pretended delight what a man it is  he fell back as he spoke and thrusting his hand into his pocket drew forth a long pistol as the innkeeper a man of huge frame edged toward him  keep your distance he said in a sharp quick voice  the innkeeper in no wise disturbed at the pistol turned away calmly and ringing the bell ordered some spirits then taking a chair he motioned to the other to do the same and they sat in silence until the staring waiter had left the room again the stranger raised his glass  my old friend captain rogers he said solemnly and may he never get his deserts  from what jail have you come inquired mullet sternly  ’pon my soul said the other i have been in so many—looking for captain rogers—that i almost forget the last but i have just tramped from london two hundred and eighty odd miles for the pleasure of seeing your damned ugly figurehead again and now i’ve found it i’m going to stay give me some money  the innkeeper without a word drew a little gold and silver from his pocket and placing it on the table pushed it toward him  enough to go on with said the other pocketing it in future it is halves d’ye hear me halves and i’ll stay here and see i get it  he sat back in his chair and meeting the other’s hatred with a gaze as steady as his own replaced his pistol  a nice snug harbor after our many voyages he continued shipmates we were shipmates we’ll be while nick gunn is alive you shall never want for company lord do you remember the dutch brig and the fat frightened mate  i have forgotten it said the other still eyeing him steadfastly i have forgotten many things for fifteen years i have lived a decent honest life pray god for your own sinful soul that the devil in me does not wake again  fifteen years is a long nap said gunn carelessly what a godsend it ’ll be for you to have me by you to remind you of old times why you’re looking smug man the honest innkeeper to the life gad who’s the girl  he rose and made a clumsy bow as a girl of eighteen after a moment’s hesitation at the door crossed over to the innkeeper  i’m busy my dear said the latter somewhat sternly  our business said gunn with another bow is finished is this your daughter rog— mullet  my stepdaughter was the reply  illustration gunn placed a hand which lacked two fingers on his breast  gunn placed a hand which lacked two fingers on his breast and bowed again  one of your father’s oldest friends he said smoothly and fallen on evil days i’m sure your gentle heart will be pleased to hear that your good father has requested me—for a time—to make his house my home  any friend of my father’s is welcome to me sir said the girl coldly she looked from the innkeeper to his oddlooking guest and conscious of something strained in the air gave him a little bow and quitted the room  you insist upon staying then said mullet after a pause  more than ever replied gunn with a leer toward the door why you don’t think i’m afraid captain you should know me better than that  life is sweet said the other  ay assented gunn so sweet that you will share things with me to keep it  no said the other with great calm i am man enough to have a better reason  no psalm singing said gunn coarsely and look cheerful you old buccaneer look as a man should look who has just met an old friend never to lose him again  he eyed his man expectantly and put his hand to his pocket again but the innkeeper’s face was troubled and he gazed stolidly at the fire  see what fifteen years’ honest decent life does for us grinned the intruder  the other made no reply but rising slowly walked to the door without a word  landlord cried gunn bringing his maimed hand sharply down on the table  the innkeeper turned and regarded him  send me in some supper said gunn the best you have and plenty of it and have a room prepared the best  the door closed silently and was opened a little later by the dubious george coming in to set a bountiful repast gunn after cursing him for his slowness and awkwardness drew his chair to the table and made the meal of one seldom able to satisfy his hunger he finished at last and after sitting for some time smoking with his legs sprawled on the fender rang for a candle and demanded to be shown to his room  his proceedings when he entered it were but a poor compliment to his host not until he had poked and pried into every corner did he close the door then not content with locking it he tilted a chair beneath the handle and placing his pistol beneath his pillow fell fast asleep  despite his fatigue he was early astir next morning breakfast was laid for him in the coffeeroom and his brow darkened he walked into the hall and after trying various doors entered a small sittingroom where his host and daughter sat at breakfast and with an easy assurance drew a chair to the table the innkeeper helped him without a word but the girl’s hand shook under his gaze as she passed him some coffee  as soft a bed as ever i slept in he remarked  i hope that you slept well said the girl civilly  like a child said gunn gravely an easy conscience eh mullet  the innkeeper nodded and went on eating the other after another remark or two followed his example glancing occasionally with warm approval at the beauty of the girl who sat at the head of the table  a sweet girl he remarked as she withdrew at the end of the meal and no mother i presume  no mother repeated the other  gunn sighed and shook his head  a sad case truly he murmured no mother and such a guardian poor soul if she but knew well we must find her a husband  he looked down as he spoke and catching sight of his rusty clothes and broken shoes clapped his hand to his pocket and with a glance at his host sallied out to renew his wardrobe the innkeeper with an inscrutable face watched him down the quay then with bent head he returned to the house and fell to work on his accounts  in this work gunn returning an hour later clad from head to foot in new apparel offered to assist him mullett hesitated but made no demur neither did he join in the ecstasies which his new partner displayed at the sight of the profits gunn put some more gold into his new pockets and throwing himself back in a chair called loudly to george to bring him some drink  in less than a month the intruder was the virtual master of the golden key resistance on the part of the legitimate owner became more and more feeble the slightest objection on his part drawing from the truculent gunn dark allusions to his past and threats against his future which for the sake of his daughter he could not ignore his health began to fail and joan watched with perplexed terror the growth of a situation which was in a fair way of becoming unbearable  the arrogance of gunn knew no bounds the maids learned to tremble at his polite grin or his worse freedom and the men shrank appalled from his profane wrath george after ten years’ service was brutally dismissed and refusing to accept dismissal from his hands appealed to his master the innkeeper confirmed it and with lacklustre eyes fenced feebly when his daughter regardless of gunn’s presence indignantly appealed to him  the man was rude to my friend my dear he said dispiritedly  if he was rude it was because mr gunn deserved it said joan hotly  gunn laughed uproariously  gad my dear i like you he cried slapping his leg you’re a girl of spirit now i will make you a fair offer if you ask for george to stay stay he shall as a favour to your sweet self  the girl trembled  who is master here she demanded turning a full eye on her father  mullet laughed uneasily  this is business he said trying to speak lightly and women can’t understand it gunn is—is valuable to me and george must go  unless you plead for him sweet one said gunn  the girl looked at her father again but he turned his head away and tapped on the floor with his foot then in perplexity akin to tears she walked from the room carefully drawing her dress aside as gunn held the door for her  a fine girl said gunn his thin lips working a fine spirit ’twill be pleasant to break it but she does not know who is master here  she is young yet said the other hurriedly  i will soon age her if she looks like that at me again said gunn by — i’ll turn out the whole crew into the street and her with them an’ i wish it i’ll lie in my bed warm o’ nights and think of her huddled on a doorstep  his voice rose and his fists clenched but he kept his distance and watched the other warily the innkeeper’s face was contorted and his brow grew wet for one moment something peeped out of his eyes the next he sat down in his chair again and nervously fingered his chin  i have but to speak said gunn regarding him with much satisfaction and you will hang and your money go to the crown what will become of her then think you  the other laughed nervously  ’twould be stopping the golden eggs he ventured  don’t think too much of that said gunn in a hard voice i was never one to be baulked as you know  come come let us be friends said mullet the girl is young and has had her way  he looked almost pleadingly at the other and his voice trembled gunn drew himself up and regarding him with a satisfied sneer quitted the room without a word  affairs at the golden key grew steadily worse and worse gunn dominated the place and his vile personality hung over it like a shadow appeals to the innkeeper were in vain his health was breaking fast and he moodily declined to interfere gunn appointed servants of his own choosingbrazen maids and foulmouthed men the old patrons ceased to frequent the golden key and its bedrooms stood empty the maids scarcely deigned to take an order from joan and the men spoke to her familiarly in the midst of all this the innkeeper who had complained once or twice of vertigo was seized with a fit  joan flying to him for protection against the brutal advances of gunn found him lying in a heap behind the door of his small office and in her fear called loudly for assistance a little knot of servants collected and stood regarding him stupidly one made a brutal jest gunn pressing through the throng turned the senseless body over with his foot and cursing vilely ordered them to carry it upstairs  until the surgeon came joan kneeling by the bed held on to the senseless hand as her only protection against the evil faces of gunn and his proteges gunn himself was taken aback the innkeeper’s death at that time by no means suiting his aims  the surgeon was a man of few words and fewer attainments but under his ministrations the innkeeper after a long interval rallied the halfclosed eyes opened and he looked in a dazed fashion at his surroundings gunn drove the servants away and questioned the man of medicine the answers were vague and interspersed with latin freedom from noise and troubles of all kinds was insisted upon and joan was installed as nurse with a promise of speedy assistance  the assistance arrived late in the day in the shape of an elderly woman whose spartan treatment of her patients had helped many along the silent road she commenced her reign by punching the sick man’s pillows and having shaken him into consciousness by this means gave him a dose of physic after first tasting it herself from the bottle  after the first rally the innkeeper began to fail slowly it was seldom that he understood what was said to him and pitiful to the beholder to see in his intervals of consciousness his timid anxiety to earn the goodwill of the allpowerful gunn his strength declined until assistance was needed to turn him in the bed and his great sinewy hands were forever trembling and fidgeting on the coverlet  joan pale with grief and fear tended him assiduously her stepfather’s strength had been a proverb in the town and many a hasty citizen had felt the strength of his arm the increasing lawlessness of the house filled her with dismay and the coarse attentions of gunn became more persistent than ever she took her meals in the sickroom and divided her time between that and her own  gunn himself was in a dilemma with mullet dead his power was at an end and his visions of wealth dissipated he resolved to feather his nest immediately and interviewed the surgeon the surgeon was ominously reticent the nurse cheerfully ghoulish  four days i give him she said calmly four blessed days not but what he might slip away at any moment  gunn let one day of the four pass and then choosing a time when joan was from the room entered it for a little quiet conversation the innkeeper’s eyes were open and what was more to the purpose intelligent  you’re cheating the hangman after all snarled gunn i’m off to swear an information  the other by a great effort turned his heavy head and fixed his wistful eyes on him  mercy he whispered for her sake—give me—a little time  to slip your cable i suppose quoth gunn where’s your money where’s your hoard you miser  mullet closed his eyes he opened them again slowly and strove to think while gunn watched him narrowly when he spoke his utterance was thick and labored  come tonight he muttered slowly give me—time—i will make your —your fortune but the nursewatches  i’ll see to her said gunn with a grin but tell me now lest you die first  you will—let joan—have a share panted the innkeeper  yes yes said gunn hastily  the innkeeper strove to raise himself in the bed and then fell back again exhausted as joan’s step was heard on the stairs gunn gave a savage glance of warning at him and barring the progress of the girl at the door attempted to salute her joan came in pale and trembling and falling on her knees by the bedside took her father’s hand in hers and wept over it the innkeeper gave a faint groan and a shiver ran through his body  it was nearly an hour after midnight that nick gunn kicking off his shoes went stealthily out onto the landing a little light came from the partly open door of the sickroom but all else was in blackness he moved along and peered in  the nurse was siting in a highbacked oak chair by the fire she had slipped down in the seat and her untidy head hung on her bosom a glass stood on the small oak table by her side and a solitary candle on the high mantelpiece diffused a sickly light gunn entered the room and finding that the sick man was dozing shook him roughly  the innkeeper opened his eyes and gazed at him blankly  wake you fool said gunn shaking him again  the other roused and muttered something incoherently then he stirred slightly  the nurse he whispered  she’s safe enow said gunn i’ve seen to that  he crossed the room lightly and standing before the unconscious woman inspected her closely and raised her in the chair her head fell limply over the arm  dead inquired mullet in a fearful whisper  drugged said gunn shortly now speak up and be lively  the innkeeper’s eyes again travelled in the direction of the nurse  the men he whispered the servants  dead drunk and asleep said gunn biting the words the last day would hardly rouse them now will you speak damn you  i must—take care—of joan said the father  gunn shook his clenched hand at him  my money—is—is— said the other promise me on—your oath—joan  ay ay growled gunn how many more times i’ll marry her and she shall have what i choose to give her speak up you fool it’s not for you to make terms where is it  he bent over but mullet exhausted with his efforts had closed his eyes again and half turned his head  where is it damn you said gunn from between his teeth  mullet opened his eyes again glanced fearfully round the room and whispered gunn with a stifled oath bent his ear almost to his mouth and the next moment his neck was in the grip of the strongest man in riverstone and an arm like a bar of iron over his back pinned him down across the bed  you dog hissed a fierce voice in his ear i’ve got you—captain rogers at your service and now you may tell his name to all you can shout it you spawn of hell shout it  he rose in bed and with a sudden movement flung the other over on his back gunn’s eyes were starting from his head and he writhed convulsively  i thought you were a sharper man gunn said rogers still in the same hot whisper as he relaxed his grip a little you are too simple you hound when you first threatened me i resolved to kill you then you threatened my daughter i wish that you had nine lives that i might take them all keep still  he gave a halfglance over his shoulder at the silent figure of the nurse and put his weight on the twisting figure on the bed  you drugged the hag good gunn he continued tomorrow morning gunn they will find you in your room dead and if one of the scum you brought into my house be charged with the murder so much the better when i am well they will go i am already feeling a little bit stronger gunn as you see and in a month i hope to be about again  he averted his face and for a time gazed sternly and watchfully at the door then he rose slowly to his feet and taking the dead man in his arms bore him slowly and carefully to his room and laid him a huddled heap on the floor swiftly and noiselessly he put the dead man’s shoes on and turned his pockets inside out kicked a rug out of place and put a guinea on the floor then he stole cautiously down stairs and set a small door at the back open a dog barked frantically and he hurried back to his room the nurse still slumbered by the fire  she awoke in the morning shivering with the cold and being jealous of her reputation rekindled the fire and measuring out the dose which the invalid should have taken threw it away on these unconscious preparations for an alibi captain rogers gazed through halfclosed lids and then turning his grim face to the wall waited for the inevitable alarm     a tiger’s skin   the travelling signpainter who was repainting the sign of the cauliflower was enjoying a wellearned respite from his labours on the old table under the shade of the elms mammoth sandwiches and a large slice of cheese waited in an untied handkerchief until such time as his thirst should be satisfied at the other side of the table the oldest man in claybury drawing gently at a long clay pipe turned a dim and regretful eye up at the old signboard  i’ve drunk my beer under it for pretty near seventy years he said with a sigh it’s a pity it couldn’t ha’ lasted my time  the painter slowly pushing a wedge of sandwich into his mouth regarded him indulgently  it’s all through two young gentlemen as was passing through ’ere a month or two ago continued the old man they told smith the landlord they’d been looking all over the place for the ’cauliflower’ and when smith showed ’em the sign they said they thought it was the ’george the fourth’ and a very good likeness too  the painter laughed and took another look at the old sign then with the nervousness of the true artist he took a look at his own one or two shadows—  he flung his legs over the bench and took up his brushes in ten minutes the most fervent loyalist would have looked in vain for any resemblance and with a sigh at the pitfalls which beset the artist he returned to his interrupted meal and hailed the house for more beer  there’s nobody could mistake your sign for anything but a cauliflower said the old man it looks good enough to eat  the painter smiled and pushed his mug across the table he was a tenderhearted man and once—when painting the sign of the sir wilfrid lawson—knew himself what it was to lack beer he began to discourse on art and spoke somewhat disparagingly of the cauliflower as a subject with a shake of his head he spoke of the possibilities of a spotted cow or a blue lion  talking of lions said the ancient musingly i s’pose as you never ’eard tell of the claybury tiger it was afore your time in these parts i expect  the painter admitted his ignorance and finding that the allusion had no reference to an inn pulled out his pipe and prepared to listen  it’s a while ago now said the old man slowly and the circus the tiger belonged to was going through claybury to get to wickham when just as they was passing gill’s farm a steamingine they ’ad to draw some o’ the vans broke down and they ’ad to stop while the blacksmith mended it that being so they put up a big tent and ’ad the circus ’ere  i was one o’ them as went and i must say it was worth the money though henry walker was disappointed at the man who put ’is ’ead in the lion’s mouth he said that the man frightened the lion first before ’e did it  it was a great night for claybury and for about a week nothing else was talked of all the children was playing at being lions and tigers and suchlike and young roberts pretty near broke ’is back trying to see if he could ride horseback standing up  it was about two weeks after the circus ’ad gone when a strange thing ’appened the big tiger broke loose bill chambers brought the news first ’aving read it in the newspaper while ’e was ’aving his tea he brought out the paper and showed us and soon after we ’eard all sorts o’ tales of its doings  at first we thought the tiger was a long way off and we was rather amused at it frederick scott laughed ’imself silly a’most up ’ere one night thinking ’ow surprised a man would be if ’e come ’ome one night and found the tiger sitting in his armchair eating the baby it didn’t seem much of a laughing matter to me and i said so none of us liked it and even sam jones as ’ad got twins for the second time said ’shame’ but frederick scott was a man as would laugh at anything  when we ’eard that the tiger ’ad been seen within three miles of claybury things began to look serious and peter gubbins said that something ought to be done but before we could think of anything to do something ’appened  we was sitting up ’ere one evening ’aving a mug o’ beer and a pipe—same as i might be now if i’d got any baccy left—and talking about it when we ’eard a shout and saw a raggedlooking tramp running toward us as ’ard as he could run every now and then he’d look over ’is shoulder and give a shout and then run ’arder than afore  ’it’s the tiger’ ses bill chambers and afore you could wink a’most he was inside the house ’aving first upset smith and a pot o’ beer in the doorway  before he could get up smith ’ad to wait till we was all in his langwidge was awful for a man as ’ad a license to lose and everybody shouting ’tiger’ as they trod on ’im didn’t ease ’is mind he was inside a’most as soon as the last man though and in a flash he ’ad the door bolted just as the tramp flung ’imself agin it all out of breath and sobbing ’is hardest to be let in  ’open the door’ he ses banging on it  ’go away’ ses smith  ’it’s the tiger’ screams the tramp ’open the door’  ’you go away’ ses smith ’you’re attracting it to my place run up the road and draw it off’  just at that moment john biggs the blacksmith come in from the taproom and as soon as he ’eard wot was the matter ’e took down smith’s gun from behind the bar and said he was going out to look after the wimmen and children  ’open the door’ he ses  he was trying to get out and the tramp outside was trying to get in but smith held on to that door like a briton then john biggs lost ’is temper and he ups with the gun—smith’s own gun mind you—and fetches ’im a bang over the ’ead with it smith fell down at once and afore we could ’elp ourselves the door was open the tramp was inside and john biggs was running up the road shouting ’is hardest  we ’ad the door closed afore you could wink a’most and then while the tramp lay in a corner ’aving brandy mrs smith got a bowl of water and a sponge and knelt down bathing ’er husband’s ’ead with it  ’did you see the tiger’ ses bill chambers  ’see it’ ses the tramp with a shiver ’oh lord’  he made signs for more brandy and henery walker wot was acting as landlord without being asked gave it to ’im  ’it chased me for over a mile’ ses the tramp ’my ’eart’s breaking’  he gave a groan and fainted right off a terrible faint it was too and for some time we thought ’ed never come round agin first they poured brandy down ’is throat then gin and then beer and still ’e didn’t come round but lay quiet with ’is eyes closed and a horrible smile on ’is face  he come round at last and with nothing stronger than water which mrs smith kept pouring into ’is mouth first thing we noticed was that the smile went then ’is eyes opened and suddenly ’e sat up with a shiver and gave such a dreadful scream that we thought at first the tiger was on top of us  then ’e told us ’ow he was sitting washing ’is shirt in a ditch when he ’eard a snuffling noise and saw the ’ead of a big tiger sticking through the hedge the other side he left ’is shirt and ran and ’e said that fortunately the tiger stopped to tear the shirt to pieces else ’is last hour would ’ave arrived  when ’e ’ad finished smith went upstairs and looked out of the bedroom winders but ’e couldn’t see any signs of the tiger and ’e said no doubt it ’ad gone down to the village to see wot it could pick up or p’raps it ’ad eaten john biggs  however that might be nobody cared to go outside to see and after it got dark we liked going ’ome less than ever  up to ten o’clock we did very well and then smith began to talk about ’is license he said it was all rubbish being afraid to go ’ome and that at any rate the tiger couldn’t eat more than one of us and while ’e was doing that there was the chance for the others to get ’ome safe two or three of ’em took a dislike to smith that night and told ’im so  the end of it was we all slept in the taproom that night it seemed strange at first but anything was better than going ’ome in the dark and we all slept till about four next morning when we woke up and found the tramp ’ad gone and left the front door standing wide open  we took a careful lookout and byandby first one started off and then another to see whether their wives and children ’ad been eaten or not not a soul ’ad been touched but the wimmen and children was that scared there was no doing anything with ’em none o’ the children would go to school and they sat at ’ome all day with the front winder blocked up with a mattress to keep the tiger out  nobody liked going to work but it ’ad to be done and as farmer gill said that tigers went to sleep all day and only came out toward evening we was a bit comforted not a soul went up to the ’cauliflower’ that evening for fear of coming ’ome in the dark but as nothing ’appened that night we began to ’ope as the tiger ’ad travelled further on  bob pretty laughed at the whole thing and said ’e didn’t believe there was a tiger but nobody minded wot ’e said bob pretty being as i’ve often told people the black sheep o’ claybury wot with poaching and wot was worse ’is artfulness  but the very next morning something ’appened that made bob pretty look silly and wish ’e ’adn’t talked quite so fast for at five o’clock frederick scott going down to feed ’is hins found as the tiger ’ad been there afore ’im and ’ad eaten no less than seven of ’em the side of the hin’ouse was all broke in there was a few feathers lying on the ground and two little chicks smashed and dead beside ’em  the way frederick scott went on about it you’d ’ardly believe he said that govinment ’ud ’ave to make it up to ’im and instead o’ going to work ’e put the two little chicks and the feathers into a pudding basin and walked to cudford four miles off where they ’ad a policeman  he saw the policeman william white by name standing at the back door of the ’fox and hounds’ public house throwing a ’andful o’ corn to the landlord’s fowls and the first thing mr white ses was ’it’s off my beat’ he ses  ’but you might do it in your spare time mr white’ ses frederick scott it’s very likely that the tiger’ll come back to my hin ’ouse for the rest of ’em and he’d be very surprised if ’e popped ’is ’ead in and see you there waiting for ’im’  he’d ’ave reason to be’ ses policeman white staring at ’im  ’think of the praise you’d get’ said frederick scott coaxing like  ’look ’ere’ ses policeman white ’if you don’t take yourself and that pudding basin off pretty quick you’ll come along o’ me d’ye see you’ve been drinking and you’re in a excited state’  he gave frederick scott a push and follered ’im along the road and every time frederick stopped to ask ’im wot ’e was doing of ’e gave ’im another push to show ’im  frederick scott told us all about it that evening and some of the bravest of us went up to the ’cauliflower’ to talk over wot was to be done though we took care to get ’ome while it was quite light that night peter gubbins’s two pigs went they were two o’ the likeliest pigs i ever seed and all peter gubbins could do was to sit up in bed shivering and listening to their squeals as the tiger dragged ’em off pretty near all claybury was round that sty next morning looking at the broken fence some of them looked for the tiger’s footmarks but it was dry weather and they couldn’t see any nobody knew whose turn it would be next and the most sensible man there sam jones went straight off ’ome and killed his pig afore ’e went to work  nobody knew what to do farmer hall said as it was a soldier’s job and ’e drove over to wickham to tell the police so but nothing came of it and that night at ten minutes to twelve bill chambers’s pig went it was one o’ the biggest pigs ever raised in claybury but the tiger got it off as easy as possible bill ’ad the bravery to look out of the winder when ’e ’eard the pig squeal but there was such a awful snarling noise that ’e daresn’t move ’and or foot  dicky weed’s idea was for people with pigs and suchlike to keep ’em in the house of a night but peter gubbins and bill chambers both pointed out that the tiger could break a back door with one blow of ’is paw and that if ’e got inside he might take something else instead o’ pig and they said that it was no worse for other people to lose pigs than wot it was for them  the odd thing about it was that all this time nobody ’ad ever seen the tiger except the tramp and people sent their children back to school agin and felt safe going about in the daytime till little charlie gubbins came running ’ome crying and saying that ’e’d seen it next morning a lot more children see it and was afraid to go to school and people began to wonder wot ’ud happen when all the pigs and poultry was eaten  then henery walker see it we was sitting inside ’ere with scythes and pitchforks and suchlike things handy when we see ’im come in without ’is hat his eyes were staring and ’is hair was all rumpled he called for a pot o’ ale and drank it nearly off and then ’e sat gasping and ’olding the mug between ’is legs and shaking ’is ’ead at the floor till everybody ’ad left off talking to look at ’im  ’wot’s the matter henery’ ses one of ’em  ’don’t ask me’ ses henery walker with a shiver  ’you don’t mean to say as ’ow you’ve seen the tiger ses bill chambers  henery walker didn’t answer ’im he got up and walked back’ards and for’ards still with that frightened look in ’is eyes and once or twice ’e give such a terrible start that ’e frightened us ’arf out of our wits then bill chambers took and forced ’im into a chair and give ’im two o’ gin and patted ’im on the back and at last henery walker got ’is senses back agin and told us ’ow the tiger ’ad chased ’im all round and round the trees in plashett’s wood until ’e managed to climb up a tree and escape it he said the tiger ’ad kept ’im there for over an hour and then suddenly turned round and bolted off up the road to wickham  it was a merciful escape and everybody said so except sam jones and ’e asked so many questions that at last henery walker asked ’im outright if ’e disbelieved ’is word  ’it’s all right sam’ ses bob pretty as ’ad come in just after henery walker ’i see ’im with the tiger after ’im’  ’wot’ ses henery staring at him  ’i see it all henery’ ses bob pretty ’and i see your pluck it was all you could do to make up your mind to run from it i believe if you’d ’ad a fork in your ’and you’d ’ave made a fight for it  everybody said ’bravo’ but henery walker didn’t seem to like it at all he sat still looking at bob pretty and at last ’e ses ’where was you’ ’e ses  ’up another tree henery where you couldn’t see me’ ses bob pretty smiling at ’im  henery walker wot was drinking some beer choked a bit and then ’e put the mug down and went straight off ’ome without saying a word to anybody i knew ’e didn’t like bob pretty but i couldn’t see why ’e should be cross about ’is speaking up for ’im as ’e had done but bob said as it was ’is modesty and ’e thought more of ’im for it  after that things got worse than ever the wimmen and children stayed indoors and kept the doors shut and the men never knew when they went out to work whether they’d come ’ome agin they used to kiss their children afore they went out of a morning and their wives too some of ’em even men who’d been married for years did and several more of ’em see the tiger while they was at work and came running ’ome to tell about it  the tiger ’ad been making free with claybury pigs and suchlike for pretty near a week and nothing ’ad been done to try and catch it and wot made claybury men madder than anything else was folks at wickham saying it was all a mistake and the tiger ’adn’t escaped at all even parson who’d been away for a holiday said so and henery walker told ’is wife that if she ever set foot inside the church agin ’ed ask ’is old mother to come and live with ’em  it was all very well for parson to talk but the very night he come back henery walker’s pig went and at the same time george kettle lost five or six ducks  he was a quiet man was george but when ’is temper was up ’e didn’t care for anything afore he came to claybury ’e ’ad been in the militia and that evening at the ’cauliflower’ ’e turned up with a gun over ’is shoulder and made a speech and asked who was game to go with ’im and hunt the tiger bill chambers who was still grieving after ’is pig said ’e would then another man offered until at last there was seventeen of ’em some of ’em ’ad scythes and some pitchforks and one or two of ’em guns and it was one o’ the finest sights i ever seed when george kettle stood ’em in rows of four and marched ’em off  they went straight up the road then across farmer gill’s fields to get to plashett’s wood where they thought the tiger ’ud most likely be and the nearer they got to the wood the slower they walked the sun ’ad just gone down and the wood looked very quiet and dark but john biggs the blacksmith and george kettle walked in first and the others follered keeping so close together that sam jones ’ad a few words over his shoulder with bill chambers about the way ’e was carrying ’is pitchfork  every now and then somebody ’ud say ’wot’s that’ and they’d all stop and crowd together and think the time ’ad come but it ’adn’t and then they’d go on agin trembling until they’d walked all round the wood without seeing anything but one or two rabbits john biggs and george kettle wanted for to stay there till it was dark but the others wouldn’t ’ear of it for fear of frightening their wives and just as it was getting dark they all come tramp tramp back to the ’cauliflower’ agin  smith stood ’em ’arf a pint apiece and they was all outside ’ere fancying theirselves a bit for wot they’d done when we see old man parsley coming along on two sticks as fast as ’e could come  ’are you brave lads alooking for the tiger’ he asks  ’yes’ ses john biggs  ’then ’urry up for the sake of mercy’ ses old mr parsley putting ’is ’and on the table and going off into a fit of coughing ’it’s just gone into bob pretty’s cottage i was passing and saw it’  george kettle snatches up ’is gun and shouts out to ’is men to come along some of ’em was for ’anging back at first some because they didn’t like the tiger and some because they didn’t like bob pretty but john biggs drove ’em in front of ’im like a flock o’ sheep and then they gave a cheer and ran after george kettle full pelt up the road  a few wimmen and children was at their doors as they passed but they took fright and went indoors screaming there was a lamp in bob pretty’s front room but the door was closed and the ’ouse was silent as the grave  george kettle and the men with the guns went first then came the pitchforks and last of all the scythes just as george kettle put ’is ’and on the door he ’eard something moving inside and the next moment the door opened and there stood bob pretty  ’what the dickens’ ’e ses starting back as ’e see the guns and pitchforks pointing at ’im  ’’ave you killed it bob’ ses george kettle  ’killed wot’ ses bob pretty ’be careful o’ them guns take your fingers off the triggers’  ’the tiger’s in your ’ouse bob’ ses george kettle in a whisper ’’ave you on’y just come in’  ’look ’ere’ ses bob pretty ’i don’t want any o’ your games you go and play ’em somewhere else’  ’it ain’t a game’ ses john biggs ’the tiger’s in your ’ouse and we’re going to kill it now then lads’  they all went in in a ’eap pushing bob pretty in front of ’em till the room was full only one man with a scythe got in and they wouldn’t ’ave let ’im in if they’d known it a’most made ’em forget the tiger for the time  george kettle opened the door wot led into the kitchen and then ’e sprang back with such a shout that the man with the scythe tried to escape taking henery walker along with ’im george kettle tried to speak but couldn’t all ’e could do was to point with ’is finger at bob pretty’s kitchen—and bob pretty’s kitchen was for all the world like a porkbutcher’s shop there was joints o’ pork ’anging from the ceiling two brine tubs as full as they could be and quite a string of fowls and ducks all ready for market  ’wot d’ye mean by coming into my ’ouse’ ses bob pretty blustering ’if you don’t clear out pretty quick i’ll make you’  nobody answered ’im they was all examining ’ands o’ pork and fowls and suchlike  ’there’s the tiger’ ses henery walker pointing at bob pretty ’that’s wot old man parsley meant’  ’somebody go and fetch policeman white’ ses a voice  ’i wish they would’ ses bob pretty ’i’ll ’ave the law on you all for breaking into my ’ouse like this see if i don’t’  ’where’d you get all this pork from’ ses the blacksmith  ’and them ducks and hins’ ses george kettle  ’that’s my bisness’ ses bob pretty staring ’em full in the face ’i just ’ad a excellent oppertunity offered me of going into the pork and poultry line and i took it now all them as doesn’t want to buy any pork or fowls go out o’ my house’  ’you’re a thief bob pretty’ says henery walker ’you stole it all’  ’take care wot you’re saying henery’ ses bob pretty ’else i’ll make you prove your words’  ’you stole my pig’ ses herbert smith  ’oh ’ave i’ ses bob reaching down a ’and o’ pork ’is that your pig’ he ses  ’it’s just about the size o’ my pore pig’ ses herbert smith  ’very usual size i call it’ ses bob pretty ’and them ducks and hins very usuallooking hins and ducks i call ’em except that they don’t grow ’em so fat in these parts it’s a fine thing when a man’s doing a honest bisness to ’ave these charges brought agin ’im dis’eartening i call it i don’t mind telling you that the tiger got in at my back winder the other night and took arf a pound o’ sausage but you don’t ’ear me complaining and going about calling other people thieves’  ’tiger be hanged’ ses henery walker who was almost certain that a loin o’ pork on the table was off ’is pig ’you’re the only tiger in these parts’  why henery’ ses bob pretty ’wot are you athinkin’ of where’s your memory why it’s on’y two or three days ago you see it and ’ad to get up a tree out of its way’  he smiled and shook ’is ’ead at ’im but henery walker on’y kept opening and shutting ’is mouth and at last ’e went outside without saying a word  ’and sam jones see it too’ ses bob pretty ’didn’t you sam’  sam didn’t answer ’im  ’and charlie hall and jack minns and a lot more’ ses bob ’besides i see it myself i can believe my own eyes i s’pose’  ’we’ll have the law on you’ ses sam jones  ’as you like’ ses bob pretty ’but i tell you plain i’ve got all the bills for this properly made out upstairs and there’s pretty near a dozen of you as’ll ’ave to go in the box and swear as you saw the tiger now can i sell any of you a bit o’ pork afore you go it’s delicious eating and as soon as you taste it you’ll know it wasn’t grown in claybury or a pair o’ ducks wot ’ave come from two ’undered miles off and yet look as fresh as if they was on’y killed last night’  george kettle whose ducks ’ad gone the night afore went into the front room and walked up and down fighting for ’is breath but it was all no good nobody ever got the better o’ bob pretty none of ’em could swear to their property and even when it became known a month later that bob pretty and the tramp knew each other nothing was done but nobody ever ’eard any more of the tiger from that day to this     a mixed proposal   major brill late of the fenshire volununteers stood in front of the small piece of glass in the hatstand and with a firm and experienced hand gave his new silk hat a slight tilt over the right eye then he took his cane and a new pair of gloves and with a military but squeaky tread passed out into the road it was a glorious day in early autumn and the soft english landscape was looking its best but despite the fact that there was nothing more alarming in sight than a few cows on the hillside a mile away the major paused at his gate and his face took on an appearance of the greatest courage and resolution before proceeding the road was dusty and quiet except for the children playing at cottage doors and so hot that the major heedless of the fact that he could not replace the hat at exactly the same angle stood in the shade of a tree while he removed it and mopped his heated brow  he proceeded on his way more leisurely overtaking despite his lack of speed another man who was walking still more slowly in the shade of the hedge  fine day halibut he said briskly fine day  beautiful said the other making no attempt to keep pace with him  country wants rain though cried the major over his shoulder  halibut assented and walking slowly on wondered vaguely what gaudy color it was that had attracted his eye it dawned on him at length that it must be the major’s tie and he suddenly quickened his pace by no means reassured as the man of war also quickened his  halloa brill he cried half a moment  the major stopped and waited for his friend halibut eyed the tie uneasily—it was fearfully and wonderfully made—but said nothing  well said the major somewhat sharply  oh—i was going to ask you brill—confound it i’ve forgotten what i was going to say now i daresay i shall soon think of it you’re not in a hurry  well i am rather said brill fact is— is my hat on straight halibut  the other assuring him that it was the major paused in his career and gripping the brim with both hands deliberately tilted it over the right eye again  you were saying— said halibut regarding this manoeuvre with secret disapproval  yes murmured the major i was saying well i don’t mind telling an old friend like you halibut though it is a profound secret makes me rather particular about my dress just now women notice these things i’m—sha’nt get much sympathy from a confirmed old bachelor like you—but i’m on my way to put a very momentous question  the devil you are said the other blankly  sir said the astonished major  not mrs riddel said halibut  certainly sir said the major stiffly why not  only that i am going on the same errand said the confirmed bachelor with desperate calmness  the major looked at him and for the first time noticed an unusual neatness and dressiness in his friend’s attire his collar was higher than usual his tie of the whitest and finest silk bore a pin he never remembered to have seen before and for the first time since he had known him the major with a strange sinking at the heart saw that he wore spats  this is extraordinary he said briefly well goodday halibut can’t stop  goodday said the other  the major quickened his pace and shot ahead and keeping in the shade of the hedge ground his teeth as the civilian on the other side of the road slowly but surely gained on him  it became exciting the major was handicapped by his upright bearing and short military stride the other a simple child of the city bent forward swinging his arms and taking immense strides at a bylane they picked up three small boys who trotting in their rear made it evident by their remarks that they considered themselves the privileged spectators of a footrace the major could stand it no longer and with a cut of his cane at the foremost boy softly called a halt  well said halibut stopping  the man’s manner was suspicious not to say offensive and the other had much ado to speak him fair  this is ridiculous he said trying to smile we can’t walk in and propose in a duet one of us must go today and the other tomorrow  certainly said halibut that’ll be the best plan  so childish said the major with a careless laugh two fellows walking in hot and tired and proposing to her  absurd replied halibut and both men eyed each other carefully  so if i’m unsuccessful old chap said the major in a voice which he strove to render natural and easy i will come straight back to your place and let you know so as not to keep you in suspense  you’re very good said halibut with some emotion but i think i’ll take today because i have every reason to believe that i have got one of my bilious attacks coming on tomorrow  pooh fancy my dear fellow said the major heartily i never saw you look better in my life  that’s one of the chief signs replied halibut shaking his head i’m afraid i must go today  i really cannot waive my right on account of your bilious attack said the major haughtily  your right said halibut with spirit  my right repeated the other i should have been there before you if you had not stopped me in the first place  but i started first said halibut  prove it exclaimed the major warmly  the other shrugged his shoulders  i shall certainly not give way he said calmly this is a matter in which my whole future is concerned it seems very odd not to say inconvenient that you should have chosen the same day as myself brill for such an errand—very odd  it’s quite an accident asseverated the major as a matter of fact halibut i nearly went yesterday that alone gives me i think some claim to precedence  just so said halibut slowly it constitutes an excellent claim  the major regarded him with moistening eyes this was generous and noble his opinion of halibut rose and now you have been so frank with me said the latter it is only fair that you should know i started out with the same intention three days ago and found her out so far as claims go i think mine leads  pure matter of opinion said the disgusted major it really seems as though we want an arbitrator well we’ll have to make our call together i suppose but i’ll take care not to give you any opportunity halibut so don’t cherish any delusions on that point even you wouldn’t have the hardihood to propose before a third party i should think but if you do i give you fair warning that i shall begin too  this is most unseemly said halibut we’d better both go home and leave it for another day  when do you propose going then asked the major  really i haven’t made up my mind replied the other  the major shrugged his shoulders  it won’t do halibut he said grimly it won’t do i’m too old a soldier to be caught that way  there was a long pause the major mopped his brow again i’ve got it he said at last  halibut looked at him curiously  we must play for first proposal said the major firmly we’re pretty evenly matched  chess gasped the other a whole world of protest in his tones  chess repeated the major  it is hardly respectful demurred halibut what do you think the lady would do if she heard of it  laugh replied the major with conviction  i believe she would said the other brightening i believe she would  you agree then  with conditions  conditions repeated the major  one game said halibut speaking very slowly and distinctly and if the winner is refused the loser not to propose until he gives him permission  what the deuce for inquired the other suspiciously  suppose i win replied halibut with suspicious glibness and was so upset that i had one of my bilious attacks come on where should i be why i might have to break off in the middle and go home a fellow can’t propose when everything in the room is going round and round  i don’t think you ought to contemplate marriage halibut remarked the major very seriously and gently  thanks said halibut dryly  very well said the major i agree to the conditions better come to my place and we’ll decide it now if we look sharp the winner may be able to know his fate today after all  halibut assenting they walked back together the feverish joy of the gambler showed in the major’s eye as they drew their chairs up to the little antique chess table and began to place their pieces ready for the fray then a thought struck him and he crossed over to the sideboard  if you’re feeling a bit off colour halibut he said kindly you’d better have a little brandy to pull yourself together i don’t wish to take a mean advantage  you’re very good said the other as he eyed the noble measure of liquid poured out by his generous adversary  and now to business said the major as he drew himself a little soda from a siphon  now to business repeated halibut rising and placing his glass on the mantelpiece  the major struggled fiercely with his feelings but despite himself a guilty blush lent colour to the other’s unfounded suspicions  remember the conditions said halibut impressively  here’s my hand on it said the other reaching over  halibut took it and his thoughts being at the moment far away gave it a tender respectful squeeze the major stared and coughed it was suggestive of practice  if the history of the duel is ever written it will be found not unworthy of being reckoned with the most famous combats of ancient times piece after piece was removed from the board and the major drank glass after glass of soda to cool his heated brain at the second glass halibut took an empty tumbler and helped himself suddenly there was a singing in the major’s ears and a voice a hateful triumphant voice said  checkmate  then did his gaze wander from knight to bishop and bishop to castle in a vain search for succour there was his king defied by a bishop—a bishop which had been hobnobbing with pawns in one corner of the board and which he could have sworn he had captured and removed full twenty minutes before he mentioned this impression to halibut  that was the other one said his foe i thought you had forgotten this i have been watching and hoping so for the last halfhour  there was no disguising the coarse satisfaction of the man he had watched and hoped not beaten him so the major told himself in fair play but by taking a mean and pitiful advantage of a pure oversight a sheer oversight he admitted it  halibut rose with a sigh of relief and the major mechanically sweeping up the pieces dropped them one by one into the box  plenty of time said the victor glancing at the clock i shall go now but i should like a wash first  the major rose and in his capacity of host led the way upstairs to his room and poured fresh water for his foe halibut washed himself delicately carefully trimming his hair and beard and anxiously consulting the major as to the set of his coat in the back after he had donned it again  his toilet completed he gave a satisfied glance in the glass and then followed the man of war sedately down stairs at the hall he paused and busied himself with the clothesbrush and hatpad modestly informing his glaring friend that he could not afford to throw any chances away and then took his departure  the major sat up late that night waiting for news but none came and by breakfasttime next morning his thirst for information became almost uncontrollable he toyed with a chop and allowed his coffee to get cold then he clapped on his hat and set off to halibut’s to know the worst  well he inquired as he followed the other into his diningroom  i went said halibut waving him to a chair  am i to congratulate you  well i don’t know was the reply perhaps not just yet  what do you mean by that said the major irascibly  well as a matter of fact said halibut she refused me but so nicely and so gently that i scarcely minded it in fact at first i hardly realized that she had refused me  the major rose and regarding his poor friend kindly shook and patted him lightly on the shoulder  she’s a splendid woman said halibut ornament to her sex remarked the major  so considerate murmured the bereaved one  good women always are said the major decisively i don’t think i’d better worry her today halibut do you  no i don’t said halibut stiffly  i’ll try my luck tomorrow said the major  i beg your pardon said halibut  eh said the major trying to look puzzled  you are forgetting the conditions of the game replied halibut you have to obtain my permission first  why my dear fellow said the major with a boisterous laugh i wouldn’t insult you by questioning your generosity in such a case no no halibut old fellow i know you too well  he spoke with feeling but there was an anxious note in his voice  we must abide by the conditions said halibut slowly and i must inform you brill that i intend to renew the attack myself  then sir said the major fuming you compel me to say—putting all modesty aside—that i believe the reason mrs riddel would have nothing to do with you was because she thought somebody else might make a similar offer  that’s what i thought said halibut simply but you see now that you have so unaccountably—so far as mrs riddel is concerned—dropped out of the running perhaps if i am gently persistent she’ll take me  the major rose and glared at him  if you don’t take care old chap said halibut tenderly you’ll burst something  gently persistent repeated the major staring at him gently persistent  remember bruce and his spider smiled the other  you are not going to propose to that poor woman nine times roared his incensed friend  i hope that it will not be necessary was the reply but if it is i can assure you my dear brill that i’m not going to be outclassed by a mere spider  but think of her feelings gasped the major  i have was the reply and i’m sure she’ll thank me for it afterward you see brill you and i are the only eligibles in the place and now you are out of it she’s sure to take me sooner or later  and pray how long am i to wait demanded the major controlling himself with difficulty  i can’t say said halibut but i don’t think it’s any good your waiting at all because if i see any signs that mrs riddel is waiting for you i may just give her a hint of the hopelessness of it  you’re a perfect mephistopheles sir bawled the indignant major halibut bowed  strategy my dear brill he said smiling strategy now why waste your time why not make some other woman happy why not try her companion miss philpotts i’m sure any little assistance—  the major’s attitude was so alarming that the sentence was never finished and a second later the speaker found himself alone watching his irate friend hurrying frantically down the path knocking the blooms off the geraniums with his cane as he went he saw no more of him for several weeks the major preferring to cherish his resentment in the privacy of his house the major also refrained from seeing the widow having a wholesome dread as to what effect the contemplation of her charms might have upon his plighted word  he met her at last by chance mrs riddel bowed coldly and would have passed on but the major had already stopped and was making wild and unmerited statements about the weather  it is seasonable she said simply  the major agreed with her and with a strongeffort regained his composure  i was just going to turn back he said untruthfully may i walk with you  i am not going far was the reply  with soldierly courage the major took this as permission with feminine precision mrs riddel walked about fifty yards and then stopped i told you i wasn’t going far she said sweetly as she held out her hand goodby  i wanted to ask you something said the major turning with her i can’t think what it was  they walked on very slowly the major’s heart beating rapidly as he told himself that the lady’s coldness was due to his neglect of the past few weeks and his wrath against halibut rose to still greater heights as he saw the cruel position in which that schemer had placed him then he made a sudden resolution there was no condition as to secrecy and first turning the conversation on to indoor amusements he told the astonished mrs riddel the full particulars of the fatal game mrs riddel said that she would never forgive them it was the most preposterous thing she had ever heard of and she demanded hotly whether she was to spend the rest of her life in refusing mr halibut  do you play high as a rule she inquired scornfully  sixpence a game replied the major simply  the corners of mrs riddel’s mouth relaxed and her fine eyes began to water then she turned her head away and laughed it was very foolish of us i admit said the major ruefully and very wrong i shouldn’t have told you only i couldn’t explain my apparent neglect without  apparent neglect repeated the widow somewhat haughtily  well put it down to a guilty conscience said the major it seems years to me since i have seen you  remember the conditions major brill said mrs riddel with severity  i shall not transgress them replied the major seriously  mrs riddel gave her head a toss and regarded him from the corner of her eyes  i am very angry with you indeed she said severely the major apologized again for losing added the lady looking straight before her  major brill caught his breath and his knees trembled beneath him he made a halfhearted attempt to seize her hand and then remembering his position sighed deeply and looked straight before him they walked on in silence  i think said his companion at last that if you like you can get back at cribbage what you lost at chess that is of course if you really want to  he wouldn’t play said the major shaking his head  no but i will said mrs riddel with a smile i think i’ve got a plan  she blushed charmingly and then in modest alarm at her boldness dropped her voice almost to a whisper the major gazed at her in speechless admiration and threw back his head in ecstasy come round tomorrow afternoon said mrs riddel pausing at the end of the lane mr halibut shall be there too and it shall be done under his very eyes  until that time came the major sat at home carefully rehearsing his part and it was with an air of complacent virtue that he met the somewhat astonished gaze of the persistent halibut next day it was a bright afternoon but they sat indoors and mrs riddel after an animated description of a game at cribbage with miss philpotts the night before got the cards out and challenged halibut to a game  they played two both of which the diplomatic halibut lost then mrs riddel dismissing him as incompetent sat drumming on the table with her fingers and at length challenged the major she lost the first game easily and began the second badly finally after hastily glancing at a new hand she flung the cards petulantly on the table face downward  would you like my hand major brill she demanded with a blush  better than anything in the world cried the major eagerly  halibut started and miss philpotts nearly had an accident with her crochet hook the only person who kept cool was mrs riddel and it was quite clear to the beholders that she had realized neither the ambiguity of her question nor the meaning of her opponent’s reply  well you may have it she said brightly  before miss philpotts could lay down her work before mr halibut could interpose the major took possession of mrs riddel’s small white hand and raised it gallantly to his lips mrs riddel with a faint scream which was a perfect revelation to the companion snatched her hand away i meant my hand of cards she said breathlessly  really brill really said halibut stepping forward fussily  oh said the major blankly cards  that’s what i meant of course said mrs riddel recovering herself with a laugh i had no idea still—if you prefer— the major took her hand again and miss philpotts set mr halibut an example—which he did not follow—by gazing meditatively out of the window finally she gathered up her work and quitted the room mrs riddel smiled over at mr halibut and nodded toward the major  illustration don’t you think major brill is somewhat hasty in his conclusions  don’t you think major brill is somewhat hasty in his conclusions she inquired softly  i’ll tell major brill what i think of him when i get him alone said the injured gentleman sourly     an adulteration act   dr frank carson had been dreaming tantalizing dreams of cooling effervescent beverages over and over again in his dreams he had risen from his bed and tripping lightly down to the surgery in his pajamas mixed himself something long and cool and fizzy without being able to bring the dream to a satisfactory termination  with a sudden start he awoke the thirst was still upon him the materials for quenching it just down one flight of stairs he would have smacked his lips at the prospect if they had been moist enough to smack as it was he pushed down the bedclothes and throwing one leg out of bedbecame firmly convinced that he was still dreaming  for the atmosphere was stifling and odorous and the ceiling descended in an odd bulging curve to within a couple of feet of his head still half asleep he raised his fist and prodded at it in astonishment—a feeling which gave way to one of stupefaction as the ceiling took another shape and swore distinctly  i must be dreaming mused the doctor even the ceiling seems alive  he prodded it againregarding it closely this time the ceiling at once rose to greater altitudes and at the same moment an old face with bushy whiskers crawled under the edge of it and asked him profanely what he meant by it it also asked him whether he wanted something for himself because if so he was going the right way to work  where am i demanded the bewildered doctor mary mary  he started up in bed and brought his head in sudden violent contact with the ceiling then before the indignant ceiling could carry out its threat of a moment before he slipped out of bed and stood on a floor which was in its place one moment and somewhere else the next  in the smell of bilgewater tar and the foetid atmosphere generally his clouded brain awoke to the fact that he was on board ship but resolutely declined to inform him how he got there he looked down in disgust at the ragged clothes which he had on in lieu of the usual pajamas and then as events slowly pieced themselves together in his mind remembered as the last thing that he could remember that he had warned his friend harry thomson solicitor that if he had any more to drink it would not be good for him  he wondered dimly as he stood whether thomson was there too and walking unsteadily round the forecastle roused the sleepers one by one and asked them whether they were harry thomson all answering with much fluency in the negative until he came to one man who for some time made no answer at all  the doctor shook him first and then punched him then he shook him again and gave him little scientific slaps until at length harry thomson in a faraway voice said that he was all right  well i’m glad i’m not alone said the doctor selfishly harry harry wake up  all ri’ said the sleeper i’m all ri’  the doctor shook him again and then rolled him backward and forward in his bunk under this gentle treatment the solicitor’s faculties were somewhat brightened and half opening his eyes he punched viciously at the disturber of his peace until threatening voices from the gloom promised to murder both of them  where are we demanded the doctor of a deep voice from the other side of the forecastle which had been particularly threatening  barque stella o’ course was the reply where’d you think you was  the doctor gripped the edge of his friend’s bunk and tried to think then a feeling of nausea overcoming all others he clambered hurriedly up the forecastle ladder and lurched to the side of the vessel  he leaned there for some time without moving a light breeze cooling his fevered brow and a small schooner some little distance from them playing seesaw as he closed his eyes to the heaving blue sea land was conspicuous by its absence and with a groan he turned and looked about him—at the white scrubbed deck the snowy canvas towering aloft on lazily creaking spars and the steersman leaning against the wheel regarding the officer who stood near by  dr carson feeling a little better walked sternly aft the officer turning round and glancing in surprise at his rags as he approached  i beg your pardon began the doctor in superior tones  and what the devil do you want demanded the second officer who told you to come along here  i want to know what this means said the doctor fiercely how dare you kidnap us on your beastly bilgetank  man’s mad murmured the astonished second officer  insufferable outrage continued the doctor take us back to melbourne at once  you get for’ard said the other sharply get for’ard and don’t let me have any more of your lip  i want to see the captain of this ship cried the doctor go and fetch him at once  illustration he saw another tatterdemalion coming toward him  the second officer gazed at him limp with astonishment and then turned to the steersman as though unable to believe his ears the steersman pointed in front of him and the other gave a cry of surprise and rage as he saw another tatterdemalion coming with uncertain steps toward him  carson said the new arrival feebly and coming closer to his friend clung to him miserably  i’m just having it out with ’em thomson said the doctor energetically my friend here is a solicitor tell him what ’ll happen if they don’t take us back harry  you seem to be unaware my good fellow said the solicitor covering a large hole in the leg of his trousers with his hand of the very dangerous situation in which you have placed yourselves we have no desire to be harsh with you—  not at all acquiesced the doctor nodding at the second officer  at the same time continued mr thomson—at the— he let go his friend’s arm and staggered away the doctor gazed after him sympathetically  his digestion is not all it should be he said to the second officer confidentially  if you don’t get for’ard in two twos said that gentleman explosively i’ll knock your heads off  the doctor gazed at him in haughty disdain and taking the limp thomson by the arm led him slowly away  how did we get here asked mr harry thomson feebly  the doctor shook his head  how did we get these disgusting clothes on continued his friend  the doctor shook his head again the last thing i can remember harry he said slowly was imploring you not to drink any more  i didn’t hear you said the solicitor crustily your speech was very indistinct last night  seemed so to you i dare say said the other  mr thomson shook his arm off and clinging to the mainmast leaned his cheek against it and closed his eyes he opened them again at the sound of voices and drew himself up as he saw the second officer coming along with a sternvisaged man of about fifty  are you the master of this vessel inquired the doctor stepping to his friend’s side  what the blazes has that got to do with you demanded the skipper look here my lads don’t you play any of your little games on me because they won’t do you’re both of you as drunk as owls  defamation of character said the solicitor feebly to his friend  allow me said the doctor with his best manner to inquire what all this means i am dr frank carson of melbourne this gentleman is my friend mr thomson of the same place solicitor  what roared the skipper the veins in his forehead standing out doctor solicitor why you damned rascals you shipped with me as cook and a b  there’s some mistake said the doctor i’m afraid i shall have to ask you to take us back i hope you haven’t come far  take those scarecrows away cried the skipper hoarsely take them away before i do them a mischief i’ll have the law of somebody for shipping two useless lubbers as seamen look to me like pickpockets  you shall answer for this said carson foaming we’re professional men and we’re not going to be abused by a bargee  let him talk said mr thomson hurriedly drawing his friend away from the irate skipper let him talk  i’ll put you both in quod when we get to hongkong said the skipper meantime no work no food d’ye hear start and cook the breakfast mr doctor and you mr lawyer turn to and ask the boy to teach you an a b’s duties  he walked back to the cabin and the new cook was slowly pushed toward the galley by the second officer the new a b under the same gentle guidance being conducted back to the forecastle  fortunately for the new seamen the weather continued fine but the heat of the galley was declared by the new cook to be insupportable from the other hands they learned that they had been shipped with several others by a resourceful boardinghouse master the other hands being men of plain speech also said that they were brought aboard in a state of beastly and enviable intoxication and chaffed crudely when the doctor attributed their apparent state of intoxication to drugs  illustration you say you’re a doctor  you say you’re a doctor said the oldest seaman  i am said carson fiercely  wot sort of a doctor are you if you don’t know when your licker’s been played with then asked the old man as a grin passed slowly from mouth to mouth  i suppose it is because i drink so seldom said the doctor loftily i hardly know the taste of liquor myself while as for my friend mr thomson you might almost call him a teetotaler  next door to one said the solicitor who was sewing a patch on his trousers as he looked up approvingly  you might call ’im a sailor if you liked said another seaman but that wouldn’t make him one all i can say is i never ’ad enough time or money to get in the state you was both in when you come aboard  if the forecastle was incredulous the cabin was worse the officers at first took but little notice of them but feeling their torn and tattered appearance was against them they put on so many airs and graces to counteract this that flesh and blood could not endure it quietly the cook would allude to his friend as mr thomson while the a b would persist in referring with a most affected utterance to dr carson  cook bawled the skipper one day when they were about a week out  dr carson who was peeling potatoes stepped slowly out of the galley and went toward him  you say ’sir’ when you’re spoken to said the skipper fiercely  the doctor sneered  my — if you sneer at me i’ll knock your head off said the other with a wicked look  when you get back to melbourne said the doctor quietly you’ll hear more of this  you’re a couple of pickpockets aping the gentleman said the skipper and he turned to the mate mr mackenzie what do these two ragamuffins look like  pickpockets said the mate dutifully  it’s a very handy thing said the old man jeeringly to have a doctor aboard first time i’ve carried a surgeon  mr mackenzie guffawed loudly  and a solicitor said the skipper gazing darkly at the hapless harry thomson who was cleaning brasswork handy in case of disputes he’s a real sea lawyer cook  sir said the doctor quietly  go down and tidy my cabin and see you do it well  the doctor went below without a word and worked like a housemaid when he came on deck again his face wore a smile almost of happiness and his hand caressed one trousers pocket as though it concealed a hidden weapon  for the following three or four days the two unfortunates were worked unceasingly mr thomson complained bitterly but the cook wore a sphinxlike smile and tried to comfort him  it won’t be for long harry he said consolingly  the solicitor sniffed i could write tract after tract on temperance he said bitterly i wonder what our poor wives are thinking i expect they have put us down as dead  crying their eyes out said the doctor wistfully but they’ll dry them precious quick when we get back and ask all sorts of questions what are you going to say harry  the truth said the solicitor virtuously  so am i said his friend but mind we must both tell the same tale whatever it is halloa what’s the matter  it’s the skipper said the boy who had just run up he wants to see you at once he’s dying  he caught hold of the doctor by the sleeve but carson in his most professional manner declined to be hurried he went leisurely down the companionladder and met with a careless glance the concerned faces of the mate and second officer  come to the skipper at once said the mate  does he want to see me said the doctor languidly as he entered the cabin  the skipper was lying doubled up in his bunk his face twisted with pain doctor he panted give me something quick there’s the medicinechest  do you want some food sir inquired the other respectfully  food be damned said the sufferer i want physic there’s the medicinechest the doctor took it up and held it out to him i don’t want the lot moaned the skipper  i want you to give me something for redhot corkscrews in the inside  i beg your pardon said the doctor humbly i’m only the cook  if you—don’t—prescribe for me at once said the skipper i’ll put you in irons  the doctor shook his head i shipped as cook he said slowly  give me something for heaven’s sake said the skipper humbly i’m dying the doctor pondered  if you dinna treat him at once i’ll break your skull said the mate persuasively  the doctor regarded him scornfully and turned to the writhing skipper  my fee is half a guinea a visit he said softly five shillings if you come to me  i’ll have half a guinea’s worth said the agonized skipper  the doctor took his wrist and calmly drew the second officer’s watch from its owner’s pocket then he inspected the sick man’s tongue and shaking his head selected a powder from the chest  you mustn’t mind its being nasty he said where’s a spoon  he looked round for one but the skipper took the powder from his hand and licked it from the paper as though it had been sherbet  for mercy’s sake don’t say it’s cholera he gasped  i won’t say anything said the doctor where did you say the money was  the skipper pointed to his trousers and mr mackenzie his national spirit rising in hot rage took out the agreed amount and handed it to the physician  am i in danger said the skipper  there’s always danger said the doctor in his best bedside manner have you made your will  the other turning pale shook his head perhaps you’d like to see a solicitor said carson in winning tones  i’m not bad enough for that said the skipper stoutly  you must stay here and nurse the skipper mr mackenzie said carson turning to the mate and be good enough not to make that snuffling noise it’s worrying to an invalid  snuffling noise repeated the horrorstruck mate  yes you’ve got an unpleasant habit of snuffling said the doctor it sometimes i worries me meant to speak to you about it before you mustn’t do it here if you want to snuffle go and snuffle on deck  the frenzied outburst of the mate was interrupted by the skipper don’t make that noise in my cabin mr mackenzie he said severely  both mates withdrew in dudgeon and carson after arranging the sufferer’s bedclothes quitted the cabin and sought his friend mr thomson was at first incredulous but his eyes glistened brightly at the sight of the halfsovereign  better hide it he said apprehensively the skipper ’ll have it back when he gets well it’s the only coin we’ve got  he won’t get well said dr carson easily not till we get to hongkong that is  what’s the matter with him whispered the solicitor  the doctor evading his eye pulled a long face and shook his head it may be the cooking he said slowly i’m not a good cook i admit it might be something got into the food from the medicinechest i shouldn’t be at all surprised if the mates are taken bad too  and indeed at that very moment the boy came rushing to the galley again bawling out that mr mackenzie was lying flat on his stomach in his bunk punching the air with his fists and rending it with his language the second officer appeared on deck as he finished his tale and glancing forward called out loudly for the cook  you’re wanted frank said the solicitor  when he calls me doctor i’ll go said the other stiffly  cook bawled the second officer cook cook  he came running forward his face red and angry and his fist doubled didn’t you hear me calling you he demanded fiercely  i’ve been promoted said carson sweetly i’m ship’s surgeon now  come down below at once or i’ll take you there by the scruff of your neck vociferated the other  you’re not big enough little man said the doctor still smiling well well lead the way and we’ll see what we can do  he followed the speechless second officer below and found the boy’s description of the first officer’s state as moonlight unto sunlight as water unto wine even the second officer was appalled at the spectacle and ventured a protest  gie me something at once yelled mr mackenzie  do you wish me to undertake your case inquired the doctor suavely  mr mackenzie said that he did in seven long abusive and wicked sentences  my fee is half a guinea said the doctor softly poor people who cannot afford more mates and the like i sometimes treat for less  i’ll die first howled the mate you won’t get any money out of me  very good said the doctor and rose to depart  bring him back rogers yelled the mate don’t let him go  but the second officer with a strange awesome look in his eyes was leaning back in his seat tightly gripping the edge of the table in both hands  come come said the doctor cheerily—what’s this you mustn’t be ill rogers i want you to nurse these other two  the other rose slowly to his feet and eyed him with lacklustre eyes tell the third officer to take charge he said slowly and if he’s to be nurse as well he’s got his hands full  the doctor sent the boy to apprise the third officer of his responsibilities and then stood watching the extraordinary and snakelike convolutions of mr mackenzie  how much—did—ye say hissed the latter  poor people repeated the doctor with relish five shillings a visit very poor people half a crown  i’ll have half a crown’s worth moaned the miserable mate  mr mackenzie said a faint voice from the skipper’s cabin  sir yelled the mate who was in torment  don’t answer me like that sir said the skipper sharply will you please to remember that i’m ill and can’t bear that horrible noise you’re making  i’m—ill—too gasped the mate  ill nonsense said the skipper severely we can’t both be ill how about the ship  there was no reply but from another cabin the voice of mr rogers was heard calling wildly for medical aid and offering impossible sums in exchange for it the doctor went from cabin to cabin and first collecting his fees administered sundry potions to the sufferers and then in his capacity of cook went forward and made an unsavory mess he called gruel which he insisted upon their eating  thanks to his skill the invalids were freed from the more violent of their pains but this freedom was followed by a weakness so alarming that they could hardly raise their heads from their pillows—a state of things which excited the intense envy of the third officer who owing to his responsibilities might just as well have been without one  in this state of weakness and with the fear of impending dissolution before his eyes the skipper sent for mr harry thomson and after some comparisons between lawyers and sharks in which stress was laid upon certain redeeming features of the latter paid a guinea and made his will his example save in the amount of the fee was followed by the mate but mr rogers being approached tentatively by the doctor in his friend’s behalf shook his head and thanked his stars he had nothing to leave he had enjoyed his money he said  they mended slowly as they approached hongkong though a fit of temper on mr mackenzie’s part during which he threw out ominous hints about having his money back led to a regrettable relapse in his case he was still in bed when they came to anchor in the harbour but the skipper and his second officer were able to go above and exchange congratulations from adjoining deckchairs  you are sure it wasn’t cholera asked the harbourmaster’s deputy who had boarded them in his launch after he had heard the story  positive said carson  very fortunate thing they had you on board said the deputy—very fortunate  the doctor bowed  seems so odd the three of them being down with it said the other looks as though it’s infectious doesn’t it  i don’t think so said the doctor accepting with alacrity an offer to go ashore in the launch and change into some decent clothes i think i know what it was  illustration the second officer leaned forward  the captain of the stella pricked up his ears and the second officer leaned forward with parted lips carson accompanied by the deputy and the solicitor walked toward the launch  what was it cried the skipper anxiously  i think that you ate something that disagreed with you replied the doctor grinning meaningly goodby captain  the master of the stella made no reply but rising feebly tottered to the side and shook his fist at the launch as it headed for the shore doctor carson who had had a pious upbringing kissed his hand in return     a golden venture   the elders of the tidger family sat at breakfast—mrs tidger with knees wide apart and the youngest tidger nestling in the valley of printdress which lay between and mr tidger bearing on one moleskin knee a small copy of himself in a red flannel frock and a slipper the larger tidger children took the solids of their breakfast up and down the stoneflagged court outside coming in occasionally to gulp draughts of very weak tea from a gallipot or two which stood on the table and to wheedle mr tidger out of any small piece of bloater which he felt generous enough to bestow  peg away ann said mr tidger heartily  his wife’s elder sister shook her head and passing the remains of her slice to one of her small nephews leaned back in her chair no appetite tidger she said slowly  you should go in for carpentering said mr tidger in justification of the huge crust he was carving into mouthfuls with his pocketknife seems to me i can’t eat enough sometimes hullo who’s the letter for  he took it from the postman who stood at the door amid a bevy of tidgers who had followed him up the court and slowly read the address  ’mrs ann pullen’ he said handing it over to his sisterinlaw nice writing too  mrs pullen broke the envelope and after a somewhat lengthy search for her pocket fumbled therein for her spectacles she then searched the mantelpiece the chest of drawers and the dresser and finally ran them to earth on the copper  she was not a good scholar and it took her some time to read the letter a proceeding which she punctuated with such ohs and ahs and gaspings and god bless my souls as nearly drove the carpenter and his wife who were leaning forward impatiently to the verge of desperation  who’s it from asked mr tidger for the third time  i don’t know said mrs pullen good gracious who ever would ha’ thought it  thought what ann demanded the carpenter feverishly  why don’t people write their names plain demanded his sisterinlaw impatiently it’s got a printed name up in the corner perhaps that’s it well i never did—i don’t know whether i’m standing on my head or my heels  you’re sitting down that’s what you’re adoing said the carpenter regarding her somewhat unfavourably  perhaps it’s a takein said mrs pullen her lips trembling i’ve heard o’ such things if it is i shall never get over it—never  get—over—what asked the carpenter  it don’t look like a takein soliloquized mrs pullen and i shouldn’t think anybody’d go to all that trouble and spend a penny to take in a poor thing like me  mr tidger throwing politeness to the winds leaped forward and snatching the letter from her read it with feverish haste tempered by a defective education  it’s a takein ann he said his voice trembling it must be  what is asked mrs tidger impatiently  looks like it said mrs pullen feebly  what is it screamed mrs tidger wrought beyond all endurance  her husband turned and regarded her with much severity but mrs tidger’s gaze was the stronger and after a vain attempt to meet it he handed her the letter  mrs tidger read it through hastily and then snatching the baby from her lap held it out with both arms to her husband and jumping up kissed her sister heartily patting her on the back in her excitement until she coughed with the pain of it  you don’t think it’s a takein polly she inquired  takein said her sister of course it ain’t lawyers don’t play jokes their time’s too valuable no you’re an heiress all right ann and i wish you joy i couldn’t be more pleased if it was myself  she kissed her again and going to pat her back once more discovered that she had sunk down sufficiently low in her chair to obtain the protection of its back  two thousand pounds said mrs pullen in an awestruck voice  ten hundered pounds twice over said the carpenter mouthing it slowly twenty hundered pounds  he got up from the table and instinctively realizing that he could not do full justice to his feelings with the baby in his arms laid it on the teatray in a puddle of cold tea and stood looking hard at the heiress  i was housekeeper to her eleven years ago said mrs pullen i wonder what she left it to me for  didn’t know what to do with it i should think said the carpenter still staring openmouthed  tidger i’m ashamed of you said his wife snatching her infant to her bosom i expect you was very good to her ann  i never ’ad no luck said the impenitent carpenter nobody ever left me no money nobody ever left me so much as a fipun note  he stared round disdainfully at his poor belongings and drawing on his coat took his bag from a corner and hoisting it on his shoulder started to his work he scattered the news as he went and it ran up and down the little main street of thatcham and thence to the outlying lanes and cottages within a couple of hours it was common property and the fortunate legatee was presented with a congratulatory address every time she ventured near the door  it is an old adage that money makes friends the carpenter was surprised to find that the mere fact of his having a moneyed relation had the same effect and that men to whom he had hitherto shown a certain amount of respect due to their position now sought his company they stood him beer at the bell and walked by his side through the street when they took to dropping in of an evening to smoke a pipe the carpenter was radiant with happiness  you don’t seem to see beyond the end of your nose tidger said the wife of his bosom after they had retired one evening  h’m said the startled carpenter  what do you think old miller the dealer comes here for demanded his wife  smoke his pipe replied her husband confidently  and old wiggett persisted mrs tidger  smoke his pipe was the reply why what’s the matter polly  mrs tidger sniffed derisively you men are all alike she snapped what do you think ann wears that pink bodice for  i never noticed she ’ad a pink bodice polly said the carpenter  no that’s what i say you men never notice anything said his wife if you don’t send them two old fools off i will  don’t you like ’em to see ann wearing pink inquired the mystified tidger  mrs tidger bit her lip and shook her head at him scornfully in plain english tidger as plain as i can speak it—she said severely they’re after ann and ’er bit o’ money  mr tidger gazed at her openmouthed and taking advantage of that fact blew out the candle to hide his discomposure what he said blankly at ’er time o’ life  watch ’em tomorrer said his wife  the carpenter acted upon his instructions and his ire rose as he noticed the assiduous attention paid by his two friends to the frivolous mrs pullen mr wiggett a sharpfeatured little man was doing most of the talking while his rival a stout cleanshaven man with a slow oxlike eye looked on stolidly mr miller was seldom in a hurry and lost many a bargain through his slowness—a fact which sometimes so painfully affected the individual who had outdistanced him that he would offer to let him have it at a still lower figure  illustration you get younger than ever mrs pullen  you get younger than ever mrs pullen said wiggett the conversation having turned upon ages  young ain’t the word for it said miller with a praiseworthy determination not to be left behind  no it’s age as you’re thinking of mr wiggett said the carpenter slowly none of us gets younger do we ann  some of us keeps young in our ways said mrs pullen somewhat shortly  how old should you say ann is now persisted the watchful tidger  mr wiggett shook his head i should say she’s about fifteen years younger nor me he said slowly and i’m as lively as a cricket  she’s fiftyfive said the carpenter  that makes you seventy wiggett said mr miller pointedly i thought you was more than that you look it  mr wiggett coughed sourly i’m fiftynine he growled nothing ’ll make me believe as mrs pullen’s fiftyfive nor anywhere near it  ho said the carpenter on his mettle—ho why my wife here was the sixth child and she— he caught a gleam in the sixth child’s eye and expressed her age with a cough the others waited politely until he had finished and mr tidger noticing this coughed again  and she— prompted mr miller displaying a polite interest  she ain’t so young as she was said the carpenter  cares of a family said mr wiggett plumping boldly i always thought mrs pullen was younger than her  so did i said mr miller much younger  mr wiggett eyed him sharply it was rather hard to have miller hiding his lack of invention by participating in his compliments and even improving upon them it was the way he dealt at marketlistening to other dealers’ accounts of their wares and adding to them for his own  i was noticing you the other day ma’am continued mr wiggett i see you going up the road with a step free and easy as a young girl’s  she allus walks like that said mr miller in a tone of surprised reproof  it’s in the family said the carpenter who had been uneasily watching his wife’s face  both of you seem to notice a lot said mrs tidger much more than you used to  mr tidger who was of a nervous and sensitive disposition coughed again  you ought to take something for that cough said mr wiggett considerately  gin and beer said mr miller with the air of a specialist  bed’s the best thing for it said mrs tidger whose temper was beginning to show signs of getting out of hand  mr tidger rose and looked awkwardly at his visitors mr wiggett got up and pretending to notice the time said he must be going and looked at mr miller that gentleman who was apparently deep in some knotty problem was gazing at the floor and oblivious for the time to his surroundings  come along said wiggett with feigned heartiness slapping him on the back  mr miller looking for a moment as though he would like to return the compliment came back to everyday life and bidding the company goodnight stepped to the door accompanied by his rival it was immediately shut with some violence  they seem in a hurry said wiggett i don’t think i shall go there again  i don’t think i shall said mr miller  after this neither of them was surprised to meet there again the next night and indeed for several nights the carpenter and his wife who did not want the money to go out of the family and were also afraid of offending mrs pullen were at their wits’ end what to do ultimately it was resolved that tidger in as delicate a manner as possible was to hint to her that they were after her money he was so vague and so delicate that mrs pullen misunderstood him and fancying that he was trying to borrow half a crown made him a present of five shillings  it was evident to the slowergoing mr miller that his rival’s tongue was giving him an advantage which only the everwatchful presence of the carpenter and his wife prevented him from pushing to the fullest advantage in these circumstances he sat for two hours after breakfast one morning in deep cogitation and after six pipes got up with a twinkle in his slow eyes which his brother dealers had got to regard as a danger signal  he had only the glimmering of an idea at first but after a couple of pints at the bell everything took shape and he cast his eyes about for an assistant they fell upon a man named smith and the dealer after some thought took up his glass and went over to him  i want you to do something for me he remarked in a mysterious voice  ah i’ve been wanting to see you said smith who was also a dealer in a small way one o’ them hins i bought off you last week is dead  i’ll give you another for it said miller  and the others are so forgetful continued mr smith  forgetful repeated the other  forget to lay like said mr smith musingly  never mind about them said mr miller with some animation i want you to do something for me if it comes off all right i’ll give you a dozen hins and a couple of decentishsized pigs  mr smith called a halt decentishsized was vague  take your pick said mr miller you know mrs pullen’s got two thousand pounds—  wiggett’s going to have it said the other he as good as told me so  he’s after her money said the other sadly look ’ere smith i want you to tell him she’s lost it all say that tidger told you but you wasn’t to tell anybody else wiggett ’ll believe you  mr smith turned upon him a face all wrinkles lit by one eye i want the hins and the pigs first he said firmly  mr miller shocked at his grasping spirit stared at him mournfully  and twenty pounds the day you marry mrs pullen continued mr smith  mr miller leading him up and down the sawdust floor besought him to listen to reason and mr smith allowed the better feelings of our common human nature to prevail to the extent of reducing his demands to half a dozen fowls on account and all the rest on the day of the marriage then with the delightful feeling that he wouldn’t do any work for a week he went out to drop poison into the ears of mr wiggett  lost all her money said the startled mr wiggett how  i don’t know how said his friend tidger told me but made me promise not to tell a soul but i couldn’t help telling you wiggett ’cause i know what you’re after  do me a favour said the little man  i will said the other  keep it from miller as long as possible if you hear any one else talking of it tell ’em to keep it from him if he marries her i’ll give you a couple of pints  mr smith promised faithfully and both the tidgers and mrs pullen were surprised to find that mr miller was the only visitor that evening he spoke but little and that little in a slow ponderous voice intended for mrs pullen’s ear alone he spoke disparagingly of money and shook his head slowly at the temptations it brought in its train give him a crust he said and somebody to halve it with—a homemade crust baked by a wife it was a pretty picture but somewhat spoiled by mrs tidger suggesting that though he had spoken of halving the crust he had said nothing about the beer  half of my beer wouldn’t be much said the dealer slowly  not the half you would give your wife wouldn’t retorted mrs tidger  the dealer sighed and looked mournfully at mrs pullen the lady sighed in return and finding that her admirer’s stock of conversation seemed to be exhausted coyly suggested a game of draughts the dealer assented with eagerness and declining the offer of a glass of beer by explaining that he had had one the day before yesterday sat down and lost seven games right off he gave up at the seventh game and pushing back his chair said that he thought mrs pullen was the most wonderful draughtplayer he had ever seen and took no notice when mrs tidger in a dry voice charged with subtle meaning said that she thought he was  draughts come natural to some people said mrs pullen modestly it’s as easy as kissing your fingers  mr miller looked doubtful then he put his great fingers to his lips by way of experiment and let them fall unmistakably in the widow’s direction mrs pullen looked down and nearly blushed the carpenter and his wife eyed each other in indignant consternation  that’s easy enough said the dealer and repeated the offense  mrs pullen got up in some confusion and began to put the draughtboard away one of the pieces fell on the floor and as they both stooped to recover it their heads bumped it was nothing to the dealer’s but mrs pullen rubbed hers and sat down with her eyes watering mr miller took out his handkerchief and going to the scullery dipped it into water and held it to her head  is it better he inquired  a little better said the victim with a shiver  mr miller in his emotion was squeezing the handkerchief hard and a cold stream was running down her neck  thank you it’s all right now  the dealer replaced the handkerchief and sat for some time regarding her earnestly then the carpenter and his wife displaying manifest signs of impatience he took his departure after first inviting himself for another game of draughts the following night  he walked home with the air of a conqueror and thought exultingly that the two thousand pounds were his it was a deal after his own heart and not the least satisfactory part about it was the way he had got the better of wiggett  he completed his scheme the following day after a short interview with the useful smith by the afternoon wiggett found that his exclusive information was common property and all thatcham was marvelling at the fortitude with which mrs pullen was bearing the loss of her fortune with a view of being out of the way when the denial was published mr miller after loudly expressing in public his sympathy for mrs pullen and his admiration of her qualities drove over with some pigs to a neighbouring village returning to thatcham in the early evening then hurriedly putting his horse up he made his way to the carpenter’s  the tidgers were at home when he entered and mrs pullen flushed faintly as he shook hands  i was coming in before he said impressively after what i heard this afternoon but i had to drive over to thorpe  you ’eard it inquired the carpenter in an incredulous voice  certainly said the dealer and very sorry i was sorry for one thing but glad for another  the carpenter opened his mouth and seemed about to speak then he checked himself suddenly and gazed with interest at the ingenuous dealer  i’m glad said mr miller slowly as he nodded at a friend of mrs tidger’s who had just come in with a long face because now that mrs pullen is poor i can say to her what i couldn’t say while she was rich  again the astonished carpenter was about to speak but the dealer hastily checked him with his hand  one at a time he said mrs pullen i was very sorry to hear this afternoon for your sake that you had lost all your money what i wanted to say to you now now that you are poor was to ask you to be mrs miller what d’ye say  mrs pullen touched at so much goodness wept softly and said yes the triumphant miller took out his handkerchief—the same that he had used the previous night for he was not an extravagant man—and tenderly wiped her eyes  well i’m blowed said the staring carpenter  i’ve got a nice little ’ouse continued the wily mr miller it’s a poor place but nice and we’ll play draughts every evening when shall it be  when you like said mrs pullen in a faint voice  i’ll put the banns up tomorrow said the dealer  mrs tidger’s lady friend giggled at so much haste but mrs tidger who felt that she had misjudged him was touched  it does you credit mr miller she said warmly  no no said the dealer and then mr tidger got up and crossing the room solemnly shook hands with him  money or no money she’ll make a good wife he said  i’m glad you’re pleased said the dealer wondering at this cordiality  i don’t deny i thought you was after her money continued the carpenter solemnly my missus thought so too  mr miller shook his head and said he thought they would have known him better  of course it is a great loss said the carpenter money is money  that’s all it is though said the slightly mystified mr miller  what i can’t understand is continued the carpenter ’ow the news got about why the neighbours knew of it a couple of hours before we did  the dealer hid a grin then he looked a bit bewildered again  i assure you said the carpenter it was known in the town at least a couple of hours before we got the letter  mr miller waited a minute to get perfect control over his features letter he repeated faintly  the letter from the lawyers said the carpenter  mr miller was silent again his features were getting tiresome he eyed the door furtively  whatwasinthe letter he asked  short and sweet said the carpenter with bitterness said it was all a mistake because they’d been and found another will people shouldn’t make such mistakes  we’re all liable to make mistakes said miller thinking he saw an opening  yes we made a mistake when we thought you was after ann’s money assented the carpenter i’m sure i thought you’d be the last man in the world to be pleased to hear that she’d lost it one thing is you’ve got enough for both  mr miller made no reply but in a dazed way strove to realize the full measure of the misfortune which had befallen him the neighbour with the anxiety of her sex to be the first with a bit of news had already taken her departure he thought of wiggett walking the earth a free man and of smith with a threemonths’ bill for twenty pounds his pride as a dealer was shattered beyond repair and emerging from a species of mist he became conscious that the carpenter was addressing him  we’ll leave you two young things alone  figure images011jpg  we’ll leave you two young things alone for a bit said mr tidger heartily we’re going out when you’re tired o’ courting you can play draughts and ann will show you one or two of ’er moves so long     three at table   the talk in the coffeeroom had been of ghosts and apparitions and nearly everybody present had contributed his mite to the stock of information upon a hazy and somewhat threadbare subject opinions ranged from rank incredulity to childlike faith one believer going so far as to denounce unbelief as impious with a reference to the witch of endor which was somewhat marred by being complicated in an inexplicable fashion with the story of jonah  talking of jonah he said solemnly with a happy disregard of the fact that he had declined to answer several eager questions put to him on the subject look at the strange tales sailors tell us  i wouldn’t advise you to believe all those said a bluff cleanshaven man who had been listening without speaking much you see when a sailor gets ashore he’s expected to have something to tell and his friends would be rather disappointed if he had not  it’s a wellknown fact interrupted the first speaker firmly that sailors are very prone to see visions  they are said the other dryly they generally see them in pairs and the shock to the nervous system frequently causes headache next morning  you never saw anything yourself suggested an unbeliever  man and boy said the other i’ve been at sea thirty years and the only unpleasant incident of that kind occurred in a quiet english countryside  and that said another man  i was a young man at the time said the narrator drawing at his pipe and glancing goodhumouredly at the company i had just come back from china and my own people being away i went down into the country to invite myself to stay with an uncle when i got down to the place i found it closed and the family in the south of france but as they were due back in a couple of days i decided to put up at the royal george a very decent inn and await their return  the first day i passed well enough but in the evening the dulness of the rambling old place in which i was the only visitor began to weigh upon my spirits and the next morning after a late breakfast i set out with the intention of having a brisk day’s walk  i started off in excellent spirits for the day was bright and frosty with a powdering of snow on the ironbound roads and nipped hedges and the country had to me all the charm of novelty it was certainly flat but there was plenty of timber and the villages through which i passed were old and picturesque  i lunched luxuriously on bread and cheese and beer in the bar of a small inn and resolved to go a little further before turning back when at length i found i had gone far enough i turned up a lane at right angles to the road i was passing and resolved to find my way back by another route it is a long lane that has no turning but this had several each of which had turnings of its own which generally led as i found by trying two or three of them into the open marshes then tired of lanes i resolved to rely upon the small compass which hung from my watch chain and go across country home  i had got well into the marshes when a white fog which had been for some time hovering round the edge of the ditches began gradually to spread there was no escaping it but by aid of my compass i was saved from making a circular tour and fell instead into frozen ditches or stumbled over roots in the grass i kept my course however until at four o’clock when night was coming rapidly up to lend a hand to the fog i was fain to confess myself lost  the compass was now no good to me and i wandered about miserably occasionally giving a shout on the chance of being heard by some passing shepherd or farmhand at length by great good luck i found my feet on a rough road driven through the marshes and by walking slowly and tapping with my stick managed to keep to it i had followed it for some distance when i heard footsteps approaching me  we stopped as we met and the new arrival a sturdylooking countryman hearing of my plight walked back with me for nearly a mile and putting me on to a road gave me minute instructions how to reach a village some three miles distant  i was so tired that three miles sounded like ten and besides that a little way off from the road i saw dimly a lighted window i pointed it out but my companion shuddered and looked round him uneasily  ’you won’t get no good there’ he said hastily  ’why not’ i asked  ’there’s a something there sir’ he replied ’what ’tis i dunno but the little ’un belonging to a gamekeeper as used to live in these parts see it and it was never much good afterward some say as it’s a poor mad thing others says as it’s a kind of animal but whatever it is it ain’t good to see’  ’well i’ll keep on then’ i said ’goodnight’  he went back whistling cheerily until his footsteps died away in the distance and i followed the road he had indicated until it divided into three any one of which to a stranger might be said to lead straight on i was now cold and tired and having half made up my mind walked slowly back toward the house  at first all i could see of it was the little patch of light at the window i made for that until it disappeared suddenly and i found myself walking into a tall hedge i felt my way round this until i came to a small gate and opening it cautiously walked not without some little nervousness up a long path which led to the door there was no light and no sound from within half repenting of my temerity i shortened my stick and knocked lightly upon the door  i waited a couple of minutes and then knocked again and my stick was still beating the door when it opened suddenly and a tall bony old woman holding a candle confronted me  ’what do you want’ she demanded gruffly  ’i’ve lost my way’ i said civilly ’i want to get to ashville’  ’don’t know it’ said the old woman  she was about to close the door when a man emerged from a room at the side of the hall and came toward us an old man of great height and breadth of shoulder  ’ashville is fifteen miles distant’ he said slowly  ’if you will direct me to the nearest village i shall be grateful’ i remarked  he made no reply but exchanged a quick furtive glance with the woman she made a gesture of dissent  ’the nearest place is three miles off’ he said turning to me and apparently trying to soften a naturally harsh voice ’if you will give me the pleasure of your company i will make you as comfortable as i can’  i hesitated they were certainly a queerlooking couple and the gloomy hall with the shadows thrown by the candle looked hardly more inviting than the darkness outside  ’you are very kind’ i murmured irresolutely ’but—’  ’come in’ he said quickly ’shut the door anne’  almost before i knew it i was standing inside and the old woman muttering to herself had closed the door behind me with a queer sensation of being trapped i followed my host into the room and taking the proffered chair warmed my frozen fingers at the fire  ’dinner will soon be ready’ said the old man regarding me closely ’if you will excuse me’  i bowed and he left the room a minute afterward i heard voices his and the old woman’s and i fancied a third before i had finished my inspection of the room he returned and regarded me with the same strange look i had noticed before  ’there will be three of us at dinner’ he said at length ’we two and my son’  i bowed again and secretly hoped that that look didn’t run in the family  ’i suppose you don’t mind dining in the dark’ he said abruptly  ’not at all’ i replied hiding my surprise as well as i could ’but really i’m afraid i’m intruding if you’ll allow me—’  he waved his huge gaunt hands ’we’re not going to lose you now we’ve got you’ he said with a dry laugh ’it’s seldom we have company and now we’ve got you we’ll keep you my son’s eyes are bad and he can’t stand the light ah here is anne’  as he spoke the old woman entered and eyeing me stealthily began to lay the cloth while my host taking a chair the other side of the hearth sat looking silently into the fire the table set the old woman brought in a pair of fowls ready carved in a dish and placing three chairs left the room the old man hesitated a moment and then rising from his chair placed a large screen in front of the fire and slowly extinguished the candles  ’blind man’s holiday’ he said with clumsy jocosity and groping his way to the door opened it somebody came back into the room with him and in a slow uncertain fashion took a seat at the table and the strangest voice i have ever heard broke a silence which was fast becoming oppressive  ’a cold night’ it said slowly  i replied in the affirmative and light or no light fell to with an appetite which had only been sharpened by the snack in the middle of the day it was somewhat difficult eating in the dark and it was evident from the behaviour of my invisible companions that they were as unused to dining under such circumstances as i was we ate in silence until the old woman blundered into the room with some sweets and put them with a crash upon the table  ’are you a stranger about here’ inquired the curious voice again  i replied in the affirmative and murmured something about my luck in stumbling upon such a good dinner  ’stumbling is a very good word for it’ said the voice grimly ’you have forgotten the port father’  ’so i have’ said the old man rising ’it’s a bottle of the celebrated today i will get it myself’  he felt his way to the door and closing it behind him left me alone with my unseen neighbour there was something so strange about the whole business that i must confess to more than a slight feeling of uneasiness  my host seemed to be absent a long time i heard the man opposite lay down his fork and spoon and half fancied i could see a pair of wild eyes shining through the gloom like a cat’s  with a growing sense of uneasiness i pushed my chair back it caught the hearthrug and in my efforts to disentangle it the screen fell over with a crash and in the flickering light of the fire i saw the face of the creature opposite with a sharp catch of my breath i left my chair and stood with clenched fists beside it man or beast which was it the flame leaped up and then went out and in the mere red glow of the fire it looked more devilish than before  for a few moments we regarded each other in silence then the door opened and the old man returned he stood aghast as he saw the warm firelight and then approaching the table mechanically put down a couple of bottles  ’i beg your pardon’ said i reassured by his presence ’but i have accidentally overturned the screen allow me to replace it’  ’no’ said the old man gently ’let it be  ’we have had enough of the dark i’ll give you a light’  he struck a match and slowly lit the candles then—i saw that the man opposite had but the remnant of a face a gaunt wolfish face in which one unquenched eye the sole remaining feature still glittered i was greatly moved some suspicion of the truth occurring to me  ’my son was injured some years ago in a burning house’ said the old man ’since then we have lived a very retired life when you came to the door we—’ his voice trembled ’that ismy son—’  ’i thought said the son simply ’that it would be better for me not to come to the dinnertable but it happens to be my birthday and my father would not hear of my dining alone so we hit upon this foolish plan of dining in the dark i’m sorry i startled you’  ’i am sorry’ said i as i reached across the table and gripped his hand ’that i am such a fool but it was only in the dark that you startled me’  from a faint tinge in the old man’s cheek and a certain pleasant softening of the poor solitary eye in front of me i secretly congratulated myself upon this last remark  ’we never see a friend’ said the old man apologetically ’and the temptation to have company was too much for us besides i don’t know what else you could have done’  ’nothing else half so good i’m sure’ said i  ’come’ said my host with almost a sprightly air ’now we know each other draw our chairs to the fire and let’s keep this birthday in a proper fashion’  he drew a small table to the fire for the glasses and produced a box of cigars and placing a chair for the old servant sternly bade her to sit down and drink if the talk was not sparkling it did not lack for vivacity and we were soon as merry a party as i have ever seen the night wore on so rapidly that we could hardly believe our ears when in a lull in the conversation a clock in the hall struck twelve  ’a last toast before we retire’ said my host pitching the end of his cigar into the fire and turning to the small table  we had drunk several before this but there was something impressive in the old man’s manner as he rose and took up his glass his tall figure seemed to get taller and his voice rang as he gazed proudly at his disfigured son  ’the health of the children my boy saved’ he said and drained his glass at a draught  the end                                    ————
