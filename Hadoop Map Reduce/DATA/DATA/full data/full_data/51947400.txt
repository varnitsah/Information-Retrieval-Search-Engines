estremedura as she lay rolling at anchor on the long moonlit heave that worked into the roadstead of santa cruz palma sobrecargo means much the same thing as purser and austin was an englishman though the estremedura was to all intents and purposes a spanish steamer she traded round the islands of the canary archipelago with mules and camels tomatoes bananas onions and seasick english tourists as fortune favoured her now as the heavily sealed document austin carried in his pocket declared she was to sail for las palmas grand canary with the cuban mail by the gracious permission of the young king of spain  he had trouble on getting on board of her for there were a good many bullocks swimming about her side waiting until the redcapped crew should heave them on board beneath the derrickboom by means of a rope twisted round their horns it probably hurt the bullocks and now and then one succumbed to a broken neck during the operation but the castilian who can face his losses placidly is not as a rule particularly merciful to his beast there were also stray sheep goats and donkeys as well as olivefaced peasants with blankets strapped about their shoulders wandering about the after portion of the main deck which was supposed to be reserved for the secondclass passengers when austin stopped a moment by the covered hatch a big electric light hung from the spardeck beams above his head and he looked about him with a little ironical smile  he was a young man of average stature and there was nothing especially distinguished in his appearance though he had good grey eyes and a pleasant bronzed face he was somewhat lightly made though he looked wiry and held himself well and there was a certain languidness in his smile which seemed to suggest that he was not addicted to troubling greatly about anything because the scotchman who ran the estremeduras engines had sold his white uniform jacket with the resplendent buttons a day or two before he was just then attired somewhat incongruously in a white cap with the very large and imposing badge of the spanish mail service clasped into the front of it a brown alpaca jacket white duck trousers and pipeclayed shoes the latter two items were however by no means immaculate since he had as a special favour to the mate brought off certain sheep and goats in his despatchboat as well as a camel tied astern of it spaniards and englishmen do not invariably agree but they lived like brothers on board the estremedura which however had its disadvantages austin objected in particular to the community of property  that evening the steamer hummed with life and the clatter of polyglot tongues parsee dealers in silverthread embroideries german commercial travellers madeiran portuguese canario hillmen and peninsular spaniards moved amidst the straying livestock while a little group of anglosaxons naturally sat apart upon the hatch there were as is usual when englishmen foregather in a country where wine is cheap empty bottles scattered about the engineer from the sister ship and an athletic tourist stripped at least as far as was permissible were wrestling in cumberland fashion on the hatch with much delicate manÅuvring of their feet and futile clutches at each others waists macallister who when he felt inclined superintended the estremeduras machinery alternately encouraged them sardonically and solaced himself with one of the bottles he was a big gaunt man and just then extremely dirty and when he saw austin he looked up with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes  i have been waiting for ye anxiously he said ye may now have the pleasure of lending me five dollars  im afraid not said austin decisively for one thing i havent got them i very seldom haveas you ought to know  macallister made a little gesture of resignation well he said ye have always your clothes and if ye had known us better ye would not have brought so many of them on board the estremedura im half expecting yon jackson o las palmas who gave us two dollars for the last white suit to come round for some more o them when we get in  austin tried the door of his room close by and was consoled to find it locked as he had left it  they cost me five and i naturally never saw a peseta of the money i suppose you kept the correo buttons  i did not said macallister unabashed ye may observe miguel the quartermaster walking round in them it was no a bad bargaina basket o big grapes an a watermelon  austin bore it patiently there was in fact nothing to be gained by protesting and he knew that it was useless to expostulate with macallister when he spoke his own tongue which was not an invariable custom with him then the engineer turned and glanced at the wrestlers who were still stamping up and down the hatch with feet spread well apart compassionately  theyve been at it the whole o a half hour an no a fall to cheer a body yet one would think it was dancing they were he said it wasnt to see that i wasted a tumblerful o anisow on them  now anisado is a preparation of spirit and extract of anise seed which is esteemed in that country and austin looked hard at his comrade because he had a jar of it intended for a spanish friend in his room he was a trifle uneasy since a lock is not an insuperable obstacle to an engineer the latter however changed the subject  its a kind o pity about your clothes he said miss jacinta brown is going across with us tonight an she was enquiring kindly after ye  austin had a good deal of composure and he often needed it but the shrewd scottish eyes saw the momentary pleasure in his face then because he did not appreciate macallisters badinage on that subject he went into his room and bolted the door behind him before he switched on the light and examined the anisado jar it seemed quite full when he shook it and the seal was intact but on looking closer he saw that the impression on the latter was not what it had been when he left it he was aware that a certain proportion of seawater may be added to rum without the average consumer noticing any great difference but he had suspicions that a blend of brine and anise was not likely to be appreciated by its recipient and he was for a moment or two consumed with righteous indignation this however passed for he realised that his expostulations would be heard with laughter it was all a part of the happygolucky life he led and nobody concerns himself unduly about anything under the flag of spain the castilian as a rule bears his troubles patiently which is perhaps just as well since he rarely sees them coming or makes any attempt to get out of the way of them  austin accordingly busied himself with his papers and it was an hour later when he went on deck the estremedura had gone to sea by then and the lights of the little spanish town blinked above the broad fringe of surf astern high above her the great black cordillera cut hard and sharp against the luminous blueness of the night and the long heave of the atlantic flashed whitetopped beneath the moon ahead she swung over it with slanted spars and swaying funnel while the keen tradebreeze sang in her rigging and now and then a flyingfish ricocheted gleaming from seatop to seatop beneath her side she was very well kept above decks a trim yachtlike vessel and for a while austin leaned over her quarterrails smoking a cigarette and wondering when miss jacinta brown would come up on deck there was a very deaf englishman who insisted on conversing with him in stentorian tones in the saloon and he had no desire for his company in the meanwhile it was pleasant to lounge there and watch the moonlight gleam upon the tumbling seas  there were he admitted a good many compensations in the life he led the warmth and colour of the south appealed to him and though they are not particularly numerous there are men like him who retain a somewhat chastened affection for the sea they earn their bread upon it is true that he earned very little more than that on board the estremedura and he had once had his aspirations like other men as well as a prospect of realising them but when financial disaster overtook the family firm nobody seemed anxious to secure the services of a young man without specialised training who had artistic and somewhat expensive tastes which was perhaps not altogether astonishing that was how austin eventually came on board the estremedura and stayed there though there were odd hours when he took himself to task for doing so still he did not exactly know where he could go if he left her and the indifference of the latins was already infecting him men in spain believe that the future is quite able to take care of itself  by and by however a slim whiteclad figure appeared in the entrance to the saloon companion and he moved in that direction with evident alacrity as one result of being the estremeduras sobrecargo he was acquainted with everybody of importance in the archipelago and among them all there was nobody who figured more prominently than miss jacinta brown she was english on both sides though she had lived in those islands most of her twentyfive years and understood the spaniards probably better than they understood themselves for they are rather an impulsive than an introspective people she also understood her countrymen and ruled over them as well as spanish artillery officers and commandantes it was not very evident how she did it for there were a good many spanish women at least almost as pretty and of much better birth than she and she apparently received no great assistance from her father for pancho brown was a merchant of an unusually solid and unimaginative description the wives of the english visitors however did not as a rule like jacinta they said she was forward and it was a pity she had no mother but when any of them received an invitation from her it was immediately proclaimed all over the hotel  she smiled at austin graciously and allowed him to place her a deck chair beneath a big lifeboat where it was out of the wind after which he procured himself another and sat down and looked at her jacinta did not seem to mind it and most men would probably have found it difficult to keep their eyes off her she was little shapely and very dainty though she could as austin knew on occasion be essentially dignified she had brown hair and eyes with a little scintillating gleam in them and her face was slightly tinted with the warm andalusian olive though there was only english blood in her she was dressed in white as usual with a simplicity that suggested perfect taste while as he watched her austin wondered again exactly where her compelling attractiveness lay he had met women with more delicate complexions finer features softer voices and more imposing carriage that is women who possessed one or two of these advantages but he had not as yet met any one to be compared to jacinta as he expressed it in the aggregate then it seemed that she read his thoughts which was as he had noticed a habit of hers  yes the dress is a new one i am rather pleased with it too she said  austin laughed if i hadnt had the pleasure of making your acquaintance some time ago you would have astonished me as it is  never mind said jacinta after all there is no great credit in telling people of your kind what they are thinking though i cant help it now and then you were wondering what anybody saw in me  now austin was too wise to fancy for a moment that jacinta was fishing for compliments she knew her own value too well to appreciate them unless they were particularly artistic and he surmised that she had merely desired to amuse herself by his embarrassment  if i was it was very unwise of me he said you are jacintaand one has to be content with that you cant be analysed  and you  i am the estremeduras sobrecargo which is perhaps a significant admission  jacinta nodded comprehension i think it is she said still since you considered yourself warranted in approving of my dress what are you doing in that jacket on a mail run  as usual there is a reason when i was across at arucas my comrades laid hands upon my garments and disposed of them at a bargain they had naturally squandered the money by the time i came back i am now longing for a few words with the man who i understand is coming down to purchase some more at an equally alarming sacrifice  jacinta laughed but she also looked at him with a little gleam in her eyes dont you think its rather a pity youarethe estremeduras sobrecargo  well said austin reflectively i wont pretend to misunderstand you but the trouble is that i dont quite see what else i could be i cannot dig and im not sure that it would be very pleasant to go round borrowing odd dollars from my friends even if they were disposed to lend them to me which is scarcely probable most of them would naturally tell me to look at them and see what i might have been if id had their diligence and probity besides i have time to paint little pictures which rash tourists buy occasionally and the life one leads here has its compensations  the estremeduras whistle hooted just then and as jacinta looked round a lordly fourmasted ship carrying everything to her royals swept up out of the night she was driving down the tradebreeze a good twelve knots an hour and the foam flew up in cascades as her bows went down swirled in a broad snowy smother along the slender streak of rushing hull above it four tapered spires of sailcloth swung back against the moonlight at every stately roll and she showed as an exquisite cameo cut in ebony on a ground of silver and blue still it was not the colour that formed the strength of that picture but the suggestion of effort and irresistible force that was stamped on it she drove by majestically showing a breadth of wet plates that flashed in a leeward roll and jacintas eyes rested on the bent figure high on the lifted poop grappling with her wheel  ah she said i suppose its sometimes brutal but that is mans work isnt it  austin laughed again though there was a faint warmth in his cheek of course i see the inference he said still it really isnt necessary for everybody to hold a big vessels wheel and i would a good deal sooner you said something nice to me nobody likes to be told the truth about themselves you know and i understand now why folks threw big stones at the goatskinned prophets long ago  well said jacinta we will talk of somebody else i wonder if you know that jefferson has been left a fortune or at least part of one  i didnt still im glad to hear it i like the man in fact hes the straightest one ive come across in his occupation which by the way is perhaps somewhat of an admission considering that hes an american  i like most americans for one thing theyre usually in earnest  and you like spaniards who certainly arent  we will waive the question its rather a coincidence that jefferson should have fallen in love about the same time  do i know the lady who is presumably in earnest too i dont like women who have a purpose openly though that does not apply to you you have usually a good many but nobody knows anything about them until you have accomplished them  jacinta ignored the compliment i dont think you know her but she is a friend of mine i went to school with her for two years in england  then of course shes nice  that said jacinta is naturally a matter of opinion she is however not in the least like me  in that case its difficult to see how she can be nice at all  jacinta smiled somewhat sardonically well she said muriel is bigger than i am and more solidin every wayas well as quiet and precise being the daughter of the clergyman of a forlorn little place in england she has of course had advantages which have been denied to me there are people who have to undertake their own training or do without any you know she very seldom says anything she does not mean and always knows exactly what she is going to do  im not sure that sounds particularly attractive  jacinta lifted her head and looked at him still she is worthoh ever so much morethan a good many such frivolous people as you or i you will see her yourself tomorrow she is coming across with us to las palmas and of course if you would like to please me  that goes without saying tomorrow we will endeavour to turn this ship upside down it usually has to be done when we have the honour of carrying a lady from any part of provincial england  i really dont want very much and jacinta smiled at him just the big forward room for her and the seat next me at the top of your table the nicest things have a way of getting there then she is fond of fruitand if you could get any of the very big moscatel and some of that membrillo jelly a few bunches of roses would look nice at our end of the table too  well said austin with a little whimsical gesture of resignation there is as you know a spanish commandante and his wife in that forward room but i suppose we shall have to turn them out the other things will naturally follow but im afraid majordomo antonio will call us dreadful names tomorrow  jacinta rose you are as nice as i expected you would be she said now it is getting chilly and i have a letter to write  she smiled at him and went forward walking though she was english with a curious buoyant gracefulness as spanish women do while austin sat still and considered the position he was quite aware that he would have trouble with the spanish commandante as well as his majordomo on the morrow but that was after all of no great importance when jacinta wanted anything she usually obtained it and it was not a little to be counted among her friends since she frequently contrived to do a good deal for them there were men as well as women in those islands who owed more than they were aware of to jacinta brown  austin sighed as he remembered it for he was a penniless sobrecargo and she in those islands at least a lady of station it must be sufficient for him to do what little he could to please her and he had in fact once or twice done a good deal he took life easily but there was in him a vein of chivalry which for the most part however found somewhat whimsical expression then he recollected that he had still certain documents to attend to and going down again locked himself into his room     chapter ii  an overheated journal   the estremedura lay rolling gently off the quaint old spanish city of santa cruz teneriffe most of the following day it was indeed late in the afternoon when she went to sea and while the jumble of white walls and redtiled roofs faded astern austin sat in a deckchair under a lifeboat while jacinta mrs hatherly and miss muriel gascoyne to whom he had been duly presented occupied a seat close by he was not particularly charmed with the latters company and decided that she was certainly as unlike jacinta as she very well could be  miss gascoyne was a clearcomplexioned blueeyed young englishwoman solidly put together and endued with a certain attractiveness but she was quiet and had a disconcerting way of looking at him in a fashion which vaguely suggested disapproval there was also what he felt to be a slightly irritating air of authority about her which seemed to suggest that she recognised the responsibility of her station as one who was looked up to in a remote corner of rural england mrs hatherly her aunt was a little withered old lady with ruddy cheeks and the stamp of vigorous health upon her though she had apparently been ordered south for the winter she became visibly interested when jacinta contrived to mention that austin was in charge of the estremeduras medicine chest  it really isnt my fault and i dont do more harm with it than i can help he said  then you have a knowledge of medicine asked the redcheeked lady  no said austin not in the least i had to get a sixpenny book from england to tell me the difference between a scruple and a drachm and im not sure about some of the measures yet you see i entered the profession quite by accident the manual in the drug chest was naturally in english as it was sent on board a spanish ship and the skipper who couldnt read it passed it on to me my first case was a great success unfortunately we were loading pine and one of the men contrived to get a splinter into the inner side of his eyelid i suppose it was a weakness but i really couldnt watch him going about in agony  is the desire to relieve a fellow creatures suffering a weakness asked miss gascoyne  austin appeared to reflect i almost think it is when the chances are tolerably even that youre going to blind him still i got the thing out and that man never quite knew the risks he ran the next week another of them dropped a hogshead on to his foot and smashed it badlythey dont wear boots you know he seemed quite convinced that i could cure him and as the risk was his i undertook the thing you can see him on the forecastle yonder and he isnt limping after that my fame went abroad and they send their cripples off to me at several of the desolate places we call at i always give them something but whatever quantity of water the manual recommends i put in twice as much  miss gascoyne looked at him curiously she had not met a young man of this type before and was not sure that she approved of him she also fancied that he was a trifle egotistical which he certainly was not and it never occurred to her that he was merely rambling on for her entertainment because he felt it his duty  dont you think that one should always have faith in ones prescriptions and act upon it said her aunt i endeavour to do so when i dose the village people who come to me  austin laughed well he said you see i havent any and perhaps if i had it would be a little rough on others still as a matter of fact they do get betterthat is most of them  miss gascoyne looked startled is it right to abuse the ignorant peoples credulity like that she said and stopped a trifle awkwardly while a little twinkle crept into jacintas eyes  mr austin hasnt really killed anybody yet she said you havent told us what you think of teneriffe muriel  miss gascoyne turned her face astern and there was appreciation and something deeper than that in her blue eyes which had seen very little of the glory of this world as yet high overhead the great black wall of the caÃ±adas cut a tremendous ebony rampart against the luminous blue and beyond it the peaks white cone gleamed ethereally above its wrappings of fleecy mist beneath the atlantic lay a sheet of glimmering turquoise in the lee of the island and outside of that there was a blinding blaze of sunlight on the whitetopped sea  it is beautifulwonderfully beautiful she said with a little tremble in her voice isnt it sad that such a country should be steeped in superstition  austin felt the last observation jar upon him for he knew that the inhabitants of that land would in respect of sobriety and morality compare very favourably with those of several more enlightened places he was acquainted with at home and that was going far enough for him still he could defer to anothers convictions when they were evidently sincere and it seemed to him that jacintas warning glance was a trifle unnecessary there was however an interruption just then for a steward appeared with a laden tray at the door of the captains room  doesnt don erminio take his comida in the saloon asked jacinta  no said austin not when we have english ladies on board hes a different man you know and some of them will insist on talking spanish to him its a little trying to have to admit you dont understand your own language  vaya said a deep voice beyond the open door eso no me gusta and while the steward backed out in haste a couple of plates went flying over the rail  don erminio said jacinta evidently doesnt approve of his dinner  miss gascoyne appeared astonished and looked at austin gravely  does he often lose his temper in that fashion she asked isnt it very childish to throwgood food into the sea  the captain is when you come to know him really a very goodnatured man said austin then he stopped and stood up suddenly as two figures came towards them along the deck and another from the opposite direction its monsignori wonder what macallister wants with him  a little portly priest moved forward with a smile of goodhumoured pride and an ecclesiastic of a very different stamp walked at his side the latter was a great man indeed a very great man though he had once toiled in comparative obscurity even miss gascoyne had apparently heard of him  if one could venture i should like to speak to him she said  neither jacinta nor austin seemed to hear her they were both watching macallister and he at least clearly intended to accost the clerics he was now dressed immaculately in blue uniform and in that condition he was a big handsome man but he was also a north british calvinist so far as he had any religious views at all and accordingly not one who could reasonably be expected to do homage to a dignitary of rome still the little fleshy priest was a friend of his and when the latter presented him he bent one knee a trifle and gravely took off his uniform cap the ecclesiastic raised two fingers and spoke in latin macallister smiled at him reassuringly  that isnt exactly what i meant but it cant do me any harm coming from a man like you while if it does me any good i daresay i need it you see im one of the goats he said  the great man glanced at his companion who translated as literally as he could though he also explained that the seÃ±or macallister not infrequently made things easier for some of the peasants who travelled third class on board the estremedura then a whimsical but very kindly twinkle crept into the great mans eyes and he laid a beautiful olivetinted hand on the shoulder of the mechanic who had graciously approved of him  if he is kind to these poor hill men he is a friend of mine the charity it covers manydifferences he said  then as they came aft together austin also took off his cap and touched miss gascoynes arm as he turned to the cleric the girl rose gravely with a tinge of heightened colour in her face and a little inclination and though nobody remembered exactly what was said unless it was the eminent cleric who was as usual with his kind a polished man of the world as well he moved on with the girl on one side of him and macallister talking volubly in a most barbarous jargon on the other mrs hatherly and the little priest took their places behind them and austin gathered that as a special favour macallister was going to show them all his engines jacinta leaned back in her seat and laughed musically  macallister she said is always unique and he will probably finish the entertainment by offering monsignor a glass of whiskey it is to be hoped he doesnt apostrophise his firemen with his usual fluency still do you know i am rather pleased with you you have made muriel happy  if i have pleased you it is rather more to the purpose said austin reflectively i have however noticed that when you express your approbation there is usually something else to be done  jacinta smiled it is very little after all but perhaps i had better explain muriel met jefferson who had been to london to see somebody on board the dahomey andim telling you this in confidencethere are reasons for believing the usual thing happened she is really good you know while jefferson is a somewhat serious man himself as well as an american they treat women rather well in his countryin fact they seem to idealise them now and then besides i understand it was remarkably fine weather  yes said austin who glanced suggestively across the sunlit heave towards the dim blue heights of grand canary it is one would believe quite easy to fall in love with any one pretty and clever during fine weather at sea that is of course on sufficient provocation there are also i think englishmen with some capacity for idealisationbut hadnt you better go on  jacinta pursed her lips as she looked at him with an assumption of severity but she proceeded now i had arranged for mrs hatherly and muriel to spend the winter in grand canary but she has heard of a doctor in one of the hotels at madeira and is bent on going there there is of course nothing the matter with her but if she approves of the doctor in question it is very probable that she will stay in that hotel until the spring still she is changeable and if she doesnt go at once it is possible that she will not go at all the madeira boat leaves las palmas about half an hour after we get there and i dont want mrs hatherly and muriel to catch her muriel doesnt want to either  austin shook his head dont you know that it is rather a serious thing to delay a spanish mailboat he said still i suppose you have decided that it must be done  i think so said jacinta sweetly i also fancy you and macallister could manage it between you you have my permission to tell him anything you think necessary  she rose and left him with this and austin who was not altogether pleased with his commission waited until after the four oclock comida when flinging himself down on a settee in the engineers room cigar in hand he put the case to macallister who grinned the latter as a rule appeared to find his native idiom more expressive in the evening  im no saying jacintas no fascinating an ive seen ye looking at her like a laddie eyeing a butterscotch he said still it can no be done neither o our reputations would stand it for one thing  we have nothing to do with the madeira boat and the lopez boat for cuba doesnt sail until an hour after her said austin besides jacinta wants it done  macallister looked thoughtful weel he said that is a reason jacinta thinks a good deal of me an if i was no married already i would show ye how to make up to her i would not sit down a long way off an look at her shes no liking ye any the better for that way of it  hadnt you better leave that out said austin stiffly im the estremeduras sobrecargo which is quite sufficient cant you have a burst tube or something of the kind  a burst tube is apt to result in somebody getting scalded an stepping into boiling water is sore on a primera maquinistas feet yell just have to make excuses to jacinta im thinking  austin who knew he could do nothing without macallisters cooperation was wondering what persuasion he could use when he was joined by an unexpected ally a big aggressive englishman in tourist apparel approached the messroom door and signed to him  you were not in your room he said as though this was a grievance  austin looked at him quietly im afraid i really havent the faculty of being in two places at once is there anything i can do for you  there is i particularly want to catch the liverpool boat via madeira tonight and the time you get in cuts it rather fine it occurred to me that you might be able to hurry her up a little  im sorry thats out of the question said austin languidly you see im not expected to interfere with this steamers engines  he was wondering how he could best favour the englishman with a delicate lefthanded compliment when macallister who was once more very dirty and wore only a dungaree jacket over his singlet broke in  i would he said like to see him try  may i ask who you are said the passenger who regarded him superciliously  ye may and there was a portentious gleam in macallisters eyes im only her chief engineer  ah said the other who did not consider it advisable to mention that he had supposed him to be a fireman well there are i believe means of obtaining a favour from a chief engineer you naturally dont get many pickings in this kind of boat  austin laughed softly for he knew his man it is now and then permissible to bestow an honorarium upon a chief engineer over a deal in coals but it requires to be done tactfully and when the stranger suggestively thrust his hand into his pocket macallister hove his six feet of length upright and looked down on him with a big hand clenched and blazing eyes  out o this before i shake some manners intil ye ye fifteenpoundtheroundtrip scum he said  the stranger backed away from him and then bolted incontinently as macallister made for the door austin laughed softly when he heard him falling over things in the dark alleyway and macallister sat down fuming  a bit doosoor on the coal trade is one thing but yon wasinsultin he said and then looked up with a sudden grin ill fix the waster can ye no smell a crankpin burning  i cant said austin still under the circumstances im quite willing to take your word for it  he went up on deck it was dark now but the moon was shining and he was not surprised to see a sooty fireman clambering in haste up the bridge ladder then the throb of the propeller slackened and when the estremedura lay rolling wildly athwart the long moonlit heave an uproar broke out in the engine room below the castilian is excitable and apt to lose his head when orders which he cannot understand are hurled at him while macallister when especially diligent did not trust to words alone but used lumps of coal and heavy steel spanners he was just then apparently chasing his greasers and firemen up and down the engine room there was a rush of apprehensive passengers towards the open skylights from which steam as well as bad language ascended and austin who went with them found jacinta by his side  i suppose its nothing dangerous she said  austin laughed if it were macallister would not be making so much noise in fact i dont think you need worry at all when miss jacinta brown expresses her wishes things are not infrequently apt to happen  jacinta smiled at him i have she said one or two faithful servants shall we move a little nearer and see what he is doing  im afraid the conversation of one of them is not likely to be of a kind that miss gascoyne for example would approve of  pshaw said jacinta and followed when austin made way for her to one of the skylights lifted frames  the estremedura was rolling wickedly and very scantily attired men were scrambling apparently without any definite purpose beneath the reeling lights which flashed upon the idle machinery they however seemed to be in bodily fear of macallister who held a spouting hose while a foamy soapy lather splashed up from the crankpit on the big shining connectingrod austin could see him dimly through a cloud of steam though he could think of no reason why any of the latter should be drifting about the engine room there were several english passengers about the skylights and the one with the aggressive manner was explaining his views to the rest  the man is either drunk or totally incapable he is doing nothing but shout he said you will notice that he spends half the time washing the connectingrods which as everybody knows cannot get hot if we miss the madeira boat i shall certainly call upon the companys manager  perhaps he spoke too loudly or it may have been an accident though austin who saw macallister flounder on the slippery floorplates as the steamer rolled did not think it was in any case he drew jacinta back and a moment later a jet from the spouting hose struck with a great splashing upon the glass the aggressive passenger who was looking down just then got most of it in his face and he staggered back dripping and gasping with anger when he once more became vociferous austin led jacinta away  im afraid we will not catch that boat but i really dont think you ought to hear macks retort he said  it was not quite half an hour later when the estremedura moved on again and macallister informed austin that he could not allow two journals to become overheated in the same voyage it would he said be too much of a coincidence and some of his subordinates did know a little about machinery they had accordingly some few minutes yet in hand when they swung round the high isleta cinder heap into sight of las palmas it gleamed above the surf fringe a cluster of twinkling lights at the black hills feet and there were other lights higher up on ships forestays behind the dusky line of mole in between the long atlantic heave flashed beneath the moon and there was scarcely two miles of it left austin standing forward with a pair of nightglasses and jacinta beside him watched the lights close on one another dejectedly  well be in inside ten minutes and i think the madeira boat has still her anchor down he said i had to give the quartermaster orders to have our lancha ready and hell take any passengers straight across to her  i believe you did what you could said jacinta still you see  oh yes said austin you like success  jacinta looked at him with a little enigmatical smile when any of my friends are concerned i believe i do  austin went aft and a little while later found macallister standing by the poop which was piled with banana baskets among which seasick canary peasants lay the big crane on the end of the mole was now on the estremeduras quarter and they were sliding into the mouth of the harbour close ahead with white steam drifting about her forecastle lay the madeira boat  theyre heaving up said the engineer jacinta will no be pleased with ye im thinking  theres only one thing left said austin one of us must fall in  macallister grinned then i know which it will be it was not me who swam across the harbour last trip but wait a moment theres a dozen or two spaniards among the baskets an im thinking nobody would miss one of them  austin who knew what his comrade was capable of seized hold of him but macallister shook his grasp off and disappeared among the baskets then there was a splash in the shadow beneath the ship a shout and a clamour broke out from the crowded deck a gong clanged below the captain shouted confused orders from his bridge and the estremedura slid forward with engines stopped past a british warship with her boats at the booms then in the midst of the confusion austin who was leaning on the rail wondering what had really happened felt himself gripped by the waist they had slid into the shadow of the isleta which lay black upon the water just there  noos your chance said a voice he knew its a hero shell think ye in ye go to the rescue  austin who was by no means certain that there was a man in the water at all had no intention of going if he could help it but as it happened he had no option the estremedura rolled just then he felt himself lifted and went out head foremost over the rail the steamer had gone on and left him when he rose to the surface but there was nobody either swimming or shouting in the water behind him he knew it would be a minute or two yet before they got the big passenger lancha over but the estremeduras propeller was thrashing astern and when she came back towards him he seized the boatwarp already lowered along her side nobody appeared to notice him for one of the british warships boats was then approaching she flashed by as he crawled in through the opened gangway and a man stood up in her  spanish mail ahoy he cried anybody speaking english aboard of you if so tell your skipper to go ahead we have got the banana basket he dropped over he can send for it tomorrow  austin slipped unnoticed into his room but he laughed as he heard the roar of a whistle and saw a long black hull ringed with lights slide by it was the madeira boat steaming down the harbour     chapter iii  on the veranda   it was a clear moonlight night when pancho brown mrs hatherly and erminio oliviera the estremeduras captain sat in big cane chairs on the veranda of the hotel catalina las palmas the catalina is long and low and fronted with a broad veranda a rather more sightly building than tourist hotels usually are and its row of windows blazed that night they were most of them wide open and the seductive strains of a soft spanish waltz drifted out with the rhythmic patter of feet and swish of light draperies for the winter visitors had organised a concert and informal dance a similar entertainment was apparently going on in the aggressively english metropole which cut a huge square block of building against the shining sea a little further up the straight white road while the artillery band was playing in the alameda of the town a mile or two away the deep murmur of the atlantic surf broke through the music in a drowsy undertone  pancho brown was essentially english a little portly gentleman with a heavy goodhumoured face he was precise in dress a little slow in speech and nobody at first sight would have supposed him to be brilliant commercially or otherwise still he had made money which is perhaps the most eloquent testimony to anybodys business ability he was then meditatively contemplating his daughter who was strolling in the garden with a young english officer from the big white warship in the harbour a broad blaze of silver stretched back across the sea towards the hazy blueness in the east beyond which lay africa and it was almost as light as day mrs hatherly followed his gaze  an only daughter must be a responsibility now and then she said i have never had one of my own but for the last few months my niece has been living with me and i have had my moments of anxiety  pancho brown who fancied she was leading up to something smiled in a fashion which suggested goodhumoured indifference though he was quite aware that his daughter was then talking very confidentially to the young naval officer  i am afraid i do not deserve your sympathy he said jacintas mother died when she was eight years old but ever since she came home from school in england jacinta has taken care of me in fact i almost think it is jacinta who feels the responsibility i am getting a little old and now and then my business enterprises worry me  and does that young girl know anything about them  jacinta said brown knows a good deal about everything and it really doesnt seem to do her any harm in fact i sometimes feel that she knows considerably more than i do i make mistakes now and then but if jacinta ever does i am not aware of them  still a girl with miss browns appearanceand advantagesmust naturally attract a good deal of attention and of course one has  brown smiled at her indulgently when jacinta chooses her husband i shall no doubt approve of him i am not sure he added with an air of reflection that it would make any great difference if i didnt  you are to be envied said his companion with a little sigh i feel the responsibility circumstances have placed on me is unpleasantly heavy and i am almost sorry i missed the madeira boat two or three weeks ago if we had gone in her we should not of course have been in las palmas now  it is almost as evident that i should have been left forlorn tonight said brown with cumbrous gallantry  mrs hatherly appeared to reflect it is a curious thing that miss brown assured me we should not catch the steamer that night though we had apparently half an hour to spare but in one respect it was perhaps fortunate after all if we had gone to madeira i should not have consulted dr lane who seems to understand my case so thoroughly but on the other hand we should have seen no more of mr jefferson  it is not such a long way to madeira and there is a steamer every week or so from what i know of mr jefferson i think it is possible he would have gone there too  you are well acquainted with him  brown glanced at her with a faint twinkle in his eyes i know a little about everybody in these islands madam mr jefferson is considered a straight man and i may mention that he meets with jacintas approval i almost think i could vouch for his character i wonder and he smiled genially if it would be as much to the purpose if i said that he had just been left eight thousand pounds  eight thousand pounds is not very much and mrs hatherly turned to him as if for guidance mr jefferson called on me this afternoon and it would be almost three weeks before i could get a letter from muriels father who trusted her to me of course a good deal would depend upon what i said about him but after all muriel has not a penny of her own  the sum in question is apt to go a long way when the man who has it is an american and i really think you could leave him and miss gascoyne to settle the affair between them brown stopped a moment and then added as if by an afterthought it is of course quite possible that they have done so already and in any case i am not sure my dear madam that jefferson would be very greatly discouraged by your opposition he isas has been saidan american  the little redcheeked lady made a gesture of resignation but just then captain oliviera who spoke a little english and appeared to feel himself neglected broke in  you come here for your healt seÃ±ora he said bueno my sobrecargo go by the step and he is savvy much the medsin me he cure frecuentemente by the morning ola i call him  otra vez said brown restrainingly and mrs hatherly favoured the captain who was big and lean and bronzed with a glance of interested scrutiny  you are an invalid too she said one would scarcely fancy it in fact you seem very robust to me what do you suffer from  brown made this a trifle plainer and don erminio smiled he had no great sense of fitness and was slightly reckless in his conversation  mi troat and the head of meby the morning he said and made a curious gurgling to give point to the explanation el sobrecargo he laugh and say aha mi captain you want a peekaup again it is of mucho effecto i go call him he make some for you  peekaup said mrs hatherly and brown laid his hand restrainingly upon the gallant skippers arm  it is a preparation they find beneficial at sea though i do not think it would suit your case he said and oliviera roused himself to a further effort  good man mi sobrecargo much education also friend of me i say him often carramba in spain is no dollar why you stay here aha seÃ±or austin savvy by and by he marry a rich english seÃ±orita  it occurred to mrs hatherly that browns face lost a trifle of its usual placidity as his eyes rested on his daughter who was however still apparently talking to the naval officer the catalina did not possess a particularly attractive garden then but there were a few dusty palms in it and any one strolling in their shadow that moonlight night could see the filmy mists drifting athwart the great black cordillera and the wisp of lights that twinkled above the hissing surf along the sweep of bay until they ended in a cluster where the whitewalled city rose above the tossing spray there were several pairs of young men and women who apparently found the prospect attractive but brown did not notice austin among them he and mrs hatherly sat in the shadow but oliviera was in the moonlight which was probably how it happened that a man who appeared in the lighted doorway close by turned towards him evidently without noticing the others  that you don erminio then come right along he said ive got to give somebody a good time and you have so much human nature its easy pleasing you get up on your hind feet and have some champagneenough to make your throat bad for a month if you feel like it  oliviera rose with alacrity aha he said i come  he wasted no time in doing it though he reluctantly spared a moment to make his companions a little grave inclination for don erminio was after all a castilian and when he had gone the two who were left looked at one another the joyous satisfaction in the voice and attitude of the man at the door had its significance for both of them mrs hatherly looked troubled but there was a faint twinkle in her companions eyes  i wonder if mr jefferson often gives his friends invitations of that kind she said  brown smiled reassuringly i almost think i could answer for his general abstemiousness still there are occasions upon which even the most sedate of us are apt to relax a little and wish to share our satisfaction with our friends  then said mrs hatherly with evident anxiety you fancy  i should almost fancy this is one of the occasions in question  the little redcheeked lady rose with a sigh i have tried to do my duty she said now i think i must find muriel if you will excuse me  she left him and when brown also sauntered into the hotel the veranda remained empty until jacinta came up the broad stairway just as it happened that austin came out of the door she was attired diaphanously in paletinted draperies and seemed to austin almost ethereal as she stopped a moment at the head of the stairway with the moonlight upon her he was however quite aware that material things had their value to jacinta brown and that few young women had a more useful stock of worldly wisdom in another moment she saw him and made him a little sign with her fan he drew forward a chair and then leaned against the balustrade looking down on her for it was evident that jacinta had something to say to him  as i havent seen you since that night on board the estremedura i naturally havent had an opportunity of complimenting you she said  may i ask upon what and austin looked a trifle uneasy  your discretion it would perhaps have been a little cold for a moonlight swim and ones clothing would also be apt to suffer after all there was of course no reason why it should afford you any pleasure to display your gallantry  austins face flushed there have been other occasions when it would have pleased me to twist macallisters neck he said no doubt you overheard what he said to me  i did said jacinta who looked at him quietly over her fan it is a little astonishing that neither of you noticed me still of course your attitude was at least sensible what i do not understand is why you saw fit to change it a minute or two later i had i may mention left the poop then  im not sure i understand  jacinta laughed musically now she said i really believe you do  well said austin with a doubtful smile if you think i went overboard of my own will to win your approbation you are mistaken i did not go at all i was in fact thrown in macallister is as you know a somewhat persistent person  ah said jacinta that explains a good deal well i feel almost tempted to be grateful to him for doing it though you were of course sensible there was really no reason why you should wish me to credit you with courage and humanityespecially when you didnt possess them  austin hoped she did not see that he winced for although he had borne a good deal of her badinage he felt his face grow hot he was quite aware that this girl was not for him and he had he believed succeeded in preventing himself falling in love with her it seemed quite fitting that she should regard him as one of her servants and since he could look for nothing more he was content with that he had however a spice of temper and sometimes she drove him a trifle too hard  still he said if i ever did anything really worth while i think i should insist upon your recognising it though it is scarcely likely that i shall have the opportunity  no said jacinta reflectively i scarcely think it is but after all i have a little to thank you for you see you did delay the estremedura i suppose you have not seen mr jefferson during the last half hour  no said austin with a little start of interest has he  he has muriel at least has evidently arrived at an understanding with him i am not sure they saw me but i came across them a little while agoand they looked supremely happy  there was satisfaction in her voice but it was with a mildly ironical and yet faintly wistful expression she gazed at the shining sea it somewhat astonished austin though there was so much about jacinta that was incomprehensible to him  well he said im glad but i should scarcely have fancied miss gascoyne would have attracted jefferson after all one would hardly consider her a young woman who had very much in her indeed i have wondered why you were so fond of her  jacinta smiled curiously as she looked at him she is wonderful to jefferson there is no grace or goodness that she is not endued with in his estimation  but if she doesnt possess them  then said jacinta decisively because he believes she does she will acquire them there are women like that you know and i am not sure that sensible people like you and i dont lose the best of life occasionally if a man believes a girl of muriels kind angelic she is very apt to unfold shining wings though nobody else ever fancied that she had anything of the kind about her  ah said austin who was a little stirred though he would not admit it no doubt you know a good many men must have thought that of you  jacinta laughed again no my friend she said i have met men who thought me amusing and two or three who thought me cleverbut that is a very different thingwhile it is possible that the others remembered i was pancho browns daughter so you see my wings have not unfolded in fact i sometimes think they are in danger of shrivelling away  there was nothing that austin could say for he was the estremeduras sobrecargo and had never forgotten that pancho brown was reputed to be making several thousand a year still he found silence difficult and changed the subject  well he said you havent told me yet why you are so fond of miss gascoyne  sheisgood and after all goodness really does appeal to some of us besides when i went to an english school a stranger more spanish than english in thought and sentiment and most of the others held aloof from me she saw i was lonely and came and made friends with me i was glad to cling to her then and you see i havent forgotten it  there was a tone in the girls voice which sent a little thrill through the man it was very clear that jacinta did not forget a kindness and he had once or twice already had glimpses of her deeper nature while he stood silent and as it happened in the shadow miss gascoyne came out of the door and approached jacinta with the moonlight on her face austin was almost startled as he glanced at her  when he had last seen muriel gascoyne he had considered her a comely english girl without imagination or sensibility she had in fact appeared to him narrow in her views totally unemotional and more than a little dull certainly not the kind of young woman to inspire or reciprocate passionate admiration in any discerning man now as she came towards him with her eyes shining and the soft colour in her face which was very gentle she seemed transfigured and almost radiant she stooped and kissed jacinta impulsively  i am so happy my dear she said we owe ever so much to you  austin had the grace to wish himself somewhere else though he did not see how he could get away but jacinta with her usual boldness turned in his direction  well she said i almost think you owe mr austin a little too if he hadnt stopped the estremedura you would probably have been in madeira now  again muriel gascoyne astonished austin for though it was evident she had not been aware of his presence she showed no embarrassment and smiled at him with a simplicity which though he had not expected it from her had in it the essence of all womanly dignity  yes she said i realise that mr austin harry has been looking for you everywhere  austin made her a little grave inclination and then because she seemed to expect it shook hands with her  i am glad that the man you have promised to marry is one of my friends he said there is not a better one in these islands  he did not remember what miss gascoyne said and perhaps it was not of any particular consequence but when she left them it happened that he and jacinta did not look at one another there was in fact an almost embarrassing silence and through it they heard the rhythmic swing of a soft spanish waltz and the deeptoned murmur of the sea then jacinta laughed  i wonder what you are thinking she said  austin smiled somewhat drily i was endeavouring to remember that there are a good many things the estremeduras sobrecargo must dispense with it is exceedingly unlikely that anybody will ever leave me eight thousand pounds  i fancy there are a good many of us who would like to have a good deal more than we will probably ever get said jacinta it can only be a very few who ever hear the celestial music at all and to them it comes but once in their life  austin looked at her quietly a little while ago i should not have considered miss gascoyne capable of hearing it but now and because i know the man she has promised to marry i almost think she will at least occasionally be able to catch an echo of it it must be difficult to hear that orchestra once and forget it  jacinta turned to him with a curious little smile in her eyes you and i are of course sensible people and fancies of that kind have nothing to do with us in the meanwhile it is really necessary that i should appear in one or two of the dances  austin made a little gesture that might have expressed anything and she rose and left him standing on the veranda     chapter iv  a big contract   it was the day after the dance at the catalina and austin was running into las palmas harbour in a powerful steam launch which had been lent him to convey certain documents to a spanish steamer the tradebreeze had veered a little further east that day as it sometimes did and the full drift of the long atlantic sea came rolling inshore the launch was wet with spray which flew up in clouds as she lurched over the whitetopped combers that burst in a chaotic spouting on a black volcanic reef not far away from her it also happened that the coaling companys new tug had broken down a few minutes earlier and when the launch drove past the long mole the first thing austin saw was a fortyton coal lighter loaded to the waters edge drifting towards the reef there was a boat astern of her out of which a couple of spanish peons seemed to be flinging the water preparatory to abandoning the lighter to her fate but austin could see very little of the latter the sea washed clean across her and she showed no more than a strip of sluicing side amidst the spray  what became of her was no business of his but when the whistle of a big grain tramp rolling across the mouth of the harbour and apparently waiting for her coal roared out a warning it occurred to austin that the spaniards in the boat might have considerable difficulty in pulling her clear of the reef against the sea accordingly he unloosed the launchs whistle and while it screeched dolefully put his helm over and ran down upon the lighter she was wallowing sideways towards the reef when he rounded up close alongside and saw somewhat to his astonishment that there was a man still on board he was very black though the spray was dripping from his face and the seas that swept over the lighters deck wet him to the knees austin shouted to him  ill run round to leeward jefferson so you can jump he said  the wet man swung an arm up stand by to take our rope im not going to jump  austin considered he was by no means sure that the launch had power enough to tow the lighter clear and the long white seething on the jagged lava astern of her suggested what would happen if she failed to do it  come on board i havent steam to pull her off he said  jefferson made an impatient gesture if you want me you have got to try  austin wasted no more time it was evidently valuable then and he knew his man he signed to the spanish fireman to back the launch astern and clutched the rope jefferson flung him as she drove across the lighters bows  i can tow her just as well with you on board here he roared  i guess you can and a sea wet jefferson to the waist as he floundered aft towards the lighters stern still youre going to find it awkward to steer her too  this was plain enough and austin decided that if jefferson meant to stay on board it was his affair while he was far from sure that he would gain anything by attempting to dissuade him even had there been time available as it was he realised that the lighter would probably go ashore while they discussed the question and he signed to the spanish fireman who started the little engine full speed ahead and then opened the furnace door there was a gush of flame from the funnel and the towrope tightened with a bang that jerked the launchs stern under then while she was held down by the wallowing lighter a big whitetopped sea burst across her forward and for a few seconds austin drenched and battered by the flying spray could see nothing at all when it blew astern he made out jefferson standing knee deep in water at the lighters helm though there was very little else visible through the rush of whitestreaked brine austin shouted to the fireman who once more opened the furnace door for that cold douche had suddenly made a different man of him  he did for the most part very little on board the estremedura and took life as easily as he could but there was another side of his nature which though it had been little stirred as yet came uppermost then as it did occasionally when he brought his despatches off at night in an open roadstead through the tradewind surf it was also known to the estremeduras skipper that he had once swum off to the steamer from the roaring beach at orotava when no fishermen in the little port would launch a barquillo out thus he felt himself in entire sympathy with jefferson as every big comber hove the launch up and the spray lashed his tingling skin while for five anxious minutes the issue hung in the balance launch and lighter went astern with the heavier seas and barely recovered the lost ground in the smooths when a roller failed to break quite so fiercely as its predecessors  then the spanish fireman either raised more steam or the heavy weight of coal astern at last acquired momentum for they commenced to forge ahead the launch plunging and rolling with red flame at her funnel and the smoke and spray and sparks blowing aft on austin who stood dripping to the skin at the tiller ahead the long seas that hove themselves up steeply in shoal water came foaming down on him but there was a little grim smile in his eyes and he felt his blood tingle as he watched them when he glanced over his shoulder which it was not advisable to do unguardedly he could see jefferson swung up above him on the lighters lifted stern and the long white smoother that ran seething up the reef  it however fell further behind them until he could put the helm over and run the lighter into smoother water behind the mole when jefferson flung up his arm again  swing her alongside the grain boat and then hold on a minute ill come ashore with you he said  austin stopped the launch and cast the towrope off and the lighter driving forward slid in under the big grain tramps side a few minutes later jefferson appeared at her gangway and when austin ran in jumped on board he was a tall man and was just then very wet and as black as any coal heaver this however rather added to the suggestion of forcefulness that usually characterised him  that fellow has been waiting several hours for his coal and as i couldnt get a man worth anything on to the crane i ran the thing myself he said the way the wind was it blew the grit all over me and im coming across for a wash with you im most afraid to walk through the port as i am just now  he laughed happily and austin fancied that he understood him since he felt that if he had held miss gascoynes promise he would not have liked to run any risk of meeting her in the state in which jefferson was just then as it happened it did not occur to either of them that they had done anything unusual which had perhaps its significance  austin took him on board the estremedura and when he had removed most of the coaldust from his person they sat down with a bottle of thin wine before them in the sobrecargos room jefferson was lean in face and person though he was largely made and had dark eyes that could smile and yet retain a certain intentness and gravity his voice had a little ring in it and big as he was he was seldom altogether still when he filled his glass his long fingers tightened on it curiously  i owe you a little for pulling us off just now but thats by no means all he said miss gascoyne told me how you stopped the boat that night three weeks ago now  austin laughed well take it item by item when you get started youre just a little overwhelming in the first place what are you coaling grain tramps for when somebody has left you a fortune  its not quite that said jefferson forty thousand dollars theyre busy at the coal wharf and wanted me to stay on until the month was up any way  i dont think you owe them very much said austin in fact im not sure that if id been you id have saved that coal for them but well get on i want to congratulate you on another thing and i really think you are a lucky man  the smile sank out of jeffersons eyes im quite sure of it he said gravely i get wondering sometimes how she ever came to listen to such a man as i am who isnt fit to look at her  austin made a little gesture of sympathy this was not what he would have said himself but he was an insular englishman and the reticence which usually characterises the species is less highly thought of across the atlantic the average american is more or less addicted to saying just what he means which is after all usually a convenience to everybody before he could speak jefferson went on  ive been wanting to thank you for stopping that steamer he said its the best turn anybody ever did me and im not going to forget it now  if youre pleased i am said austin who did not care for protestations of gratitude a trifle hastily any way you have got her and though its not my business the question is what youre going to do eight thousand pounds isnt very much after all and english girls are apt to want a good deal you know  jefferson laughed forty thousand dollars is quite a nice little sum to start with but ive got to double it before im married  there are people who would spend most of their life doing it said austin reflectively how long do you propose to allow yourself  six months and there was a snap in jeffersons voice and eyes if i havent got eighty thousand dollars in that time im going to have no use for them  when you come to think of it that isnt very long to make forty thousand dollars in said austin  he said nothing further for he had met other americans in his time and knew the cheerful optimism that not infrequently characterises them  jefferson looked at him steadily with the little glow still in his eyes you stopped the estremedura and in one respect youre not quite the same as most englishmen theyre hidebound it takes a month to find out what theyre thinking and then quite often it isnt worth while any way im going to talk i feel ive got to wouldnt you consider miss gascoyne was worth taking a big risk for  yes said austin remembering what he had seen in the girls face i should almost think she was  you would almost think and jefferson gazed at him a moment in astonishment well i guess you were made that way and you cant help it now im open to tell anybody who cares to listen that that girl was a revelation to me shes good all through theres not a thought in her that isnt clean and wholesome after all thats what a man wants to fall back upon then shes dainty clever and refined with sweetness and graciousness just oozing out of her its all round her like an atmosphere  austin was slightly amused though he would not for his life have shown it it occurred to him that an excess of the qualities his companion admired in miss gascoyne might prove monotonous especially if they were as in her case a little too obtrusive he also fancied that this was the first time anybody had called her clever still jeffersons supreme belief in the woman he loved appealed to him in spite of its somewhat too vehement expression and he reflected that there was probably some truth in jacintas observation that the woman whose lover credited her with all the graces might at least acquire some of them it seemed that a simple and somewhat narrowminded english girl without imagination such as miss gascoyne was in reality might still hear what jacinta called the celestial music and listening become transformed after all it was not mere passion which vibrated in jeffersons voice and had shone in muriel gascoynes eyes and austin vaguely realised that the faith that can believe in the apparently impossible and the charity that sees no shortcomings are not altogether of this earth then he brushed these thoughts aside and turned to his companion with a little smile  how did you ever come to be here jefferson he asked irrelevantly its rather a long way from the land of progress and liberty  jefferson laughed in a somewhat curious fashion well he said others have asked me but ill tell you and ive told miss gascoyne i had a good education and im thankful for it now there is money in the family but it was born in most of us to go to sea i went because i had to and it made trouble the man who had the money had plotted out quite a different course for me still i did well enough until the night the sachemthere are several of them but i guess you know the one i meanwent down i was mate but it wasnt in my watch the dutchman struck her  ah said austin softly that explains a good deal it wasnt exactly a pleasant story  he eat looking at his companion with grave sympathy as the details of a certain grim tragedy in which the brutally handled crew had turned upon their persecutors when the ship was sinking under them came back to him knowing tolerably well what usually happens when official enquiry follows upon a disaster at sea he had a suspicion that the truth had never become altogether apparent though the affair had made a sensation two or three years earlier still while jefferson had not mentioned his part in it he had already exonerated him  it was so unpleasant that i couldnt find a shipping company on our side who had any use for the sachems mate he said and his voice sank a little of course it never all came out but there were more than two of the men who went down that night who werent drowned well what could you expect of a man with a pistol when the one friend he had in that floating hell dropped at his feet with his head adzed open that left me and nolan aft he was a brutea murdering pitiless devil but there were he and i with our backs to the jiggermast and a few of the rest left who meant that we should never get into the quarterboat  austin was a trifle startled you told miss gascoyne that he said how did she take it  jefferson made a curious little gesture of course he said simply i had to she believed in me but do you think im going to tellyouhow it hurt her  it was borne in upon austin that after all he understood very little about women a few days earlier it would have seemed impossible to him that a girl with muriel gascoynes straitened views should ever have linked her life with one who had played a leading part in that revolting tragedy now however it was evident that there was very little she would not do for the man who loved her  im sorry youll excuse it he said still that scarcely explains how you came to las palmas  i came as deckhand on board a barque bringing tomato boxes over they were busy at the coaling wharf just then and i got put on you know the rest of it i was left forty thousand dollars  you havent told me yet how youre going to turn them into eighty thousand  im coming to it you know we coaled the cumbria before she went out to west africa a nearly new 1500ton tramp she was light draught at that or shed never have gone where she did you could put her down at Â£15000 sterling she went up into the halfcharted creeks behind the shoals and islands south of senegal and was lost there among other things it was a new gum she went for it appears the niggers find gums worth up to Â£5 the hundredweight in the bush behind that country a frenchman chartered her but hes dead now as is almost everybody connected with the cumbria theyve fevers that will wipe you out in a week or two yondermore fever in fact than anywhere else in africa well as everybody knows they got oil and sundries and a little gum and went down with fever while they crawled about those creeks loading her she got hard in the mud up one of them and half of the boys were buried before they pulled her out at all and then she hit something that started a plate or two in her they couldnt keep the water down and they rammed her into a mangrove forest to save her more of them died there and the salvage expedition lost three or four men before they turned up their contract  that said austin is what might be termed the official version  jefferson nodded what everybody doesnt know is that the skipper played the frenchman a crooked game he said there was more gum put into her than was ever shown in her papers while they had got at the trade gin before she went ashore in fact i have a notion that it wasnt very unlike the sachem affair i cant quite figure how they came to start those plates in the soft mud of a mangrove creek any way the carpenter who died there was a countryman of mine you may remember i did a few things for him and the man was grateful well the result is i know theres a good deal more than Â£20000 sterling in the cumbria  austin surmised that this was possible it was not he knew seafarers of unexceptional character who usually ventured into the still little known creeks of western africa which the coast mailboats skippers left alone he was also aware that more or less responsible white men are apt to go a trifle off their balance and give their passions free rein when under the influence of cheap spirits in that land of pestilence  well he said  ive bought her as she lies for Â£6000  austin gasped you will probably die off in two or three weeks after you put your foot in her  im not quite sure i was at panama and never had a touch of fever any way im going and if youll stand in with me ill put you down a quartershare for a dollar  it was in one respect a generous offer but austin shook his head no he said decisively have you forgotten that miss gascoyne expects you to marry her  jeffersons eyes glowed im remembering it all the time thats why im going would you take a refined and cultured girl and drag her through all the hard places men of my kind make money in up and down the world has she to give up everything and come down to me no sir it seems to me the man who wants to marry a girl of that kind has got to do something to show he knows her value before he gets her and it would be way better for both of us that she should be sorry for me dead than that i should live to drag her down  it seemed to austin that there was a good deal to be said for this point of view and it also occurred to him that there was in this latterday american who had still the grime of the coaling wharf upon him something of the spirit which had sent the knighterrant out in the days of chivalry still he naturally did not say so for he was after all what jefferson called a hidebound englishman  well he said youre taking a big risk but perhaps you are right  jefferson rose with the abruptness which usually characterised his movements  youre not coming  no i havent your inducement and im afraid the contracts too big for me  you have a week to consider it in said jefferson who opened the door in the meanwhile theres another fellow ready for his coal and im going along     chapter v  the tomato finca   three weeks had passed since his interview with austin before jefferson was ready to sail and he spent most of the time in strenuous activity he had cabled to england for a big centrifugal pump and a secondhand locomotivetype boiler while when they arrived macallister said that five hundred pounds would not tempt him to raise full steam on the latter he also purchased a brokendown launch and though she was cheap the cost of her and the pump with other necessaries made a considerable hole in his remaining Â£2000 it was for this reason he undertook to make the needful repairs himself with the help of a steamers donkeyman who had somehow got left behind while austin and macallister spent most of the week during which the estremedura lay at las palmas in the workshop he had extemporised he appeared to know a little about machinery and could at least handle hacksaw and file in a fashion which moved macallister to approbation while austin noticed that the latters sardonic smile became less frequent as he and the american worked together  jefferson was grimly in earnest and it was evident that his thoroughness which overlooked nothing compelled the engineers admiration it also occurred to austin that while there are many ways in which a lover may prove his devotion few other men would probably have cared for the one jefferson had undertaken he was not a very knightly figure when he emerged smeared with rust and scale from the secondhand boiler or crawled about the launchs engines with blackened face and hands but austin who remembered it was for muriel gascoyne he had staked all his little capital in that desperate venture forebore to smile he knew rather better than jefferson did that it was a very forlorn hope indeed the latter was venturing on one cannot heave a stranded steamer off without strenuous physical exertion and the white man who attempts the latter in a good many parts of western africa incontinently dies  at last all was ready and one night jefferson steamed off to the african liner from las palmas mole taking with him the steamboat donkeyman and another english seafarer who were at the time disgracefully drunk as well as six spaniards from the coasting schooners he said that when he reached the cumbria he would hire niggers who would be quite as reliable and considerably cheaper as it happened the estremedura was going to sea that night bound for the eastern islands and mrs hatherly who was never seasick and had heard that the climate of one of them where it scarcely ever rained was good for rheumatic affections had determined to visit it in her jacinta for no very apparent reason decided to go with her and it accordingly came about that most of her few acquaintances were with muriel gascoyne when she said goodbye to jefferson at the head of the mole she kissed him unblushingly and then when the launch panted away across the harbour turned a little pale in face but with a firm step towards the estremedura and an hour later stood with jacinta on the saloon deck watching the liners black hull slide down the harbour then as the steamer lurched out past the mole with a blast of her whistle throbbing across the dusky heave muriel shivered a little  i dont know whether we shall ever meet here again but i think i could bear that now and it really couldnt be so very hard after all she said it would have been horrible if he had gone and had not told me  jacinta looked thoughtful as in fact she was she was of a more complex and in some respects more refined nature than her companion while her knowledge of the world was almost startlingly extensive but wisdom carries one no further than simplicity when one approaches the barriers that divide mans little life from the hereafter indeed there is warrant for believing that when at last they are rolled away it is not the wise who will see with clearest vision  i am notquitesure i understand she said  there was a trace of moisture on muriel gascoynes cheek but she held herself erect and she was tall and large of frame as well as a reposeful young woman though she probably did not know it there was a suggestion of steadfast unchangeableness in her unconscious pose  now she said very simply he belongs to me and i to him if he dies out thereand i know that is possibleit can only be a question of waiting  jacinta was a little astonished she felt that there had been a great and almost incomprehensible change in muriel gascoyne since she fell very simply and naturally in love with jefferson it was also very evident that she was not consoling herself with empty phrases or repeating commendable sentiments just because they appealed to her fancy as some women will she seemed to be stating what she felt and knew  ah said jacinta you knew he might die there and you could let him go  muriel smiled my dear i could not have stopped him and now he is gone i think i am in one way glad that it was so i do not want moneyi have always had very littlebut feeling as he did it was best that he should go he would not have blamed me afterwardsof that i am certainbut i think i know what he would have felt if hardship came and i wanted to spare it him then with a faint smile which seemed to show that she recognised the anticlimax she became prosaic again one has to think of such things eight thousand pounds will not go so very far you know  jacinta left her presently and as it happened came upon austin soon after the estremedura steamed out to sea he was leaning on the forward rails while the little yachtlike vesselshe was only some 600 tons or soswung over the long smoothbacked undulations with slanted spars and funnel there was an azure vault above them strewn with the lights of heaven and a sea of deeper blue which heaved oilily below for that night at least the trade breeze was almost still  the liner will be clear of the land by now she said i suppose you are glad you did not go with jefferson you never told me that he had asked you to  austin who ignored the last remark laughed in a somewhat curious fashion  well he said reflectively in one respect jefferson is perhaps to be envied he is at least attempting a big thing and if he gets wiped out over it which i think is quite likely he will be beyond further trouble and miss gascoyne will be proud of him in fact it is she i should be sorry for she seems really fond of him  is that under the circumstances very astonishing  jefferson is really a very good fellow said austin with a smile in fact whatever it may be worth he has my sincere approbation  jacinta made a little gesture of impatience pshaw she said you know exactly what i mean i wonder if there is one among all the men i have ever met who wouldunder any circumstancesdo as much for me  she glanced at him for a moment in a fashion which sent a thrill through him but austin seldom forgot that he was the estremeduras purser he had also a horror of cheap protestations and he avoided the question  you could scarcely expectmeto know he said suppose there was such a man what would you do for him  there was just a trace of heightened colour in jacintas face i think if it was necessary and he could make me believe in him as muriel believes in jefferson i would die for him  austin said nothing for a space and looked eastwards towards africa across the long smooth heave of sea while he listened to the throbbing of the screw and the swash of the water beneath the steamers side he was quite aware that while jacinta on rare occasions favoured her more intimate masculine friends with a glimpse of her inner nature she never permitted them to presume upon the fact he had he felt made some little progress in her confidence and favour but it was quite clear that it would be inadvisable to venture further without a sign from her jacinta was able to make her servants and admirers understand exactly what line of conduct it was convenient they should assume if they failed to do so she got rid of them  whatever is mrs hatherly going to fuerteventura for he asked  dry weather said jacinta with a little smile  austin laughed one would fancy that las palmas was dry and dusty enough for most people i suppose you told her there is nowhere she can stay they havent a hotel of any kind in the island  that said jacinta sweetly will be your business you are a friend of don fernando and he has really a comfortable house still i expect three days of it will be quite enough for mrs hatherly you can pick us up you know when you come back from lanzarote  austin made a little whimsical gesture of resignation there is presumably no use in my saying anything after all she will be company for confidencia  who is by the way a friend of yours too  i have artistic tastes as you know confidencia isbarring one or twothe prettiest girl in these islands  he moved away but he turned at the top of the ladder and jacinta smiled  it is almost a pity a taste of that kind does not invariably accompany an artistic talent she said  austin went down to his little room which was almost as hot as an oven and strove to occupy himself with his papers the attempt however was not a success for his thoughts would follow jefferson who was on his way to africa with a big centrifugal pump a ricketty steam launch and a secondhand boiler of the locomotive type in view of his ulterior purpose there was it seemed to austin something ludicrously incongruous about this equipment though he realised that the gaunt american possessed in full degree the useful practical point of view in which he himself fell short jefferson was in some respects primitive but that was after all probably fortunate for him he knew what he desired and set about the obtaining of it by the first means available then he dismissed the subject and climbing into his bunk went to sleep  next morning he took jacinta mrs hatherly and muriel gascoyne ashore and afterwards went on with the estremedura to the adjoining island it was three days later and the steamer had come back again when he and her captain rode with the three ladies towards the coast after a visit to the black volcanic hills mrs hatherly and muriel sat in a cratelike affair upon the back of a camel with distress in their faces for there is probably no more unpleasant form of locomotion to anyone not used to it than camelriding the beast possesses a gait peculiarly its own and at every lurch of its shoulders the two women jolted violently in the crate the camel however proceeded unconcerned with long neck moving backwards and forwards like a pistonrod the rest rode horses and a gun and several ensanguined rabbits lay across the captains saddle he rode like a castilian and not a sailor and jacinta had noticed already that austin was equally at home in the saddle the fact had naturally its significance for her  it was then about two oclock in the afternoon and very hot though the fresh trade breeze blew long wisps of dust away from under the horses feet nobody could have called that part of fuerteventura a beautiful country but it had its interest to two of the party who had never seen anything quite like it before behind them rose low hills black with streams of lava red with calcined rock and every stone on them was outlined in harsh colouring in that crystalline atmosphere in front lay a desolation of ashes and scoriÃ¦ with tracts of yellow sand blown there presumably from africa which swirled in little spirals before the breeze it was chequered with clumps of euphorbia and thorn but they too matched the prevailing tones of grey and brown and chrome and there was not in all the waste a speck of green further still in front of them the sea flamed like a mirror and a vault of dazzling blue hung over all  they wound down into a hollow through which as one could see by the tortuous belt of stones a little water now and then flowed and dismounted in the scanty shadow of a ruined wall it had been built high and solid of blocks of lava centuries ago perhaps by the first of the spanish or by dusky invaders from morocco as it was not quite so hot there austin and the captain made preparations for a meal when a barelegged peon led the beasts away then the captain frowned darkly at the prospect  ah mala gente que el infierno los come he said with blazing eyes and swung a brown hand up as though appealing to stones and sky before he indulged in another burst of eloquence  what is he saying asked muriel gascoyne he seems very angry  austin smiled i scarcely think it would be altogether advisable to enquire but it is not very astonishing if he is angry he said don erminio is not as a rule a success as a business man and this is a farm he once invested all his savings in i am particularly sorry to say that i did much the same  miss gascoyne appeared astonished which was perhaps not altogether unnatural as she gazed at the wilderness in front of her there were she could now see signs that somebody had made a desultory attempt at building a wall which was nearly buried again a few odd heaps of lava blocks had also been piled up here and there but the hollow was strewn with dust and ashes and looked as though nothing had ever grown there since that island was hurled incandescent out of the sea it was very difficult to discover the least evidence of fertility  ah said jacinta so this is the famous finca de la empreza financial  oliviera overheard her and once more made a gesture with arms flung wide  mira he said the cemetery where i bury the hopes of me o much tomate mucho profit i buy more finca and the cow for me aha there is also other time i make the commercial venture i buy two mulo very good mulo i charge mucho dollar for the steamboat cargo cart comes the locomotura weet the concrete block down las palmas mole the mole is narrow the block is big the man drives the locomotura behind it he not can look vaya my two mulo and the cart she is in the sea that is also ruin me i say vaya in fifty year she is oll the same but when i see the finca de tomate i have the temper alors weet permission me vais chasser the conejo  the unfortunate man said jacinta when he strode away in search of a rabbit still the last of it wasnt quite unexceptional castilian  austin laughed don erminio speaks french almost as well as he does english in fact hes a linguist in his way still im not sorry he didnt insist upon me going shooting with him its risky and i would sooner hed borrowed somebody elses gun  they made a tolerable lunch for the estremeduras cook knew his business and though it very seldom rains there some of the finest grapes to be found anywhere grow in the neighbouring island of lanzarote then mrs hatherly apparently went to sleep with her back against the wall while muriel sat silent in the shadow close beside her perhaps the camel ride had shaken her and perhaps she was thinking of jefferson for she was gazing east towards africa across the flaming sea jacinta as usual appeared delightfully fresh and cool as she sat with her long white dress tucked about her on a block of lava while austin lay contented not far from her feet  you never told me you had a share in the finca she said  well said austin i certainly had i also made a speech at the inaugural dinner and don erminio almost wept with pride while i did it i had though he did not mention it a share in his mule cart too and once or twice bought a schooner load of onions to ship to havana at his suggestion you see i had then a notion that it was my duty to make a little money somehow the onions never got to cuba and our other ventures endedlike the finca  then you have given up all idea of making money now  it really didnt seem much use continuing and after all a little money wouldnt be very much good to me a chance of making twenty thousand pounds might perhaps rouse me to temporary activity  ah said jacinta looking at him with thoughtful eyes you want too much my friend you are not likely to make it by painting little pictures on board the estremedura  a faint trace of darker colour showed through the bronze in austins cheek yes he said that is exactly what is the matter with me still as i shall never get it i am tolerably content with what i have fortunately i am fond of iti mean the sea  of course said jacinta with a curious little sparkle in her eyes contentment is commendable though there is something that appeals to ones fancy in the thought of a man struggling against everything to acquire the unattainable  so long as it is unattainable what would be the good besides i am almost afraid i am not that kind of man  jacinta said nothing further and half an hour slipped by until a trail of smoke with a smear of something beneath it crept up out of the glittering sea  the andalusia said austin she takes up our western run here under the new timetable i hope shes bringing no english folks from las palmas to worry us  as it happened there was a man on board the andalusia who was to bring one of the party increased anxiety and distress of mind but they did not know that then and in the meanwhile the peon with the horses and don erminio came back again he brought no rabbits but he had succeeded in badly scratching one of the damascene barrels of austins gun  the conejo he no can eat the stone and here there is nothing else he explained otra vezthe other time comes here a seÃ±or engleesman and we have the gun but there is no conejo me i say mira conejo into his hole he go bueno the engleesman he put the white rat into that hole and wait oh he wait mucho tiempo me away i go i come back the engleesman has bag the captain of puerto  then he turned with a dramatic gesture to the camel which stretched out its little head towards his leg burrr hijo de diablo aughrrr focha camello me i also spick the avarrack the condemn camello he comprehend  the longnecked beast at least knelt down as though it did and mrs hatherly climbed into the crate with a somewhat apprehensive glance at the gallant captain     chapter vi  austins point of view   mrs hatherly decided during the ride to the beach that she had seen quite enough of that island in the three days she had spent there and she had already gone off to the estremedura with muriel and jacinta when austin stood smoking on the little mole long undulations of translucent brine seethed close past his feet to break with a drowsy roar upon the lava reefs and the estremedura lay rolling wildly a quarter of a mile away a cluster of barefooted men were with difficulty loading her big lancha beneath the mole with the barleystraw the row of camels kneeling in the one straggling street behind him had brought down the men were evidently tired for they had toiled waistdeep in the surf since early morning and austin decided to spare them the journey for his despatch gig  accordingly when the lancha was loaded high with the warm yellow bales he clambered up on them and bade the crew get under way the long sweeps dipped and the craft went stern first towards the reef for a moment or two before she crawled out to sea looking very like a cornstack set adrift as she lurched over the shining swell austin lay upon the straw smoking tranquilly for everybody leaves a good deal to chance in spain and now and then flung a little castilian badinage at the gasping men who pulled the big sweeps below as it happened they could not see him because the straw rose behind them in a yellow wall they were cheerful inconsequent fishermen who would have done a good deal for him and not altogether because of the bottle of caÃ±a he occasionally gave them  they had traversed half the distance when opening up a point they met a steeper heave and when the dripping bows went up after the plunge there was a movement of the barleystraw austin felt for a better hold but two or three bales fetched away as he did so and in another moment he plunged down headforemost into the sea when he came up he found a straw bale floating close beside him and held on by it while he looked about him the lancha was apparently going on and it was evident that although the men must have heard the straw fall they were not aware that he had gone with it there was he surmised no room for the lost bales and the men could not have heaved them up on top of the load it therefore appeared probable that they purposed unloading the lancha before they came back for them and he decided to climb up on the bale  he found it unexpectedly difficult for when he had almost dragged himself up the bale rolled over and dropped him in again while when he tried to wriggle up the front of it it stood upright and then fell upon him after several attempts he gave it up and set out for the steamer with little pieces of barleystraw and spiky ears sticking all over him he could swim tolerably well and swung along comfortably enough over the smoothbacked swell for his light clothing did not greatly cumber him still he did not desire that any one beyond the estremeduras crew should witness his arrival  he was accordingly by no means pleased to see jacinta and miss gascoyne stroll out from the deckhouse as he drew in under the estremeduras side especially as there were no apparent means of getting on board quietly the lancha had vanished round the stern the ladder was triced up and the open cargo gangway several feet above the brine the steamer also hove up another four or five feet of streaming plates every time she rolled still it was evident that he could not stay where he was on the chance of the ladies not noticing him indefinitely and as he swam on again miss gascoyne broke into a startled scream  oh she said theres somebody drowning  the cry brought macallister to the gangway and he was very grimy in engineroom disarray austin in the water saw the wicked twinkle in his eyes and was not pleased to hear jacinta laugh musically  i really dont think he is in any danger she said  austin set his lips and swam for the gangway as the estremedura rolled down his flung up hand came within a foot of the opening and then he sank back a fathom or more below it as the estremedura hove that side of her out of the water when he swung up again macallister was standing above him with a portentiously sharp boat hook while two or three grinning seamen clustered round the girls were also leaning out from the saloondeck rails  will ye no keep still while i hook ye said the engineer  if you stick that confounded thing into my clothes ill endeavour to make you sorry said austin savagely  macallister made a sweep at him and austin went down while one of the seamen leaning down grabbed him by the shoulder when he rose  let go he sputtered furiously give me your hand instead  he evidently forgot that the seaman who held on was not an englishman and next moment he was hove high above the water then there was a ripping and tearing and while the seaman reeled back with a long strip of alpaca in his hand austin splashed into the water he came up in time to see macallister smiling in jacintas direction reassuringly  theres no need to be afraid he said though im no sure hes worth it ill save him for ye  now jacinta was usually quite capable of making any man who offended her feel sorry for himself but the sight of austins savage red face as he gazed at macallister with the torn jacket flapping about him in the water and the barleystraw sticking all over him was too much for her and she broke into a peal of laughter  in another moment macallister contrived to get his boat hook into the slack of austins garments and when two seamen seized the haft they hove him out wrong side uppermost and incoherent with wrath when they dropped him a tattered dripping heap on the deck miss gascoyne leaned her face upon her hands and laughed almost hysterically until jacinta touched her shoulder  mr austin evidently believes he has a good deal to thank his comrade for i think you had better come away she said  austin put himself to some trouble in endeavouring to make macallister understand what he thought of him when they had gone but the engineer only grinned  well he said ill forgive ye if i had looked like ye do with two ladies watching me i might have been a bit short in temper myself but come away to your room the andalusias boat came across a while ago and theres business waiting ye  austin went with him but stopped a moment when he approached his room the door was open as usual and a stranger in grey tourist tweed upon whom englishman and clergyman was stamped unmistakably sat inside the room austin felt that he knew who the man must be  does he know miss gascoyne is on board he asked  no said macallister the boat came round under our quarter and we landed him through the lower gangway he said hed stay here and wait for ye hes no sociable anyway ive offered him cigars and anisow besides some of my special whisky but he did not seem willing to talk to me  austin fancied he could understand it macallister who had discarded his jacket was very grimy and his unbuttoned uniform vest failed to conceal the grease stains on his shirt then he remembered that his own jacket was torn to rags and he was very wet but macallister raised his voice  heres mr austin sir he said  the clergyman who said nothing gazed at him and austin who realised that his appearance was against him understood his astonishment he also fancied that the stranger was one with whom appearances usually counted a good deal  if you will wait a minute or two while i change my clothes i will be at your service sir he said as you may observe i have been in the sea  swum off to the steamer said macallister with a wicked smile it saves washing he comes off yon way now and then  austin said nothing but stepped into the room and gathering up an armful of clothing departed leaving a pool of water behind him the clergyman it was evident did not know what to make of either of them a few minutes later austin who came back and closed the door sat down opposite him  my name is gascoyne said the stranger handing him an open note mr brown of las palmas who gave me this introduction assured me that i could speak to you confidentially and that you would be able to tell me where my daughter and mrs hatherly are staying  austin glanced at him with misgivings he was a little man with pale blue eyes and hair just streaked with grey his face was white and fleshy without animation or any suggestion of ability in it but there had been something in the tone which seemed to indicate that he had at least been accustomed to petty authority austin at once set him down as a man of essentially conventional views who was deferred to in some remote english parish in fact just the man he would have expected muriel gascoynes father to be that is before she had revealed her inner self it was a type he was by no means fond of and he was quite aware that circumstances were scarcely likely to prepossess a man of that description in his favour still austin was a friend of jeffersons and meant to do what he could for him  i know where miss gascoyne is but you suggested that you had something to ask me and i shall be busy by and by he said  gascoyne appeared anxious but evidently very uncertain whether it would be advisable to take him into his confidence  i understand that you are a friend of mr jeffersons he said  i am i may add that i am glad to admit it and i almost fancy i know what you mean to ask me  gascoyne who appeared grateful for this lead looked at him steadily perhaps i had better be quite frank indeed mr brown who informed me that you could tell more about jefferson than any one in the islands recommended it he said i am mr austin a clergyman who has never been outside his own country before and i think it is advisable that i should tell you this because there may be points upon which our views will not coincide it was not easy for me to get away now but the future of my motherless daughter is a matter of the greatest concern to me and i understand that mr jefferson is in africa i want you to tell me candidlyas a gentlemanwhat kind of man he is  austin felt a little better disposed towards gascoyne after this his anxiety concerning his daughter was evident and he had at least not adopted quite the attitude austin had expected but as austin was not by any means brilliant himself he felt the difficulty of making gascoyne understand the character of such a man as jefferson while his task was complicated by the fact that he recognised his responsibility to both of them gascoyne had put him on his honour and he could not paint jefferson as he was not in the meanwhile he greatly wished to think  i wonder if i might offer you a glass of wine sir or perhaps you smoke he said  no thanks said gascoyne with uncompromising decision i am aware that many of my brethren indulge in these luxuries i do not  well said austin if you will tell me what you have already heard about jefferson it might make the way a little plainer  i have been told that he is an american seafarer it seems of the usual careless type seafarers are perhaps liable to special temptations and it is generally understood that the lives most of them lead are not altogether  austin smiled a little when gascoyne stopped abruptly im afraid that must be admitted sir i can however assure you that jefferson is an abstemious manamericans are as a rule you seeand though there are occasions when his conversation might not commend itself to you he has had an excellent education since we are to be perfectly candid has it ever occurred to you that it was scarcely likely a dissolute sailor would meet with miss gascoynes approbation  gascoyne flushed a trifle it did notthough of course it should have still he told her that he was mate of the sachem which was a painful shock to me i of course remember the revolting story  he stopped a moment and his voice was a trifle strained when he went on again i left england mr austin within three days of getting my daughters letter and have ever since been in a state of distressing uncertainty mr jefferson is in africai cannot even write him i do not know where my duty lies  had the mans intense anxiety been less evident austin would have been almost amused the reverend gascoyne appeared to believe that his affairs were of paramount importance to everybody as perhaps they were in the little rural parish he came from but there was something in his somewhat egotistical simplicity that appealed to the younger man  one has to face unpleasant facts now and then sir he said there are times when homicide is warranted at sea and mans primitive passions are very apt to show themselves naked in the face of imminent peril it is in one respect unfortunate that you have probably never seen anything of the kind but one could not expect too much from a man whose comrades head had just been shorn open by a drinkfrenzied mutineer can you imagine the little handful of officers driven aft away from the boats while the ship settled under them standing still to be cut down with adze and axe you must remember too that they were seafarers and americans who had few of the advantages you and your friends enjoy in england  he could not help the last piece of irony but gascoyne who did not seem to notice it groaned  to think of a man who appears to hold my daughters confidence being concerned in such an affair at all is horribly unpleasant to me  i have no doubt it was almost as distressing to jefferson at the time still as you have probably never gone in fear of your life for weeks together you may not be capable of understanding what he felt and we had perhaps better get on a little further  gascoyne seemed to pull himself together mr jefferson has i understand no means beyond a certain legacy it is not after all a large one  if he is alive in six months i feel almost sure he will have twice as much which would mean an income of close upon Â£600 a year from sound english stock and that one would fancy would not be considered abject poverty in a good many english rural parishes  gascoyne sighed that is trueit is certainly true you saidif he were alive  as he is now on his way to one of the most deadly belts of swamp and jungle in western africa i think i was warranted knowing him as i do it is i fancy certain that if he does not come back with Â£16000 in six months he will be dead  ah said gascoyne with what was suspiciously like a sigh of relief one understands that it is a particularly unhealthy climate still when one considers that all is arranged for the best  austin who could not help it smiled sardonically though he felt he had an almost hopeless task it appeared impossible that gascoyne should ever understand the character of a man like jefferson but he meant to do what he could  it is naturally easier to believe that when circumstances coincide with our wishes sir he said now i do not exactly charge you with wishing jefferson dead though your face shows that you would not be sorry i am of course another careless seafarer a friend of his and i can understand that what you have seen of me has not prepossessed you in my favour still if i can i am going to show you jefferson as he is to begin with he believes as you do that miss gascoyne is far above himand in this he is altogether wrong miss gascoyne is doubtless a good woman but jefferson is that harder thing to be a good man his point of view is not yours it is perhaps a wider one but he has what concerns you most directly now a vague reverential respect for all that is best in womanhood which i think is sufficient to place miss gascoyne under a heavy responsibility  he stopped a moment looking steadily at gascoyne who appeared blankly astonished  because it was evident to him that a woman of miss gascoynes conventional upbringing must suffer if brought into contact with the unpleasant realities of the outside world he has staked his life willinglynot recklesslyon the winning of enough to place her beyond the reach of adversity he realised that it was at least even chances he never came back from africa but it seemed to him better that she should be proud of him dead than have to pity him and herself living i know this because he told me he would never drag the woman who loved him down he fell in love with her without reflection instinctivelyor perhaps because it was arranged soi do not understand these things as surelyconventionalities dont always countshe fell in love with him and then he had to grapple with the position your daughter could not live as some women do unshocked and cheerfully among rude and primitive peoples whose morality is not your morality in the wilder regions of the earth it was also evident that she could not live sumptuously in england on the interest of Â£8000 you see what he made of it if he died miss gascoyne would be free if he lived she could avoid all that would be unpleasant isnt that sufficient could there be anything base or mean in a nature capable of devotion of that description  gascoyne sat silent almost a minute then he said very quietly i have to thank you mr austinthe more so because i admit i was a little prejudiced against you perhaps men living as i do acquire too narrow a view i am glad you told me and now where is my daughter and mrs hatherly  wait another minute jefferson is as you will recognise a man of exceptional courage but he is also a man of excellent education and so far as that goes of attractive presence such a one in fact as i think a girl of miss gascoynes station is by no means certain to come across again in england now if i have said anything to offend you it has not been with that object and you will excuse it your daughter and mrs hatherly are on board this ship it seemed better that you should hear me out before i told you  ah said gascoyne well i think you were right and again i am much obliged to you will you take me to mrs hatherly  austin did so and coming back flung himself down on the settee in macallisters room  give me a drinka long one i dont know that i ever talked so much at once in my life and i only hope i didnt make a consummate ass of myself he said  its no that difficult said macallister reflectively as he took out a syphon and a bottle of wine ye made excuses for yourself and jefferson  austin laughed no he said i made none for jefferson i think i rubbed a few not particularly pleasant impressions into the other man i felt i had to it was of course a piece of abominable presumption  macallister leaned against the bulkhead and regarded him with a sardonic grin  i would have liked to have heard ye he said     chapter vii  at the bull fight   austin was writing in the saloon which was a little cooler than his room at about eight oclock that night while jacinta and mrs hatherly made ineffectual attempts to read in the ladies cabin for the estremedura was on her way south again with the tradewind combers tumbling after her she rolled with a long rhythmic swing and now and then shook and trembled with the jar of her lifted propeller muriel gascoyne was accordingly alone with her father on the deck above she sat in a canvas chair while gascoyne leaned upon the rails in front of her there was a full moon overhead and a fantastic panorama of fireblackened hills wastes of ash and lava whirling clouds of sand black rocks lapped by spouting surf and bays of deepest indigo unrolled itself upon one hand it is however probable that neither of the pair saw much of it for their thoughts were not concerned with the volcanic desolation  it is a pity i did not come a few weeks earlier said gascoyne with a sigh  muriels eyes were a trifle hazy but her voice was even if you had come then and insisted upon it i might have given him up she said  that means it is irrevocable now i want you to make quite sure my dear this man does not belong to our world even his thoughts must be different from ours you cannot know anything of his past lifei scarcely think he could explain it to you he would regard nothing from the same standpoint as we do  still it cannot have been a bad one i cant tell you why i am sure of that but i know  gascoyne made a little hopeless gesture muriel he said a trifle hoarsely it is a terrible riskand if you marry him you must inevitably drift away from me you are all i have and i am getting old and lonely but that is not of the greatest moment it would be horrible to think of you drifting away from all you have been taught to believe in and hold sacred  it was a strong appeal perhaps the strongest he could have made for the girl had been without breadth of view when she left home and the boundaries of her outlook had coincided with those of the little rural parish still in some strange fashion she had gained enlightenment and she was resolute though her blue eyes slowly brimmed with moisture it was true that he would be very lonely  ah she said and it was a significant sign that she questioned the comprehension of the man whom she had regarded as almost infallible a few weeks earlier how can i make you understand there are perhaps many worlds and we know there are many kinds of men they must think differently but does that matter so very much after all there is the same humanity in all of us  undoubtedly in turks idolaters and unbelievers humanity in itself is fallen and evil  muriel smiled father she said you dont believe that there is no good in all those who have not been taught to believe as we do  gascoyne did not answer her though it is possible that there were circumstances under which he would have returned a very slightly qualified affirmative  there is a perilous optimism abroad he said  still said muriel unconscious of the irony of her deprecatory answer mr jefferson is neither a turk nor an idolater he is only an american sailor  gascoyne sighed dejectedly for there was it seemed nothing left for him to appeal to the girls beliefs had gone the simple ironfast rules of life she had once acknowledged were now apparently discredited but even in his concern he was vaguely sensible that an indefinite something which he did not recognise as the charity that love teaches was growing up in place of them still he felt its presence as he watched her and knew that it could not be altogether born of evil  my dear he said how shall i implore you to consider  muriel smiled out of hazy eyes it is too late he has my promise and i belong to him nothing that you could say would change that now he has gone outto africabelieving in me and i know that he may never come back again  gascoyne appeared a trifle startled and remembered a curious remark that austin had made to the effect that there was a heavy responsibility upon his daughter he could not altogether understand why this should be but he almost fancied that she recognised it now there was also a finality and decision in the girls tone which was new to him  i think you know how hard it was for me to get away but it seemed necessary i came out to implore you to give this stranger up he said  the girl rose and stood looking at him gravely with one hand on the chair arm to steady herself as the steamer rolled and the moonlight upon her face it was almost reposeful in its resolution  father she said you must try to understand perhaps i did wrong when i gave him my promise without consulting you but it is given and irrevocable he has gone out to africaand may die therebelieving in me i dont think i could make you realise how he believes in me but though of course he is wrong i grow frightened now and then and almost hope he may never see me as i really am that is why idarentfail him if there was no other reason i must keep faith with him  then said gascoyne very slowly i must at least try to resign myselfand perhaps my apprehensions may turn out to be not quite warranted after all i was horribly afraid a little while ago but this man seems to have the faculty of inspiring confidence in those who know him they cannot all be mistaken and the man who is purser on this steamer seems to believe in him firmly his views are peculiar but there was sense in what he said and he made me think a little less hardly of mr jefferson  muriel only smiled she realised what this admission insufficient and grudging as it was must have cost her father andfor she had regarded everything from his point of view until a few weeks agoshe could sympathise with him still she was glad when she saw jacinta and mrs hatherly coming towards them along the deck  it was an hour later when jacinta met austin at the head of the ladder and stopped him with a sign  i have had a long talk with mr gascoyne and found him a little less disturbed in mind than i had expected she said i want to know what you said to him  well said austin reflectively i really cant remember and if i could it wouldnt be worth while of course i knew what i wanted to say but im almost afraid i made as great a mess of it as i usually do  still i think miss gascoyne is grateful to you  that said austin affords me very little satisfaction after all you see i didnt exactly do it to please miss gascoyne  then i wonder what motive really influenced you  austin pursed his lips as if thinking hard i dont quite know for one thing very orthodox people of the reverend gascoynes description occasionally have an irritating effect upon me i feel impelled to readjust their point of view or at least to allow them an opportunity of recognising the advantages of mine which however isnt necessarily the correct one i hope this explanation contents you  jacinta smiled i think i shall remember it she said i believe i generally do when anybody does a thing to please me still miss gascoynes gratitude will not hurt you  then she swept away and left him standing meditatively at the head of the ladder he saw no more of her that night and he was busy when the estremedura steamed into las palmas early next morning while it was nearly three weeks later when he met her again at a corrida de toros in the bull ring at santa cruz teneriffe which was perhaps the last place where one would have expected to find an english lady  the spacious amphitheatre was open to the sky and all its tiers of stone benches packed with excited humanity for half the inhabitants of the island had apparently gathered to enjoy the sanguinary spectacle black is the colour affected by men who can afford it on a spanish holiday but the white cotton the barelegged hillmen wore and the pink and chrome of their wives and daughters dresses flecked with luminous colour the sombre ranks of the closepacked multitude blazing sunlight beat down upon them for it is only the richer citizens who sit in the shadow and the topmost row was projected a filagree of black and motley against the hard glaring blue below the arena shone dazzlingly yellow and the smell of blood and fresh sawdust came up from it through the manytoned murmur of the crowd when this sank a little one could hear the deep boom of the atlantic swell crumbling on the lava beach  the revolting picador scene was over two or three wornout and blindfolded horses had been gored or trampled to death and one picadors arm had been broken the tawny longhorned bull which had shown unusual courage stood panting in the middle of the arena with a crimson smear on one shoulder where a lance had scored it deep and while the bugles rang the vast assembly waited for the banderillero scene in high good humour just then a little party descended one of the avenues on the shady side and austin who had a note from pancho brown in his pocket with some difficulty made his way to meet them he was quite aware that brown was probably the only englishman in those islands who would have been able to reserve desirable places at a corrida de toros  jacinta who accompanied him was attended by his spanish housekeeper and two sunburnt english naval officers but she made room for austin on one side of her and appeared in no way displeased by his indifferently veiled approbation miss brown had been dressed by a castilian modeste mostly in black lace that day and her clustering brown hair was ornamented by a little mantilla of the same material it was not a dress which would have suited every englishwoman especially of substantial type but jacinta was slight and delicately round and altogether sylphlike  you venture to approve of this getup she said the tourists were a little horrified at the hotel  austin who wore white duck noticed that she smiled at the governor who sat above them amidst his glittering staff and that almost sufficed to spoil his satisfaction though it was only one of the many little things that emphasised the difference between them still he contrived to laugh  i expect they were envious its bewilderingly effective and i am a bit of an artist as you know he said i was wondering whether you would have the courage to come  jacinta said pancho brown has courage enough for anything still she came because i asked her i make my living out of these people and perhaps a little more it was policy  jacinta laughed well she said i rather like it and i have been before of course i mean after they have killed the horses and smashed the picadores that part is not only cruel but ineffective its not inspiriting to see a man padded with leather sit quite still to be knocked over they should either wipe it out or give them stuffed horses by the way you dont know my companions  the two naval officers acknowledged the introduction with characteristic brevity their eyes were fixed on the arena and the scene was probably worth their attention for there are parts of a bull fight which cannot be termed revolting at least by those who have actually witnessed them  a lithe wellfavoured man picturesquely attired skipped into the ring holding a crimson cape in one hand and a couple of little decorated darts in the other it was his business to strike them into the neck or shoulder of the bull but nowhere else while their points were calculated to do no more than exasperate it the beast watched him savagely pawing up the sand and the chances appeared somewhat against the man since to reach its neck he must approach his silkcovered breast within an inch or two of the gleaming horns one of which was suspiciously reddened  austin could not quite see how he did it for his motions were bewilderingly rapid but he saw the wave of the gaudy cloak and heard its crisp rustle that was lost in the roar then the man was running round the ring for his life and the bull thundering along with lowered head and a dart bristling in its neck a yard or two behind him he had no time to swing himself over the barricade as hard pressed banderilleros now and then did for the deadly horns were almost in the small of his back it was a frantic test of speed highly trained human agility and endurance against the strength of the beast and there was dead silence while they went round the arena once the man running desperately with tense set face while austin fancied he could hear his gasping breath through the roar of the hoofs then with a splendid bound he drew a yard ahead and another man with a green cape hurled himself through the opening somehow he escaped destruction and the bull slid onward with hoofs ploughing up the sand and the gaudy silk fluttering about its head there was a roar of plaudits that could have been heard miles away at sea and while from tiers of benches the hats came sailing down the bull which shook the cape off tore the coloured rags to fragments  that fellow has good nerves said one of the navy men i dont see anything very brutal in it after all they both start level and take their chances you know  jacinta looked at austin over her fan and there was a faint flush in as much of her face as he could see as well as a little gleam in her eyes  im afraid itisa little barbarous she said everybody says so still wasnt that banderillero splendid you see i have put on castilian notions with my clothes of course as an englishwoman i could never venture here  austin was a little annoyed to feel that he was smiling sardonically well he said i should almost have fancied that you were too superrefined and ethereal to admire that kind of thing but i really believe you do  jacinta waved her fan do not be deceived my friend there is a good deal of the primitive in us all and it shows up now and then then she laughed i wonder how they all get their right hats back again  austin could not tell her for it was a thing he could never understand but while the attendants were still flinging the black sombreros into the air another banderillero approached the bull he planted one dart and then dashed across the ring but either his nerve failed him or he could not trust his speed for he grasped the top of the barricade and swung himself over in another moment the bull struck it with a crash and then stood still half stunned apparently endeavouring to make out where the man had gone there was a storm of hisses and opprobrious cries  that banderillero said jacinta sweetly should have been driven out of the ring he ought never to have undertaken a thing that was too big for him  isnt that a little hard upon the man said austin he probably didnt know it was too big until he had undertaken it  thats sensible miss brown said one of the navy men when he found he couldnt run as fast as the bull could what was he to do  what did a certain gunboats men do when they found themselves quite unexpectedly in front of the african headmans battery  the navy man flushed a little for he was young oh he said that was different they set their lips and went in though i dont suppose any of them liked it still you see that was what they were there to do  exactly and jacinta laughed a little though there was still a gleam in her eyes and it was austin she looked at they did the obvious as well as the most artistic thing it fortunately happens that theyre often very much the same  im not quite sure i understand you said the young officer people who want me to have to talk plain still i suppose one has always a certain sympathy for the fellow who gets himself killed decently  then for a time they became absorbed in the play of the banderilleros who flashing here and there with cloaks of red and gold and green passed the bull from one to another up and down the trampled arena now one of them escaped annihilation by a hairsbreadth while the thundering vivas went up to the glaring sky and a comrade turned the tormented beast again now a silkclad athlete swept through the twofoot gap between deadly horns and flying man and the bull swung round with a bellow to pursue him or stood still temporarily blinded with the gaudy cloak about its horns it was a fascinating exhibition of human nerve and skill and austin saw that jacinta watched it with slightly parted lips and a gleam in her eyes until at last the bugles rang and most of the men withdrew leaving the bull alone in the middle of the arena with the foam flakes dripping from its muzzle and its brawny neck bristling with the little darts then there was a general movement and a great hum of voices rose from the closepacked benches jacinta waved her fan and touched austins arm as she looked about her  surely that is macallister but whatever is he doing there she said  austin looked up across the long rows of faces and saw his comrade sitting spick and span in the blue spanish mail uniform among the brilliant officers of the governors staff macallister was a big man with a commanding appearance when he had for the time being done with the engine room and austin who knew that he could make friends with anybody was not astonished to notice that he seemed very much at home  it is rather more than i know he said still i should fancy he was telling them something amusing in execrable castilian by the way they are laughing i believe macallister could get anywhere he wanted he has as a matter of fact dragged me into somewhat astonishing places  i shouldnt wonder said one of the navy men george isnt that big fellow in the uniform yonder the one we saw the other night at the opera  it is said his comrade with a little soft laugh as though he remembered something that had afforded him considerable pleasure  jacinta touched austin with her fan i presume you know what he is referring to  well said austin what i do know is this mack and i went to see the italian company the other night and because he of course knew everybody about the place we went behind the scenes he unfortunately became interested in the stage machinery and when he had made spirited attempts to pull some of it to pieces i and the improvisatore beguiled him to a chair in the wings we gave him a cigar to keep him quiet as well as the libretto which he could not read and as he seemed somewhat sleepy i was thankful to leave him there i didnt care about that opera he never told me what happened after  the young officer laughed again i daresay i can enlighten you in the middle of the last act one of the wings collapsed and everybody saw a big englishman who had apparently just kicked it over sitting half asleep in a folding chair he didnt appear to have any legitimate connection with the drama but he brought the house down when he got up in a hurry and fell over his chair  then the shrill call of the bugles rang through the great building and a tall man with a scarred face gorgeously dressed walked into the arena holding a threecornered hat and a long straight sword he stood still a moment an imposing and curiously graceful figure with bright blade lowered while a tumultuous shout of mÃ¦stro filled the building and then taking a cloak from an attendant approached the bull it was freely smeared with blood and as it stood bellowing and pawing the sand in murderous rage it was evident that the mÃ¦stros task was not a particularly pleasant one there was only one way in which he could kill the bull and that was to pass his sword over the horns and down into the brawny chest near the base of the neck should he strike elsewhere it was probable that the vast assembly would descend and trample on him for this was a duel to the death between man and beast in which the latter was secured what seemed an even chance by punctilious etiquette the spaniard displays a good deal of sympathy with a gallant bull  the beast seemed to understand that this man was different from the banderilleros who had previously tormented it and backed away from him until he smote it lightly on the nostrils then it swept forward in a savage rush but though the mans movements were so quick that one scarcely noticed them he was not quite where he had been a moment earlier when the bull thundered past him still one horn had ripped a strip of silk from him he followed the beast and struck it with his hand and for five or six frenzied minutes the vast audience roared this man never ran he stepped backwards or twisted always with grave gracefulness in the nick of time until at last the bull stood still as though stupefied with rage or uncertain how to attack its elusive persecutor  then as the man walked up to it very quietly and unconcernedly it seemed to hump itself together for a furious bound and rush with lowered head and there was no sound in the great building until the bright steel flashed mans breast and gleaming horns seemed to meet but apparently in the same second the gorgeously clad figure had stepped aside and in the next the bull plunged forward and came down upon its knees  there was another roar and once more from all the closepacked benches came the rain of hats cigars and bundles of cigarettes  ah said jacinta with a little gasp i think i have seen enough there will be another bull and more picadores now i never could stand that part of it besides i have done my duty and patronised the show  they made their way out while the audience waited for another bull and certain leatherswathed picadores rode in on decrepit blindfolded horses brought there to be killed and it was an hour later when as they stood beneath the oleanders in a fonda garden looking down upon the whitewalled town jacinta mentioned the affair again  of course it is a little cruel but after all it appeals to rather more than the lower passions and lust of slaughter dont you think she said  i never saw anything to equal that mÃ¦stros play in my life said one of the young officers it was cool daring in the superlative degree  i fancy said austin you want us to make excuses for your being there  jacinta laughed not exactly i am rather proud of being a law to myselfand othersyou know now i really think that the qualities the mÃ¦stro possessed appealed to me though i naturally mean some and not all of them i am after all as i admitted a little primitive in some respects  you mean that you like a man to be daring asked the other officer  of course and once more it was austin jacinta looked at still i dont necessarily mean that everybody should go bullfighting there are other things more worth while  even than sailing round the canaries and painting little pictures said austin  jacinta glanced at him with a curious smile well she said since you ask me i almost think there are then she stopped a moment and stood looking out from among the oleanders towards the glittering heave of the atlantic across the whitewalled town once more a faint gleam crept into her eyes  i wonder she added what jefferson is doingout yonder in africa     chapter viii  jefferson feels the strain   the afternoon was wearing through but it was still almost insufferably hot when jefferson stood with his hand upon the valve of the cumbrias forward winch she lay with her bows wedged into the mangrove forest which crawled on higharched roots over leagues of bubbling mire to the edge of one of the foulest creeks in western africa it flowed thick and yeasty beneath the steamers hoveup side for she lay with a list to starboard athwart the stream there was a bend close by and her original crew had apparently either failed to swing her round it which is an accident that sometimes happens in that country or driven her ashore to save her sinking  her iron deck was unpleasantly hot and the negroes who crossed it between hatch and surfboat hopped they of course wore no boots and indeed very little of anything at all beyond a strip of cotton round their waists there was not a breath of wind astir and the saturated atmosphere which was heavy with the emanations of the swamps seemed to seal the perspiration in the burning skin jefferson felt the veins on his forehead swollen to the bursting point when he stopped the winch and looked about him while the spaniards slipped a sling over a palmoil puncheon in the hold below  he could see nothing but a strip of dazzling water and the dingy whitestemmed mangroves which stretched away farther than the eye could follow and sighed as he glanced back at the cumbria she lay with deck unpleasantly slanted and one bilge in the mire a rusty twomasted steamer with the blistered paint peeling off her and the burnt awnings hanging from their spars he did not expect much water in that creek until the wet season and in the meanwhile it was necessary to heave the coal and cargo out of her and send it down stream to a neighbouring beach it was very slow work with the handful of men he had and those few weeks had set their mark on jefferson  he had never been a fleshy man and long days of feverish toil under a burning sun and in the steamy heat of the flooded holds had worn him to skin and bone his duck garments hung with a significant slackness about his gaunt frame and they were rent in places as well as blackened and smeared with oil his face was grim and hollow but there was a fierce steadfastness in his eyes which seemed filled with curious brilliancy  are you going to sleep down there cant you send up another cask he said  a voice came up from the dusky hatch out of which there flowed a hot sour smell of palm oil and putrefying water the next tiers jammed up under the orlop beams it said we might get on a little if we could break a puncheon out  jefferson laid his hands upon the combing of the hatch and swung himself over it was a drop of several yards and he came down upon the slippery round of a big puncheon and reeling across the barrels fell backwards against an angleiron he was however up again in a moment and stood blinking about him with eyes dazzled by the change from the almost intolerable brightness above blurred figures were standing more than ankle deep in water on the slanted rows of puncheons and jefferson who could not see them very well blinked again when an englishman stripped to the waist moved towards him the latter was dripping with yellow oil and perspiration  its this one he said and kicked a puncheon viciously the derrickcrabs have pulled the tops of the staves off her theyre soaked an soft with oil the water underneaths jamming them up an youll see how the tiers keyed down by the orlopbeams  jefferson wrenched the iron bar he held away from him and turned to the rest  theres a patch of the head clear two or three of you get a handspike on to it he said no shove it lower down mas abajo now heave all together vamos toda fuerza  they were barefooted canary spaniards of an astonishing ignorance but excellent sailormen and they understood him lean muscular bodies strained and bent the dew of effort dripped from them and as he heaved with lips set the hollows grew deeper in jeffersons grim face no one spoke there was only a deep stertorous gasping until the puncheon moved a little and jefferson stooping drove his bar a trifle lower then while he strained every muscle and sinew in strenuous effort the great slimy barrel rose again tilted and rolled out on its fellows for a moment it left a space of oily black water where it had been and then the puncheons closed in with a crash again jefferson flung the bar down and straightened himself  now he said wearily you can get ahead  he crawled up the ladder with a curious languidness and while one of the englishmen apostrophised the puncheons the spaniards went back to their task the castilian is not supposed to be remarkable for diligence but there is at least among the lower ranks of men in whom the iberian blood flows a capacity for patient toil and uncomplaining endurance which while not always very apparent nevertheless shows itself unmistakably under pressure of circumstances these were simple men who had never been encouraged to think for themselves and were therefore like other spaniards of their degree perhaps incapable of undertaking anything on their own initiative but they could do a great deal under the right leader and they had him in jefferson  one of the englishmen however was not quite satisfied he had been in the tropics before and did not like the curious flush in jeffersons face or the way the swollen veins showed on his forehead so he climbed the ladder after him and leaned upon the winchdrum looking at him meditatively the man was very ragged as well as very dirty and altogether disreputable so far as appearance went while it is probable that in several respects his character left a good deal to be desired  heres your hat its wet but thats no harm he said you forgot it hadnt you better put it on quick  jefferson who recognised the wisdom of this did so  thats all right well whatareyou stopping for he said  the other man still regarded him contemplatively i know my placebut things isnt quite the same aboard this ooker as they would be on a big twofunnel liner you couldnt expect it thats why i come up just now to speak to you youre not feelin well today  its not worth worrying about i guess nobody but a nigger ever does feel well in this country  the other man shook his head you go slow ive seen it comin on he said you oughtnt to a had your hat off a minute you see if you drop out hows bill an me to get the bonus you promised us  jefferson laughed though he found somewhat to his concern that he could not see the man very well  im going to hold up until i knock the bottom of this contract out he said goodhumouredly i cant do it if i stop and talk to you get a move on light out of this  the man went back he had done what he felt was his duty though he had not expected that it would be of very much use and jefferson started the winch it hammered and rattled and the barrels came up slimy and dripping with patches of whitewash still clinging to them the glare of it dazzled jefferson until he could scarcely see them as they swung beneath the derrickboom but he managed to drop them into the surfboat alongside and pile the rest on deck when she slid down the creek with a row of negroes paddling on either side the steamer had struck the forest at the time of highest water and it was necessary to take everything out of her if she was to be floated during the coming rainy season  he toiled on for another hour with a racking pain in his head and the canarios toiled in the stifling hold below until there was a jar and a rattle and a big puncheon that should have gone into the surfboat came down with a crash amidst them and bursting splashed them with yellow oil then the man who had remonstrated with jefferson went up the ladder in haste the winch had stopped and jefferson lay across it amidst a coil of slack wire with a suffused face the man who stooped over him shouted and the rest who came up helped to carry him to his room beneath the bridge the floor was slanted so that one could scarcely stand on it and as the berth took the same list they laid him where the side of it met the bulkhead he lay there speechless with halfclosed eyes and water and palm oil soaking from him  now said the man who had given jefferson good advice youll get these spaniards out of this bill then youll go on breaking the puncheons out walleye here can run the winch for you but you can come back in half an hour when ive found out whats wrong with the skipper  bill seemed to recognise that his comrade had risen to the occasion well he said i spose theres no use in me sayin anything all i want to know is how youre going to do it  see that and the other man pointed to a chest beneath the settee its full of medicines an theres a book about them good ole board of trade  how dyou know those medicines arnt all gorn asked bill  they arnt ive been in theres a bottle of sweet paregoricky stuff i came round for a swigg of when mr jefferson wasnt there now and then it warms you up kind of comfortin  bill went away with the spaniards and in place of improving the occasion by looking for liquor as he might perhaps have been expected to do went on with his task the english sailorman does not always express himself delicately but he is now at least very far from being the dissolute unintelligent ruffian he is sometimes supposed to be there is no doubt of this for shipowners know their business and while there is no lack of teutons and cheerful sober scandinavians a certain proportion of english seamen still go to sea in english ships the man who sat in jeffersons room could at least understand the treatise in the medicine chest although it was one approved by the board of trade which august body has apparently no great fondness for lucid explanations he was however still pouring over it when his comrade thrust his head into the doorway again and it is possible that jefferson had not suffered greatly from the fact that he had not as yet quite decided on any course of treatment  well said the newcomer i spose you know what hehasgot  come in an sit down there said the other its fever for one thingive seen it coming onan sunstroke for another what im stuck at is if im to treat them both together  bill looked reflective i think id take them one at a time get the sunstroke out of him an then go for the fever how d you start on it tom  undo his clothes thats easy the buttons is mostly off them an he has hardly any on then you put cold water on his head  thats not easy anyway where the blazes are you going to get cold water from  it was somewhat of a paradox for while there is plenty of water in western africa none of it is cold tom however was once more equal to the occasion  we could get a big spanner from the engine room an put it on his head he said theres plenty of them spose you go an bring one any way well swill him with the coldest water we can get  they laid a soaked singlet upon his head with a couple of iron spanners under it and then sat down to watch the effect somewhat to their astonishment it did not appear to do him any appreciable good darkness closed down as they waited and it seemed to grow hotter than ever while the thick white steam rose from the swamps tom stood up and lighted the lamp  the fevers easier he said ive had it you give him the mixtureits down in the bookthough i dont know what the meaning of all these sign things is that starts him perspiring an then its thick blankets we used to give them greenlime water in the mailboats  wheres the green limes said bill any way id give the sunstroke a decent chance first perhaps hell come out of it himself i dont know that it wouldnt be better if he did  jefferson came out of his limp unconsciousness into a raving delirium that night and they rolled him in two blankets while bill being left on watch wisely threw away the draught his comrade had concocted jefferson was also very little more sensible during the next few days and though the work went on before the week was over the two lonely englishmen found they had another difficulty to grapple with the sun was almost overhead and the iron deck insufferably hot when the surfboat negroes who had just finished their meal came forward together eight or nine big naked men with animal faces and splendid muscles nobody knew where they came from but when two or three of them appeared in a canoe jefferson had managed to make them understand that he was willing to pay them for their services and they forthwith went away and came back with several comrades and a man of shorter stature who had apparently worked on a steamboat or at a white mans factory they had worked tolerably well while jefferson was about to watch them but they had now apparently decided on another mode of behaviour for the attitude of their leader was unmistakably truculent the man called bill sitting on the fore hatch turned at the patter of naked feet and looked at him  well he said sharply what the  are you wanting  two bokus them green gin said the negro two lil piece of cloff every boy  tom laughed ironically there isnt any green gin bokus in the ship for one thing youll get your clothpiece when the work is done thats all ive got to say to you get out of this  the negro made a little forceful gesture you no cappy  well said bill drily he figures hes a bloomin admiral in the meanwhile and thats good enough for you go home again and dont worry me  two cloffpiece said the negro two cloffpiece every boy you no lib for get them we come down too much boy an take them teamboat from you  the white men looked at one another and it was evident that they were uncertain how far the negro might be able to make good his threat there was as it happened very little to prevent him doing it and stockaded factories as well as stranded steamboats have been looted in western africa still they remembered that they had the prestige of their colour to maintain  oh get out one time said tom  the negro turned upon him you no cappy you low white teamboat bushman too much boy he lib for come down one night an cut you big fat troat  bill who was big and brawny rose with an air of sorrowful resignation this  nonsense has got to be stopped he said and walked tranquilly towards the negro you wouldnt listen to reason blackfunnelpaint  then before the latter quite realised what had happened to him a grimy fist descended upon his jaw and as he staggered backwards somebody seized his shoulders and whirled him round in another moment bill kicked with all his might and the negro went out headlong through the open gangway into the creek alongside in the meanwhile the spaniards came tumbling from the hatch and though they were quiet men they carried long canary knives the sight of them was enough for the negroes and they followed their leader plunging from the gangway or over the rail their canoes still lay beneath the quarter and though tom hurled a few big lumps of coal on them as they got under way they were flying up the creek in another minute with paddles flashing  then bill explained the affair to the canarios as well as he could and afterward drew his comrade back into the shadow of the deckhouse to hold a council both of them felt somewhat lonely as they blinked at the desolation of dingy mangroves which hemmed them in there was so far as they knew not a white man in that part of africa and the intentions of the negroes were apparently by no means amicable  funnelpaint may come back an bring his friends said tom i dont know whats to stop him if he wants to theres not a gun in the ship except mr jeffersons pistol an those canary fellows knives an we cant worry mr jefferson about the thing when hes too sick to understand if id only begun on him for fever he might have been better  im thankful said bill as he isnt dead it wouldnt be very astonishing but that dont matter  youd think it mattered a good deal if you was mr jefferson if i wasnt that anxious about him id let you try your hand an see how easy it is worrying out that book as it is one of us is enough  im thinking said bill sourly as its a  sight too much  tom glared at him a moment for one of the effects that climate has upon a white mans nerves is to keep him in a state of prickly irritation but he was more anxious than he cared to confess too anxious indeed to force a quarrel  well he said ill ask you what you mean another time just now weve got to do a little for mr jefferson and a little for ourselves eight pound a month all found and a fiftypound bonus when he gets her off isnt to be picked up everywhere and of course theres no telling when you an me may get the fever now then we want a boss who isnt sick an more men as well as a doctor  of course howre you goin to get em  not here they dont grow in the swamps somebodys got to go for them an las palmas is the best place you could find a westcoast mailboat goin home if you went down the creek in the launch theyve a man or two sick in the engine room most trips an theyd be glad to take you firin now before mr jefferson got that sunstroke he showed me two envelopes if he was to peg out sudden i was to see the men in las palmas got them and theyd tell me what to do men do peg out at any time in this country well you look for a liner an take those letters if its a good boat shell only be four or five days steaming up the trades mr jefferson deserves a chance for his life  whats wrong with takin him too or all of us goin for that matter asked his companion  eight pounds a month an a bonus besides mr jefferson put all his money into getting this ship off if he comes round an finds it thrown away hes not going to be grateful to either of us  bill sat silent evidently thinking hard for a minute or two well he said theres sense in the thing an ill try it youll be all right with those canariers theyre nice quiet men an if you make em say it over lots of times you can generally understand em walleye can bring the launch back ill get out of this when weve steam up  it was two hours later when he and one of the canarios who had worked on board the coaling companys tug departed and the rest clustering along the cumbrias rail watched them wistfully as the little clanking craft slid down the creek they would very much have liked to have gone in her and might have done so had not jefferson had the forethought to promise them a small share of the profit when the work was done and fed them well there are also men who inspire confidence in those they lead and sailormen capable of carrying out a bargain thus there were no open expressions of regret or misgivings when the last of the launchs smoketrail melted above the mangroves though tom looked very grave as he clawed the shoulder of an olivefaced canario seaman who did not understand him  if that man goes on the loose with what he gets for firin an forgets all about those letters it wont be nice for us he said in the meanwhile weve just got to buck up and lighten the blame old scrapiron tank between us  he called her a few other names while the spaniard watched him smiling and having so relieved himself went softly into the skippers room where jefferson lay a wornout shadow of a man wrapped in very dirty blankets and babbling incoherently     chapter ix  austin makes a venture   it was late one hot night when austin first met captain farquhar of the ss carsegarry in a calle of santa cruz and the worthy shipmaster being then in a somewhat unpleasant position was sincerely pleased to see him the carsegarry had reached las palmas with three thousand tons of steam coal some ten days earlier and because there are disadvantages attached to living on board a vessel that is discharging coal farquhar had taken up his abode at the metropole he had as usual made friends with almost everybody in the hotel during the first few days which said a good deal for his capabilities considering that most of them were englishmen and then finding their society pall on him went across to santa cruz in search of adventure and more congenial company  as it happened he found the latter in the person of another englishman with similar tastes and one or two of their frolics are remembered in that island yet on the night farquhar came across austin they had amused themselves not altogether wisely in a certain cafÃ© from which its proprietor begged them to depart when they had broken one citizens guitar and damaged anothers clothes then as it was getting late they adjourned to the mole where the englishman had arranged that a boat at his command should meet them and convey farquhar who was going back to las palmas next day on board the estremedura the boat was not forthcoming and the englishmans temper deteriorated while they waited half an hour for it until when at last the splash of oars came out of the soft darkness he was not only in a very unpleasant humour but determined upon showing his companion that he was not a man with whom a spanish crew could take liberties  there was also a pile of limestone on the mole and when a shadowy launch slid into the blackness beneath it he hurled down the biggest lumps he could find as well as a torrent of castilian vituperation then however instead of the excuses he had expected there were wrathful cries and the englishman gasped when he saw dim whiteclad figures clambering in portentous haste up the adjacent steps  well have to get out of thisquick he said ive made a little mistake its somebody elses boat  they set about it without waste of time but there was a good deal of merchandise lying about the mole and the englishman who fell over some of it lay still until a peon came across him peacefully asleep behind a barrel next morning farquhar however ran on snatching up a handspike as he went with odd lumps of limestone hurtling behind him and as he and his pursuers made a good deal of noise as they sped across the plaza at the head of the mole the citizens still left in the cafÃ©s turned out to enjoy the spectacle english seafarers are tolerated in that city but it is perhaps their own fault that they are not regarded with any particular favour and when farquhar turned at bay in a doorway and proceeded to defy all the subjects of spain nobody was anxious to stand between him and the barelegged sailors who had nasty knives it might in fact have gone hard with him had not two civiles with big revolvers strapped about them arrived  they heard the crowds explanations with official unconcern and then though it was perhaps their duty to place farquhar in safe custody in the cuartel decided on sending for austin who was known to be staying that night in a neighbouring hotel he had befriended english skippers already under somewhat similar circumstances and the civiles who knew their business were quite aware that nobody would thank them for forcing the affair upon the attention of the english consul austin came and saw farquhar gazing angrily at the civiles and still gripping his bar while the crowd stood round and made insulting remarks about him in castilian he at once grasped the position and made a sign of concurrence when one of the civiles spoke to him  you take him to his steamer said the officer one of us will come round in the morning when he understands  austin turned to farquhar give the man that bar he said come along and ill send you off to your steamer  im going to have satisfaction out of some of them first and farquhar made an indignant gesture of protest then ill knock up the consul ill show them if a crowd of garliceating pigs can run after me  if you stop here youll probably get it in the shape of a knife between your ribs said austin who seized his arm a wise man doesnt drag in the consul when he wants to keep his berth  he forced farquhar who still protested vigorously along and because the civiles marched behind conveyed him to the mole where a boat was procured to take them off to the estremedura farquhar had cooled down a little by the time they reached her and appeared grateful when austin put him into his berth  perhaps you did save me some trouble and ill not forget you he said take you round all the nice people in las palmas and tell them youre a friend of mine  im not sure it would be very much of a recommendation said austin drily  farquhar laughed thats where youre mistaken when ive been a week in a place im friends with everybody worth knowing  if tonights affair is anything to go by its a little difficult to understand how you manage it said austin  its quite easy to be looked up to and still have your fun and farquhar lowered his voice confidentially when folks think a good deal of you in one place you have only to go somewhere else when you feel the fit coming on  the estremedura sailed for las palmas next morning and on arriving there austin was somewhat astonished to discover that farquhar had in fact acquired the goodwill of a good many people of consequence in that city he was a genial frolicloving man and austin who became sensible of a liking for him spent a good deal of his leisure on board the carsegarry while when the estremedura came back there he also consented to advise farquhar about the getting up of a dance to which everybody was invited it was a testimony to the latters capacity for making friends that a good many of them came and among the rest were pancho brown his daughter muriel gascoyne and mrs hatherly as well as the commander of a spanish warship and several officers of artillery  the night was soft and still and clear moonlight shone down upon the sea the trade breeze had fallen away and only a little cool air came down from the black isleta hill while fleecy mists drifted ethereally athwart the jagged peaks of the great cordillera an orchestra of guitars and mandolins discoursed spanish music from the poop and there was room for bolero and casucha on the big afterhatch while when the waltzers had swung round it the carsegarrys engineer made shift to play the english lancers on his fiddle everybody seemed content and the genial farquhar diffused high spirits and good humour  austin had swung through a waltz with jacinta though the guitars were still twinging softly when they climbed the ladder to the bridgedeck where canvas chairs were laid out it was a curious waltz tinged with the melancholy there is in most spanish music but the crash of a gun broke through it and while the roar of a whistle drowned the drowsy murmur of the surf the long black hull of an african mailboat slid into the harbour ringed with lights then there followed the rattle of cable and austin fancied that the sight of the steamer had for no very apparent reason its effect upon his companion she had been cordial during the evening but there was a faint suggestion of hardness in her face as she turned to him  i am especially fond of that waltz she said you may have noticed theres a trace of what one might call the bizarre in it no doubt its eastern they got it from the moors  it only struck me as very pretty said austin who surmised by her expression that jacinta was preparing the way for what she meant to say im afraid im not much of a musician  you at least dance rather well there are not many englishmen who really do which is perhaps no great disadvantage after all  austin laughed though he was a trifle perplexed well he said though you dont overwhelm me with compliments as a rule you have told me that i could dance before now however one could almost fancy that the fact didnt meet with your approval  jacinta looked at him reflectively over her fan i scarcely supposed you would understand and one does not always feel in the mood to undertake a logical exposition of their views still heres muriel and she at least generally seems to know just what she means suppose you ask her what she thinks of dancing  austin did so and miss gascoyne who was crossing the deckbridge with farquhar stopped beside them  i dont think there is any harm in dancing in itselfin fact i have just been waltzing with captain farquhar she said of course the disadvantage attached to amusements of any kind is that they may distract ones attention from more serious things dont you think so captain farquhar  farquhar caught austins eye and grinned wickedly but miss gascoyne who failed to notice this glanced towards the steamer which had just come in  that must be the african boat but i suppose there is no use expecting any news she said quietly though there was a faint suggestive tremour in her voice  she passed on with farquhar and jacinta glanced at austin with a little enquiring smile  if i had a sister who persisted in talking in that aggravatingly edifying fashion i should feel tempted to shake her he said still one could forgive her a good deal if only for the way she looked at the westcoast boat it suggested that she has as much humanity in her as there is in the rest of us after all  still dont you think there was a little reason in what she said  of course that is no doubt why one objects to it well since its difficult to keep the personal equation out i suppose dancing and sailing about these islands on board the estremedura is rather a wasteful life painting little pictures probably comes to much the same thing too though there are people who seem to take art seriously  jacinta looked at him steadily when one has really an artistic talent it is different she said  austin who hoped she did not notice that he winced sat silent a space gazing out across the glittering sea and it was not altogether a coincidence that his eyes were turned eastwards towards africa where jefferson was toiling in the fever swamps he wondered if jacinta knew his thoughts had also turned in that direction somewhat frequently of late  well he said i suppose it is some of those pictures must be pretty or the tourists wouldnt buy them but that doesnt go very far after all he stopped a moment and then went on with a little wry smile no doubt some patients require drastic treatment and there are cases where it is necessary to use the knife  jacinta rose and dropping her fan to her side gravely met his gaze  if it wasnt it would probably not be tried she said one could fancy that it was now and then a little painful to the surgeon  austin walked with her to the ladder and stopped a moment at the head of it well he said one has to remember that all men are not built on the same model and what is more to the purpose they havent all the same opportunities no doubt the latter fact is fortunate for some of them since they would probably make a deplorable mess of things if they undertook a big enterprise  ah said jacinta who remembered it afterwards one never knows when the opportunities may present themselves  she went down the ladder and it was about an hour later when a boat slid alongside and a man came up asking for austin the latter who sat on the bridgedeck amidst a group of farquhars guests looked at him curiously when he handed him an envelope his garments had evidently not been made for him and there were stains of grease and soot on his coarse serge jacket while the coal dust had not been wholly washed from his face it was not difficult to recognise him as a steamers fireman  youre mr austin he said  austin admitted that he was and after a glance at the letter turned round and saw that muriel gascoyne who sat close by was watching him with a curious intentness then he once more fixed his attention on the paper in his hand  ss cumbria was written at the top of it and there followed a description of the creek and how the steamer lay as well as the cargo in her holds then he read im beginning to understand why those wrecker fellows let up on the contract though they hadnt the stake i have in the game there are times when i get wondering whether i can last it out for it seems to me that white men who work in the sun all day are apt to drop out suddenly in this country i make you and mr pancho brown my executors in case of anything of that kind happening to me if you come across anybody willing to take the cumbria over as a business proposition do what you can on the understanding that onethird of the profit goes to miss gascoyne the rest as executors and wreckers remuneration i dont know how far this statement meets your law but i feel i can trust you any way in case either party is not willing to take the thing up the other may act alone  austin turned to the fireman you have another letter for mr brown  yes sir said the man mr jefferson  austin who heard a rustle of feminine draperies and what seemed to be a little gasp of surprise or alarm made the man a sign  come into the skippers room ive two or three things to ask you he said miss brown will you please hand that letter to your father  they disappeared into the room beneath the bridge and it was some time before they came out again then austin sent the man down the ladder with a steward to take him to brown and leaned against the rail jacinta muriel and mrs hatherly were still sitting there but the rest had gone he told them briefly all he had heard about jefferson and then descended the ladder in search of brown the latter met him with the letter in his hand and they found a seat in the shadow of the carsegarrys rail nobody seemed to notice them though the fluttering dresses of the women brushed them as they swung in the waltz  you have read it said austin what do you think  pancho brown tapped the letter with the goldrimmed glasses he held in his hand  as a business proposition i would not look at it the risks are too great he said  it struck me like that too still thats not quite the question you see the man isnt dead  i almost think he is by this time said brown reflectively now he did not seem quite sure when he wrote those letters that there was really any gum in her at least he hadnt found it and i understand that circumstances had made him a little suspicious about the cumbrias skipper who we know is dead taking oil at present value in view of what we would have to pay for a salvage expedition and chartering there is it seems to me nothing in the thing  im not quite sure of that but you are still presuming jefferson dead  brown turned and looked at him the first thing we have to do is to find out somebody will have to go across and of course he must be a reliable man i should be disposed to go so far as to meet the necessary expenses not as a business venture but because jacinta would give me no peace if i didnt  there would be no difficulty about the man  brown turned to him sharply you  yes if jefferson is dead i should probably also undertake to do what i can to meet his wishes as executor  brown sat silent a space and then tapped the letter with his glasses again in that case i might go as far as to find say Â£200 it should at least be sufficient to prove if there is any odd chance of getting the cumbria off  i think i shall do that with Â£80 but i should prefer that you did not provide it that is unless you decide to go into the thing on a business footing and take your share of the results as laid down by jefferson  brown seemed to be looking hard at him but they sat in shadow and austin was glad of it  ah he said quietly though there was a significance in his tone well somebody must certainly go across and if you fail elsewhere you can always fall back on me fora loan when are you going  by the first boat that calls anywhere near the creek  he rose and turned away but pancho brown sat still with a curious expression in his face if any of the dancers had noticed him it would probably have occurred to them that he was thinking hard pancho brown was a quiet man but he often noticed a good deal more than his daughter gave him credit for still when at length he rose and joined farquhar there was nothing in his appearance which suggested that he was either anxious or displeased  in the meanwhile austin came upon mrs hatherly who was wandering up and down the deck and she drew him beneath a lifeboat  miss gascoyne is no doubt distressed i am sorry for her he said  the little lady held his arm in a tightening grasp of course she said and there was a tremour in her voice still after all that does not concern us most just now somebody must go and see what can be done for mr jefferson  yes said austin i am going  thenand i am sure you will excuse meit will cost a good deal and you cannot be a rich man or  i should not have been on board the estremedura you are quite correct madam  mrs hatherly made a little deprecatory gesture i am not exactly poor in fact i have more money than i shall live to spend and i always meant to leave it to muriel it seems to me that it would be wiser to spend some of it on her now you will let me give you what you want mr austin  austin stood silent a moment with a flush in his face and then gravely met her gaze  i almost think i could let you lend me forty pounds with that i shall have enough in the meanwhile you will not think me ungracious if i say that just now i am especially sorry i have not more money of my own  the little lady smiled at him oh i understand that is what made me almost afraid it cannot be nice to borrow from a woman still i think you could if it was necessary do even harder things  i shall probably have to said austin a trifle drily i dont mind admitting that what you have suggested is a great relief to me  you would naturally sooner let me lend it you than mr brown  why should you suppose that and the flush crept back into austins face  mrs hatherly smiled again ah she said i am an old woman and have my fancies but they are right now and then i will send you a cheque tomorrow and mr austin i should like you to think of me as one of your friends do you know that i told muriel half an hour ago you would go  austin made her a little grave inclination though there was a smile in his eyes  i am not sure that any of my other friends has so much confidence in me madam he said after all it is another responsibility and i shall have to do what i can  the little lady smiled at him as she turned away well she said quietly i think that will be a good deal  it was ten minutes later when austin met jacinta and she stopped him with a sign  you are going to mr jefferson she said  yes said austin with a trace of dryness i believe so after all he is a friend of mine  jacinta watched him closely and her pale olivetinting was a trifle warmer in tone than usual his selfcontrol was excellent to the little smile but she could make a shrewd guess as to what it cost him  soon she asked  in two or three days that is if the compania dont get the spaniards to lay hands on me by the way you may as well know now that i had to get mrs hatherly to lend me part at least of the necessary money  jacinta flushed visibly you will not be vindictive though of course i have now and then been hard on you  i shouldnt venture to blame you as we admitted there are occasions on which one has to resort to drastic remedies  jacinta stopped him with a gesture pleaseyou wont she said of course i deserve it but you will try to forgive me you can afford tonow  she stood still a moment in the moonlight an ethereal whiteclad figure with a suggestion of uncertainly and apprehension in her face which very few people had ever seen there before and then turned abruptly with a little smile of relief as miss gascoyne came towards them  hes going out muriel you will thank himi dont seem able to she said  muriel came forward with outstretched hands and in another moment austin to his visible embarrassment felt her warm grasp  oh she said mrs hatherly knew you meant to i feel quite sure i can trust you to bring him back to me  austin managed to disengage his hands and smiled a little though it was jacinta he looked at  i think he said i have a sufficient inducement for doing what i can still you will excuse me there are one or two points i want to talk over with captain farquhar  he turned away and twenty minutes later jacinta standing on the bridgedeck alone watched his boat slide away into the blaze of moonlight that stretched suggestively towards africa     chapter x  jacinta is not content   darkness was closing down on the faintly shining sea and the dull murmur of the surf grew louder as the tradebreeze died away when jacinta and muriel gascoyne sat in the stern of a white gig which two barefooted canarios pulled across las palmas harbour on the evening on which austin was to sail in front of them the spray still tossed in filmy clouds about the head of the long dusky mole and the lonely isleta hill cut black as ebony against a cold green transparency while skeins of lights twinkled into brilliancy round the sweep of bay jacinta however saw nothing of this she was watching the estremeduras dark hull rise higher above the line of mole and listening to one of the boatmen who accompanied the rhythmic splash of oars with a little melodious song she long afterwards remembered its plaintive cadence and the words of it well  las aves marinas vuelen encima la mar he sang and then while the measured thud and splash grew a trifle faster no pueden escapar las penas del amor  he did not seem to know the rest of it and when she had heard the stanza several times jacinta who saw muriels eyes fixed upon her enquiringly made a little halfimpatient gesture  its the usual sentimental rubbish though he sings passably well even the sea birds cannot escape the pains of love she said absurd isnt it like most of the men one comes across nowadays they probably spend all their time in search of something to eat still i supposeyouwould sympathise with the man whose perverted imagination led him to write that song  muriel looked at her with a hint of reproach in her big blue eyes which were very reposeful i dont think i ever quite understood you and i dont now but i once went to see an english gullery she said there were rows of nests packed so close that one could scarcely pick a way between with little halffeathered things in most of them they all had their mouths open  jacinta laughed musically of course she said you are delightful but never mind me go on a little further  it was the big gulls i was thinking of said muriel gravely they didnt fly away but hung just above us in a great white cloud wheeling screaming and now and then making little swoops at our heads it didnt seem to matter what happened to them but any one could see they were in an agony of terror lest we should tread upon some of the little halffeathered nestlings i came away as soon as the others would let me it seemed a cruelty to frighten them  it seems to me said jacinta that you are anticipating or confusing things considerably but ill try not to offend you by making that a little plainer though i should almost like to im in quite a prickly humour tonight  she sat silent a moment or two while a trace of colour crept in her companions face looking out towards the eastern haze as she had done of late somewhat frequently  yes she said reflectively i feel that it would be a relief to make you upset and angry you are so aggravatingly sure of everything and serene of course that is perhaps only natural after all you have in one respect got just what you wanted and have sense enough to be content with it  muriel turned and looked at her with a trace of bewilderment for there was an unusual hardness in jacintas tone  wouldnt everybody be content in such a case she asked  oh dear no and jacinta laughed i for one would begin to look for flaws in the thing whatever it was and wonder if it wouldnt be wiser to change it for something else in fact i dont mind telling you i feel like that tonight you see for a year at least i have been trying to bring a certain thing about andnow i have succeededi wish i hadnt of course you wont understand me and i dont mean you to but you may as well remember that its a somewhat perilous thing to keep on giving people good advice some day they will probably act upon it  but that ought to please one  jacinta glanced once more into the soft darkness that crept up from the east with a little shiver well she said sharply in my case it certainly doesnt  they were alongside the estremedura in another minute but the seaman they found on deck did not know where austin was and led them down to macallisters room it was beneath the spardeck and very hot for the dynamo was not running that night and a big oil lamp lighted it it was also full of tobacco smoke andfor the port was openthe rumble of the long swell tumbling against the mole came throbbing into it a big man in very shabby serge with a hard face sat opposite the engineer until the latter seeing the two women laid a hand upon his shoulder  out ye get he said and his guest was projected suddenly into the dimlylighted space about the afterhatch  then he smiled upon the newcomers affably come away in he said was it me or mr austin ye came to see  on this occasion it was mr austin said jacinta who found a place opposite him beside muriel on a settee of course that was because he is going away isnt he here  he is not and macallister beamed at her in one way its not that much of a pity theres twice the lightheartedness in me that there is in mr austin  i can quite believe it still lightheartedness of one kind is now and then a little inconvenient where has he gone  to the town i dont expect him until he calls for his manthe one ive just hove outwhen the westcoast mailboat comes in she wont stop more than half an hour but theres no sign of her yet  jacinta sighed whimsically perhaps to hide what she felt  then im afraid we shall not see him which is a pity because ive been thinking over the nice things i meant to say to him and now theyre all wasted she said you will tell him that we came to say goodbye to him wont you and that im just a little vexed he never called to tell us anything about his expedition  macallister grinned sardonically and though jacinta was usually a very selfpossessed young woman she appeared to find his gaze a trifle disconcerting  well he said i know all about it he has sold everything he had and he borrowed Â£40 one way or another he has another Â£60 of his own  jacinta looked up sharply he has no more than that  its not likely and macallister watched her with a faint twinkle in his eyes i do not know why he would not have the Â£200 mr brown offered him maybe ye do  there was a just perceptible trace of colour in jacintas cheek i hardly see how you could expect me to when i never heard of it until this moment she said would Â£100 be enough for mr austin  im thinking it would no for everybody under the same circumstances but enough for him there are folks in these islands who have only seen the outside of mr austin which ye may observe is in one sense quite a natural thing  he stopped a moment and smiled upon her genially its not his fault that hes no quite so well favoured as i am what would ye expect of an englishman still there are men aboard here who have seen whats underneathi mean the other side of himat nights when he brought the dispatch off through the surf and oncethough that was not his businesswhen i was sick an they let water down in the starboard boiler  still said jacinta he would naturally have to have so many things  he has four good men a little box o drugs and a case o dynamite farquhars going on to australia with mining stores and he gave it him  it seemed absurdly insufficient and jacinta struggled with an almost hysterical inclination to laugh it was she realised a very big thing austin had undertaken and his equipment consisted of a case of dynamite and a box of drugs which on his own confession he knew very little about still she saw that macallister who she fancied ought to know rated manhood far higher than material it was muriel who broke the silence  but they will want a doctor she said with a little tremour in her voice  macallister shook his head ye would not get one to go there for Â£500 and he would be no use if he did he said ye will remember that malaria fever does not stay on one long it goes away when it has shaken the strength out o yeand now and then comes back againwhile by the time austin gets there mr jefferson will be  he stopped with some abruptness but though she shivered muriel looked at him with steady eyes  ah she said you mean he will either be better or that no doctor could cure him then  macallister made her a little inclination and it was done with a grave deference that jacinta had scarcely expected from him  just that he said im thinking ye are one of the women a man can tell the truth to it is a pity there are not more o them it is no a healthy country mr austin is going to but i have been five years on the coast o it and ye see me here  i wonder said jacinta whether you who know all about ships and engines did not feel tempted to go with mr austin  the engineer smiled curiously tempted he said it was like trying to be teetotal with a whisky bottle in the rack above ones bunk but i am a married man with a wife who has a weakness for buying diningroom suites  diningroom suites what have they to do with it  just everything and macallister sighed she will only have the biggest ones the doors will let in and she has furnished a good many diningrooms altogether ye will mind that we lived here and there and everywhere while shes back in england now ye would not meet a better woman but on Â£20 a month ye cannot buy unlimited redvelvet chairs and sideboards with lookingglasses at the back o them  jacinta laughed as she rose you will tell mr austin we are sorry we did not see him  i will and macallister stood up too perhaps ye mean it this time and im a little sorry for him myself there are men who get sent off with bands and speeches and dinners to do a smaller thing but mr austin he just slips away with his box o dynamite and his few sailormen  he stopped and looked hard at her a moment before he turned to muriel still well have the big drum out when he brings mr jefferson and the cumbria back again and if theres anything that can be broken left whole in this ship that night it will be no fault o mine  they went out and left him but jacinta stopped when they came upon the man he had ejected from his room sitting on the companion stairway and smoking a very objectionable pipe she also held a little purse concealed beneath her hand  you are going back with mr austin to the cumbria she said  the man stood up in course he said its eight pound a month all found an a bonus  ah said jacinta i suppose there is nothing else  the man appeared to ruminate over this until a light broke in on him  well he said mr jefferson does the straight thing an he fed us well that is as well as he could considering everything  jacinta smiled at muriel you will notice the answer he is a man then she held out a strip of crinkly paper that will make you almost a month to the good and if you do everything you can to make things easier for the man who wants to get the cumbria off there will probably be another waiting for you when you come back again  the man who took the crinkly paper gazed at it in astonishment and then made a little sign of comprehension thank you kindly miss but which one am i to look after special you see theres two of them  jacinta was apparently not quite herself that night for the swift colour flickered into her face and stayed there a moment  both she said decisively still you are never to tell anybody about that note  the man once more gazed at her with such evident bewilderment that muriel broke into a little halfaudible laugh then he grinned suddenly and touched his battered cap  well well make itboth he said  they went up the companion and left him apparently chuckling but jacinta appeared far from pleased when she got into the waiting boat  that was to have gone to england for a hat and one or two things i really cant do withoutthough i shall probably have to now she said oh arent they stupid sometimesi felt i could have shaken him  in the meanwhile the man in the firemans serge went back to macallisters room  give me an envelopequick he said  macallister got him one and he slipped a strip of paper inside before he addressed it and tossed it across the table  youll post that theres a castle boat home tomorrow and id sooner trust you with it than myself he said with a little sigh which however once more changed to a chuckle  if theres money inside it yere wise said macallister drily still what are ye grinning in yon fashion for  i was thinking its just as well ive onlyoneold woman it would make a big hole in eight pounds a monthan a bonusif i had any more of em but you get that letter posted before i want it back  wanting said macallister reflectively is no always getting maybe its now and then fortunate it is so after all  it was two hours later and jacinta stood on the flat roof of pancho browns house looking down upon the closepacked spanish town when the crash of a mail gun rose from the harbour and was lost in the drowsy murmur of the surf then the other noises in the hot streets below her went on again but jacinta scarcely heard the hum of voices and the patter of feet as she watched a blinking light slide out from among the others in the harbour it rose higher and swung a little as it crept past the mole then a cluster of lower lights lengthened into a row of yellow specks and she could make out the westcoast liners dusky hull that moved out with slanting spars faster into the faintly shining sea jacinta closed one hand as she leaned upon the parapet and watched it until she turned with a little start at the sound of footsteps she was one could have fancied not particularly pleased to see muriel gascoyne then  we were wondering what had become of you and mrs hatherly is waiting to go home said the latter then she turned and caught a glimpse of the moving lights that were closing in on one another and growing dim again that must be the african boat  it is she is taking out six careless sailormen whose lives are perhaps after all of some value to them  muriel looked at her and wished she could see her face every one of them may be of some value to somebody else  i suppose so and jacinta laughed curiously you obvious people are now and then to be envied muriel  if there is anything you would like to tell me and muriel laid a hand upon her arm with a gesture of sympathy  there isnt we all have our discontented fits and mine is no doubt more than usually unreasonable since everything has turned out as i wanted it  then she rose and turned towards the stairway with a little laugh which muriel fancied had a hint of pride in it i really dont think i would have had anything done differently after all and now i must not keep mrs hatherly waiting     chapter xi  the land of the shadow   it was towards the end of the afternoon when the skipper of the westcoast mailboat peering through his glasses made out two palms that rose apparently straight out of the sea he watched them for some minutes and then took their bearing carefully upon the compass before he rang for half speed and called austin to the bridge  thats your island and well run in until i get under six fathoms he said after that it will have to be the surfboat and i fancy you will be very wet when you get ashore  it seemed to austin that this was more than probable for although there was not an air of wind to wrinkle it a long heave came up in vast slow undulations out of the southern horizon and the little mailboat swung over them with sharply slanted spars and funnel she stopped once for a few moments while the deepsea lead plunged from her forecastle and then with propeller throbbing slowly crept on again she had come out of her course already under the terms of the bargain austin had made with the las palmas agent for some of those steamers have the option of stopping for odd boatloads of cargo and passengers wherever they can be found along the surfswept beaches and since no offer he could make would have tempted her skipper to venture further in among the shoals austin had fixed upon that island as the nearest point of access to the cumbria he did not however know how he was to reach her when he got there  in the meanwhile they were slowly raising the land or the nearest approach to it to be found in that part of africa which consists of mire and mangroves intersected everywhere by lanes of water it lay ahead a grey smear streaked with drifting mist against which the palms that had now grown into a cluster rose dim and indistinct and a thin white line stretched between themselves and it the skipper appeared to watch the latter anxiously  theres considerable surf running in on the beach and im a little uneasy about my boat he said i suppose it wouldnt suit you to go on with us and look for a better place to get ashore tomorrow  no said austin decisively im far enough from where im going already and one would scarcely fancy that there are many facilities for getting about in this country  the skipper made a little gesture of resignation thats a fact he said well i cant go back on the agent but if the boat turns you and the boys out before you get there you cant blame me  austin laughed he had got many a wet jacket and had once or twice had to swim for it in the surf of the canary beaches though he was quite aware that there are very few places where the sea runs in and breaks as it does on the hammered coast of western africa indeed as he watched the blur of steamy mangroves grow clearer and the filmy spouting increase in whiteness he could have fancied that nature in placing that barrier of tumbling foam along its shore had meant it as a warning that the white man was not wanted there the air was hot and heavy the sky a dingy grey the sea a dim slatey green and there came off across the steep heave a dull booming like the sound of distant thunder  it was not an encouraging prospect and austin knew from what he had heard about the country that he was not likely to be more favourably impressed with it upon closer acquaintance he also felt that if there was not quite so much at stake he could very willingly leave the salving of the cumbria to jefferson and take the next steamer back again he could fix upon no sufficient reason for his being there at all since the very uncertain profits on a quarter share in the venture did not account for it in one respect also jacintas favourable opinion could scarcely be of any practical value to him since she would naturally marry a man of means by and by and forget all about him still she had dropping now and then a barbed word which rankled in his memory striven to stir him to endeavour and now he was watching the spray drive across a beach of western africa while he wondered what the result of it all would be and whether he or the men he had brought with him would escape the fever so far as he was concerned it did not seem to greatly matter he had taken life easily but he realised that it had very little to offer him and it was perhaps fortunate that he did so since it is as a rule broken men and those who have nothing to fall back upon who accomplish what is most worth doing in the lands that lie beneath the shadow  in any case it was clear that he had broken down the last bridge behind him when the mailboat stopped and lay rolling more wildly than ever athwart the long swell a big surfboat sank down her side amidst a clatter of blocks and complaining of davitfalls down which a cluster of almost naked black men slid on board it was not an easy matter to descend after them the steamer rolled one way the boat another while the latter swung up one moment almost level with her rail and swooped down beneath a fathom of streaming side the next austin bill the fireman and the canarios however accomplished it and there was a waving of hats among the cluster of passengers who watched them above then the negroes perched six or seven on either side took up the paddles and austin was sensible of a momentary sinking of his heart as the boat slid out from the rolling steamer she was a part of the civilisation he had been accustomed to and when a sonorous blast of her whistle came throbbing after him in farewell he sighed  he would however at least not look behind and sitting in the sternsheets out of the paddlers way he tossed the canarios a bundle of maizehusk cigarettes and passed one to bill the fireman who glanced at it scornfully then he made himself as comfortable as he could upon the box of dynamite while he lighted another for that compound of nitroglycerine is supposed to require a detonator and nobody is very particular who has lived in spain the black men wanted cigarettes too but austin did not hand them any the island was still a good way off and it seemed to him advisable that they should devote their attention to their paddling  they did it swaying rhythmically with toes in a loop of fibre and naked black bodies that straightened suddenly and bent again while some kept up a measured hissing and the rest broke into a little doleful song a brawny man with a blue stripe down his forehead stood upright grasping the sculling oar astern and the boat swung along smoothly with big dim slopes of water rolling up astern of her they however grew steeper as she drew in with the shore and the easy dip and swing became a succession of fierce rushes during which she drove onwards lifted high with the foam seething to her gunwale and then swooped suddenly into the hollow when she did so austin glancing aft could see a great slope of water that grew steeper and steeper as it came speeding after her  then the slopes became ridges that frothed above and roared and the paddles whirled faster while the big muscles bunched beneath the helmsmans skin and the veins began to stand out on his sable forehead the boat no longer sailed inshore she sped like a toboggan on an icy slide though it seemed to austin that the comparison was faulty because she went fastest uphill while when he rose upright for a moment he could see no shore at all there was only a succession of parallel white ridges in front of them and a filmy cloud of spray the afternoon was also wearing through and the vapours from the steaming swamps obscured the dingy heavens  it was even less consoling to glance astern for the surf that sweeps the fever coast was evidently rather worse than usual that day as it is now and then for no very apparent reason the ridges had become walls with great frothing crests and sides that were smeared with spumy lines they had the vast slow lift and fall of the ocean behind them and were running up a smoothly slanted plane of shoals  the black men paddled faster and they no longer sang they hissed and shrieked and whistled while the thud of their paddles rose in a strenuous rhythm like the tapping of a great drum and the craft careered at furious speed beneath them driven by the sea the foam stood feet above her now when she sped along very like an arrow and boiled in over her high pointed stern every now and then there was a foot of brine inside her that swilled to and fro and every man was dripping while the roar of the tumbling rollers had grown bewildering they appeared to be crumbling upon hammered sand not very far away  how the negroes meant to beach her austin did not know and he was content that it was their business and not his the canarios were evidently uneasy for sailormen as they were they had never run through surf like this but they were also of iberian extraction and when discussion is clearly useless and the last crisis must be faced the spaniard is at least as capable of calm resignation as most other men in any case there is certainly no better boatboy than the west african kroo and austin left the affair to the helmsman when there was a sudden horrifying crash that threw three or four of the paddlers down together it was evident that they had touched bottom but fortunately for them the swirl of the shorerunning sea dragged them off again and they went up not more than half swamped sideways with the foam seething into her on the next roller then the spouting chaos about them seemed to suddenly melt away and austin wiping the water from his eyes saw that they were sliding round a sandy beach into a little bay  in another few minutes they were out on the sand though they toiled for the next half hour helping the negroes to tilt the great boat and run her in again when they had emptied the water out of her it was done at last and austin felt almost sorry while he was once more sensible of vague but unpleasant misgivings when the negroes drove her lurching out into the spray night was not very far away and he had no notion of where he was to sleep or what he was to eat for that matter since the provisions the steward had given him were for the most part saturated a little muddy creek oozed down amidst the mangroves across the bay and there were a few huts apparently made of rammed soil beside it as well as a canoe the light was going when they reached them and bill who went into the nearest came out suddenly  theres a dead nigger inside he said  austin looked at him with a little smile he had reasons for surmising that the mans nerves were good but his voice had an uncertain tone in it and his eyes were anxious  well he said i suppose one must expect to come across a dead nigger now and then in this country  bill glanced furtively over his shoulder towards the hut as though he desired to be rather farther away from it  that one wasnt nice to look at he said what did they leave him there for when theres a creek just outside the door and where are the rest of them id like to know what he died of it might be catchin  austin was once more sensible of a little thrill of apprehension as he looked about him and considered the question on the one side a tuft of palms dominated the narrow strip of sand but the little ridge of high land behind it was covered with apparently impenetrable jungle elsewhere the dingy mangroves rose from black depths of mire on slimy roots and pale stems that glimmered blanched amidst the drifting steam that clung about them night was close at hand and though there was no sign of the land breeze yet the air was thick and heavy with a hot sour smell the clamour of the surf made the deep silence more apparent for there was no sound of life about the clustered huts austin knew that the black man is frequently stricken by the pestilence and as he stood there on the little strip of desolate beach he felt his courage melting away from him the canarios he also saw were standing close together and murmuring excitedly while every now and then one of them would glance askance at the huts  if there was any niggers but dead ones in the place theyd have been out by now said bill  the cumbria should lie about north from here up the biggest creek said austin if we borrowed the canoe yonder you could find your way to her  id try that or anything so long as it was to get out of this  he glanced towards the hut again and austin who could not quite explain it then or afterwards became sensible that if he waited much longer he would say or do something that would not be seemly in one who was there as leader he felt that had he been alone he would probably have turned and run  well he said as quietly as he could contrive we will run the canoe down i believe some of the things they get are infectious now and then  he had no need to repeat the order the canarios jumped at the word and in another few minutes they had launched the canoe and were paddling her out of the creek clumsily as men unaccustomed to the oar might do it opened into a wider one through which the heave of the sea pulsed languidly until they crawled round a point and the streamy mangroves closed in on them then suddenly the thick hot darkness fell  they moored the canoe to a slimy stem and lay down in her packed like herrings but in spite of the mosquitoes austin slept a little of the night he was glad when all the swamps steamed again as the dawn broke suddenly upon them and when they had eaten they took up the paddles the mists thinned and melted the sun that sucked the damp from their dewsoaked clothing scorched their skin and the glare from the yellow water became intolerable still it was evident that it would not be advisable to waste any time and through the long hot hours the canoe crept on  now she slid into steamy shadow among the mangrove islets skirting belts of mire and now crept a slender strip of hull packed with wearied and perspiring humanity across broad reaches of flaming water that moved on inland under her streaked with smears of yellow foam it was evident to austin that the flood tide ran longer than usual there as it sometimes does about an island or the guinea stream had backed it up along the shore the stream however did not only set up the creek but slid through the forest where the trees rose on arched roots above the water and here and there they had to paddle hard to avoid being drawn into branchroofed tunnels that smelt like open sewers the refuse of leagues of forest seemed to lie rotting there  by afternoon austins hands were bleeding and one of his knees was raw where he pressed it as a point of resistance to paddle from on the crafts bottom but he took his place when his turn came though his eyes were dazzled and the headache that had crept upon him was growing insufferable he was now distinctly anxious as to when they would reach the cumbria for though bill said she lay up a big muddy creek north of the island he appeared by no means sure that was the one and austin felt he could not logically blame him creeks it was evident were bewilderingly plentiful in that country and there were no distinctive features in the scenery dingy whitestemmed mangroves fermenting mire and yellow water were all the same and as they crept on past bend and island there was no sign of change  the shadows lay black upon the water when they stopped again all of them horribly cramped and aching in every limb but when they had sat portentiously silent with the craft moored to a mangrove root for half an hour or so bill stood up in the bow  did you hear anything mr austin he asked  austin fancied that he did though for a moment or two he was not sure that it was not the ticking of his watch for the sound which was very faint had a beat in it then it grew a little louder and he felt a curious thrill of satisfaction  engines he said sharply its the launch  she swung out apparently from the mangroves in another few minutes and came on towards them clanking and wheezing horribly with the yellow foam piled about her but austin felt that he had never seen anything more welcome than that strip of miredaubed hull with the plume of smoke streaming away from it then she stopped close alongside them and austin shook hands with tom as he climbed on board  did you come across any niggers sir asked the latter  no said austin hows mr jefferson  comin round said tom with a grin ive worked most of the feveran the sunstrokeout of him it was a big load off me when as i took him his mixture one morning he looks up at me who the devil are you poisoning says he quite sensible an like himself again  you were coming down to look for us  we werean uncommonly glad to see you the blame niggers is getting aggravating came down two canoe loads of em a night or two ago an only sheered off when we tumbled one o them over with a big lump o coal walleye dropped it on to the man in the bow of her from the bridge an so far as we could make out it doubled him up considerable  walleye was apparently the squinting spaniard who acted as fireman and when he saw tom glance at him he stood up with a grimy hand clenched and unloosed a flood of castilian invective austin who smiled as he watched him felt that while most of what he said could not be effectively rendered into cold anglosaxon it was probably more or less warranted in the meanwhile the launch was coming round with backed propeller and in another moment or two she was clanking away into the darkness that descended suddenly towards the cumbria     chapter xii  nocturnal visitors   jefferson was standing at the open door of the house beneath the cumbrias bridge when austin first caught sight of him as he groped his way forward along the slanted deck the black impenetrable obscurity that descends upon the tropic swamps when the air is full of vapour hung over the stranded steamer and the mans gaunt figure cut with harsh sharpness against the stream of light the thin duck he wore clung about him soaked with perspiration and the allpervading damp emphasising the attenuated spareness of his frame and austin could almost have fancied it was a draped skeleton he was gazing at still he was a trifle reassured when he felt the firm grasp of a hot bony hand  so you have come said the american its good to get a grip of you i guessed you would  he drew austin into the deckhouse and they sat down opposite each other and said nothing for almost a minute though there was a little smile in jeffersons face as he leaned back against the bulkhead his hair which had grown long since he left las palmas hung low and wet upon his forehead and the big cheek bones showed through the tightstretched skin which was blanched though there was a faint yellow tinge in it which relieved its dead whiteness this had its significance for the coast fever has not infrequently an unpleasant after effect upon the white mans constitution  it isnt quite a sanatorium he said as though he guessed his comrades thoughts port royal santos panamai know them allarent a patch on these swamps still we neednt worry now you have come  austin smiled as he looked at him to be correct im not quite sure that i did he said reflectively i mean it wasnt exactly because i wished to  ah said jefferson as comprehension dawned on him then the quarter sharethat offer stands gooddidnt bring you well i was wondering if she would make you go  austin was a trifle astonished for though he had a somewhat hardly acquired acquaintance with human nature it had never occurred to him that the patronage jacinta extended to her masculine friends naturally attracted some attention or that in this particular case the onlookers might most clearly grasp the points of the game  i cant quite see why she should have wanted me to he said  there was another brief silence during which the men looked at one another this was not a subject either of them had meant to talk about indeed it was one which under different circumstances they would have kept carefully clear of but both realised that conventional niceties did not count for much just then they were merely men who had henceforth to face the grim realities of existence with the shadow of death upon them and they knew that the primitive humanity in them would become apparent as the veneer wore through  still said jefferson i can think of one reason there was a time when muriel was good to her and jacinta cant forget it shes not that kind the first day i met her i felt that she was taking stock of me and i knew id passed muster when she made you stop the estremedura perhaps it wasnt very much in itself but i was thankful ive done a few tough things in my time but i know id never have got muriel if that girl had been against me still it wasnt altogether because of muriel she sent you  austin showed his astonishment this time and jefferson smiled you cant quite figure how i came to understand a thing of that kind well some of you smart folks have made the same mistake before you dont seem to remember when you waste ten minutes working a traverse round what you could say in one that however you dress it up human natures much the same now youre astonished at me im talking sometimes i feel i have to you want to know just why she really sent you  to be frank i have asked myself the question and couldnt be quite sure it was altogether because she wanted me to get this unfortunate steamboat off  it wasnt youre getting as near to it as one could expect of an englishman it hurts some of you to let anybody know what you really think well ill try to make my notion clear to you there was a lady in france who threw her glove among the lions long ago but the man who went down for it was of no great account after all he hadnt sense enough to see the point of the thing  there were apparently folks who sympathised with him said austin with a reflective air im not sure the man could reasonably have been expected to go at all since the lady in question evidently only wished to show everybody how far he would venture to please her  now it seems to me quite likely that she meant to do a good deal more the man may have been content to fool his time away making pretty speeches to the court ladies and walking round dressed in silk while the rest of them rode out in steel cant you fancy that she wanted him to find out that he had the grit of the boldest of them and could do something worth while too she probably knew he had or she would never have sent him  a little colour crept into austins face but he laughed one could no doubt imagine a good many other reasons and most of them would probably be as wide of the mark any way they dont concern us if the thing ever happened it was a very long while ago we know better now  well i guess you cant help it and there was a twinkle in jeffersons eyes your shells quite a good fit and you dont like to come out of it though i almost thought you were going to a moment or two ago  i dont like to be pulled out one feels that it isnt decent the shells the best of some of us said austin  then well come down to business you brought the giant powder  a case of it with fuses and detonators and austins relief at the change of subject was evident are you contemplating blowing her up  no sir shes worth too much it is however quite likely that well make a hole in the mangrove forest and shake up the bottom of this creek that is when were ready theres a good deal to be put through first  have you found the gum  i havent looked shes full to the orlops and we havent started in to pump her out didnt seem much use in trying while she had so much weight in her and well want all the coal weve got when we have hove most of it and the oil out ill start the big centrifugal you see she hasnt a donkey on deck thats why though it cost me a good deal i bought the locomotive boiler you folks have a library of shipping acts but you dont show much sense when you let anything under 2000 tons go to sea with her pumps run from the main engines when you most want steam for pumping its when your fires are drowning out  it was once more evident to austin that jefferson knew his business and had foreseen most of the difficulties he would have to grapple with still he fancied by his face that he had not quite anticipated all  where are you putting the oil you take out of her he asked  on a strip of sand up a creek thats one of the few things that are worrying me well have to get it on board as soon as we float her off when the rain comes or the creek will get it ahead of us the next point is that it will be a little rough on the men who have to watch it after working all day long  to watch it who is likely to meddle with it here  niggers said jefferson drily they cleaned most everything they could come at off the boat before i got to her but they couldnt break out cargo with the water in her and didnt know enough to get at the provisions in the lazaret still while these particular swamps dont seem to belong to anybody theres trade everywhere and oils a marketable commodity  wheres the frenchman who chartered the cumbria  dead ive been up to his place in the launch i found it caved in and trees growing up in it already nature straightens things up quite smartly in this country any way ill show you round tomorrow and in the meanwhile its about time that spaniard brought you some supper  it seems to me that everybody who had anything to do with this unfortunate vessel invariably died  jefferson smiled a trifle grimly thats a fact he said  then one of the canarios brought in a simple meal and when they had eaten and talked for another hour austin stretched himself out on the settee and jefferson climbed into his slanted bunk they left the light burning and the door wide open and both of them lay down dressed as they were but while jefferson seemed to fall into a somewhat restless doze austin found that sleep fled the further from him the more he courted it that night it was very hot for one thing and stranded steamer and mangrove forest alike seemed filled with mysterious noises that stirred his imagination and disturbed his rest it was only by a strenuous effort he lay still for a couple of hours and then rising softly with a little sigh went out into the night  the darkness closed about him black and impenetrable when he stepped out of the stream of light before the deckhouse door and the feeble flame of the match he struck to light his pipe as he leaned upon the rail only made it more apparent he could see nothing whatever when the match went out but the oily gurgle of the creek beneath him suggested the height of the steamers hoveup side she lay so jefferson had told him with her inshore bilge deep in the mire and two big derrickbooms slung from the wire hawser that ran from her stern to the mangroves along what should have been the bank as a precaution against any nocturnal call by negroes in canoes her outshore side which he looked down from was he surmised by the slant of deck between ten and fifteen feet above the creek  it was a little cooler there and the sounds were less disquieting than they had been in the room he could localise and identify some of them nowthe splash of falling moisture the trickle of the stream and the soft fanning of unseen wings as one of the great bats which abound in that country stooped towards the light still behind these were mysterious splashings among the mangroves and wallowings in the creek while the thick hot darkness seemed to pulse with life he could almost fancy he heard the breathing of unseen things and it did not seem strange to him that the dusky inhabitants of that country should believe in malevolent deities indeed as he leaned upon the rail with its darkness enfolding him he was troubled by a sense of his own insignificance and a longing to escape from that abode of fear and shadow other men including those who had come out with a salvage expedition had found the floating of the cumbria too big a thing for them and he already understood that there are parts of the tropics where the white man is apt to find his courage melt away from him as well as his bodily vigour  then he commenced to wonder dispassionately why jacinta had sent him or if he had after all been warranted in considering that she had done so she had though he admitted it unwillingly at least not bidden him go but she had certainly done what she could to make him understand that he was wasting his life on board the estremedura it would have been a consolation to feel that he was obeying her command and doing her a definite service if it was only to bring jefferson home to muriel gascoyne but she had not laid one upon him and even jefferson seemed to understand that her purpose went further  he was less pleased with the fancy that jacinta had undertaken what she apparently considered his reformation he had been in some respects content as he was for while there was no other woman he had the same regard for he had forced himself to recognise that it was quite out of the question that she should ever entertain more than kindliness for him austin could be practical and remembered that young women with her advantages as a rule looked higher than a steamboat purser while even if jefferson succeeded in his venture and he went home with four or five thousand pounds which appeared just then distinctly unlikely jacinta was the only daughter of a man whose income was supposed to amount to as much a year  austin sighed a little as he decided that he did not really know why he had come in the meanwhile he was there and there was nothing to be gained by being sorry especially as he could not even console himself with the fancy that jacinta was grieving over him she was probably as usual far too busy by that time with somebody elses affairs he was also averse from permitting himself to feel any glow of selfcongratulation over the fancy that he was doing a chivalrous thing in fact he saw it with realistic clearness of vision as one that was wholly nonsensical and it did not occur to him that the essence of all that was best in the old knightly days might be surviving still and indeed live on indestructible even in the hearts of practical undemonstrative englishmen as well as garlicscented spaniards and seafaring americans still when he had yielded himself instinctively to jacintas will he had vaguely realised that after all the bonds of service are now and then more profitable to a man than dominion  in the meanwhile the damp soaked through his clothing and his physical nature shrank from the hot steaminess and the sour odours of putrefaction it was unpleasant to stand there in that thick darkness and even a little hard upon the nerves but he had had enough of the deckhouse and he could not sleep which is by no means an unusual difficulty with white men in the tropics it was a relief when at last a sound that grew louder fixed his attention and resolved itself into a measured thudding here were evidently canoes coming down the creek but austin was a little uncertain what to do he had no wish to rouse the wornout men who probably needed all the sleep they could get if this was a usual occurrence but it did not appear advisable that there should be nobody but himself on deck in case the canoes ran alongside he was considering what he should do when jefferson who held a glinting object in his hand appeared in the door of the deckhouse then there was a patter of feet on a ladder below and another dim figure materialised out of the darkness  that  funnelpaint come back again said the halfseen man  jefferson laughed unpleasantly hes getting monotonous but hes taking steep chances this time  the beat of paddles slackened a little there was a murmur of voices beneath the steamers side and jefferson leaned out looking down into the impenetrable blackness beneath him a scraping sound came out of it and apparently moved along while when the halfseen man thrust a big block of coal upon him austin turned and strode softly after jefferson who walked forward beside the rail  better let him have it now sir said the other man shes quite low on the other quarter and if they try swimming round her stern the booms wont stop them  then there was a vivid streak in the darkness and a detonation that was twice repeated while austin who hurled his lump of coal down with all his strength caught a whiff of acrid smoke there was also a splash below and a confused clamour that was lost in the hasty thud of paddles as the invisible canoes got away then while the canarios came floundering across the deck a single voice rose up  bimeby we done lib for cut you troat it said  oh go to the devil said jefferson and the big revolver flashed again  there was no answer and the splash of paddles slowly died away it was evident that the affair was over and austin fancied that nobody was much the worse jefferson sauntered towards him snapping the spent shells out of his pistol  funnelpaint is getting on my nerves ill have to drop half a stick of giant powder on him next time he comes he said  he didnt make much of a show said austin you think he meant to come on board  if there had been nobody round he would have done so but how far hed have gone then is another question he probably knows that nigger stockades are apt to get blown up when a white man disappears and its quite likely his nerve would have failed him any way hes hanging out at a village up the creek and well probably go round tomorrow with some giant powder and make a protest in the meanwhile i dont know any reason why you shouldnt go to sleep again  austin went back with him to the house beneath the bridge and though it was not perceptibly cooler found sleep come to him his vague apprehensions had vanished in the face of a definite peril     chapter xiii  toil   a faint light was creeping into the skippers room when austin awakened and seeing his comrades berth unoccupied went out on deck the swamps were wrapped in woolly vapour and a column of dingy smoke went up straight and unwavering from the funnel of the locomotive boiler the hot land breeze had died away and it would be some time yet before that from the sea set in in the meanwhile it was almost cool and very still so still in fact that austin was startled when a flock of parrots invisible in the mist swept past screaming overhead  then the sounds of mans activity suddenly commenced for there was a clatter forward where the spaniards flung the loose covers from the hatch and a harsh rattle of chain mingled with the soft patter of their naked feet in another few moments a sharp musical clinking broke out and austin saw tom who had served as a steamers donkeyman straighten his bent back when a rush of white vapour whirled with a strident hissing about the locomotive boiler which now drove the winch he grinned at austin and glanced at the misty creek far down which a faint screaming was dying away  those parrots must be  silly things he said what d they want to live here for when they can fly  austin who decided that there was some reason in the query strolled round the house and came upon jefferson sitting with his back to it and the box of dynamite on the deck in front of him he looked gaunter and more haggard than ever in the daylight but he was busy pinching down a copper cap upon a strip of snaky fuse which he proceeded to carefully embed in a roll of semiplastic material that looked very like a candle made of yellow wax  what are you doing asked austin  nipping on a couple of detonators said jefferson stand clear of the one on the deck theyre lined with mercury fulminate and you want to take your shoes off when you come near that giant powders innocent by comparison i mean to try a stick or two of this consignment  what are you going to try it on asked austin who stepped back a pace or two expeditiously  jefferson looked up with a little grim smile on the house of the headman of the village where funnelpaint lives he said if we can get in a good mornings work well go up and remonstrate with him this afternoon you might take that stick of powder and fuse and wrap it up in something  austin picked up the yellow roll and then held it as far as he conveniently could from him while jefferson laughed  i guess you neednt worry you could pound it with a hammer or put it in the fire and it wouldnt show fightthat is ninetynine times out of the hundred he said still there might be considerable trouble on the other one the sure way to stir it up is to pat a shred of it with a piece of wood though the man who tries it is scarcely likely to see what it does  austin got rid of the dynamite as speedily as he could and when he came back one of the spaniards was laying out breakfast on the deck it was not a sumptuous meal consisting as it did of coffee a can of meat that austin fancied was tainted ships bread which is biscuit and a pale fluid that had presumably been butter but he did not feel hungry and jefferson ate little in the meanwhile a blaze of light beat through the mists which melted under it and flaming yellow creek and dingy mangroves sprang suddenly into being as by the unrolling of a transformation scene their pale stems dripped slime and just there their foliage was blotched and spotted as with smears of flour it gave them a diseased appearance and austin who felt he loathed the sight of them already remembered that where the mangrove grows the white man not infrequently dies he was almost glad when breakfast was over and jefferson rose  i want to be quite clear he said youre going to see this thing out with me on a quarter share  i am said austin anyway ill do what i can though im afraid i havent given the question of the share much consideration  jefferson looked at him intently well he said ive worried a good deal about my threequarters thats what i came for and if we float her off youll get yours just as sure as youll earn ithard its a big thing youre going into and youll find it calling on all the grit thats in you were on results here and now you understand that well start in  he went to the forward winch and austin obeying his directions descended to the hold with a vague recognition of the fact that there was a change in jefferson as coaling clerk in grand canary austin had found him a quiet and somewhat reserved man who conducted himself in everything at least as conventionally as most of his english friends in that island now it was as though he had sloughed off the veneer so that the primitive man beneath it appeared which is a thing that not infrequently happens in such places as the swamps he was toiling in his voice even was different it was harsh with a suggestion of command and the fierce resolute nature of the man became revealed in it and the penetrating glance of his steady eyes  austin however discovered that he had very little time to think of jefferson the spaniards were on results too and when the chain sling came rattling down the strenuous toil began the hold was dim and shadowy as well as insufferably hot and filled with nauseating smells the tiers of barrels slanted so that one could scarcely stand on them but when somebody gave austin a handspike he took his place with the rest and set about prizing loose the puncheons so that they could get a sling round them or the hoistingcrabs on the staveends now and then the crabs slipped or tore through the oilsoaked wood when the great barrel swung up into the sunlight and it came crashing down while each time they made an opening the rest slipped down grinding upon each other and squeezed it up again those on the lower side were waterborne but the others were only held in place by those beneath them on the incline and the men could not keep the untouched tiers intact as they would have done had the cumbria been floating level  for the first half hour austin who had never undertaken manual toil before felt that his task was beyond the strength of such a man as he one can no more acquire facility in labour without some training than he can in an art or craft and again and again his untaught muscles failed to obey the prompting of his will then the heavy puncheon generally rolled back and bruised him or the slipping handspike left its mark upon his skin it was probably fortunate that the canarios were cheerful defthanded sailormen courteous too and considerate in their own fashion for that half hour was in some respects a bitter one during it the man of taste and leisure had his comparative uselessness impressed upon him for while he gasped and the dew of effort dripped from him it was not alone the slackness of his soft muscles that became apparent but his inferiority in quickness and the intrepidity which on occasion risks crushed foot and hand or a broken limb the men who surpassed him were also benighted aliens but he remembered afterwards that there was not one among them who flung a jibe at him  then it became a trifle easier his nerves steadied and the fits of gasping became less frequent as he warmed to the work it was as jefferson had mentioned a big thing they had undertaken a thing worth doing even apart from what they might gain by it and it occurred to him that somebody must toil brutally before anything of that kind in brought to its accomplishment by and by the strain and stress of it the swift flitting of halfnaked figures the upward lurch of the dripping puncheons and the clanging of the winch commenced to fire his blood there was after all a good deal of the primitive in him and he had the capacity for finding delight in bodily toil which still lurks here and there in a cultured englishman and presently he flung his oilstained jacket away then in a momentary pause his shirt was discarded too and he knotted his suspenders about his waist when he fell in between the grinding puncheons one of them removed most of the light singlet from him and he clambered out with a berserker fit upon him he had found his manhood and vaguely recognised that the curse laid on man in eden might be a privilege something had awakened in him he had not felt before though he had run the estremeduras lancha through the spouting surf and had never been accounted a laggard in the strenuous english games  the chain slings came down faster and faster while the hammerings of the winch rang insistently through their rattle at any cost to the men below it must not be kept waiting the blaze of brightness beneath the hatch became dazzling and austin felt his shoulders scorched as he passed through it the iron deck above them shed down an intolerable heat and still the olivefaced canarios swayed and splashed and heaved amidst the barrels now and then a man said carrai or in incongruous juxtaposition ave maria ejaculating it in gasps but there was a puncheon ready when the sling came clashing down and jeffersons voice rang encouragingly through the din  oh hump yourselves send her up he said vamos adelante dern your skins more bareel  bill grinned at austin in one momentary stoppage the boss is himself again he said hes shoving her along weve got to make the time for our little trip this afternoon oh howlingis that how you slew a puncheon youll manslaughter one of us next time cut her as she rolls  austin gasped with astonishment as well as relief when the winch stopped at last the first half hour had appeared interminable the other hours had fled for he saw by the distance the glare of light had moved across the hold that the sun was overhead then he essayed to straighten himself and when he had with some difficulty accomplished it went up the ladder with the rest when he went out on deck jefferson was sitting upon the drum of the winch and smiled curiously as he scrutinised him austin whose torn singlet fell away from him clitted with yellow oil was almost naked to the waist as well as very wet from the knees downwards one of his canvas shoes had burst and his hands were bleeding he stood still dazzled by the change of light and blinked at his comrade  well said jefferson reflectively i have seen men who looked smarter but i guess youll do in fact im beginning to feel sure of you  thanks said austin i suppose in one respect thats a compliment still i almost think or at least i did when i first went down there that if id known what was in front of me id have stayed in grand canary  jefferson nodded with a curious little smile i wonder he said reflectively if you ever felt like that before  austin considered a moment  im not going to make any admissions you probably have he said  quite often and jefferson laughed its a thing that happens to most of us now and then there are times when the contract looks very big and the man feels very small in fact its sometimes hard to look straight at it and not back down still in the case of this one it has to be done  i suppose so said austin and then turned round well what is it bill  heres your shirt an jacket said the man if you dont want your skin to come off youd better put them on  austin who thanked him did so and then fumbled in the pocket for a cigarette the one he found was torn and crushed but he contrived to light it and flung himself down in the shadow of the rail jefferson who watched him grinned  youre getting your grip he said not long ago youd have slung that thing into the creek the man left the sir out too perhaps you noticed it  i did still no doubt after watching my efforts in the hold he felt himself warranted i didnt expect to find things quite the same here as they are at the catalina  jefferson laughed softly theyre not this is a blame risky cooperative venture and when i made it so i put down a big stake on human nature were all on results and partners in the thing theres no respect in this ship i dont want it why should any man touch his hat to me oh i know we use the fist and handspike on american shipswhen its necessaryand i skipped round the sachems deckhouse once with the cold steel an inch or two behind me but thats not the point at all i want a hundred cents worth for my dollar from every man and im going to get it but im boss because i can drive a winch and break out cargo better than any of the rest of them at least thats one big reason  austin would have grinned at this not very long ago jefferson expressed himself crudely but austin was disposed to be less critical after that mornings labour and was commencing to realise that his comrade had in fact placed a heavy stake upon the reliability of seafaring humanity a taint of suspicious distrust or petty treachery would he felt be sufficient to ruin the venture for there was one pistol in the ship to enforce authority and a dozen men who might defy it with wicked knives it was also evident that the full dollars worth would be demanded from every one of them still austin smiled  i scarcely think thats the american skippers usual point of view though of course its a commendable one he said after all one has to admit that there is perhaps some foundation for the equality notion in a democratic country but from what i know of yours while you seem willing to act upon it in regard to scandinavians teutons poles and englishmen you make indians and niggers an exception  exactly they were made different and they stop outside i was crowding her a little this morning to save time because i mean to remonstrate with one of them this afternoon this ships mine i bought her with good money and there may be a balance out thats to be settled with blood as well am i to sit down while the black scum take her from me  i really think that the longer one looks at this contract the bigger it gets said austin reflectively  jefferson glanced at the dingy forest flaming creek and the cumbrias slanted deck with a little glow in his eyes  well he said thats what gets hold of me to worry a big contract through islifeto some kinds of men  perhaps it is but it was easier painting little pictures still you see when you marry miss gascoyne youll have to go round with your shirt and perhaps a frock coat on and let up on this kind of thing in fact what you are doing isnt at all what the folks she is acquainted with would expect from a man with Â£20000 in england  jefferson laughed though there was a certain grimness in his face well he said there is a good deal to be done everywhere and different ways of playing the game a frock coat wouldnt stop a man making a show at one of them although at first he mightnt find it comfortable lifes much the same thing everywhere when you mean to take part in it and hustle any way ive talked enough and walleyes coming along with the comida  they ate the meal in silence austin was glad to rest and sitting drowsily content in the shadow he began to realise the boundless optimism and something of the adaptability of his companion jefferson had made an excellent coaling clerk at las palmas though he knew nothing about the business which demands a good deal of discretion when he came there he had also passed muster with mrs hatherly and muriel gascoyne as what they no doubt called a gentleman which was a manifestly harder thing and here in africa he was a ragged and feverworn leader of primitive men but clearly a successful one it seemed to austin that if he eventually aspired to become a local influence in any part of sheltered england he would also in all probability show up equally well     chapter xiv  jeffersons remonstrance   they were not long over the meal and when austin thrust his plate aside jefferson who had waited at least five minutes for him rose with a little twinkle which seemed to express whimsical resignation in his eyes  and now theres something id rather leave alone to be done he said the launch is ready and well go up and remonstrate with those niggers its a little rough upon a man who is fond of a quiet life  one would scarcely have fancied that quietness had any great attraction for you said austin still you probably know what pleases you better than i do  jefferson laughed there are folks who seem to like being kicked but its a sensation that doesnt appeal to everybody  you have a case of dynamite too now i had once an airgun sent me a good many years ago and i remember how i burned to go out and destroy the neighbours cats with it  the americans face grew a trifle grim and he looked at him with halfclosed eyes well he said i suppose that feelings there but in a sense youre wrong it isnt the only one we put up a big bluff in coming here at all and its nerve and nothing else that will have to keep us where we are there are no police or patrolmen in this country to fall back upon and you have to face the cold truth which is this if one of those niggers clinched with you or me he would mop the deck with us in about two minutes its not a nice thing to admit but there it is  austin looked thoughtful as indeed he was for jefferson who it seemed could look an unpleasant fact in the face had gone straight to the bottom of the question as he usually did the white mans domination it had to be admitted largely depended upon his command of machine guns and magazine rifles but they had none of these on board the cumbria they were no match for the negro as a muscular animal and there was only left them what jefferson called bluff which apparently consisted of equal parts of hardihood and arrogance still there are respects in which it is difficult to distinguish between it and genuine courage and it was certainly apt to prove futile in that land without the latter austin realised that since there was nothing else available they must do what they could with it though this was far from pleasing him he had a dislike for anything which savoured of assertive impudence  they went up the creek in the little clanking launch eight limp and perspiring white men with knives and iron bars under a scorching sun that burned through their oilstained garments they slid through strips of shadow where the belts of mire they skirted bubbled with the emanations the heat sucked up from them and slid across lakelike reaches where the yellow water was dazzling to look upon all the time endless ranks of mangroves crawled past them and there was no sound but the presumptuous clanking of the engine to break the deep silence of the watery forest the whole land seemed comatose with heat and all that had its being in it probably was so for it is at night that nature awakens in the swamps of the fever belt man alone was stirring and the puny noise of his activity jarred for a few moments on the great stillness and then sank into it again  austin sat huddled in the launchs sternsheets with his senses dulled by the heat and glare though the desolation of mire and mangroves reacted on him he knew as he sometimes admitted a little about a good many things which were of no use to him and he remembered then that the vast quadrilateral of northern africa west of egypt had absorbed several civilisations long before the portuguese saw its southern shores they had vanished and left no mark on it and it was plain that in the great swamp belt at least the black man still lived very much as he had done when the first mangroves crept out into the sea it is a primitive country where man knows only the law of the jungle and jefferson who grasped that fact was apparently ready to act upon it in the usual primitive fashion  there was at first no sign of life when the launch came into sight of a little village hemmed in by the swamps it had its attractiveness in that country for the clustering huts stood half buried in foliage beneath towering cottonwoods with a glaring strip of sand in front of them there were bananas and as jefferson recognised lime trees in between still by the time they approached the beach men came floundering hastily out of the huts and austin was not greatly consoled by the sight of them they were big men and wore very little to conceal their splendid muscles some of them also carried long canoe paddles and one or two had wicked corkscrewheaded spears austin wondered a little uneasily whether they only speared fish with them and looked round to see what effect their appearance had upon his companions  it was apparently not a great one jefferson was quietly grim tom the donkeyman scornfully cheerful while there was a little portentous glint in the canarios eyes austin fancied he was the only one who had the slightest doubt that anything their leader did would not be altogether warranted this however was comprehensible for he was aware that while the americans attitude towards the coloured people is perhaps not altogether what it should be the western pioneer never quite equalled the iberian in his plan of subjugation the spaniard at least did not send out indian agents or dole out rations of very inferior beef  they landed without molestation and straightened themselves to make what show they could though there was nothing very imposing about any of the party the climate had melted the stiffness out of them and their garments which were stained with oil and rent by working cargo clung about their limbs soaked with perspiration they looked austin fancied more like shipwrecked seamen than anything else in fact he felt almost ashamed of himself and that it was the negroes own fault if they did not unceremoniously fling them back into the creek still he realised that they were men who probably held their lives in their hands and had what appeared to be a singularly difficult task in front of them they were there to make it clear to the headman that it would be wise of him to leave them alone and austin was quite willing to supplement jeffersons efforts in this though he was by no means sure how it was to be accomplished the negroes so far as he could see were regarding them with a kind of derisive toleration  in the meanwhile they were moving forward between patches of bananas and under a few glossy limes while groups of dusky men kept pace with them behind until they reached a broad strip of sand with a big cottonwood tree in the midst of it there was a hut of rammed soil that appeared more pretentious than the rest in front of them and a man stood waiting in the door of it jefferson stopped in the shadow when he saw him  im going to sit down where its cool he said any way if that is their headman id sooner he came out to us  he sat down with his back to the tree while the rest clustered round him a lean dominant figure in spite of his haggard face and the state of his attire and it seemed to austin that there was a suggestion of arrogant forcefulness in his attitude the headman stood quietly in his doorway looking at him while the negroes drew in a little closer they now seemed uncertain what to make of these audacious strangers and waited glancing towards their leader though there were austin fancied forty or fifty of them  is there anybody here who speaks english asked jefferson  it appeared that there was for all along that coast there is a constant demand for labour in the white mens factories and a man who wore a piece of cloth hung from his shoulder instead of the waistrag stood forward at a sign from the headman the latter had little cunning eyes set in a heavy fleshy face and he too wore a piece of cloth a sheet of white cotton which flowed about his tublike body in graceful lines negroes like other people fatten when they seize authority and live in idleness upon the result of others toil for even the swamp belt heathen who asks very little from life must now and then work or starve there are no charitable institutions to fall back upon in that country where the indigent is apt to be belaboured by his neighbours paddles  then the headman who did not leave his hut conferred with the interpreter until the latter turned to jefferson whom he had it seemed already pitched upon as leader  them headman he done saywhat the debbil you lib for here for he announced  we have come for funnelpaint said jefferson  it was evident that the negro did not understand whom he meant but when jefferson assisted by the donkeyman supplied him with a very unflattering description of the delinquent comprehension seemed to dawn on him and he once more conferred with his master  him no one of we boy he said him dam bad teamboat bushman sah lib for here two three day now lib for go away  austin who understood that the term bushman was not used in a complimentary sense in those swamps smiled as he noticed that seafaring men were evidently also regarded there with no great favour and glanced at jefferson inquiringly  hes probably lying said the latter ive trailed funnelpaint here and theres nowhere else he could live ive been round to see any way he had a crowd of this rascals boys with him when he came down to worry me well let him have that to figure on  it cost him some trouble to make his meaning clear to the negro while when the latter in turn explained it to the headman austin noticed a retrograde movement among several of those about them they seemed desirous of getting a little further away from the domineering white man  i want those boys said jefferson indicating the negroes who had edged away then i want some gum or ivory or anything of that kind your headman has as a token hell send me down funnelpaint as soon as he can catch him he hasnt caught on to half of it help me out austin  austin did what he could and at last it became evident that the interpreter grasped their meaning this time there was however a change in the attitude of the negro which had hitherto appeared to be a trifle conciliatory  none of my boys have been near your steamer go away before we drive you out was at least the gist of what he said  jefferson made a little contemptuous gesture and pointed to one of the negroes tell him i want those boys and it would be wise of him to turn them up before the shadow crawls up to where that man is if he doesnt ill let a duppy juju or whatever he calls his fetish devils loose on him he has about fifteen minutes to think the thing over in  even with the help of the donkeyman they were some time in making this comprehensible and austin glanced at his comrade when the headmans answer came it was a curt and uncompromising non possumus and jefferson sighed  of course he said i saw it would come to this from the beginning and in one way im not sorry i dont know what id have done with funnelpaint or his friends if i had got them except that somehow id most have scared them out of their lives still it seemed only decent to give the headman a chance for himself now it will suit us considerably better to scare him and the others all together ill wipe that house of his out of existence inside twenty minutes  austin glanced at the house it was larger than the others and comparatively well built and he fancied probably of as much value to its owner as a white mans mansion would be to him this was clearly not a time to be supersensitive but he felt a trace of compunction  i dont know that id go quite so far myself he said after all were not sure that the headman is responsible  then said jefferson drily well make him and you listen to me we may have to do quite a few things that arent pretty and we have no use for sentimentality were just a handful of white men with everything to grapple with and well be left alone to do it while these devils are afraid of us and not a moment longer the fever may wipe half of us out at any time and we have got to make our protest now  its the giantpowder im sticking at no doubt its a little absurd of mebut i dont like it  jefferson laughed a trifle scornfully theres a good deal of what we call buncome in most of you you dont like things that dontlookpretty pistols among them well am i to be trampled on whenever it happens that the other man is bigger than i  the law is supposed to obviate that difficulty in a civilised community  the man who gets the verdict is usually the one with the biggest political pull or the most money in the one i belong to but thats not quite the point just now if you have a notion that the games all in our hands look at them yonder  austin did so and decided that after all jefferson might be right the negroes had clustered together and there were more of them now while all of them had spears or big canoe paddles it was tolerably evident that any sign of vacillation would bring them down upon the handful of white men whose prestige alone had hitherto secured them from molestation if they failed to maintain it and had to depend upon their physical prowess the result appeared as certain as it would be unpleasant the affair had resolved itself into a case of what jefferson termed bluff a test of coolness and nerve and austin glanced a trifle anxiously at the spaniards they were he fancied a little uneasy but it was clear that they had confidence in their leader and they sat still though he could see one or two of them fingering the wicked canary knives their courage was however not of the kind that stands the tension of uncertainty well and he commenced to long that the shadow would reach the trampled spot where the man jefferson pointed to had stood  in the meanwhile it was creeping slowly across the hot white sand and he felt his heart beat as he watched it and the negroes who commenced to murmur and move uneasily the white mans immobility had its effect on them and it seemed that jefferson had done wisely in confiding in the latters ability to bear the longer strain still austin was not sure that the impatience of the spaniards might not spoil everything after all as regarded himself he began to feel a curious and almost dispassionate interest in the affair which almost prevented him considering his personal part in it he also noticed the intensity of the sunlight and the blueness of the shadows among the trees as well as the mirrorlike flashing of the creek it was he fancied the artistic temperament asserting itself then he felt a little quiver run through him when jefferson stood up  we have to get it done he said keep those canarios close behind me  they moved forward in a little phalanx carrying staves and iron bars though austin knew that a word would bring out the twinkling steel and somewhat to his astonishment the negroes fell back before them and as they approached it the headman scuttled out of his house jefferson stopped outside it and taking a stick of yellow substance from his pocket inserted it in a cranny he raked out in the wall then he lighted the strip of fuse and touched austins shoulder  get those fellows back to the creek but theyre not to run he said the action of one stick of giantpowder is usually tolerably local but i dont want any of the niggers hoisted either wheres that interpreter steady well bring them down on us like a swarm of bees if they see us lighting out before they understand the thing  there was austin fancied not much time to waste but he managed to impress the fact upon the canarios that their haste must not be too evident and to make the negro understand that it was perilous to approach the house then he overtook the spaniards and they moved back in a body towards the launch and stopped close by the beach the negroes also stood still and all alike watched the little sputtering trail of smoke creep up the side of the house it showed blue in the sunlight though there was a pale sparkling in the midst of it  then a streak of light sprang out suddenly and expanded into a blaze of radiance after it came the detonation and a rolling cloud of thin vapour out of which there hurtled powdered soil and blocks of hardrammed mud the vapour thinned and melted and austin saw that there was no longer any front to the headmans house while as he watched it most of the rest fell in he looked round to see what effect it had on the negroes but could not make out one of them they had it seemed gone silently and in haste then he heard jefferson sigh as with relief  well he said thats one thing done and im glad we have come out of it with a whole skin well light out before somebody shows them that were only human and spoils the thing  they went on board the launch but austin felt curiously limp as she clanked away down stream the strain of the last half hour had told on him though he had not felt it to the full at the time it was two hours steaming before they swept past the cumbria and a man on her forecastle waved an arm to indicate that all was right on board her but austin would not have had the time any shorter he felt it was just as well that village lay some distance from them they went on to the strip of sand where jefferson had stored the coal and oil and when they reached it he stood up suddenly with an imprecation  four puncheons gone funnelpaint has come out ahead of me after all he said well theres no use in worrying now when he has got away with them but im going to stop down here tonight in case he comes back again  then he swung the launch round with backed propeller and in another few minutes they were steaming back up stream towards the cumbria a tent of some kind must be extemporised for it is not wise of a white man to spend the night unprotected in the fever swamps     chapter xv  starting the pump   the bush was dim with steamy shade when austin and jefferson plodded along a little path behind the beach where the oil was stored it was with difficulty they made their way for the soil was firmer there and a dense undergrowth sprang up among the big cottonwoods which replaced the mangroves they were draped with creepers and here and there an orchid flung its fantastic blossoms about a rotting limb while the path twisted in and out among them and through tangled thickets it was then the hottest part of the afternoon and save for the soft fall of the mens footsteps everything was still the atmosphere was very like that of a turkish bath and as austin stumbled along the perspiration dripped from him  he had toiled strenuously from early dawn until darkness closed down of late and though he had as yet escaped the fever every joint in his body ached and he was limp and dejected with the heat and weariness his only respite from labour had been the few hours spent on watch beside the landed oil when his turn came and he had now come down with two of the spaniards to relieve jefferson who was going back to the cumbria the latter glanced towards a ray of brightness that beat into the dim green shadow and here and there flung a patch of brilliancy athwart the great columnar trunks  ive been wondering where this trail goes and it seems to me theres an opening close in front of us he said well rest when we get there and i dont know that ill be sorry you have to choose between stewing and roasting in this country and when it lets my skin stay on me i almost think the latters easier  austin felt inclined to agree with him for they had blundered through the shadowy bush for half an hour and its hot saturated atmosphere made exertion almost impossible still he said nothing and in a few more minutes they came out upon a glaring strip of sand beside another creek jefferson stopped a moment with a little gesture of astonishment in the shadow of a palm  what in the name of wonder have they been turning that sand over for he said  austin walked out of the shadow blinking in the dazzling brightness the creek flung back and saw that the sand had certainly been disturbed every here and there it seemed to him that somebody had been digging holes in it and then had carefully filled them up  there isnt a nigger village nearer than the one where funnelpaint lives or i could have fancied theyd had an epidemic and been burying their friends he said  jefferson shook his head they wouldnt worry to bring them here he said still somebody has been digging since the last wet season for it seems to me that when the rain comes the creek flows over here  it occurred to austin that one or two at least of the excavations had been filled in not long ago but his comrade made no comment when he suggested it and they went back together to the shadow of the palm where jefferson sitting down thoughtfully filled a blackened pipe  it was several minutes before he broke the silence  there is he said at length a good deal i cant get the hang of about the whole affair but if i knew just how they came to start the plates that let the water in id have something to figure on you cant very well knock holes in an iron steamers bottom on soft slimy mud and i dont know where they could have found a rock here if they wanted to  ah said austin then you think they might have wanted to find one  jefferson again sat silent for almost a minute and then slowly shook his head i dont knowive nothing to go upon he said shes not even an old playedout boat still it seems to me that a heavily freighted steamer hung up by her nose on the bank might easily have started some of her plates when the waters of the creek subsided then shed settle deeperits nice soft mud  but that would beaftershe went ashore  yes said jefferson dryly thats the point of it  austin looked thoughtful it had also occurred to him that there was a good deal it was difficult to understand about the stranding of the cumbria though that after all did not appear to concern them greatly just then  what puzzles me is why the salvage men let go he said you see theyre accustomed to this kind of thing and have money behind them  jefferson looked at him with a little smile and austin saw that he guessed his thoughts jefferson was as gaunt as ever a feverworn skeleton of a man dressed for the most part in oilstained rags while austin was quite aware that so far as outward appearances went there was very little that was prepossessing about himself his big felt hat hung over his forehead sodden with grease and shapeless his hands were hard and scarred his nails were broken and the rent singlet hung open almost to his waist all this seemed to emphasise their feebleness and the fact that there was no money behind them at least  well said jefferson thats quite easy those salvage men are specialists and expect a good deal for the time they put in now they took some oil out of her but there is reason for believing they were not sure theyd get the cumbria off at all and it would cost a good deal to charter a lightdraught steamer to come up here they tried towing it down to a schooner and lost a good deal of it on the shoals then they towed the schooner in and had to wait for a smooth surf before they could get her out with no more than sixty tons at that the game wasnt worth while and the men were going down with fever  but the gum  there wasnt a great deal down in the cargo sheets and any way until theyd hove the oil out they couldnt come at it  you are still sure about the gum yourself  jefferson laughed softly i think i am i dont quite know where it is but the skipper got ita good deal of it  still the steamer would be worth a persistent effort there was no doubt about her being there  no said jefferson with a little gesture of comprehension now i know just what you mean youre wondering since those men couldnt heave her off whats the use of us trying well specialists make their mistakes now and then just like other men and they took it for granted that things were normal when they were there from what ive seen of the sand strips and the marks on the mangrove trunks i dont think they were you see theres a good deal we dont know about the tides yet and the guinea stream doesnt always run quite the same along this coast while when theres less than usual of the southwest winds that help it along its quite likely to mean two or three feet less water in these creeks then you can have a wet season thats a little drier than the other ones and its fresh water herethe tide just backs it up  then youre counting on the present season being a normal one  yes said jefferson quietly ive staked all i have on itand a good deal more than that if it isnt i might as well have pitched my forty thousand dollars into the sea  he stopped a moment and then laid a little grey object in austins palm what dyou make of that  austin started as he looked at it a pistol bullet  exactly said jefferson it has been through the barrel too you can see the score of the rifling i picked it up along the trail but i dont know how long it lay there or who fired it still the niggers dont carry pistols well its about time i was getting back on board if were to start the pump tonight  austin glanced at him sharply and noticed that there was a suggestion of tension in his voice though his face was quiet it was evident that a good deal would depend upon the result of the first few hours pumping for unless it lowered the water there would be little probability of their floating the steamer neither of them however said anything further and when they went back to the beach where the oil was jefferson steamed away in the launch and austin who was left with two canarios lay down in the shadow of a strip of tarpaulin the spaniards tired with their mornings labour went to sleep and austin who filled his pipe several times found the hours pass very slowly there was nothing to hold his attentiononly glaring sand dingy dim green mangroves and tiers of puncheons with patches of whitewash clinging to them it flung back an intolerable brightness that hurt his aching eyes and he became sensible of a feverish impatience as he lay watching the shadows lengthen  his thoughts were with jefferson who was no doubt now getting steam on the locomotive boiler and coupling up the big pump unless the latter did what they expected of it the toil they had undergone and jeffersons eight thousand pounds would have been thrown away that was very evident but austin wondered a little at himself as his impatience grew upon him until it was only by an effort he held himself still  it was not the quarter share jefferson offered him which had brought him there for he realised that even with five thousand pounds he would still be to all intents and purposes a poor man and his life on board the estremedura had in most respects been one that suited him he had in fact not greatly cared whether the cumbria could be floated or not when he came out but since then jeffersons optimism or something that was born of the toil they had undertaken had laid hold of him and now he was almost as anxious as his comrade that their efforts should result in success in fact he was feverishly anxious and felt that if it would gain them anything he would willingly stake his life on the venture then he smiled as he remembered that he had without quite realising it done so already  still the long hot afternoon dragged away and when the sun dipped and black darkness closed down upon the creek the launch came clanking up to the beach she brought two canarios as well as bill the fireman and austins voice was eager as he greeted the latter  have you got the pump going yet he asked  no said bill tom and mr jefferson was packing something when i came away hed given her a spin and found the engine blowing at a gland  austin asked him nothing further but drove the launch at top speed through the blackness that shrouded the misty creek and walked straight to where jefferson was standing when he reached the cumbria the red glow from the open firedoor of the locomotive boiler fell upon him and there were signs of tension in his face while the red trickle from a hand he had apparently injured smeared his torn jacket steam was roaring from a valve beside him and austin could scarcely hear him when he turned to the donkeyman  shut the firedoor shell go now he said ill let her shake down for a minute or two and then well give her everything  he walked forward towards where the light of a lamp fell upon the casing of the pump which looked like a huge iron drum considerably flattened in then he touched a valve and the machine became animate with a low pulsatory wheezing while something commenced to hum and rattle inside it the sound swelled into a fierce rhythmic whirring the great iron case vibrated and austin could feel the rails he leaned on tremble jefferson turned and looked at him with a little smile while he laid a hand as it were affectionately upon the pump  yes he said ive made her go and shes going to earn me eighty thousand dollars shes drawing air just now heave your hat down and see if shell take it along  austin who became sensible that a little draught was shaking his duck trousers did as jefferson suggested and the big felt hat rolled and flopped in a ludicrous fashion along the deck then it seemed to spring forward into the blackness and groping after it he found it glued to the iron grid which was screwed to the end of a big pipe it was with some little difficulty he tore it loose then he saw jefferson swing up one hand  easy while shes getting her first drink then if shes spouting full you can let her hum he said and turned to austin now come down with me  they went down together into the musty hold and when somebody lowered the big hose after them jefferson standing upon the ladder seized the rope and looked up at the canarios clustering round the hatch above  wheres that rake you made he said  it was handed him and austin glanced down at the water which glistened oilily under the light of a suspended lamp it was thick with floating grease and strewn with fragments of rotten bags  get hold and keep her clear said jefferson who thrust the rake upon him and then waited a moment before he lowered the hose while austin glancing round a moment could see the faces of the men above them they were intent and almost as expectant as his comrades  then the big pipe sank with a soft splash and shook out its loose halfcoil as if alive while it swelled it grew hard and rigid and the dim oily water swirled and seethed about the end of it in another moment there was a rush of floating objects towards it from the shadows strips of bagging handspikes clots of oil and dunnage wood came thicker and thicker and jefferson raised his voice  let her hum he said  the pipe palpitated as it further straightened itself and now a hole opened in the oily water and halfseen things came up with a rush from the depths of the flooded hold hundreds of little black kernels whirled and sank in the swing of the eddy which grew wider as a deep resonant hum descended from the deck above it seemed to austin that everything in the hold was coming to the top but as he watched the bewildering succession of odds and ends that spun amidst the froth jeffersons voice rose harshly  its water shes wanting keep her clear he said  austin contrived to do it for a while though now and then the whirling rush of bags and wood almost tore the rake away from him he was kept busy for half an hour while jefferson stood leaning out from the ladder and steadily watching the water then the american swung himself down with his knife in his hand and scratched the iron at its level  well know in another hour or two whether were pumping out the cumbria or pumping in the creek he said if its the latter ive got to let up on the contract i cant undertake to dry out this part of africa  then he signed to one of the canarios come down ven aca savvy and take this rake  they went up together but as they passed along the deck jefferson stopped once more to lay his hand upon the pump it was running with a dull rumbling roar and the deck trembled about it  shes doing good work he said now well have comida i darent go back there for another hour  they went into the deckhouse where the spaniard who acted as steward was waiting them but in passing jefferson made a sign to tom who stood in the glow from the firedoor with a shovel in his hand  all shes worth he said  they ate as a matter of duty and because they needed all the strength the climate had left them but neither had much appetite and austin knew that jefferson was listening as eagerly as he was himself to the deep vibrating hum that came throbbing through the open door it was a relief to both of them to hear the persistent jingling of a cup that stood unevenly in its saucer the pump was running well but there remained the momentous question was it lowering the water and when the meal was over austin glanced at jefferson as he pushed his plate aside  shall i go down and look he asked  no said jefferson hoarsely any way if you do dont come back and worry me shes full up fore and after holds and engine roomand there are things i dont stand very well well give her two hours and then if shes doing anything worth while the scratch i made will be dry  austin nodded sympathetically under the circumstances he said two hours is a long while  jefferson smiled a curious wry smile its hardthe toughest thing one can dojust to keep still but if i climbed up and down that ladder for two hours id probably break out and heave somebody into the creek there are things you have to get over once for alland do it quick  i suppose there are said austin still its the first time ive made the acquaintance of any of them and i shouldnt have fancied one could get a thrill of this kind out of a centrifugal pump there is however of course a good deal at stake  eighty thousand dollars said jefferson and all the rest of my life you dont usually get such chances as the cumbria is giving us twice  austin found that he at least could not keep still however he tried and he went out and paced up and down the slanted deck where he fell over things though he now and then endeavored to talk rationally to tom the donkeyman he did not find the attempt a success but he saw that he was not the only one who felt the tension for the canarios in place of resting were clustered round the hatch and apparently staring down the opening jefferson was still in the deckhouse each time he passed a gaunt grimfaced object with a lean hand clenched on an unlighted pipe and at last austin sat down on the deck beside the pump he liked to feel the throb of it but he remembered the half hour he spent there a long while afterwards  then jefferson came out of the deckhouse walking slowly though austin fancied it cost him an effort and they climbed down the ladder together the man with the rake stood on the opposite one across the hatch and austin felt his heart beat painfully as he raised the lantern he held and jefferson stooped down he straightened himself slowly though the blood was in his face  dry he said hoarsely shes lowering it its a sure thing austin if the fever doesnt get us well see this contract out  then he turned and they went up and back to the deckhouse while an exultant clamour broke out from the canarios but jeffersons lean hand quivered a little when he laid it on the table as he sat down  if she has started any plates theyre not started much he said now talk about anything you like so long as it isnt the cumbria ive got to slacken down tonight     chapter xvi  elusive gum   it was in the small hours when austin wakened and listening a moment stretched his aching limbs with a little sigh of content the odds and ends on the table beside him were rattling merrily and a deep pulsatory humming rang stridently through the silence of the swamps the pump was running well for he could hear the steady splash of water falling into the creek and once more a little thrill of exultation ran through him he was not in most respects a fanciful man for in him the artistic temperament was held in due subjection by a knowledge of the world and shrewd practical sense still there were times when he vaguely recognised that there might after all be a reality behind the fancies he now and then indulged in with a smile and that night it seemed to him that the big centrifugal pump was chanting a song of triumph  he had tasted toil and what toil really is only those know who have borne it in the steamy heat of the tropics which saps the white mans vigour while he had discovered what artist as he was he had not learned before that by way of compensation man may attain a certain elusive spirituality by the stern subjugation of his body even when it is accomplished by brutal manual labour as the estremeduras sobrecargo he had watched the struggle for existence between man and man with goodhumoured toleration of its petty wiles and trickeries but now it was the cleaner and more primitive struggle between man and matter he was called upon to take his part in with the faith in the destiny of his species which is capable of moving mountains and not infrequently does so with hydraulic hose and blasting charges as well as a few odd thousand tons of iron and water in a stranded steamer lying still a while he heard the great pump hurling out its announcement of mans domination to swamp and forest and then went peacefully to sleep  he was astir with the dawn next morning but when they went down the ladder into the hold he knew that the change in him had reached a further stage whether the water had sunk or not he was going to see that fight out and go back triumphant or leave his bones in africa it was not alone to vindicate himself in jacintas eyes for that though it counted too seemed of less moment now he was there to justify his existence to prove himself a man which many who have won honours in this world have after all never really done as a sign of it he was wholly practical when hanging down from the ladder he laid the fingers of one hand upon the scratch jefferson had made on the iron then he held up the hand  wet to the knuckles only he said last night the water was on the thumb  they went up and jefferson looked at him keenly when they stood on deck in fact as he had done when austin first clambered half naked out of the hatch  yes he said quietly she is heaving it out and you have done more than start in you mean staying with it now  austin laughed im not sure how you know it but i really think i do  no said jefferson with a twinkle in his eyes when its in your voice and stamped upon the rest of you well i think were going to float her though its perhaps not quite a sure thing yet we seem to have bluffed off funnelpaint but the trouble is you cant bluff the fever in the meanwhile well see if shes draining any out of the engine room  they went in and stood on the top platform looking down on the water which so far as they could discern stood at much the same level as it had done jefferson gazed at it with an air of reflection  if the bulkheads strained and started so the water could get in i dont quite see why it shouldnt run out into the hold again but theres evidently no suction that way he said you see how that toolcase lid is floating theres another point that strikes me those started plates dont seem to be letting very much water in  as you have already pointed out there is a good deal its a little difficult to understand about the whole thing  well said jefferson gravely it doesnt matter in the meanwhile and well probably find out by and by the first thing we have to do is to lay hands on that gum and until the waters lower we cant start in the boys can lay off today well what are you wanting bill  two of the canariers down said the fireman who appeared in the doorway they was looking groggy yesterday an one o thems talking silly now i think its fever  austin looked at jefferson whose face grew a trifle grim ah he said its beginning well i had expected wed have that to grapple with before very long well go along and look at them  they went and found one of the men raving in the forecastle while austin who did what he could for him and his comrade which was very little afterwards spent a day of blissful idleness stretched at full length on the settee in the skippers room with a dampstained treatise on navigation he had never imagined that he could peruse a work of that kind with interest but it served its purpose for he felt he must have something to fix his attention on in the meanwhile the big pump hummed on as it did for another day and night until on the third morning jefferson stopped it and turned steam on the winch again  you have got to keep your eyes open as well as hustle boys he said as he stood with his hand on the lever therell be forty dollars spanish for whoever finds the first bag of gum  austin made this clear to them and they went down the ladder but two men who had gone with them before were not there that day the water had sunk and tiers of rotting bags lay half afloat in it giving out a sickening smell of fermentation they were filled with little black nuts the oleaginous kernels of the palm fruit from which the layer of oil had been scraped off and these were evidently worth little in their damaged condition austin however had very little time to notice them in for the winch above him rattled and the day of feverish toil began  the bags burst when they dragged them into piles and laid them upon the sling while when the winch swung them up a rain of kernels and slimy water came pattering and splashing down putrefying kernels floated up into every hole they made and now and then a man sank waist deep among the crumbling bags still there was no stoppage or slackening of effort forty dollars is a large sum to a seaman of the canaries who can bring up a family on one peseta which is rather less than ninepence a day while the bonus contingent on getting the cumbria off would set up most of them for life they remembered it that day as they floundered and waded about the stifling hold for the work of the big pump had renewed their ardour  still the task before them was one most men would have shrunk from the heat below decks was suffocating the smell of the steaming fermenting mass of slime and oil and kernels nauseating the water it swam in was putrescent and the weight to be hauled out of it and sent up into the sunlight apparently enough to keep them busy for months ahead though they had as everybody knew very little time to move it in it was to be a grim struggle between man and inert material for unless the cumbria was hove off when the rains came it seemed very probable that she would stay there until she fell to pieces  they set about it in silence which in the case of spaniards was a significant thing but nobody had any breath to spare and austin gasped distressfully as he toiled almost naked in their midst his hair was filled with grease clots of oil smeared his shoulders and the bags that burst as he lifted them abraded his dripping skin still they went up opening as they swung out of the dusky hold and the winch rattled on while there could be no rest for any man while sling succeeded sling  he was half blinded by perspiration the wounds on his raw hands had opened again and there were now red patches on his uncovered breast and arms his muscles had however grown accustomed to the strain since the first arduous day and he did a mans part as their comrade with the rest there were no distinctions down in the stifling hold it was a community of effort for the one result and again austin wondered at the forethought of the feverwasted man above who drove the hammering winch  jefferson was beyond all question boss but with singular clearness of vision or perhaps that higher halfconscious faculty of doing the right thing that characterises the leader of men he had recognised that what he called bluff was of no service here and had gone straight to the strength there is in simple human nature there was those untaught sailormen knew no labour he was not ready to bear his part in and no command was flung at them for a show of authority jefferson spent his strength and dollars freely and while he asked no more than a hundred cents worth for the latter he got it with interest a hundredfold  it grew hotter and hotter and there were curiously mingled ejaculations of latin prayer and imprecations that had somehow lost their sting the man with calumniated ancestry took it as a jest and amidst the roar of running chain and fierce rattle of the winch the work went on the rains were coming there was very much to be done and human courage braced itself to the task hard hands were torn and bleeding veins showed gorged on dusky foreheads muscles rose and bunched themselves under the olive skin and englishman and iberian gave freely all that was in them the sweat of the harddriven body and tension of controlling will they were alone in the land of the shadow with a deadly climate against them but the conflict they were engaged in has been waged before by spaniards and englishmen in half the wilder lands  then the winch stopped suddenly and jefferson came backwards down the ladder he alighted knee deep in water among the rotten bags and all his observations were not recordable he had put off conventionality and was once more the reckless sailor and the optimistic american so he spoke of the lower regions and called the men who had stowed the cumbrias cargo condemned loafers in barbarous castilian and good american while the olivefaced canarios gasped and grinned at him  the man who packed those bags there should be hung he said we cant break the bulk out until weve shifted most of them then ill send you down the slingtub and well heave the stuff to  its sixty dollars now for the man who finds the gum  no sign of it yet said austin theyd never have stowed it among the bulk kernels theyre worth something hadnt you better make sure of them  jefferson laughed grimly theyre worthhow do i know call it Â£12 a ton when theyre not rotten its the gum we came for and im going to find it if i tear the ballast tanks and limbeys out of her clear that bag bulkhead and then stand by for the slingtub well heave every blueflamed kernel over  the tub came down by and by in fact two of them and those who had no shovels bailed up the slimy kernels with their hats and hands but each time the chain swung through the hatch the tub below was full it was two oclock when they desisted and some of them were waist deep in water then while soon after they came up the big hose splashed in again there were steampipe collars to unbolt and pack and bolt again before that was done while when austin came upon jefferson he held up one hand from which the scalded skin was peeling  i can run the  winch if i drive her with my mouth and foot he said get the comida into you and then back into the hold again were going to make her hum  austin glanced suggestively towards the men who stood with backs still bent with weariness about the entrance to the forecastle  i suppose so he said still the question is can they stand it long  jefferson laughed harshly theyll have to we have the blazing sun against us and the evening fevermist in fact most everything that man has to grapple with and the worst of all is time still they cant break us we have got to beat themthe river the climate and all the mankilling meanness nature has in western africa  he stopped a moment and standing very straight a haggard grimfaced scarecrow flung up his scalded hands towards the brassy heavens in a wide appealing gesture when you come to the bottom of things thats what we were made for theres something in us that is stronger than them all  austin said nothing though once more a little thrill ran through him as he slipped away quietly in search of his comida what they were doing had he felt been sung in epics long ago and jefferson had it seemed blundered upon the underrunning theme it was the recognition of the primal ban again the ban that had a blessing for man to triumph in and by it win dominion over the material world and all there is therein he and his comrade were men whose creed was crudely simple though it was also on points they did not often mention severe but they bore the bonds of service which are never worn without compensation willingly and the tense effort of will and limb had clarified and strengthened the vague faith in them until they were ready to attempt the impossible  still austin had little time for his comida the men in the forecastle were very sick indeed and he packed them in foul blankets and dosed them with greenlime water boiling hot to start the perspiration which was he recognised likely to accomplish more than his prescriptions there were limes in funnelpaints village and they had not scrupled to requisition them one of the men lay still moaning faintly through blackened lips and the other raving called incoherently on saints and angels it seemed to austin standing in that reeking den that there was small chance for his patients unless they heard him two of those whose names he caught had once he remembered been at least freshwater sailormen and half unconsciously he also appealed to them one creed appeared much the same as another in that dark land and something in him cried out instinctively to the great serene influences beyond the shadow when he had finished his work of mercy the spaniards were stripping the covers off the after hatch and he had scarcely a minute for a mouthful before he joined them to heave the kernels up by hand they went up basket after basket and splashed into the creek but there was no sign of a gum bag or package anywhere among them bill who hove them out through the open gangway once turned to grin at austin who stood next the hatch  ive never been a millionaire an its  unlikely that ill ever be one either but i know what it must feel like now he said here are you an me slingin away stuff thats worth twelve pounds a ton an one o them goes a long way with a man like me  austin said nothing he had no breath to spare but he thrust a brimming basket upon the fireman and that did just as well they toiled throughout that afternoon under a broiling sun but when the black darkness came again they had still found no gum then as they ate together austin looked at jefferson  you are sure the gum was really put into her he said  it was said jefferson with a little grim smile whether its there now or not is another thing well know when shes empty and if we havent found it then well consider not a pound reached grand canary and its quite certain that the fellows who wentsomewhere elsetook none of it with them     chapter xvii  austin goes down river   a week had passed without their finding any gum when one evening austin stood beside jefferson in the cumbrias forecastle it felt as hot as an oven though the damp fell in big drops from the iron beams and trickled down the vessels unceiled skin while a smoky lamp supplied it with insufficient illumination the faint light showed the hazily outlined forms of the men sitting limp and apathetic now the long days toil was over in the acrid smoke of canary tobacco and forced up clearly the drawn face of one who lay beneath it gazing at austin with a glitter in his uncomprehending eyes behind him other figures occupied a part of the shelflike row of bunks but they were mere shapeless bundles of greasy blankets and foul clothing with only a shock of damp hair or a clawlike hand projecting from them here and there to show that they were human jefferson said nothing but his face was a trifle grim and he straightened himself wearily when one of the spaniards rose and moved into the light  seÃ±or he said with a little deprecatory gesture for ourselves we others do not complain but these men are very sick and the medicines of the seÃ±or austin do not make them better one of them is my cousin another my wifes brother and there are those in las palmas and galdar who depend on them in a week or perhaps a day or two they die something must be done  there was a faint approving murmur from the rest of the men they had worked well but the excitement of the search for the gum was wearing off and the strain had commenced to tell jefferson smiled wryly as he glanced at austin  hadnt you better ask him what can be done he said  the spaniard flung his arms up when austin translated this who knows he said i am only an ignorant sailorman and cannot tell but when we came here the seÃ±or austin promised us that we should have all that was reasonable it is not fitting that men should die and nothing be done to save them  i scarcely think it is said austin still how to set about the thing is more than i know it must be talked over we may perhaps tell you more tomorrow  he touched jeffersons shoulder and they went out of the forecastle and towards the skippers room silently when they sat down jefferson looked hard at him  well he said two of them are your men  austin made a little sign of comprehension i dont remember what i promised them i had trouble to get them but i certainly told them the place wasnt a healthy one that however doesnt convey a very sufficient impression to anybody who hasnt been here  no and jefferson smiled grimly i dont quite think it does the point is that you feel yourself responsible to them though i dont see why you should a man has to take his chances when he makes a bargain of the kind they did  austin stretched himself on the settee wearily and lighted a cigarette he had been feeling unpleasantly limp of late and his head and back ached that night  its a little difficult to define what a bargain really is he said still it seems to me that to make it a just one the contracting parties should clearly understand one what he is selling and the other what he is buying in the case in question i knew what i was getting but im far from sure the canarios quite realised what they might have to part with  that is not the business view  i am willing to admit it i however cant help fancying that there is a certain responsibility attached to buying up mens lives for a few dollars when theyre under the impression that its their labour theyre selling in fact its one that is a little too big for me  jefferson sat silent for almost a minute looking at austin who met his gaze steadily with his eyes half closed  well he said it isnt the usual view but theres something to be said for it what dyou mean to do  put the sick men on board the launch and run them out to sea on the chance of picking up a westcoast liner orand it might suit just as wellone of the new opposition boats from what i gathered at las palmas the men who run them are for the most part rather a hardup crowd and youre usually more likely to get a kindness done you by that kind of people we have nothing to pay their passage with you see  you might get one oil puncheon into the launch still you have to remember that men who go down with fever along shore often die instead of coming round when they get out to sea  austin smiled one would fancy that men who stay along shore when they have fever as these fellows have it die invariably  once more jefferson sat silent a while gazing at his comrade thoughtfully  well he said with a little gesture i leave the thing to you after all its quite likely that ones dollars arent worth what you lay out to get them now and then but thats certainly not the question the boats not making the water i expected but we havent found the gum and engine room and after hold are still almost full the boiler as you know has two or three tubes blowing and we have nothing to stop them with that means shes wasting half her steam and as we have to keep a full head for the pump and winch the coals just melting by the time we heave her off there will be very little left and ive no fancy for going to sea short of fuel and being picked up as salvage its a point that has been worrying me lately  there is coal to be had at sierra leone  and there are a british consul and government authorities youre loaded down to the waters edge with shipping acts and the cumbrias still upon your register do you suppose they are going to let her out again as she is if we once go in there  austin fancied it was scarcely likely the requirements of the paternal board of trade are in fact so onerous that english owners not infrequently register their ships under another flag while it occurred to him that consul and surveyor would have a fit of indignant horror if they saw how the enactments were complied with on board the cumbria  no sir said jefferson shes going straight across to las palmas when she leaves this creek thats spanish and a few dollars go a long way in spain besides its not quite certain that well leave the creeks at all this season  austin straightened himself suddenly what do you mean  only that im not going home without the gum  there was a little silence and during it austin endeavoured to adopt an attitude of resignation it was his belief that the cumbria would be floated or the project given up when the rains came that had animated him through the toil he had undertaken another month or two would he had expected see the task accomplished but now it might it seemed continue indefinitely and he shrank from the thought of a longer sojourn in the land of shadow then with a little effort he slowly raised his head  to be candid that is a good deal more than i counted on when i made the bargain he said still i cant well go back on it now there is coal to be had in dakar too but it would cost a good deal to bring even a schooner load here though we could per contra load up oil in her have you the money  jefferson drummed with his fingers upon the table thats the trouble i have a little left but im not quite sure i could get it into my hands without the mailing to and fro of signed papers  some of the westcoast mailboats call at dakar i might get the coal and a schooner on a bond there of course the people would want a heavy profit under the circumstances  three or four times as much as they were entitled to any way and a little glint crept into jeffersons eyes now its quite usual for the man who does the work to be glad of the odd scraps the man with the money flings him for his pains but its going to be different with this contract i havent the least notion of working here to make the other fellow rich if we buy the coal it will be at the market value cash down the trouble is i dont quite know where im going to get it  well said austin slowly a means of raising it has occurred to me you see as seems to have been the case with you there is money in the family and ethically i really think a little of it belongs to me it is notfor several reasonsa pleasant thing to ask for it in fact i fancied once id have starved before i did so but it couldnt be harder than what we have been doing here one could cable to las palmas and a credit might be arranged by wire with one of the banking agencies there  your people would let you have the money  austin laughed a trifle harshly not exactly out of goodwill but if i worded that cable cleverly they might do it to keep me here i dont know how it is in your country but in ours theyre seldom very proud of the poor relation in fact some of them would do a good deal to prevent his turning up to worry them i think there are occasions when a man is almost warranted in levying contributions of the kind  jeffersons eyes twinkled you are a curious inconsequent kind of man you worry over those spaniards who have no call on you and then you propose to bluff your own people out of their money  if i had been one who always acted logically i should certainly not have been here as it is ill start tomorrow and wire my kind relations that failing a draft for two hundred pounds im coming home in rags by the first steamer i almost think theyll send the money  jefferson stretched out a lean hand suddenly and laid it on his comrades arm its going to hurt you but you cant get anything worth while without that you can send them back their money when we get her off but if you let anything stop you now youll feel mean and sorry all your life  yes said austin i fancy i should its rather a pity but one cant always be particular in the meanwhile ill see tom about the launch  he went out and coming back half an hour later threw himself down on the settee and was fast asleep when jefferson who had been busy about the pump came in and stood a moment looking down on him austins face was worn and thinner than it had been when he reached the cumbria the damp stood beaded on it and his hair lay wet and lank upon his pallid forehead  i guess the raising of that money is going to be about the hardest thing you ever did but youll do it said jefferson ive got the kind of man i want for a partner  austin who did not hear him slept on peacefully and steamed away down river early next morning while it was late on the second night and the launch was out at sea when he sat very wearily with his hand upon her helm looking out across the long smooth undulations a halfmoon hung low to the westward and they came up heaving in long succession from under it ebony black in the hollows and flecked with blinks of silver light upon their backs austin only saw the latter for he was looking into the dusky blueness of the east though it was only by an effort he kept himself awake during the last few days a feeling of limp dejection had been creeping over him  the launch was steaming slowly with only a little drowsy gurgle about her propeller as she swung and dipped to the swell though she rolled uneasily with the weight of the big oil puncheon high up in her bill the fireman was crouched half asleep beside the clanking engine and two very sick men lay forward beneath a ragged tarpaulin though the surf had been smoother than usual austin did not know how he had brought them all out across the bar  there were many stars in the heavens and by and by as he blinked at the soft darkness with aching eyes he saw one that seemed unusually low down and moved a little then shaking himself to attention he made out a dim glimmer of green and became sensible of a faint throbbing that crept softly out of the silence he leaned forward and touched the fireman  open her out he said thats a steamboat coming and it looks as if she would go by well to the south  bill pulled at a lever the engine clanked faster and the launch commenced to rail more sharply as she lurched over the long undulations with an increasing gurgle beneath her side the sea was oily smooth and she rolled southwards fast but the steamers lights were rising high and the pounding of engines grew louder in a sharp crescendo until they could hear the black water frothing under iron bows then the launchs whistle broke into a shrill scream there was no answer and austin turned to the fireman again  shake her up there will not be another boat for a week he said  bill pulled the lever over a little further and stirred the furnace and the clanking grew louder while the launch rolled more violently when she swung up austin saw a strip of dusky hull that swayed and heaved in front of them and then was suddenly lost to view again  shes not one of the mailboats anyway theyd be lighted saloon deck and poop he said it almost looks as if she would get away from us  bill opened the whistle full and left it screaming while he sprang up on the side deck a black figure holding high a strip of blazing waste its red glare streaked the water and the burning oil dripped from it in a sparkling rain while austin felt his heart beat when the man flung it down with an imprecation then a deep vibratory blast came trembling across the glimmering water and he saw the piledup foam fall away beneath the big iron bows  theyve seen us he said shes standing by  five minutes later the launch lay lurching beneath the steamers high black side while a man leaned out from her slanted bridge above looking down into her  what dyou want he said im not going in for cargo unless its worth while were tolerably full this trip  a passage said austin there are myself and two sick men were going to grand canary  whats the oil for  to cover the ticket  the skipper appeared to be gazing down at him in astonishment  sixteen pounds worth at the most for three men to grand canary you have good nerves he said  i cant go any further and you see theyre very sick  the skipper was understood to say that his ship was not a several adjectived hospital but austin only smiled for he was acquainted with that kind of man and aware that he was at least as likely to do him a kindness as an elaborately got up mailboats skipper  well he said if you wont have us ill take them back and bury them its tolerably sure to come to that two of us will not eat much any way and well be quite content to sleep on deck  there was no answer for a moment and then as the bridge came slanting down the man who leaned out from it laughed  its a puncheon of oil to nothing and ive been hard up myself he said the next thing is how the devil are you going to get them up weve stowed away our ladder  then itll have to be a sling ill steady them up when she rises and some of your crowd can hand them in  it was done with difficulty for the steamer rolled with a disconcerting swing and then austin grasped bills hand before he went up the rope a gong clanged sharply the launch slid astern and several seamen carried the two bundles of foul blankets away while austin watched them vacantly a hand fell upon his shoulder and propelled him into a room beneath the bridge then he heard a harsh voice  there isnt any factory im acquainted with hereabouts where dyou get that oil from it said  austin sat down on the settee and blinked at the burly hardfaced man in front of him  i dont know if youll be astonished but we really came by it legitimately he said in fact we got it out of a stranded steamerone were endeavouring to heave off you see  the skipper smiled as comprehension suddenly dawned on him then youre one of the  fools who bought the cumbria  i am still im not sure that your opinion of us is quite warranted yet if it isnt youll get more than the one puncheon for taking us across in the meanwhile im a little anxious about those men  theyre all right pills will see to them we have one he probably killed somebody by accident or did something of that kind or he wouldnt be here directors had a notion we might pick up a few passengers they however prefer the liners  austin laughed and the skippers eyes slowly twinkled the fact is i dont blame them he said any way you will lie down here until they get you a room in the poop ready  he went out and an hour or two later austin was roused by a touch from a fitful sleep a young man who stooped over him was regarding him intently  put that in your mouth he said  austin slipped the little glass tube between his lips and the doctor nodded when he passed it back to him  yes he said you have a very promising case of fever coming on get up and lean on me the sooner we pack you between the blankets the better  austin rose unsteadily and found that he had some difficulty in walking when they went out upon the slanting deck he was quite sure of that but everything else that he did or was done to him during the next few days was wrapped in obscurity still he had a hazy notion of the doctor and another man half dragging him into a little room     chapter xviii  jacinta becomes indignant   it was fifteen days after he boarded the steamer when austin reached las palmas in a condition which at least prevented him chafing at the delay as he otherwise would have done on the second day something went wrong with the highpressure engine and the little deeploaded vessel lay rolling idly athwart the swell while her engineers dismantled and reerected it then the trouble they had already had with the condenser became more acute so that they would scarcely keep a vacuum and it also happened that the tradebreeze she had to steam against blew unusually fresh that season  austin however was not aware of this at the time he lay rambling incoherently for several days and when at last his senses came back to him found himself too weak and listless to trouble about anything he gained strength rapidly for the swamp fever does not as a rule keep its victim prostrate long it either kills him without loss of time or allows him to escape for a season but its effect is frequently mental as well as physical and austins listlessness remained he had borne a heavy strain and when he went ashore at las palmas the inevitable reaction was intensified by the black dejection the fever had left behind it seemed to him that he and jefferson were only wasting their efforts and though he still meant to go on with them he expected no result since he now felt that there was not the slightest probability of their ever getting the cumbria off it was a somewhat unusual mood for a young englishman to find himself in though by no means an incomprehensible one in case of a man badly shaken by the malaria fever while one of austins shortcomings was or so at least jacinta brown considered a too complaisant adaptation of himself to circumstances she held the belief that when the latter were unpropitious a determined attempt to alter them was much more commendable and not infrequently successful  in any case austin found pancho brown was away buying tomatoes when he called at his office and the spanish clerk also informed him that miss brown and mrs hatherly had left las palmas for a while he fancied they had gone to madeira but was not certain and austin who left him a message for brown and a letter jefferson had charged him with to be forwarded to miss gascoyne went on to the telegraph office more dejected than ever jacinta had usually a bracing effect upon those she came into contact with and austin who felt he needed a mental stimulant realised now that one of the things that had sustained him was the expectation of hearing her express her approval of what he had done he had not looked for anything more but it seemed that he must also dispense with this consolation  he delivered one of the canarios who was apparently recovering to his friends and saw the other bestowed in the hospital and then finding that he could not loiter about las palmas waiting an answer to his cable which he did not expect for several days decided to go across to teneriffe with the estremedura there was no difficulty about this though funds were scanty for the spanish manager told him he could make himself at home on board her as long as he liked if he would instruct the new sobrecargo in his duties as he it appeared had some difficulty in understanding them  on the night they went to sea he lay upon the settee in the engineers messroom with macallister sitting opposite him and a basket of white grapes and a garafon of red wine on the table between them port and door were wide open and the tradebreeze swept through the room fresh and delightfully cool austin had also an unusually good cigar in his hand and stretched himself on the settee with a little sigh of content when he had recounted what they had done on board the cumbria  i dont know if well ever get her off and the astonishing thing is that since i had the fever i dont seem to care he said in the meanwhile its a relief to get away from her in fact i feel i would like to lie here and take it easy for at least a year  macallister nodded comprehendingly austins face was blanched and hollow and he was very thin while the stamp of weariness and lassitude was plain on him still as he glanced in his direction a little sparkle crept into the engineers eyes  so jefferson made the pump go and ran the forehold dry he said when ye come to think of it yon is an ingenious man  austin laughed he is also in some respects an astonishing one he was perfectly at home among the smart people at the catalina and i fancy he would have been equally so in the bowery whose inhabitants one understands very much resemble in their manners those of your glasgow closes or edinburgh wynds in fact ive wondered now and then if miss gascoyne quite realises who she is going to marry there are several sides to jeffersons character and she has so far only seen one of them  well said macallister reflectively im thinking she will never see the rest there are men though theyre no exactly plentiful who can hide them and its scarcely likely that jefferson will rive a steamboat out of the african swamps again  once is quite enough in a lifetime but its when the work is done and he has to quiet down i foresee trouble for jefferson im not sure miss gascoynes english friends would altogether appreciate him  again macallister nodded still he said what yon man does not know he will learn i would back him to do anything now he has made that boiler steam then ye will mind its no the clever women who are the easiest to live with when ye have married them and theres a good deal to be said for girls like miss gascoyne who do not see too much it is convenient that a wife should be content with her husband and not be wanting to change him into somebody else which is a thing i would not stand at any price myself  austin grinned for it was known that macallister had at least now and then found it advisable to entertain his friends on board the estremedura by stealth the engineer however did not appear to notice his smile  ye will go back when ye get the money he said  of course i have to see the thing out now though i dont quite understand how i ever came to trouble myself about it in the first place  this time it was macallister who grinned i have been in this world a weary while and would ye pull the wool over my eyes ye are aware that the notion was driven into ye  austin was astonished and a trifle annoyed as he remembered a certain very similar conversation he had had with jefferson it was disconcerting to find that macallister was as conversant with his affairs as his partner had shown himself to be especially as they had both apparently drawn the same inference  i wonder what made you say that he asked with lifted brows  macallister laughed well he said drily im thinking miss brown knows as well as i do that ye would not have gone of your own accord  why should miss brown have the slightest wish that i should go to africa  if ye do not know how could ye expect me to still it should be plain to ye that it was not for your health  austin raised himself a trifle and looked at his comrade steadily the drift of your remarks is tolerably clear any way because i would sooner you made no more of them it might be as well to point out that no girl who cared twopence about a man would send him to the swamps where the cumbria is lying  maybe she would not there are things i do not know but ye will mind that jacinta brown is not made on quite the same model as miss gascoyne she sees a good deal and if she was not content with her husband she would up and alter him im thinking it would not matter if it hurt the pair o them  the difficulty is that she hasnt got one  macallister laughed softly its one that can be got over though jacintas particular its not everybody who would suit her ye are still wondering why ye went to africa  no said austin with a trace of grimness i dont think its worth while mind im not admitting that i didnt go because the notion pleased me and if miss brown wished me to it was certainly because of muriel gascoyne  maybe said macallister with a little incredulous smile he rose and moving towards the doorway turned again she might tell ye herself tomorrow shes now in santa cruz  he went out apparently chuckling over something and austin thoughtfully smoked out his cigar to be a friend of jacinta browns was as he had realised already a somewhat serious thing it implied that one must adopt her point of view and what was more difficult to some extent at least sink his own individuality macallister and jefferson were he fancied perhaps right upon one point and that was that jacinta had decided that a little strenuous action might be beneficial in his case but if this was so austin was not sure that he was grateful to her he was willing to do anything that would afford her pleasure that was so long as he could feel she would gain anything tangible if it was only the satisfaction of seeing muriel gascoyne made happy through his endeavours in fact what he wished was to do her a definite service but the notion of being reformed as it were against his wishes when he was not sure that he needed it did not please him this was carrying a friendly interest considerably too far and it was quite certain he thought that he could expect nothing more from her he almost wished that he had never seen her which was a desire he had hovered on the brink of before but while he considered the matter the tradebreeze was sighing through the port and the engines throbbed on drowsily while from outside came the hiss and gurgle of parted seas austin heard it all until the sounds grew fainter and he went to sleep  it also happened that while he slept and dreamed of her jacinta sat with muriel gascoyne in the garden of a certain hotel on the hillside above santa cruz teneriffe the house had been built long ago evidently for a spanish gentleman of means and taste and its latest proprietor had sufficient sense to attempt no improvement on its oldworld beauty it stood on a terrace of the hillside quiet quaint and cool with its ancient bronzerailed balconies redtiled roof and pinkwashed walls but its garden of palms and oleanders was its greatest charm  on the night in question a full moon hung over the caÃ±adas splintered rampart and its soft radiance fell upon the whitewalled city and smote a track of glittering silver across the vast plain of sea the smell of oleanders and heliotrope was heavy in the air and a cluster of blossoms swayed above jacintas shoulder she was just then looking up at a spanish officer in dark green uniform who stood close by with sword girt tight to his thigh he had a dark forceful face with the stamp of distinction on it but he received no encouragement though he glanced at the vacant place on the stone bench suggestively  no said jacinta i do not think i shall go tomorrow so you need not call for me i have scrambled through the mercedes wood several times already and we came here to be quiet that is why we are sitting outside tonight there are two or three tiresome people in the house who will insist upon talking  it is seldom necessary to furnish a spaniard who is usually skilled in innuendo with a second hint and the officer took his departure gracefully when he vanished with jingling sword into the shadow of the palms muriel looked at her companion  you meant me to stay she said  of course said jacinta still i didnt mean you to let him see that i did and i really did not kick you very hard any way it doesnt matter the great thing is that he is gone  you were anxious that he should go  yes said jacinta i feel relieved now he is in some respects a very silly man in fact he has been wanting to marry me for ever so long  why said muriel and stopped abruptly of course i mean that he is a spaniard you know  jacinta laughed and apparently indicated herself by a little wave of her fan she was once more attired in an evening dress that appeared to consist largely of black lace and looked curiously dainty and sylphlike in the diaphanous drapery the moonlight was also on her face  the reason she said ought to be sufficiently plain he is as you point out certainly spanish but there really are a few estimable gentlemen of that nationality this one was governor or commandante in some part of cuba and i believe he got comparatively rich there they usually do still hes a little fond of the casino and is reported to be unlucky while in spite of my obvious disadvantages i am the daughter of pancho brown  she stopped with another laugh that had a faintly suggestive ring in it there are times when i wish i was somebody else who hadnt a penny  but it cant be nice to be poor said muriel looking at her with a trace of bewilderment in her big blue eyes  it is probably distinctly unpleasant still it would be consoling to feel that your money could neither encourage nor prevent anybody you liked falling in love with you and it would in one sense be nice to know that the man you graciously approved of would have to get whatever you wanted for you you ought to understand that  there was a trace of pride in muriels smile of course but after all there are not many men who can do almost anything likeharry jefferson some of the very nicest ones seem quite unable to make money  i really dont think there are and jacintas tone was for no very apparent reason slightly different now the nicest ones are as you suggest usually lazy its sad but true still you see if ever i married my husband would have to shake off his slothfulness and do something worth while  but he mightnt want to  of course said jacinta drily he probably wouldnt still he would have to i should make him  ah said muriel do you know that you are just a little hard and i think when one is too hard one is generally sorry afterwards now i dont understand it all but you once told me you had got something you wished for done and were sorry you had i fancied you were even sorrier than you wished me to know  jacinta sat silent a moment or two with a curious expression in her face as she looked out across the clustered roofs towards the sparkling sea it was a custom she had fallen into lately and it was always towards the east she gazed then she smiled  well she said perhaps i was but it was certainly very silly of me  neither of them spoke again for a while and by and by a man came out of the house bearing an envelope upon a tray jacinta tore it open and muriel saw the blood surge to her face as she spread out the telegraphic message then the swift colour faded and there was only a little angry glint in her eyes  its from my father and good news for you she said tell muriel austin was here salvage operations difficult but he left jefferson who expects to be successful well forwarding letter  ah said muriel with a little gasp you dont know what a relief that is to me but you seem almost angry  jacinta laughed a trifle harshly i almost think i am it isnt exactly pleasant to find ones self mistaken and i had expected something better from mr austin the difficulties he mentions were evidently too much for him you were quite right my dear there are not many men like jefferson  now muriel gascoyne had no very keen perceptions and was moreover wrapped up in her own and jeffersons affairs or she might have seen that anger was not all that jacinta was feeling as it was overcome by the relief the message had brought her she quite failed to notice the pain in her companions face or the quivering of her hands in a minute or two jacinta who waited until she fancied she could do so without it appearing significant rose and left her  she however stopped on the terrace and once more looked down on the glittering sea with one hand closed at her side then as though remembering something she turned hastily  i could never have believed you were a cowardand you went out for me she said and moved towards the hotel with a little air of resolution as one who had made a painful decision     chapter xix  condemned unheard   a full moon hung over the white city and the drowsy murmur of the surf broke fitfully through the music of the artillery band when austin sat listlessly on a bench in the plaza of santa cruz it was about eight oclock in the evening and the plaza was crowded as usual at that hour peon and officer merchant and clerk paced slowly up and down enjoying the cool of the evening with their wives and daughters or sat in clusters outside the lighted cafÃ©s the band was an excellent one the crowd gravely goodhumoured and picturesquely attired for white linen paletinted draperies sombre cloth and green uniform formed patches of kaleidoscopic colouring as the stream of humanity flowed by under the glaring lamplight and the soft radiance of the moon  austin had sat there often before he went to africa listening to the music and watching the spectacle but neither had any charm for him that night the laughter sounded hollow the waltz the band was playing had lost its swing and the streams of light from the cafÃ©s hurt his eyes and irritated him the deep murmur of the sea alone was faintly soothing and remembering how often he had thought of that cool plaza with its lights and music in the steamy blackness of the swamps he wondered vaguely what had happened to him the zest and sparkle seemed to have gone out of life and he did not attribute it to the fact that the melancholia of the swamp belt was still upon him  he crossed the plaza and sitting outside one of the cafÃ©s he had frequented asked for wine it was brought him chilled with snow from the great peaks summit but the greeting of the man who kept the cafÃ© seemed for once devoid of cordiality and the wine sour and thin still the spaniard stood a minute or two by his chair and as it happened jacinta passed just then with a darkfaced spanish officer he wore an exceedingly tightfitting uniform but he had a figure that carried it well and an unmistakable air of distinction jacinta was also smiling at him though she turned and seemed to indicate somebody in the vicinity with a little gesture as she did so her eyes rested for a moment upon austin who became for the first time unpleasantly conscious of his haggard face and hard scarred hands there was he realised nothing in the least distinguished about him then it was with a faint sense of dismay he saw that jacinta did not mean to recognise him for she laughed as she turned to her companion and he heard the soft rustle of her light draperies as they went on again  that is the colonel sarramento he said as carelessly as he could though there was a faint flush in his hollow face  it is said his companion colonel in the military service though he has held other offices in cuba a man of ability seÃ±or and now it is said that he will marry the english merchants daughter why not the seÃ±orita brown is more spanish than english and she is certainly rich  i dont know of any reason said austin listlessly and the man turned away he had no wish to waste his time upon an englishman who apparently did not appreciate his conversation  austin sat still a little while indignation struggling with his languor for he was almost certain that jacinta had seen him he had never flattered himself that she would regard him as anything more than a friend who was occasionally useful but he thought she might at least have expressed her appreciation of his latest efforts and he was also a trifle puzzled jacinta as a rule would stop and speak to any of the barefooted peons she was acquainted with and he had never known her to slight an acquaintance without a reason it seemed only due to her to make quite sure she had intentionally passed him without recognition  he rose and strolled round the plaza until he met her again face to face where a stream of garish light fell upon them both she allowed her eyes to rest upon him steadily but it was the look she would have bestowed on a stranger and in another moment she had turned to the officer at her side then a bevy of laughing tourists passed between and separated them  after that austin strolled round the plaza several times in a far from amiable temper he was stirred at last and easygoing as he usually was there was in him a certain vein of combativeness which had been shaken into activity in africa it was he admitted certainly jacintas privilege to ignore him but there were occasions on which conventionalities might be disregarded and he determined that she should at least make him acquainted with her purpose in doing so he did not mean to question it but to hear it was he felt no more than his due  it was some time before he came upon her again talking to a spanish lady who seeing him approaching with a suggestion of resolution in his attitude had sufficient sense to withdraw a pace or two and sign to another companion jacinta apparently recognised that he was not to be put off this time for she indicated the vacant chairs not far away with a little wave of her fan and when he drew one out for her sat down and looked at him  you are persistent she said i am not sure that it was altogether commendable taste  austin laughed a trifle bitterly for the pessimistic dejection the fever leaves does not as a rule tend to amiability and its victim while willing to admit that there is nothing worth worrying over is apt to make a very human display of temper on very small provocation  one should not expect too much from a steamboat sobrecargo he said it is scarcely fair to compare himfor examplewith a distinguished spanish officer  i do not think you are improving matters said jacinta  well said austin drily i have you see just come from a land where life is rather a grim affair and one has no time to study its little amenities i am in fact quite willing to admit that i have left my usual suavity behind me still i dont think that should count you contrived to impress me with the fact that you preferred something more vigorously brusque before i went out  jacinta met his gaze directly with a little ominous sparkle in her eyes and straightening brows she had laid down her fan and there was a cold disdain in her face the man could not understand it was unfortunate he did not know how pancho brown had worded his message for it contained no intimation that he was going back to africa  its a pity you didnt stay there she said  austin started a little he did not see what she could mean and the speech appeared a trifle inhuman  it would please me to think you havent any clear notion what those swamps are like he said one is unfortunately apt to stay there altogether  which is a contingency you naturally wished to avoid i congratulated you upon your prudence once before still you at least seemed quite acquainted with the characteristics of the fever belt of western africa when you went out your friends the mailboats officers must have told you that being so why did you go  a persistent dropping will it is said in time wear away considerably harder material than i am composed of words are also one could fancy even more efficacious than water in that respect  a trace of colour crept into jacintas face and her brows grew straighter the lines of her slight form became more rigid and she was distinctly imperious in her anger  oh i understand she said well i admit that i was the cause of your going and now you have come to reproach me for sending you well i will try to bear it and if i do show any anger it will not be at what you say but at the fact that one who i to some extent believed in should consider himself warranted in saying anything at all no doubt you will not recognise the distinction but in the meanwhile you havent quite answered my question you were a free agent after all and i could use no compulsion why did you go  austins temper had grown no better during the interview which was unfortunate for him because an angry man is usually at a disadvantage in the presence of a woman whose indignation with him is largely tempered by a chilling disdain  that he said reflectively is a point upon which i cannot be quite certain though the whole thing was naturally in most respects a piece of egregious folly still your good opinion had its value to me especially as it was very evident that i could never expect anything more a little brutal candour is i think admissible now and then  the colour had faded out of jacintas face but the sparkle was a trifle plainer in her eyes so you recognised that under the circumstances it was wise of you though how far you were warranted in telling me is a question we neednt go into now it is a pity you ever went at all  in one sense i almost think it is said austin gazing at her bewilderedly still there is a good deal i cant understand i am in the dark you see  then i suppose i must try to make it clear to you i am an essentially practical person and any ardour you possess has hitherto been qualified by a very commendable discretion but we are not very old after all and there is fortunately something in most of us which is occasionally stronger than the petty prudence we guide ourselves by now and then as you gracefully suggest it leads us into folly which we have perhaps really no great reason to be sorry for well for a little while you shook off the practical and apparently aspired after the ideal you went out to africa because you fancied it would please me and it did one may admit that a thing of that kind appeals to a womans vanity still of course one could scarcely expect you to adhere to such a purpose we have grown too wise to indulge in unprofitable sentimentality and our knights errant do not come back upon their shields they are practical gentlemen who appreciate the comfort of a whole skin  im afraid youre confusing historical periods and the times have certainly changed they now use an empty gun case in western africa i believe and if they cant get that any old blanket or piece of canvas that happens to be available  it should be a comfort to know that you need never anticipate anything so unpleasant  this time the colour suffused austins pallid face it was clear that she was taunting him with cowardice in leaving jefferson and her contempt appeared so wholly unreasonable that he would make no attempt to vindicate himself it did not appear likely to be successful in any case and the pessimistic bitterness the fever leaves was still upon him  well he said quietly i had looked for a slightly different reception but it presumably isnt dignified to complain especially when its evident it wouldnt do any good while i scarcely think there is anything to be gained by extending our conversation you see i am naturally aware that my character is a somewhat indifferent one already you will no doubt excuse me  jacinta made him a little inclination over her lifted fan  if you will tell the seÃ±ora anasona yonder that i am waiting i should be much obliged she said  it was five minutes later when austin was admitted to the cable office as a favour and handed a despatch from a las palmas banking agency  your draft will be honoured to the extent of Â£200 it ran  he smiled grimly as he thrust it into his pocket and wandering round the plaza again came upon muriel gascoyne and mrs hatherly sitting in two of the chairs laid out in front of a hotel he felt tempted to slip by but remembered that he had a duty to jefferson mrs hatherly shook hands with him and though he fancied there was a restraint in her cordiality muriel turned to him impulsively  tell me everything she said the letter has not arrived  there is a good deal of it said austin with a smile  then dont waste time  austin roused himself with an effort her tense interest and her simplicity which it seemed to him had in it so much that was admirable appealed to him and he determined that she at least should know what jefferson had done for her the artistic temperament had also its influence on him and he made her and her companion see the steaming swamps and feel the stress and strain of effort in the stifling hold while it was his pleasure that jefferson should stalk a lean dominant figure through all the varied scenes he felt when he concluded that he had drawn those sombre pictures well and it would be jeffersons fault if he did not henceforward pose before the girls fancy as a knightly hero of romance there were naturally difficulties to be overcome for he recognised that she must be forced to comprehend that chivalric purposes must nowadays be wrought out by most prosaic means and that the clash of the encounter occasionally leaves its mark upon a man still he saw that he had succeeded when the simple pride shone through the moisture that gathered in the girls big blue eyes and he was moved to sympathy when she rose with a little gasp  i must tell jacinta i dont feel quite able to thank you mr austin but you will understand she said  she left them and mrs hatherly turned and looked at austin very graciously  so you are going back she said  of course said austin there is a spanish boat to las palmas tomorrow and nothing to keep me now i have got the money i dont mind admitting that the asking for it was harder than anything i did in africa  the little lady nodded with a very kindly light in her eyes yes she said i can understand that but in one sense i am not exactly pleased why didnt you come to me  it sounds very ungracious madam but i am already in your debt and one is naturally shy about asking favours of that kind from women i almost think there are special reasons why it should be so in my case  that presumably means somebody has used you badly still it really isnt wise to generalise too freely and you were once good enough to promise that you would consider me as a friend of yours  i could scarcely have fancied you were particularly friendly a little while ago  the little lady smiled again i offer you my sincere apologies mr austin and now a question did you tell jacinta what you have told us  i certainly did not to be candid i hadnt the slightest encouragement miss brown made it quite clear to me that she hadnt a trace of interest in any of my doings in fact she was kind enough to suggest it was rather a pity i escaped the fever and hadnt come back upon my shield  for which she will probably be distinctly annoyed with herself by and by i presume you must catch the spanish steamer mr austin  of course after all i shall be glad to get back people are not so very exacting in africa you see  mrs hatherly nodded though there was a twinkle in her eyes well she said we will talk of something else in the meanwhile i am alone just now and you cannot decently leave me  they discussed a good many things and it seemed to austin that his companion meant to keep him there and was anxious to gain time still he could see no reason for it and failed to understand her remark about jacinta and he sat still with an effort until muriel came back again she appeared a trifle vexed about something  i dont know what has happened to jacinta but she wasnt in the least sympathetic she said she wouldnt even listen when i wanted to talk about harry and the cumbria  where is she now asked mrs hatherly  with the seÃ±ora anasona they are going back to laguna directly though she had as you know practically promised to stay with us tonight the seÃ±ora it seems wants to drive her across to her finca at orotava tomorrow it is very provoking  mrs hatherly changed the subject and it was a minute or two later when she turned to austin again  i suppose it is really necessary that you should cross to las palmas tomorrow she said casually couldnt you get there in the estremedura before the westcoast boat sailed  there are several things i have to do which cant well be arranged here  you would insist on getting them all done even if you knew it would cost you something  i really think i should you see jefferson and the others are practically depending on me and i darent omit anything i want whatever trouble it might cause me although as a matter of fact i dont anticipate any and it will be rather a relief to get away  ah said mrs hatherly well i suppose that is only what one would expect from you muriel will you tell jacinta that she has not shown me the lace she mentioned and as i think ill get the woman at laguna to make me some i want to see it before she goes away i shall have to keep you another few minutes mr austin  muriel disappeared into the crowd and it was a little time before she came back again  jacinta has just driven off with the seÃ±ora she said i cant quite understand why she didnt come to say goodbye  austin smiled drily i think i could guess her reason  mrs hatherly rose and held out her hand if you can come and see us tomorrow please do so she said if not you will remember now that whatever happens i am one of your friends  i shall be glad to do so madam and austin made her a little inclination good friends are scarce and there are apparently not many people who believe in me     chapter xx  jacinta makes no excuse   it was in the heat of the afternoon mrs hatherly and muriel drove into oldworld laguna which stands high upon the hill slopes above santa cruz it was built four hundred years ago and remains but little changed for its early prosperity ebbed away with the trade in the once famous vintages of canary so that it stood until a few years ago with the grass in its streets a place of drowsy stillness picturesque in its decay cool and by no means over clean beneath it the hillside drops dusty and sunscorched to the sea but on the plateau behind it are fields of tall sugarcane walnuts eucalyptus and vines beyond which again the shoulders of the great peak are seamed by straggling pines still when mrs hatherly drove into it laguna was once more awakening for the british tourist had arrived with his wife and daughters in blue veils and inartistic raiment that roused the peasants wonder besides cameras and baggage by the carriage load and when the tourist comes quietness and the dignified simplicity of olden spain melt before him  the seÃ±ora anasona with whom jacinta was then residing however belonged to the ancient order and she had also placed herself and all her possessions at mrs hatherlys disposal the latter had already discovered that to be a friend of jacintas counted for a good deal in those islands it secured one consideration in unexpected places and opened doors at which the tweedclad tourists wives might knock in vain the castilian is somewhat behind the times and perhaps because he is seldom troubled with much of it attaches rather less importance than some other people do to the possession of money muriel however was not certain why her aunt had undertaken that hot and dusty drive although she had informed her that if there was a comfortable hotel in laguna she might stay there a day or two because she was not sure that santa cruz suited her and she had been troubled with certain premonitory twinges in one shoulder  in any case she faced the scorching sun uncomplainingly and arriving at last before an ironbound door in a blank white wall was led through an illkept garden where flowers rioted a chaos of blazing colour at their will into a big cool house which seemed filled with slumbrous quietness she was received by a very reposeful lady of middle age in inconveniently tightfitting black silk with the powder thick upon her pallid face the seÃ±ora anasona was as is usual with spanish women who have passed their third decade somnolent in expression and portly but though they could only muster a very little indifferent french between them she promptly set her guests at ease  this poor house and all there is in it are yours she said the friends of the seÃ±orita jacinta are also mine since you have known this for some time why have you stayed away so long  it was the usual conventional formula in spain but there was a certain stately graciousness in her gesture which mrs hatherly had never seen quite equalled before the latter attempted an appropriate reply in french and then inquired for jacinta whereupon her hostess smiled  she is in the patio and perhaps asleep she said if not it is likely that she will come in i do not know one does what one pleases always in this house of mine and here one usually sleeps by the afternoon what would you it is a custom of the country and there is nothing else to do one can dream of the times when it was different with us and spain  one could fancy in this island that those days have not altogether passed away or at least that they had left something behind said mrs hatherly one sees it in even your peons courtesy and the modesty of the women  you did not feel that in las palmas  no said mrs hatherly i dont think i did  the seÃ±ora laughed las palmas is not spanish now my friend they have coal wharves and harbour works and heap up the pesetas there there are however things we others would not exchange for silver this house for example an englishman would buy it and make it an hotel  of course you would not sell it him  the seÃ±ora shook her head it is not mine she said it belongs to the anasonas who are dead one of them built it four hundred years ago and one of them has lived here always until my husband colonel of cazadores died in cuba now i live alone and remember until by and by my nephew comes here after me the past is all we have in spain but one feels that after all it may be worth more than the presentwhen one goes to las palmas  then a maid brought in a basket of grapes and a little wine and it was some time later when the seÃ±ora turned to muriel  it seems that jacinta is not coming in she said perhaps she would sooner see you alone in the patio i do not know jacinta does not care about the conventions she does what pleases her and it is also very often the right thing one descends from the veranda outside that window  muriel smiled as she went out for she was acquainted with jacintas habits and was beginning to comprehend the customs of the land she lived in where time is not considered and it is always drowsy afternoon then though she was not an imaginative person she trod softly as she went down the steps to the patio for the influence of the place laid hold on her the little white town lay silent under the cloudless heavens and had there been any movement of busy life there which very seldom happened the high white walls of the garden would have shut out the sound the house was also built round the patio in a hollow square and interposed a double barrier between the outer world and that space of flowers  over it hung bronzerailed balconies and quaint verandas with old carved pillars and rich trellises smothered in purple bougainvilla while there were oleanders and heavy scented heliotrope in the little square below a fountain twinkled in the midst of it and fat goldfish from palma swam slowly round its marble basin but all was old artistic ill cared for and steeped in a silence which seemed filled with the reminiscences of bygone years even jacinta who lay in a big cane chair near the fountain appeared in keeping with the atmosphere of the place for she was dressed in gauzy castilian black which added a suggestion of oldfashioned stateliness to her somewhat slender figure and an ebony fan of a kind not made nowadays lay across an open book she had apparently been reading she looked up with a little smile when she saw muriel and languidly pointed to the canvas lounge beside her  its comfortable and i think its strong she said any way the seÃ±ora regularly goes to sleep in it i brought the lounges with me because they dont have such things in spain i shall probably leave them here and if they break down with the seÃ±ora it is quite certain nobody will ever think of mending them one folds ones hands and says that it doesnt matter at laguna you will begin to understand it if you stay here  muriel laughed its often a little hard to tell what you mean she said you have been reading  mr prescotts history of the spanish occupation of mexicoyou will no doubt be astonished at that  i am still i have read it too  jacinta smiled as she unfolded her fan i have my moments of relaxation and can be sentimental now and then sentiment you see is in the atmosphere here one feels mediÃ¦val as if all the old things of the olden days had come back again miracles and crowned virgins that fell from the clouds valour and knightliness and mans faith in woman no doubt there were more but i dont remember them they have of course gone out of fashion long ago  she spoke lightly but there was a trace of bitterness in her voice that muriel noticed  one doesnt find that atmosphere in the book the men who went with cortez were cruel as well as brutal  they certainly seem to have been so which is one reason why they interest me you see the spaniards seized these islands a little before they discovered cuba and i wanted to find out what the men who built these beautiful homes here were really like when they had work on hand as one would have fancied the grave ceremonious don who posed as a most punctilious gentleman at home became a very different kind of person when he went to mexico the original adam showed up there its a useful lesson to any one silly enough to idealise the man she is going to marry  muriel flushed a little i think i know what you mean mr austin tried to convey the same impression when he told me what they were doing on board the cumbria still he went a good deal further than you do he made me understand that though there are things that could only be done rudely and almost brutally it was often only what was ideal in the men who did them that sent them to the work at all  yes said jacinta drily i fancy he would do it rather well mr austin is not much of an artist and would never be a great one but he has the capacity of understanding or perhaps i should say imagining things still the pity is that he usually stops there he doesnt want to do them and though he once very rashly tried he was not long in discovering that the work was a good deal too hard for him i really think you should be glad there is a trace of primitivewell be candid and call it brutalityin harry jefferson  again the colour showed in muriels face it isnt she said its only natural forcefulness but we neednt go into that i wonder why you are so angry with mr austin  angry and jacinta raised her brows oh dear no still there are points on which he did not quite come up to my expectations and after the admonitions i have wasted on him i feel a little annoyed with him  still isnt that a trifle unreasonable what could he have done that he hasnt done he was ill and worn out but he wouldnt even stay a day after he got the money  what money and there was a sharp insistency in jacintas tone  the money to buy the coal with they found they hadnt enough you know  i dont  well said muriel it is really your own fault you wouldnt let me tell you about it in the plaza mr austin had to borrow the money from his english relatives though i think it hurt him horribly to ask them when he found they would send it he had to catch the first african steamer  jacinta straightened herself suddenly and gazed at muriel with astonishment and dismay in her face  so he meant to go back all the time she said  of course said muriel and jacinta sitting back again sat very still though her companion noticed that one hand had closed tightly on her fan  when was he to go she asked with a curious quietness  in a day or two he is in las palmas now  then there was a curious silence for almost a minute and jacinta who could not rouse herself to break it was glad to see that muriel had evidently not remembered that her only information about austins doings was that contained in her fathers message there was no sound but the soft splashing of the fountain and jacinta found the stillness becoming intolerable it was a relief when muriel who felt that her company was not appreciated rose  perhaps the seÃ±ora will expect me to go back she said are you coming  i am not said jacinta i have no doubt your aunt will come out to see me presently  muriel looked a little puzzled you will not mind my going  of course not and jacinta laughed somewhat curiously i have as you see a work on mexico to keep me company  muriel left her and she lay still in the chair listening to the fountain and gazing straight in front of her until mrs hatherly came down the veranda stairs alone half an hour later she sat down and looked at jacinta steadily  i suppose you know why i have come to laguna today she said  yes said jacinta quietly still i hadnt the faintest notion a little while ago i shall try to bear anything you may think fit to say to me mr austin i understand is a friend of yours  the little lady smiled for she saw that jacinta was clever enough to make no excuses and she appreciated her candour as well as her good sense  well she said i want you to tell me why you sent him to africa  for one thing because muriel was once very kind to me mr jefferson was down with fever and i fancied that in any case he could do a good deal more with a comrade there still that was not all there were other reasons  naturally it is gratifying to discover how far a mans devotion will carry him  a little flash crept into jacintas eyes but it faded again i suppose i deserve that but you are wrong it wasnt to soothe my vanity  no and there was a suggestion of incredulity in mrs hatherlys smile still one may be excused for pointing out that it really looks very like it  jacinta made a little movement with her fan you cant think worse of me than i do of myself but i scarcely fancy i did wrong in sending him he was wasting his life here and i thought i knew what there was in him i wanted to rouse itto waken him you see i am talking very frankly  in that case it must have cost you something to send him to africa  the colour showed plainly in jacintas face i think that is another question one too which you could scarcely expect me to answer you  im afraid it was not very delicate and mrs hatherlys eyes grew gentler still didnt you feel that you were presumptuous  of course but i have always done what pleased me and made others do it too it usually turned out well you know i have however come to grief this time and it would almost be a relief if somebody would shake me  mrs hatherly smiled i fancy the feeling will do you good still if you were right in sending mr austin out it is just a little incomprehensible  then you dont know how i treated him  no said mrs hatherly at least not exactly he only admitted that you did not seem very pleased to see him still i am an old woman and that naturally conveyed a good deal to me perhaps you do deserve shaking but i want to be kind  jacinta turned to her with the colour in her cheeks and a haziness in her eyes  i taunted him with being a coward and finding the work too hard for him the man was ill and jaded but i had no mercy on him he said nothing he never told me he was going back how was i to know the night my fathers message came i felt i could have struck him if i had done so he would probably not have felt it half so much as the bitterness i heaped upon him  ah said mrs hatherly it was perhaps natural under the circumstances but there is a good deal that you are responsible for  what do you mean by under the circumstances  mrs hatherly smiled i have not the slightest doubt that you quite understand my dear the question however is how you are going to set it right  jacinta shivered a little the colour had already ebbed from her face which was a trifle more pallid than usual  it is a thing i may never be able to do she said that is what makes it so hard you see a good many men go out to africa and so few come back again if it hadnt been for that i dont think i should have admitted what i have done but i feel i must have somebodys comprehensionif i cant expect sympathy  you have mine my dear and mrs hatherly laid a beautiful thin hand gently upon her arm besides i think mr austin will understand how it came about when he goes back to africa  jacinta straightened herself slowly well she said that may happen and in any case i know that i sent him and he was glad to go  she met the little ladys sympathetic gaze steadily still that is so very little after all  mrs hatherly smiled reassuringly my dear she said i think you do not quite understand all that man is yet in spite of the climate he and his comrade are going to be successful  then she turned and jacinta rose for the seÃ±ora anasona and muriel were coming down the stairway     chapter xxi  the pictures   austin had been gone a fortnight when jacinta and muriel gascoyne sat under the lee of the estremeduras deckhouse one morning on their way to las palmas above them the mastheads swung languidly athwart a cloudless sweep of blue and the sea frothed in white incandescence about the lurching hull below as the little yachtlike steamer reeled eastwards with a rainbow in the spray that whirled about her bows astern of her the peaks white cone gleamed above its wrappings of fleecy mist and ahead on the far horizon grand canary swam a purple cloud  jacinta was dressed ornately in the latest english mode and it seemed to muriel that she had put on conventional frivolity along with her attire indeed muriel had noticed a change in her companion during the last few days one that was marked by outbreaks of flippancy and somewhat ironical humour an english naval officer leaned upon the back of her chair and a tourist of the same nationality stood balancing himself against the rolling with his hand on the rail that ran along the deckhouse the latter was looking down at macallister who sat upon the deck with a little box in front of him  i brought up the two or three sketches ye were asking for mr coulstin he said the saloons full of jabbering spaniards and the messrooms over hot  the tourist screwed the glass he wore more tightly into his eye if theyre equal to the one i saw in the nÂ wÂ a store i may be open to make a purchase he said i think you told me you were acquainted with the artist miss brown  i believe i did said jacinta who was conscious that macallister was watching her languidly you will however no doubt be able to judge his pictures for yourself  coulston made a little humourous gesture i am not a painter and i could scarcely venture to call myself a connoisseur still i buy a picture or two occasionally and the one i mentioned rather took my fancy a sketch or two of that kind would make a pleasant memento  one would fancy that a good photograph would be more reliable as well as cheaper said the naval officer  coulston reproachfully shook his head im afraid we differ there he said leaving out the question of colour a photograph is necessarily an artificial thing it wants life and atmosphere and you can never put that into a picture by a mechanical process only a man can feel and transmute his impressions into material accuracy of detail is after all by comparison a secondary consideration but perhaps i had better pull up before my hobby makes a bolt of it  i have heard of people riding a hobby uncomfortably hard said jacinta reflectively  that i think is to be accurate seldom what happens if a man has a genuine hobby it never needs spurring it is in fact unpleasantly apt to run away with him on the smallest provocation are steamboat men addicted to making sketches mr macallister  no said macallister grinning at least its not the usual thing but i once sailed with another of them who did he was second engineer and would draw the chief one day it was very like him so like that it cost the man his job and a wife as well says he how could ye expect me to idealise a man with a mouth like yon  but how did that affect his wife asked the officer  macallister grinned more broadly but it was jacinta he looked at  ye see he said he had not got one then he was second engineer and would have gone chief in a new boat if hed stayed with that company the young woman was ambitious and she told him she would not marry him until he was promoted on principle he was a long while over it after he lost that berth and thenalso on principlehe would not marry her  jacinta laughed though muriel fancied she had seen a momentary hardening of her face  she probably deserved it though one cant help concluding that she wouldnt feel it much she said that is one of the advantages of being a practical person but hadnt you better get the drawings out  macallister took out a sketch in watercolour and held it up it showed a strip of a steamers deck with the softened sunlight beating down through an awning upon a man in skippers uniform who lay cigar in hand in a hammock that swung beneath the spars he was to judge from his expression languidly contented with everything and there was a big glass of ambercoloured liquid on the little table beside him and a tier of bottles laid out upon the deck beneath it ran the legend for men must work  that said jacinta is at least what they tell their wives  the tourist gazed at the drawing and then turned to her he was as she had discovered already a painfully didactic person  the conceit he said is a somewhat happy one though the sketch is it seems to me a little weak in technique as we admitted one difference between a photograph and a painting is that the artist records his own sensations in the latter and stamps it with at least a trace of his individuality in that respect the sketch is i fancy characteristic the artist one could imagine was in full sympathy with his subjectthe far nientebut i am no doubt getting prosy  for no very apparent reason a little flush of colour crept into jacintas face and macallister who saw it chuckled as he took out another sketch  well he said reflectively i never met a man who could do nothing more gracefully than mr austin but ill let ye see the rest of them since theyre in my charge to sell mr austin who wants the money took a sudden notion hed go to africa and if theyve had a quick run hes now humping palm oil puncheons in a stranded steamers hold im thinking it will be a big change for him  the naval officer laughed softly from what i know of the tropics i fancy you are right in fact its rather difficult to imagine the man i met at the bull fight doing that kind of thing at all salvage work is necessarily hard under any circumstances and anywhere but the last place i would care to attempt it in is western africa what senthimthere  ye must not ask me and a little twinkle for which jacinta longed to shake him crept into macallisters eyes now there are clever folks who will look at a man or maybe talk to him awhile and then label him thinking they know just what to expect of him it does him no great harm and it pleases them until one day he does something that astonishes them in spite of his label then theyre apt to get angry with him a man ye see is after all not that unlike an engine ye cannot tell what may be going on in the inside of him and when the results distressing its most often the fault of injudicious handling  jacinta to whom he apparently directed his observations contrived to regard him with a little smile and he proceeded to extricate another sketch a canvas this time  this one is different he said  coulston who apparently concurred with him gazed at the picture with a trace of astonishment it showed a big cargo lancha lurching out deeploaded through a fringe of tumbling surf with four men straining at the ponderous oars the wet rags they wore clung about their limbs and there was weariness in their grim brown faces bent backs and set lips had their significance and the sketch was stamped with the suggestion of endurance and endeavour yet as those who saw it felt there was triumph in it too for while the rollers came seething in to hurl her back the lancha was clawing off the shore  its good said the navy man its unusually good those fellows are played out and they know if they slacken down for a moment shell roll over with them or go up on the beach the seas running in against herone finds out by trying it how hard it is to pull off against a surfbut theyre driving her out presumably thats what you call the motive of the thing  the tourist nodded appreciatively yes he said in spite of certain faults in drawing its well worked out what puzzles me is how the man who did the other one came to feel it as he evidently did one could fancy he had had a revelation and that in some respects he was a different man when he painted this ill offer you five guineas for it mr macallister  then said macallister promptly ye can have it eight guineas for the two if ye would like the other one there are two or three more of them here ye might care to look at he stopped a moment and added as if in explanation im anxious to do what i can for mr austin manys the time ive stole his wine and sold his clothes  he undid a package and first of all took out a photograph of a young girl with a comely english face which jacinta glanced at somewhat sharply then she became intent when there followed several rudimentary pencil and pastel sketches of herself until macallister handed coulston a picture he turned from it to jacinta and looked at her with a steadiness a young woman less accustomed to masculine criticism would probably have found disconcerting  she lay smiling at him in the canvas lounge very pretty and very dainty with conventional indifference expressed even in her pose she was he fancied a woman who knew her world thoroughly and had the greater influence therein because she seldom asked too much from it then he glanced again at her portrait almost incredulously for it showed the little shapely head held well erect the red lips straightened and firmly closed and the glow of a strenuous purpose in the eyes stooping he laid the picture on her knees with a little smile  jacinta laughed softly yes she said of course i know what you mean i am essentially modern and frivolous and not in the least like that still you see all of us have our serious moments now and then although it is probably fortunate they dont last long  ah said coulston wilfully neglecting his opportunity i almost fancy a light breaks in on me one could entitle this inspiration and it is you know possible to transmit it occasionally i wonder whether it would make the idea clearer if we placed the three pictures together mr macallister will permit me  he set up the first sketch of the steamboat skipper against the lifeboat skids and gazed at it critically assuming that a picture contains something of its painters ego you will observe how the idea of petty indulgence and his appreciation of sensual comfort is impressed on one he said now we will set up the other sketch of the sailormen there you see restraint tense effort abnegationand victoryin one sense a spiritual triumph over the body it is an interesting question how the man who painted both could have been brought to grasp what lieutenant onslow calls the motive of the last one but if we might venture to place another picture between  jacinta raised her head sharply and there was an ominous sparkle in her eyes no she said with quiet incisiveness i would sooner you didnt there are certainly men whose hobby now and then runs away with them macallister will you put that portrait back again  she handed it him face downwards for the others had not seen it and lieutenant onslow turned to the tourist  i dont quite understand but i fancy miss brown doesnt approve of vivisection any more than i do he said it really isnt decent to turn anybody inside out  i wonder said coulston ignoring him if you would mind my offering to buy the three  he was looking steadily at her but jacinta contrived for a moment to catch macallisters eye so swift was the flashed glance that the tourist did not notice it but jacinta could convey a good deal with a look and the engineer was a man of considerable intelligence  that one is not for sale he said  no said onslow who held up a strip of pasteboard and a sheet of brown paper i scarcely think it is in fact you dont appear to have noticed that theres a seal on this part of it and instructions that this particular packet is not to be opened  it seemed to muriel that a trace of colour once more crept into jacintas face but macallister surveyed the wrappings the officer handed him with a grin  it is not that difficult to slice a seal off and stick it back again he said its also a thing mr austin should have remembered many a garafon of wine has he seen opened  so you know that trick onslow laughed im inclined to think its one that has now and then been practised upon our mess  just then mrs hatherly appeared on deck and the group broke up muriel joined her aunt macallister accompanied by the tourist went down the ladder with the box of sketches under his arm while jacinta and lieutenant onslow were left alone the latter stood with his hand on the lifeboat skids looking down on her gravely he was a wellfavoured young man with an honest sunbronzed face  i am he said as you know going out to take over command of a westcoast gunboat in a day or two and it is more than probable that i shall not have an opportunity like this again you see nasmyth and i have had a very good time in these islands and we feel that we owe it largely to you in fact its perfectly clear to us that things would have been very different if you hadnt taken us under your gracious protection i just want to say that we recognise it and feel grateful  well said jacinta reflectively i am rather glad you do gratitude that is worth anything carries a certain sense of obligation with it  of course and onslow smiled only give me the chance of doing anything i can for you  do you know whereabouts on the westcoast the delgado island lies  i can readily find out  jacinta glanced at him sharply and had no doubt concerning the eagerness in his face if there was anything he could do to please her it would certainly be done  there is a stranded steamer somewhere up a creek behind that island and i think the men who are trying to salve her have a good many difficulties to contend with among other things i fancy the niggers are worrying them  ah said onslow our ships are not as a rule permitted to take any part in commercial ventures but there are of course exceptions to everything according to my instructions i am also to avoid all unpleasantness with the seaboard niggers unless they have been provoking the authorities still i would like to ask if any of the men on board that steamer is a friend of yours  one of them is miss gascoynes affianced lover and she is a very old friend indeed however since you are apparently unable  onslow checked her with a little smile im not sure you are really willing to let me off and if you were i shouldnt be pleased while i scarcely think you have answered my question very frankly either that however doesnt matter it is permissible for the commander of a coast patrol gunboat to send a pinnace in to survey a little known creek or channel and her crew would of course be guided by circumstances if they came upon a stranded steamer  i presume you would not care to earn muriels undying gratitude by being a trifle more definite  no said onslow with twinkling eyes i esteem miss gascoynes good opinion but i really couldnt go any further to win yours as i pointed out one would be guided by circumstances but men on board stranded steamers have been supplied with drugs and provisions as well as lent naval artificers to advise them as to repairs i have even heard of a gunboats launch carrying out their hawsers and anchors  jacinta rose with a little smile i think one could leave it with confidence to your discretion and since it seems very likely that you will come across that steamer i should be pleased to have your views as to the selection of a few comforts and provisions  onslow favoured her with them and as it happened met macallister when at last he went down the ladder  ye are going out to africa too said the latter with a grin she has been giving ye sailing instructions  onslow looked at him grimly well he said what the devil has that to do with you  oh nothing just nothing at all still because i see ye are willing i would have ye know that there aretwomen from grand canary on board yon steamer already  onslow smiled a trifle drily my dear man im not altogether an ass he said  in the meanwhile muriel strolled back towards jacinta and glanced at her with a suggestion of astonishment in her face as she sat down  you are different from what you were a little while ago she said  jacinta laughed i daresay i am i had as a matter of fact sunk into a state of pessimistic apathy which naturally found expression in illhumoured pleasantries lately but i have been getting to work again it has rather a bracing effect you see in the meanwhile it might be advisable for you to make yourself as nice as possible to lieutenant onslow who is now coming up on deck again go and ask him to show you a flying fish or something  muriel went for she had discovered that there was usually a sufficient reason for most of what jacinta did and the latter lay still in her chair  there is she said still a fly in the amber i wonder what he wanted with that photograph though after all he didnt think it worth while carrying to africa     chapter xxii  funnelpaints proposition   deep stillness hung over the dingy mangroves and there was not a breath of air astir while austin who lay among the palm oil puncheons beside the creek was oppressed by a sense of suffocation a few yards away two spaniards lay apparently asleep huddled shapeless heaps of ragged clothing beneath a strip of tarpaulin raised on poles and it was then though there was no sun visible a little past the hottest part of the afternoon a yellow vapour that seemed suffused with heat had obscured the heavens for a week or more and the swamps lay sweltering beneath it waiting for the rain austin longed for it ardently for there was an almost unendurable tension in the atmosphere  he had shaken off the fever but he was worn and dazed by toil for the strain was not without its effect upon him and he had become subject to curious tricks of fancy he had brought the coal from dakar and it now lay piled upon a down river beach but he had obtained only two or three men and the steamy heat of the swamp belt had melted the sustaining energy out of the cumbrias company individually he felt that it was a hopeless struggle they were making they had untrammelled nature against them and he could almost fancy the malevolent spirits of the bush the negroes believed in a man he admitted could believe in anything in that country and he had of late been troubled by a feeling that something sinister and threatening was hovering near him  he was unpleasantly conscious of it then which was partly why he lay raised on his elbow with his eyes fixed on the bush that shut in the narrow strip of land it rose before him laced with tangled creepers mysterious and shadowy and it seemed to him that somebody or something was watching him from its dim recesses he had been conscious of the same sensation when he plodded with a spanish seaman along the narrow trail to the dug up beach an hour earlier but it was stronger now and instinctively he slipped his hand into a pocket where the pistol he had bought in grand canary lay then he laughed in a listless fashion for they had seen no more of the negroes since the blowing up of the headmans house and he felt that he had not them to fear there was in fact no tangible cause for apprehension at all  presently something seemed to materialise amidst the shadows where the creepers streamed from a cottonwood in dense festoons and lying still with fingers closing on the pistol he could almost fancy he made out a dim human form there was at least one black patch among the leaves that suggested greasy naked skin it vanished again however and austin who felt his heart beating abused the intolerable glare the sand flung up that dazzled his vision and then stiffened himself in tenser watchfulness as for a moment he made out a pair of rolling eyes the creepers rustled a twig snapped and he was about to call out when one of the canarios raised himself a trifle  ave maria he said with drowsy hoarseness and though the words are frequently used to express astonishment in his country it was evident that he meant them as a pious appeal  in any case the creepers became suddenly still again and austin who rose a trifle stiffly found nothing when he pushed his way through the midst of them there was no sound in the steamy bush not a leaf seemed bruised or bent and he went back again with the perspiration dripping from him nevertheless he was annoyed to notice that the canario was watching him curiously  nothing he said with a dramatic gesture nothing that one can see  what do you mean asked austin sharply  the canario flung out an arm again who knows though one cannot see it it comes now and then there are evil things in this land of the devil and the saints are very far away this is no place for them  austin sat down again and took out his pipe he felt that there was nothing to be gained by continuing the discussion for of late he had become almost superstitiously apprehensive himself he lay watching the bush for another hour and then though it was the last thing he had intended went to sleep he had borne a heavy strain and his will was weakening  it was dark when he was awakened by a splash of paddles as the cumbrias surfboat crept up the creek with the relief watch and another hour had passed when they made the craft fast alongside the gangway and climbed wearily on board the steamer there was no sound or light on board her for half the crew were sick and the pump had stopped she lay a black mass amidst the sliding mist and he stumbled over the kernel bags upon her slanted deck as he groped his way to his room in the poop it was seldom he or jefferson slept soundly now and as they only awakened each other austin had moved to a room aft  he lighted the oil lamp and flung himself dressed as he was into his berth but found he could not sleep though he could not remember how long he lay awake listening he could hear mysterious splashings in the forest and the low gurgle of the creek while now and then a timber creaked or a drop of moisture fell from the iron beams with a splash that startled him at last when his eyes were growing heavy there was a different and very faint sound on deck and as he raised himself the door that stood a little open swung back gently the lamp was still burning for he found the light comforting as white men are occasionally apt to do in that country and it was with a little gasp of relief he felt for the pistol beneath his pillow as funnelpaint came in he was almost naked and the water ran from him but the strip of cloth about his loins was bound by a leather belt with a sheath hung to it such as seamen wear and the knife from the latter gleamed in his wet hand he however dropped it upon the deck and squatted on the waterledge that rose a foot beneath the door austin watched him quietly for he was at least not afraid of funnelpaint  what the devil do you want he said  halluf them gum said the negro with a wicked grin  how are we to give it you when we havent found a bag of it  the negro grinned again spose i done tell you where him lib  if you knew why didnt you get it for yourself  funnelpaint shook his head them book i got savvyi no savvy make him tell me he said you dash me halluf them gum you get them book  austin lay silent resting on one elbow for a moment or two he knew that book means anything which is written on in that country and it occurred to him that if the gum had been hidden ashore it was very probable that the man who buried it had made a rough sketch or other record of the spot the document it was conceivable might have come into the negros possession still he was suspicious  theres another boy who speaks english in the headmans village he said  him only dam bushmanno savvy book no savvy anyting him them headmans boy headman he want everyting  ah said austin who was more dubious about his visitors good faith than ever since it was clear that it was his intention to trick his confederate out of his share of the plunder i suppose since you swam off you havent the book about you  the negro let one eyelid droop a little you tink black man one dam fool  no said austin reflectively if you understand me i should rather call you an infernal rogue any way you lib for get out one time and come back tomorrow ill palaver with them other white man by then savvy  funnelpaint unobtrusively laid a wet prehensile toe upon the haft of the knife but austin who was careful not to betray the fact noticed it  them other white man he do go dash me anyting he said decisively i savvy him spose you done tell him you no go catch them book  then how do you fancy im going to give you half the gum without his knowing  funnelpaint grinned unpleasantly bimeby them white cappy man he die he said as though he were sure of it white man sick too much in dis country i savvy  austin contrived to hold in check the indignant wrath he felt a mans life he was quite aware was worth very little in those swamps and because he placed some small value on the one that belonged to him it was evidently advisable to proceed circumspectly funnelpaint was he recognised a diplomatist in his way and had said very little though that was sufficient to show austin what his proposition meant it was at least clear that he was to ask no questions if anything unexpected happened to jefferson and in reward of this he would be permitted to carry off half the gum it appeared that funnelpaint was sure of its existence or he would never have ventured to creep on board at night at all and austin decided that since he certainly could not be trusted the boldest course was best the rage he felt also prompted him to it and he lay still considering with a hand beneath the pillow and a flush in his face while the negro squatted huge and motionless on the doorledge watching him with a little cunning smile it seemed to austin that it would simplify matters considerably if he could secure funnelpaints person though he could not quite see how it was to be done especially since it was evident that the negro would be no use to them dead  in the meanwhile there was deep stillness without intensified by the oily gurgle of the creek until austin fancied he heard another faint and stealthy sound on deck funnelpaint did not appear to notice it which was it seemed to austin significant for he sat still though with a scarcely perceptible motion he drew the knife a little nearer to him with his toe austin decided that the proposition he had made was after all probably a blind and the friends he had expected were now arriving  keep still he said abruptly whipping out the pistol  the negro started and would apparently have fallen backwards in his alarm had he not seized the edge of the cushion on the settee in a wet hand then he gazed at austin as though in bewilderment or consternation  bushman lib he said  he glanced towards the open ring of the port and for a second austin turned his eyes in the same direction but that was long enough for the big cushion of the settee fell upon his head and he rolled over under it it was a moment or two before he had flung it from him and sprung out of his berth and then there was no sign of funnelpaint though he could hear a rush of feet and the sound of a scuffle on deck they were also booted feet and austin ran out into the black darkness beneath the poop he could see nothing for a moment but he heard a hoarse ejaculation that was followed by a splash in the creek then a shadowy figure grew out of the blackness and he dropped the pistol to his side at the sound of an english voice  all right mr austin it said  i am said austin is that you bill  the halfseen man assured him that it was and then followed him back into the lighted room where he sat down and held up a hand from which a red trickle dripped down his arm  the dam brutes got away he said praps you could fix this up for me  austin lugged a little chest out from under the settee and glanced at the injured hand nothing serious though i have no doubt it stings he said you were in one sense lucky in getting it there how did you happen to come along  it was my watch said bill i had just come down from the bridgedeck when i thought i heard talking and that brought me here as quietly as i could if id had the sense to take my boots off id have had him i gripped him by the rail but he shoved the knife into my hand and slung himself over  austin bound his hand up and then looked at him thoughtfully  i dont think theres anything to be gained by letting the others know he said any way id consider it a favour if you said nothing about the thing until ive talked it over with mr jefferson  bill grinned comprehendingly ill tell tom but nobody else we have our own little row with the vermin and the next time i get my grip on him therell be an end of him  he went out and by and by austin contrived to go to sleep while it was next day and they sat in the dripping engine room from which the water was sinking when he told jefferson what had passed the latter listened thoughtfully and then broke into a little hollow laugh  it seems to me that you missed your chance he said funnelpaint knows a good deali have guessed that for some timebut he has found out he cant get at the gum without one of us helping him at last that is probably why he has left us alone so long he wasnt sure whether there was any of it on board the ship and was naturally willing that we should decide that point for him  what would he gain by that asked austin  the gum and jefferson laughed again but not pleasantly hes an inconsequent devil but he seems to have scraped up a little sense as he went on with the game you see white men are apt to die off suddenly in this country and i scarcely think that anybody who could make trouble knows were here any way theres no unusual need for worry it only means double watches  still one could fancy you had a good deal on your mind  i have we have stripped this ship all but the engine room to the ballast tanksthere was you may remember a manhole lid lifted on the forward one which may account for some of the water getting inand the five hundred dollars i raised the offer to hasnt produced a pound of gum half the men are down now and we cant send them all away while even if we wanted to theyre most of them unwilling to go theyre as keen on their shareand its quite a big oneas i am then well have the rains on us in a week or two  austin sat silent awhile he knew that the feverish search for the treasure had stirred the cupidity of the latins until they were as determined on finding it as their leader nothing else was thought of the sick men raved of it and in any case those who had held out so long and staunchly had their percentage on the value of the steamers hull and cargo to gain it meant comparative affluence to the barefooted sailormen that however was only one side of the question after all for while their willingness was evident their physical capacity for work was lessening every day  the rains will flood every beach he said if we dont find the gum before they come what then  if its necessary well stay here until the water falls again that is at least some of us will  austin rose up slowly with a little sign of comprehension two men had been buried while he was away and he did not think that many of them would be left there to see the waters fall     chapter xxiii  funnelpaint moves again   a week had slipped by since the negros visit and austin and jefferson were sitting late in the skippers room there had been no change in the weather and it was then if possible hotter than ever the muggy land breeze had died away and a thick woolly mist shut the stranded steamer in door and ports were open wide but the oil lamp that hung beneath the beams burned unwaveringly and the ray of light that streamed out from the doorway made the blackness outside more apparent the big pump was running behind the deckhouse and its deep vibratory humming rang startlingly through a stillness so intense that it seemed unnatural as it hurled the water out of the engine room  austin sat huddled in a corner attired only in duck trousers and torn singlet which came no lower than his elbows and for want of buttons fell open at his neck he had an unusually clean skin and his sunscorched lower arms and scarred hands with the battered knuckles and broken nails emphasised by contrast the clear whiteness of his halfcovered chest that night it was beaded with perspiration for which he was sincerely thankful since there are times in the tropics when the healing moisture fails to find its way through the fevered skin and its afflicted owner burns in torment  jefferson sat on the little table a blackened pipe in his hand and the listless pose of both suggested that the last trace of energy had been sapped out of them at last austin laughed hollowly and dejectedly  i dont know why were sitting here saying nothing when we have to begin again at five oclock tomorrow but i dont feel like sleep he said in fact i scarcely think ive slept for more than a couple of hours at a time since i came back again i suppose i ought to be in the forecastle nowfour or five of them seemed very sick when i last looked inbut theres an abominable tension in the air that makes any exertion out of the question  jefferson nodded you cant do anything for them and theres nobody we could spare to send with them down river he said theyve got to take their chances with the rest of us now and it seems to me one might figure them out as three or four to one if the rains dont come still if you dont want to do anything why cant you keep still  i dont know and austin who had been rolling a damp cigar in his fingers flung it down if that pump stopped i should probably make an exhibition of myself the hum and thump it makes has a soothing effect on me its suggestive even here man has something to say i dont know whether you understand me  jefferson looked at him curiously i guess i do id mix myself a good strong pickmeup if i were you you have had something on your mind the last day or two  i have said austin im afraid of that infernal funnelpaint i think i cant help a fancy that we havent done with him yet and though the connection isnt very apparent the fact that the first thing we came across after landing when i came out was a dead nigger insists on obtruding itself on my recollection bill told me he was singularly unpleasant to look at  jefferson contrived to laugh you take that pickmeup and in the meanwhile let up on your reminiscences things of that kind arent cheerfuland im worried by one or two of them myself  austin who stooped and picked up the cigar settled himself afresh on the settee after lighting it and half an hour dragged by neither of them felt the least sign of drowsiness yet and the jingle of the odds and ends in the rack and tremble of the stout teak house was as he had said vaguely reassuring the big pump was pounding on in spite of the climate and neither heat nor fever had any effect on steam then he looked up sharply and jefferson straightened himself for a faint sound of footsteps came out of the darkness they were slow and dragging as though somebody was groping his way warily towards the light  on deck said the american what dyou want are you there walleye que hay  there was no answer but the shuffling steps drew nearer slowly and falteringly as though whatever made them was but indifferently capable of motion there was also something unpleasantly suggestive about them and austin now sat very straight while he saw that jeffersons lips were pressed together there was no apparent reason why they should shrink from what was coming but austin at least felt his nerves tingling he was overwrought and white men are apt to become fanciful when they work too hard in the fever swamps it is a land where one realises the presence of influences beyond the definition of human reason and he afterwards admitted that he was afraid  mil diablos said jefferson ven aca what are you after outside there  there was still no answer though a clatter of booted feet now rose from the iron deck it drowned the other footfalls and austin found that clang of nailed shoes curiously reassuring then a figure that swayed from side to side emerged from the blackness and stood mowing in the stream of light  good lord said jefferson with horror in his voice slam that door to keep it out  austin rose with a sense of sudden sickness but the figure had moved again and now stood with one foot inside the room and a horrible hand on the doorjamb leering at them it had the shape of a man but the resemblance ended there for there was no sign of human intelligence in the awful face the thing had no eyebrows the hair had almost gone and nose and cheeks were formless with corruption while naked chest and arms were smeared with festering scars austin stood still shivering with one hand clenched hard on the table until jefferson snatched a glinting object from his bunk  good lord he said again its coming in  the figure seemed to brace itself for another move forwards and austin saw jefferson straighten himself slowly with a big pistol in his hand he did not remember what his comrade said but the negro seemed to recoil instinctively before his fierce ejaculation and lurching backwards faded into a formless shadow in the gloom again then jeffersons hand fell upon austins shoulder  shake yourself theres something to be done he said they have a light forward and we cant havethat thinggroping among them in the forecastle  they went out and as they did so a sudden glare of light sprang up tom the donkeyman had lighted the airblast lamp he used when anything had to be done to pump or boiler at night and its smoky radiance showed that jeffersons shouts had roused the spaniards they were clustered half dressed about the head of the ladder which led to the bridge deck with consternation in their shadowy faces glancing at one another as though afraid to move a step further tom leaned against the rail holding up the lamp and the thing that had the shape of a man sat gibbering on a coil of hawser in the midst of the bridge deck the eyes of all who stood there were fixed upon it but nobody seemed anxious to come any nearer  jefferson standing very straight opened the breech of his pistol ran a finger across the back of the chamber and then closed it with a little snap which though the pump was humming sounded startlingly distinct his lips were tightly set and his face was very grim the loathsome figure on the rope mowed and grinned at him  i suppose the thing was humanonce he said still we cant have it here these complaints are contagious one understands but i wish it hadnt happened hes too like a man  he dropped the pistol to his side as though his nerve had momentarily failed him and austin who suddenly grasped his purpose sprang forward as he raised it again  hold on he said do you realise what it is you propose to do  jefferson turned to him slowly and there was a curious stillness among those who watched them austin was glad of the hum of the big pump and the pounding of the engine for he felt that silence would have made the tension unendurable then jefferson smiled a little wry smile  i know he said a trifle hoarsely it isnt nice to think of but its no more than happens to a superfluous kittenand its necessary heaven knows what the poor devil suffered before he came to this and we dont want to hes animate carrion without reason or sensibility now it was only the light brought him here when funnelpaint somehow sent him within sight of us  austin saw that this was true there was no glimmer of human intelligence in the creatures wandering gaze but he still bore the shape of a man and that counted for a good deal after all  jefferson he said it cant be done  his comrade looked at him with halfclosed eyes would you wish to live if you looked like that or do you want the rest of us to find out what he went through im responsible for those men yonderand its only antedating the thing a month or two the life is almost rotted out of him stand clear we must get it over  it was evident that the spaniards understood what he meant to do and a murmur of concurrence rose from them for they knew a little about the more loathsome forms of skin diseases men who might have escaped from the sepulchre walk abroad in the hot southern countries where restraint is unknown and salt fish is a staple food but though they have often themselves to blame the innocent also suffer in western africa and none of those who stood by tense and strung up had ever seen a man who looked quite as this one did  then as jefferson raised his pistol austin seized him by the shoulder and shook him in a sudden outbreak of fury  youre right he said but you shall not do it you hear me put the  thing down  then there was a sudden clamour and as the canarios ran forward jefferson struggled vainly austin never knew where his strength came from but in another moment the pistol slipped from his comrades hand and reeling backwards he struck the deckhouse austin stood in front of him with hands clenched and the veins swollen high on his forehead panting hard  it has come to this he said if you move a step ill heave you over the rail ive strength enough to break your back tonight  jefferson straightened himself slowly and waved back the others who were clustering round then he smiled and made a little gesture of resignation  i believe you have but thats not quite the point he said its the only thing you have ever asked me and if nothing else will satisfy you you shall have him you dont suppose it isnt a relief to me the question is what youre going to do with him you see he cant stay here  that at least was evident and for a moment or two austin gazed about him stupidly as he grappled with the difficulty the stricken man still squatted unconcerned upon the hawser mowing and grimacing while he clawed at the hemp in a fashion that suggested the antics of a pleased animal with swollen hands the rest stood still well apart from him with expectancy overcoming the repulsion they felt then tom the donkeyman who was nearest the rail held up his flaring lamp  theres the canoe he come in still alongside aft he said  austin gasped with relief heave down a bunch of the red bananas we got up the creek he said hell know they are good to eat  it was done and jefferson smiled again grimly  that he said is easy still have you figured how he is to be gotten into the canoe you are hardly going to make him understand what he is to do  theres only one way he must be put into it under the circumstances its only fitting that i should undertake the thing  no and jeffersons voice rang sharply not you offer any of the rest of them fifty dollars  austin smiled to take a risk im responsible for i think not i went sufficiently far when i brought some of them here besides its comforting to remember you maynt be right about the thing being contagious after all  jefferson looked at him hard a moment with the fingers of one hand closed and then made a little sign  well he said if you feel it that way theres probably nothing to be gained by protesting there are disadvantages in being leader  austin turned and touched the negro with his foot while he pointed to the ladder  get up you lib for canoe one time he said  the negro mowed and gibbered meaninglessly and austin stooping grasped his shoulder which was clean with an effort he dragged him to his feet and while the rest fell back from them drove the man towards the head of the ladder then one of them slipped and there was a cry of horror from the rest as the negro clutched the white man and they rolled down the ladder into the darkness below together tom ran towards the rail with his lamp and as jefferson leaned out from them he saw austin shake off the negros engirdling grasp  get up he said hoarsely and stirred him with his foot again  the man rose half upright stumbled and straightening himself moved towards the open gangway with a lurch then he vanished suddenly and there was a crash below austin leaned out through the opening and his voice rose harsh and strained  come down one of you and cut this warp the devils hanging on he said  walleye the canario sprang down with his knife and when austin climbed back to the bridge deck the men clustering along the rails saw a canoe with a shadowy object lying in the stern of her slide through the blaze of radiance cast by the blastlamp and vanish into the blackness outside it then tom put out the light and a hoarse murmur of relief rose out of the darkness  a minute or two later austin stood a trifle grey in face in the doorway of the skippers room and stepped back suddenly when jefferson approached him  keep off he said give me the permanganate out of the side drawer i left it there miguel bring me the clothes you washed out of my room in the poop and fill me a bucket  the last was in castilian and one of the canarios went scrambling down the ladder while when he came back with an armful of duck clothing jefferson held out a jar to his comrade  no said austin sharply put it down  jefferson did as he was bidden and austin who stripped the thin garments from him and flung them over the rail shook the permanganate into the bucket and then standing stark naked when it had dissolved sluiced himself all over with the pink solution it was ten minutes later when he stepped into the room dripping with a wet rag about his waist and shook his head when jefferson handed him a towel  i think not he said if theres any efficacy in the thing i may as well let it dry in after all its consoling to remember that it maynt be necessary  jeffersons fingers quivered as he leaned upon the table no of course not he said and added inconsequently i dont think im unduly sensitive but a very little thing would turn me deadly sick  austin struggled into his duck trousers and jefferson whose face was also a little more pallid than usual glanced at him again  you have a beautiful skin he said its most like a womans theres good clean blood in you  its one of my few good points and austins smile suggested comprehension i havent been particularly indulgent in any direction considering my opportunities and im rather glad of it now one could fancy that the man who seldom let one slip would be unusually apt to get the promised wages in this country  he dragged his singlet over his arms and a little twinkle slowly crept into jeffersons eyes  well he said you carry your character with you how long has the restraining influence been at work on you  you are a little outside the mark and a faint flush showed in austins hollow cheeks i am as you know not a believer in the unnecessary mortification of the flesh but theres a trace of the artistic temperament if thats the right name for it in me and its rather apt to make one finickingly dainty  jefferson smiled drily that doesnt go quite far enough ive seen men of your kind wallow harder than the rest still whatever kept you from it you can be thankful now  austin went on with his dressing and then took a little medical treatise out of a drawer he spent some time turning over it before he looked up  theres nothing that quite fits the thing here and from what the westcoast mailboat men told me crawcraw must be different he said in the meanwhile it wouldnt do any harm to soak myself in black coffee  he was about to go out when jefferson stopped him this is a thing that is better buried but theres something to be said from my point of view and its that of the average sensible man i was right but yours goes higher and in one way i am glad of it i just want to tell you im satisfied with my partner  austin smiled at him well both be guilty of some sentimental nonsense we may be sorry for afterwards if we continue in that strain my friend still theres one thing to consider although i couldnt help it what i did was of course absurd if you look at it practically and things of that kind have their results occasionally  jefferson seemed to shiver and then clenched a hard scarred fist  we wont think of it your bloods clean he said but if after all trouble comesill get even with that damned funnelpaint if i spend my life in africa trailing him and have to kill him with my naked hands     chapter xxiv  austin finds a clue   the grey light was growing clearer and the mangroves taking shape among the fleecy mist when austin stood looking down upon the creek in the heavy windless morning there was no brightness in the dingy sky which hung low above the mastheads but the water gleamed curiously and no longer lapped along the steamers rusty plates it lay still beneath her hoveup bilge giving up a hot sour smell and jefferson who came out of the skippers room touched austin as he gazed at it  the stream should have been setting down by now somethings backing up the ebb he said a shift of wind along the shore most likely the rains coming  austin glanced up at the lowering heavens but there was no change in their uniform greyness and no drift of cloud the smoke of the locomotive boiler went straight up and the mist hung motionless among the trees ashore still there was something oppressive and portentous in the stillness and his skin was tingling  if it doesnt come soon well not have a man left he said it isnt in flesh and blood to stand this much longer  then said jefferson drily the sooner we get to work the better theres a good deal to do and youre not going to feel it quite so much once you get hold of the spanner  the pump had just stopped and tom came towards them rubbing his greasy hands with a cotton rag as they moved in the direction of the engine room the lower part of it was dripping when they went down and a foot or two of water still lay upon the floorplates where they met the depressed side but it was evident that another hours work of the big pump would leave the place almost dry austin sat down on a toollocker lid with jefferson standing beside him but tom floundered away towards the stokehold and they could hear him splashing in the water when he reappeared with a blinking lamp he crawled up the slippery ladder as though working out a clue while it was several minutes before he came back and leaned against a column opposite jefferson with the look of a man who had not found quite what he had expected  seacocks shut he said ballast tank fullway cock is screwed up too of course they could have closed that with the overhead screwgear youll remember that manhole cover was off the forward section  jefferson glanced at austin though it was tom he spoke to did you expect to find them open  well said the donkeyman to be quite straight i did  i wonder why  tom glanced at him with a little suggestive grin she has two plates started but with the boiler blowing away half her steam we havent very hard work to run all that came in that way down and her bilge pump would have kept her clear what i want to know is what all that water was doing in her  ah said jefferson you must ask another i guess nobodys going to find the full answer to that conundrum there are only two or three men who could have told us and were not going to have an opportunity of worrying them about it unless we get the fever too  well said tom the mills looking good but its about time we made a start on her and got the cylinder covers off and hove the pistons up its quite likely well want to spring new rings on them there should be some of the spanners in that locker mr austin  austin rose and lifted the lid while tom held the lamp but the first thing he saw was a sodden book he drew it out dripping and opened it but while a good many of the pulpy pages had fallen out there were enough left to show that it was one of the little tables of strengths and weight of materials an engineer often carries about with him there was a rather wide margin round the tabulated figures and as he vacantly pulled out one of the wet pages he noticed a little close pencil writing upon a part of it  hold that light nearer tom heres something that looks interesting he said buried jackson this morningmemo hand his share over to mary nichol  he signed tom to move the light again there follows an obliterated address and the words scarcely think shell ever get it my left arms almost rotten now  he stopped again a moment and his face had grown hard when he went on you see the thingiscontagious and that devil funnelpaint or somebody has played the same trick before i wonder if the man who wrote this looked quite as bad as the nigger did  hold on said jefferson sharply i guess none of us have any use for that kind of talking and you swilled yourself with permanganate any way  the result will probably be the same whether one thinks of it or not you will however notice that the mans name was jackson and the womans mary nicol  it was evident that this was a forced attempt to break away from the subject and though tom grinned it was in a sickly fashion  thats no how astonishing she was the last he said hadnt you better turn over and see if theres any more of it  austin contrived to lift another of the pulpy pages and once more the close writing appeared but it was difficult to make out and their faces were close together when tom lowered the lamp they showed curiously grave as well as hollow in the smoky light for there was reason for believing that the man who had made those notes was dead and it was clear that the horrible thing which had stricken him might also come upon them  the last of the bags buried this afternoon austin read watson took a new bearing w half n to the cottonwood with twist of creek in line forty paceshe made it thirtynine graham says one packet left in the old place where the niggers got scent of it and the quills on the second islet memo it makes Â£50 to me  he dropped the book and tom came near letting go the lamp while for a moment or two afterwards they stared at one another austin was quivering a little but jefferson made a restraining gesture as he laid a hand upon his shoulder  steady i guess weve got the clue he said there are two islets two or three leagues back down the creek you passed them coming up still what do they put up in quills  golddust the niggers bring it down from the western soudan and i believe theyre ostrich quills one of the trader fellows told me a good deal about them over a dinner at the metropole a bushman had once stuck him with a lot of brass filings are you going down to look for them  jefferson it was evident from his face laid a strong restraint upon himself  no he said with curious quietness funnelpaint knows nothing about these islets yet or he wouldnt have come to you and its my first business to heave this steamer off to do it well want her engines and theres a heavy job in front of us before we start them the rains wont wait for any man  he broke off for a glare of blue light fell through the open frames above and flooded the engine room it flickered on rusty columns and dripping discoloured steel and vanished leaving grey shadow behind it amidst which the smoky lamplight showed feeble and pale then there was a crash that left them dazed and deafened and in another moment was followed by a dull crescendo roar while a splashing trickle ran down into the engine room the glass frames quivered under the deluge and one could almost have fancied that the heavens had opened jefferson whirled round and gripped the donkeymans arm shaking him as he stood blinking about him in a bewildered fashion  if you tell any of the rest what you have heard ill fling you into the creek and now up with you and bring every man who is fit to work theres no time to lose he said  tom made for the ladder and austin who went with him carrying the book was drenched before he reached the skippers room the air was filled with falling water that came down in rods and blotted out the mangroves a dozen yards away steam rose from the sluicing deck the creek boiled beneath the deluge but there was no longer any trace of the insufferable tension and he stood a moment or two relaxing under the rush of lukewarm water that beat his thin clothing flat against his skin then he splashed forward to the forecastle where tom had little difficulty in rousing the men they crawled out gaunt and haggard in filthy rags some of them apparently scarcely fit to stand for the rain had come and every inch the water rose would bring them so much nearer home there was no need to urge them when they floundered into the engine room and hour after hour they strained and sweated on big spanner and chaintackle willingly while the big cylinderheads and pistons were hauled up to the beams the one thought which animated them was that the engines would be wanted soon  it mattered little that platformgrating and slippery floorplates slanted sharply under them and each ponderous mass they loosened must be held in with guy and preventer lest it should swing wildly into vertical equilibrium that was only one more difficulty and they had already beaten down so many so day after day they worked on sloping platforms slipping with naked feet and only grinned when tom flung foul epithets and now and then a hammer at one of them much of what he said was incomprehensible and in any case he was lord supreme of the machinery and bill whose speech was also vitriolic acted as his working deputy the latter had served as greaser in another steamer and for the time being even jefferson deferred to him  they stripped her until the big cylinders stood naked on their columns and the engine room resembled the erecting shop of a foundry and then the work grew harder when the reassembling began since the skeleton engines slanted nothing would hang or lower as they wanted it and they toiled with wedge and lever in semidarkness by the blinking gleam of lamps while the rain that shut the light out roared upon the shutdown frames above it was very hot down in the engine room and when a small forge was lighted to expand joints they could not spring apart and to burn off saponified grease men with less at stake would probably have fancied themselves suffocated still each massive piece was cleaned and polished keyed home or bolted fast and when the hardest work was over the slope of the platforms lessened little by little as the cumbria rose upright it was evident to all of them that the water was rising in the creek  in a month her deck was almost leveled but the muddy flood that gurgled about her still lay beneath her corroded water line and jefferson seized the opportunity of laying out an anchor to heave on before the stream ran too strong the launchs boiler had given out and they lashed her to the surfboat with the hatch covers as a bracing between but they spent an afternoon over it before jefferson was satisfied and the thick steamy night was closing in when they warped the double craft under the cumbrias forecastle it rose above them blackly with a blaze of flickering radiance over it where the blastlamp hurled a shaft of fire upwards into the rain floundering figures cut against the uncertain brilliancy voices came down muffled through the deluge and there was a creaking and groaning as the ponderous stream anchor swung out overhead  austin stood half naked on the platform between launch and surfboat with the water sluicing from him and though he had toiled since early dawn he was sensible only of a feverish impatience and no weariness at all he had had enough of the dark land and what they were about to do was to ensure a start on the journey that would take them out of it it grew rapidly darker the long hull faded and the flare of the lamp alone cut a sheet of orange and saffron against the blackness above them jeffersons voice fell through it sharply  stand by he said well ease her down  there was a fresh groaning and creaking something big and shadowy that racked the complaining chain descended towards them and then there was a scuffle and a shout on the deck above austin heard the rattle of running chain and a hoarse cry  jump on it jeffersons voice ran out fierce with alarm nip the slack around the bollard hang on oh hang on until he gets a turn  feet shuffled about the light there was stertorous gasping another cry and a scream and again jeffersons voice broke through the confused sounds  stand from underfor your life it said  the warning was unnecessary for the canarios were already crouching forward in the surfboats bottom and as austin sprang in among them there was a whirr and a crash the craft swayed beneath him he could feel her dipping in the flood but she rose with a staggering lurch slanted slightly and held down by something huge and heavy  are you still on top there jefferson asked  we seem to be said austin somethings gone but its too dark to see how dyou come to let her go with a run  walleye let her surge too soon said jefferson he was getting an extra turn on and nipped his hand in she has most wrung it off him handspike your anchor where you can tilt her clear before we slack cable  they contrived to do it somehow with the flare that was lowered from the catdavit dropping blazing oil about them and then coiled down a length of the ponderous cable one of the twin craft was tilted to the waters edge now and still the massive iron links came clanking down then as the last fell with a crash jefferson leaned out over the rails above  bend the wire on below the break youll want a clear link for the shackle when we couple her up he said hang on to your anchor until youre in the mangroves on the other bank we want to heave towards deep water out in the stream  more barefooted men came swinging down the hanging wire and they slid away into the blackness bumping against the steamers plates the twin craft were topheavy and lurched in the grip of the stream it was a minute or two before they had cleared the cumbria and by then they were almost under her quarter while when they had crept away from her a fathom or two all of them knew there was a task in front of them that would severely tax all their strength  they had the uncoiling wire rope to drag them back into line the stream swept them down a fathom for every one they made ahead and as ill luck would have it bore upon the launchs pressed down side so that they could hear the water gurgling into her in ever faster swirl still they had to reach the opposite bank or be hauled back to commence the task again and gasping and panting they heaved on the wet rope that led into the rain ahead most of them were used to work of that kind but during the first five minutes austin felt his arms grow weary and nerveless and the veins distend on his forehead while a curious singing commenced in his ears he choked with every fresh grasp he laid upon the rope and a canario behind him gasped out breathless snatches of castilian obscenity  still in spite of all they could do the blaze of red light leaping in the rain showed that they were making nothing and now and then the rope ran out again through their clinging hands there was no sign of the mangroves on the opposite bank while the tilt of the platform grew steeper and it was evident that the launch was filling under them then little by little the wire rope that ran out into the darkness astern commenced to curvethey could hear the swirl of the stream across itand after another five minutes tense effort they swung into a slacker flow or reflex eddy there was however no slackening of the strain and it was not until a dim black wall rose up above them that austin loosed his grasp upon the rope and floundering and stumbling in the rain and darkness they strove to clear the anchor  it went over with a mighty splash the platform rose with a jerk under them then as they backed clear there was a rattle of cable and they seized the wire the lashed craft swung like a pendulum athwart the stream the rattling winch hauled them back fathom by fathom to the cumbria while when he had crawled on board her austin dropped limply and a trifle grey in face on to the settee in the skippers room  well he said thats done though i think a little more of it would have made an end of me it is rather an astonishing thing but while i felt fiercely anxious to get that anchor out before we started it hardly seems worth the trouble now  we couldnt heave her off without it said jefferson that means going homeeventually  i suppose it does said austin with a little mirthless smile still i havent any home you see and im not sure that a lazar hospital of some kind isnt what is awaiting me you will remember the encouraging words that fellow leftmy arms almost rotten now  jefferson slowly clenched one scarred hand thats a thing we are neither of us strong enough to think about its a little too horribleit couldnt happen  its scarcely likely in your case at least he didnt put his arm round you and i had nothing worth mentioning on that night men do die rotten and i fancied once or twice i felt a suggestive tingling in my skin  jefferson seemed to be holding himself in hand with a struggle but austin smiled  well he said if it comes at all it will get the right one im not going home to be married in fact i was told that it would be rather a graceful thing to come back upon my shield though i dont know that i would like to do so looking as that nigger did in the meanwhile i had perhaps better see to walleyes hand  he went out into the darkness and jefferson stood still with his lips set tight leaning on the table he was in some respects a hard man and his sojourn in africa had not roused his gentler qualities but just then he felt an unpleasant physical nausea creeping over him again     chapter xxv  hove off   the rain came down in sheets and the mangrove roots were hidden by the yellow flood when jefferson stood dripping on the cumbrias bridge her iron deck was level the stumpy pole masts ran upright into the drifting mist and a column of black smoke floated sluggishly from her rusty funnel dingy vapour also rose from the slender one of the locomotive boiler and cableshemp and wire and chainstretched between the mangroves and the steamers bow and stern jefferson leaning heavily on the bridge rails considered them each in turn he shivered a little though the rain was warm and his wet face looked unusually gaunt and worn but his eyes were intent and steady for at last all was ready for the supreme effort of heaving the cumbria off  he looked down when austin stopped at the foot of the ladder his face and hands were black and the thin singlet which was all he wore above his duck trousers seemed glued to him  hadnt you better keep inside the wheelhouse until we start the mill he said  jefferson smiled drily do you think you could what are you wandering up and down the deck for  im not ive been firing the locomotive boiler and spent the last twenty minutes in the forecastle it isnt as dry as it should be there  he spoke lightly though there was a suggestion of tension in his voice and it was evident that both of them were anxious indeed jefferson fancied that his comrade found it difficult to stand still at all  well he said  there are a third of them i darent turn out and two or three of the others who are down with tom look a good deal shakier than i care about still you see i couldnt keep them in theyve had about enough of this country and i dont blame them you can figure on about half of us as reasonably effective but what everybody wants to know is when we are to begin  when you can give me eighty pounds of steam then well shake her up for an hour or two with reversed propeller and heave on everything when you get up to the hundred still although we have blown a good deal of the mud out forward i expect shell want another fifty before shell move  austin glanced at the gap in the forest beneath the bows across which the shattered mangroves were strewn he and jefferson had gone over all this before but since he had stopped by the ladder they must talk of something for silence would have been intolerable just then  ill go down and stir them up though im not sure that they need it he said  he disappeared round the deckhouse and now there was nobody to see him jefferson paced feverishly up and down the bridge until walleye the steward came pattering barefoot along the deck with his arm in a sling jefferson stopped him with a sign  slip into mr austins room and bring me the thermometer he keeps in the little case he said as usual no comprenny casetta de cuero very chiquitita  the man went away and when he came back jefferson who went into the wheelhouse sucked the little clinical thermometer gravely for a minute or two then he frowned as he looked at it  ninetynine point something i guess its coming on again he said well one can go on working when its a good deal more than that especially when he has to  he came out and leaning down dropped the case into the hands of the man below  put it back and dont let mr austin know he said seÃ±or austin no savvy you comprenny  walleye grinned as he went away he could of course hold his tongue but the little case was sodden already and it could not have got so wet as that in austins room  in the meanwhile austin had gone down to the stokehold the place was dimly lighted and insufferably hot for with the cumbria stationary no more air came down the ventilator shafts than the fires would draw and they were burning sulkily in fact it was only by strenuous labour that steam could be raised at all here and there the pale flicker of an oil lamp emphasised the gloom though there were three halfmoon patches of brightness in each of the two boilers until a fierce red glow beat out as tom the donkeyman flung open a furnace door then austin gained some impression of his surroundings  the bent figures of half naked men with shovels were forced out of the shadows another man dripping with perspiration pushed a clattering truck and several more lay apparently inert upon the floorplates with water thick with coal grime trickling from them only two of them were professional firemen and all were weakened by the climate or shaken by the fever while as the red light touched them austin could see how worn they were and the suggestive hollows in their uncovered skin there are also things which it is unfit that a white man should do and firing in a calm in the tropics is one of them austin however had little time to look about him in for tom thrust an iron bar into one of the spaniardss hands  stand by with the bucket you now out with the clinker he said  it is probable that the last man addressed did not understand what was said but he knew how to clean a fire and stood half crouching before the furnace with face averted while he plied the bar there was a rattling beneath the gratebars and an overpowering wave of heat in the midst of which the man stood bowed with thin garments scorching and his hair frizzling visibly austin could hear his gasping breath and became possessed by a sense of futile indignation toil of that kind was he felt more than could be expected of anything made in the image of a man then the canario let the bar fall clanging and seized another while the heat grew more intense when he raked out the ash and glowing clinker from the flaming tunnel austin shrank back with a hand upon his eyes and singlet singeing and his voice broke through toms cry of damp her down  por misericordia he said echadle agua  somebody swung a bucket and a cloud of steam whirled up but the man who had cleaned the fire let his scraper fall and lurching with a half strangled cry went down amidst the vapour he lay with scorched chest and arms on the floorplates making little stertorous noises until tom who tore the bucket from his comrades hands flung the rest of its contents over him  drag him away he said and turned to austin hes the second one but hell come round by and by did you come down to look on or give us a hand  he flung open another door and austin took a shovel from a weary man he had studied the art of firing up on deck where it was considerably cooler before the locomotive boiler but he discovered that the work now demanded from him was an entirely different matter the heat was overpowering the bed of glowing fuel long and it was only by the uttermost swing of shoulders and wrench of back and loins that he could effectively distribute his shovelful he felt his lowered face scorching and the sweat of effort dripped from him but he toiled on in berserker fury while tom encouraged him  spread it he said next lot well down to the back end you neednt be afraid to move yourself keep her thin  austin wondered whether he had any eyebrows left when that furnace was filled but it was done at last and then there was coal to be trimmed from the bunkers the dust that whirled about the shovels blackened and choked him but he worked on savagely every man was needed with half the spaniards sick and he felt that if this was the cost of success it was not fitting that he should shirk his part in it social distinctions counted for nothing there the barriers of creed and nationality had also melted they were all privates in that forlorn hope with death as the penalty of failure and while they could not be more none of them that day dared be less than men  he never remembered all he did there was a constant clanging of shovels whirring of coal trucks and slamming of iron doors that opened to let out fiery heat and radiance and take the flying fuel in men came and went like phantoms gasping panting groaning now and then and the voice of their leader rose stridently at intervals he was a man of low degree and his commands were not characterised by any particular delicacy but he was the man they needed and when he emphasised his instructions with a grimy hand and now and then the flat of the shovel nobody resented it during one brief interlude he found breath for a deprecatory word or two with austin  if she was doing her eight or ten knots it wouldnt be as hard as this he said then the ventilators would cool her down the fires wont burn themselves nowyou have got to make them but youll find her steam sweet and easy when shes going up the trades head to breeze  i wonder said austin grimly how many of us will be left when she gets there  then bill who had been busy at the locomotive boiler came down the ladder with a message and he and tom vanished into the engine room while austin who greatly desired to go with them put a restraint upon himself for some minutes he felt his heart beat as he listened to a premonitory wheezing and panting and then his blood seemed to tingle as this merged into the steady rumble of engines the faint quiver of the floorplates sent a thrill through him and he drew in a great breath of relief when beam and angle commenced to tremble the rumbling grew steadily louder the whirl of the reversed propeller shook the ship and it was evident that the engines were running well  after that however the work became harder still for the big cylinders must be fed and it was with a sensation of thankfulness that he had not broken down beneath the strain austin dragged himself up the ladder when a message was brought him that he was wanted to drive the after winch it was raining heavily but he found it a relief to feel the deluge beat upon his beaded face and scorched skin though he could scarcely see the mangroves to which the wire that ran from the winch drum led it was shackled to a big bridle a loop of twisted steel that wound in and out among a rood or two of the stoutest trees the winch was also powerful and it remained to be seen whether it would heave the cumbria out of her miry bed or pull that portion of the watery forest up bodily a great cable that slanted back towards him rose out of the water forward in a curve and he could dimly see jeffersons lean figure outlined against the drifting mist high up on the bridge on the forecastle beyond it more shadowy men stood still and austin wondered whether their hearts beat as his did while they waited the man beside him stooped ready with body bent in a rigid curve and bare stiffened arms clenching the wire that led to the winchdrum there was a minutes waiting and then jefferson moving along the bridge flung up a hand  heave he said  austin felt his pulses quicken and a curious sense of exultation as he unscrewed the valve for it seemed to him that flesh and blood had borne the strain too long and now they had steel and steam to fight for them the deck beneath him quivered as the screw whirled faster and he could see the poop shaking visibly then the winch wheezed and pounded and there was a groaning forward as the rattle of the windlass joined in wire and hemp and studded chain rose ripping from the river creaked and groaned and strained but when they had drawn each curve out they could get no inch of slack in austin clenched his fingers on the valvewheel but his eyes were fixed on the lonely figure pacing feverishly up and down the bridge and just then he felt all the bitterness of defeat the rattle forward died away and though the winch still whirred and hammered none of the wire rope ran over the drum into the crouching spaniards hands the tension lasted for some minutes and then jeffersons voice came down harshly through the rain  let up he said get down half of you and see if you can help them with the firing well try her again when you have raised more steam  there was by contrast a curious silence when the roar of steam died away and the thudding of the big engines below decks sank to a lower pitch the men who could be spared went down in a body and toiled for another hour in a frenzy the fierce latin blood was up they knew it was the last round and they would not be beaten now the throbbing blast which rushed skywards from the blowoff valve when they came up again showed what they had done and austin walked aft singed and blackened to his winch with his heart in his mouth it must be now or never for it was clear to him that the men were making their last effort and the boilers would not bear another pound of steam  the windlass was groaning horribly when he opened the valve and the whole ship trembled with the whirring of the screw he saw the drums spin round futilely for a moment or two and then the spaniard who crouched behind one of them howled as a foot of the uncoiling wire came back to his hands simultaneously the groaning of the windlass changed to a clanking rattle and no sound had ever seemed half so musical to austin the ship shook beneath him and creaked in all her frame while the hammering and rattling swelled into a frantic din as she commenced to move he felt as though he were choking and his sight momentarily failed him but as yet the battle was not quite won and closing blackened fingers on the valvewheel he watched the rope come home with dazzled eyes it ran in faster and faster he could hear the great studcable splashing and grinding as it came in too and for five breathless minutes he held himself to his task feeling the cumbria creep down stream stern foremost under him then her pace grew faster and the clanging of his winch seemed to deafen him until at last a shrillpitched voice fell through the din  bastante it said shes clear now vast heaving  then the tension slackened as the long rusty hull swung out into midstream and flesh and blood were left shaken and as yet unable to recover from the suddenly lifted strain in the silence as winch and engines stopped tom the donkeyman was chanting some incoherent ribaldry forward here and there a canario howled or flung up dripping arms while the one beside austin sat down upon the hatch and rocked himself to and fro as he called upon the queen of heaven only jefferson stood very still a tall lean figure on the bridge with his torn and drenched clothing sticking to him and austin leaned heavily upon his winch he did not wish to move and was not sure he could have done so had he wanted to the cumbria was clear afloat and they had won but there was nothing he could say or do which would sufficiently celebrate that triumph  jefferson gave them five minutes to recover their balance and then his voice came down again the windlass clanked its hardest wire hawsers splashed and the cumbria had swung across to the opposite forest when the big anchor rose to her bows in the meanwhile the surfboat had been busy too and when the winch whirred again they slid away stern foremost with propeller churning slowly against the muddy stream it was twenty minutes later when with a roar of running cable the anchor plunged once more and she brought up abreast of the creek where the coal and oil were stored jefferson came down from his bridge and sat down on the table in the skippers room when austin flung himself on to the settee with the water trickling from him  well he said we have floated her but theres still a good deal to be done there are the coal and oil to get on board and then we have to find the gum  austin looked up at him with a little smile  thats rather a prosaic epilogue when one comes to think of it he said  then you can paint a picture of it when you get home if you fancy it worth while said jefferson drily  i dont think it would be and austin smiled again after all a picture either goes beyond or falls a long way short of the real thing and the subjects rather too big for me mans domination symbolised by a staggering scarecrow with a firemans shovel  jefferson dropped his hand on his shoulder and gripped it hard well he said you can drive a winch and sling a palm oil puncheon like a sailorman i guess thats most as useful as the other thing any way  ah said austin youre skirting rather a big question but we are practical now are you going to dig the gum up before you heave in cargo  im not it seems to me its safer where it is in the meanwhile so long as funnelpaint doesnt know where to look for it if youll give me a dose of quinine id be obliged to you  austin glanced at him sharply have you any special reason for asking for it  ive been in the rain quite a long while now and its a good deal wiser to head off a fever than wriggle out of its clutches once it gets a good grip on you one gets cautious in this country  austin said nothing further for he was by this time well acquainted with his comrades characteristics but he was not quite contented with the latters reason when he lugged out the medicine chest     chapter xxvi  jefferson finds the gum   a halfmoon shone in a rift between the massed banks of cloud when austin stood looking down into the trench four of the spaniards were digging it ran partly across the islet which was small and sandy intersecting another excavation that had a palm at one end of it while a halfrotten cottonwood from which orchids sprang stood in line with the trench the men were toiling in they were shovelling strenuously and the thud of the sand they flung out jarred on the silence for the night was very still austin could hear the creek lapping on the beach and the deep humming of the cumbrias pump softened by the distance she lay with a light or two blinking fitfully on board her half a mile away ready at last for sea then he glanced at jefferson who stood close beside him shivering a little though the night was hot as he leaned upon a shovel  we have been at it at least a couple of hours austin said suggestively  jefferson laughed and well be here this time tomorrow unless we find the case theres only one on this islet that fellow said and as i tried to point out the men who buried it probably wanted to get the thing done quickly theyd have run a line from the two trees and either dumped the case at the intersection or a few paces outside it on a given bearing if we dont strike it in a few minutes well work a traverse  ten minutes passed and then one of the canarios cried out excitedly as he struck something with his shovel austin saw his comrades hands quiver on the shovelhaft in the moonlight but that was all and next moment two of the spaniards fell on hands and knees in the sand they flung it up in showers with their fingers while austin by an effort stood very still for he felt that he might do things he would be sorry for afterwards if he let himself go the latins were panting in their eagerness and wallowing rather like beasts than men amidst the flying sand then one of them who dragged something out hove it up and flung it at austins feet with a gasp of consternation  ah maldito es muy chiquitita he said  austin set his lips as he glanced at his comrade whose face grew suddenly hard  yes he said with portentous quietness it is remarkably small and by the way he hove it up there cant be very much in it  they stood still a moment looking down at the little wooden case while the spaniards clustered round them with eyes that gleamed in the moonlight breathing unevenly then jefferson said light that blastlamp and well open it  austins fingers trembled and he wasted several matches before the sheet of flame sprang up then he fell furiously upon the case with a hammer and splintered the lid he plunged his hand in and took out a quill which he twisted until it burst and spilled a little heap of gleaming grains in his palm  its gold he said  empty the lot said jefferson and his voice was hoarse your hat is big enough it will all go into it  there was a low murmur from the spaniards when austin obeyed him and he handed the widebrimmed hat to jefferson  would you make it four pounds asked the latter  i certainly would not  jefferson laughed harshly then its probably worth some Â£200 he said its rather a grim joke considering what has no doubt been done for the sake of it  he laid the hat down and one of the spaniards glancing at the little pile of quills broke into a torrent of horrible maledictions while austin who said nothing gazed at his comrade until the latter made a curious little gesture  there is still the gum he said  austin smiled sardonically if you can still believe in it you are an optimist of the finest water any way well go and look for it it will be a relief to get done with the thing  they waded to the surfboat which lay close by on the beach and slid down stream to an adjacent island where they had no difficulty in finding the tree the man who made the note in the engineers tables had alluded to the moon had however sunk behind a cloud and they toiled by the light of the blastlamp for half an hour until once more one of the canarios struck something with his shovel they dragged it out with difficulty and found it to be a heavy halfrotten bag with something that appeared to be a package of plaited fibre inside it other bags followed and hope was growing strong in them again when they had disclosed at least a score jefferson looked at austin with a little smile in his eyes  theres a couple of hundred pounds any way in each of those bags and if the man who told me was right that stuff is worth anything over Â£100 the ton he said so far as we have prospected this strip of sand is full of them its going to be more profitable than goldmining well get this lot into the surfboat first put that lamp out  austin did so and they staggered through a foot or two of water with the bags on their backs some of them burst as they carried them but the fibre packages remained intact and the big boat was almost loaded when austin who was breathless seated himself for a moment on her gunwale he could see by the silvery gleam on the cloud banks edge that the moon was coming through again and he was glad of the fact for he had stumbled and once fallen heavily under his burden when floundering through the strip of thorny brushwood which fringed the beach still he agreed with jefferson that it was not advisable to use the big blastlight any longer than was absolutely necessary for they both had an unpleasant suspicion that they had not done yet with funnelpaint it was indeed for that reason they had made the search at night and used the surfboat which could be paddled almost silently instead of the launch though tom had repaired her boiler and she was then lying alongside the cumbria with steam up ready  the black hull of the latter was faintly visible and as he glanced at it he fancied that a puff of white steam sprang up where he supposed the locomotive boiler to be a moment later a thin shrill scream rang through the stillness and one of the spaniards startled by the sound fell heavily against the boat with the bag he was carrying austin made a sign to jefferson who was staggering across the beach with a bag upon his back  theyre whistling he said i fancy i can hear the launch coming  there was another hoarser scream and when it died away a low thudding sound crept out of the darkness austin swept his gaze upriver but could only see the shadowy mangroves for the moon had not come through yet  funnelpaint said jefferson breathlessly there are four more bags in sight well get her afloat before we go for them  they did it up to their waists in water and it cost them an effort for the big boat was heavy now and then though the spaniards glanced longingly at the cumbrias blinking lights jefferson insisted upon their carrying down the bags when that was done nobody lost any time in getting on board and grasping the paddles they drove her out into the stream  paddle said jefferson grimly i guess its for your lives  it is probable that the spaniards did not understand him but they did what they could for while the clank of the launchs engines grew louder the sound of paddles was also rapidly drawing nearer there were however very few of them and the boat was big so that austin gasped with relief when at last the little steamer swept round her stern  stand by for the line said tom who sprang up on her deck they cant be far off its ten minutes any way since we first heard their paddles  the towline was caught and tightened with a jerk and the surfboat went upstream with the yellow water frothing about her while austin could hear the rhythmic thud of paddles through the clank of hardpressed engines jefferson said nothing but stood rigidly still with hands clenched on the big steering oar until they drove alongside the cumbria  up with you tom and see they whip those bags in he said i want the case youll find under the settee in my room too youll sing out for two or three men who can be relied on austin  what are you going to do asked austin  jefferson laughed unpleasantly head the devils off from the island any way and if its necessary obliterate some of funnelpaints friends its fortunate the launch has twice the speed of any canoe  he clambered on board the launch and when a few more men came scrambling down swung her out before they could decide whether it would be wiser to climb back again after that he left the helm to austin and moving towards the engine opened the valve wide  head her for the islet if they have had anybody watching us in a canoe theyll go there first he said  austin made a sign of comprehension but said nothing until his comrade sitting down opened the case he had asked for then he became possessed by unpleasant apprehensions as he saw jefferson take out several rolls of giantpowder with fuses attached to them they looked exactly like candles now only the wicks were black and unusually long sitting still very grim in face he tied one or two together and then nipped a piece or two off the fuses with his knife  i guess it would be as well to make sure he said  of what asked austin  that theyll go off when i want them and jefferson laughed a little grating laugh ive had them ready for some while and took a good deal of trouble timing the fuses now the effect of giantpowders usually local and i figure one could throw these things far enough for us to keep outside the striking radius theyd go better with a little compression but theres a big detonator inside them which should stir them up without it if these two sticks fell upon a nigger they wouldnt blow him up theyd dissolve him right into gases and its quite probable there wouldnt be any trace of him left  austin asked no more questions worn as he was by tense effort and the climate kept awake as he had been to watch when he might have slept at night and troubled by vague apprehensions that the loathsome plague might be working in his blood he was ready and perhaps rather more than that to turn upon the man who had made their heavy burden more oppressive still indeed it would have been a relief to him to feel the jump of a rifle barrel in his hand but from jeffersons scheme he shrank almost aghast to run amuck with flashing pistol or smashing firebar among the canoes would have appeared to him a natural thing but the calculating quietness of his comrade who sat so unconcernedly making sure that the rolls of plastic material should not fail struck him as wholly abnormal and a trifle horrible pistol shot machete slash and spear thrust were things that one might face but it seemed beyond toleration that another man should unloose the tremendous potentialities pent up in those yellow rolls upon flesh and blood  he was however quite aware that there was nothing to be gained by protesting and while jefferson went on with his grim preparations he turned his gaze upriver towards the approaching canoes he could see them clearly black bars that slid with glinting paddles athwart a track of silvery radiance for the halfmoon had sailed out from behind the cloud they were coming on in a phalanx five or six of them and the splash and thud of the paddles rose in a rhythmic din he swung the launchs bows a trifle down stream to run in between them and the island  then he turned again and saw bill the fireman watching jefferson the light of the engine lantern was on his face and it showed wry and repulsive with its little venomous grin forward the spaniards were clustered together and they were by their movements apparently loosening their wicked knives but they showed no sign of consternation and austin became sensible of a change in his mood it seemed to him that he and they had grown accustomed to fear and felt it less in the land of shadow if they were to be wiped out by a spear thrust or jeffersons giantpowder which seemed equally likely nothing that he could do would avert it but by degrees he became possessed by a quiet vindictive anger against the man who had forced this quarrel on them when their task was almost done there were he fancied fifty or sixty men in the canoes and he felt a little thrill of grim satisfaction as he reflected that if he and his comrades went under they would not go alone in fact he could almost sympathise with jefferson  in the meanwhile the canoes were drawing level with them as they approached the islet he could see the wet paddles glinting and the naked bodies swing while presently jefferson who made bill a little sign to stop the engine stood up on the deck the case of giantpowder lay open at his feet and bill laid a glowing iron on the cylinder covering the men in the canoes ceased paddling and while the craft slid slowly nearer each other there was for a moment or two an impressive silence through which austin fancied he could hear a faint rhythmic throbbing then jefferson who cut one of the rolls of giantpowder through flung up his hand  where you lib for funnelpaint he shouted  them beach said the negro and his voice reached them clearly we done come for them gum you lib for teamboat before we cut you troat  then im going to put the biggest kind of juju onto you said jefferson you savvy how i blow up them headmans house if you dont want to be blown up like it lib for up river one time and be  to you  there was probably only one man among them who partly understood him but his gesture was fierce and commanding and the confused splashing of paddles suggested that some at least of the negroes were impressed two of the canoes moved backwards against the stream and while funnelpaint cried out in his own tongue jefferson stooped  touch that on the iron bill he said  in another moment he stood very straight again with a dim object that sparkled in his hand and then hurled it at the island it fell amidst the brushwood out of which there sprang a sheet of flame that was followed by a detonation and a great upheaval of flying sand then the paddles splashed confusedly and in another minute or two the canoes were a hundred yards away after that there was silence broken only by the voice of funnelpaint who seemed to be flinging reproaches at his friends and a faint dull throbbing which austin fancied was a trifle plainer than before then jefferson laughed as he took up another stick of giantpowder  that seems to have scared them but if they come back again theyll get the next one in the middle of them he said  listen said austin holding up his hand cant you hear engines  jefferson swung round sharply and the scream of a whistle came shrilly across the water from the cumbria just then it was answered by another of a deeper tone and a blaze of blue light sprang up apparently out of the creek it showed a black shape that wallowed through a mass of piled up foam  a launch said jefferson a fast one  no said austin a pinnace a gunboats pinnace ah the canoes are going  there was a sudden thudding of paddles and the canoes melted into the darkness as the moon sailed behind a cloud again but the whirr and thump of engines drew nearer and jefferson reached down for the lantern  well he said a good deal depends upon what country she belongs to and its quite likely were going to have trouble still we have got to face it now  he waved the lantern and while the whirr of engines slackened a voice came out of the darkness  launch ahoy is that the cumbria yonder it said in excellent english  austin took the lantern from jefferson with a soft laugh  ill take charge nowyou see im acquainted with my countrymens little peculiarities he said and raised his voice a trifle it is if you dont mind steaming that far we should consider it a pleasure to do anything we can for you  if you have no great objections ill come on board now said the other man starboard a little start her slow  there was a whirring of engines a little very trim pinnace crept up alongside and a young man in immaculate white uniform stepped on the launchs deck  ah he said mr austin ive had the pleasure of meeting you before what has become of the niggers  which niggers asked jefferson carelessly  the young officer looked at him with a little dry smile and it was evident that his eyes were keen for he made a sign to bill who was about to secrete the giantpowder  i am he said under the impression that you know a good deal more about them than i do we have rather good glasses and i certainly made out four or five canoes may i ask what that stuff is yonder  it is what i believe is called in america giantpowder said austin we found it useful in blowing the mangroves up  quite so said the officer in fact we heard the detonation still i daresay there are several things we should like to ask each other about and you suggested going across to your steamer  i did said austin we should be glad of your company for tonight at least though im afraid we cant offer you much to eat this is my partner jeffersonlieutenant onslow     chapter xxvii  austins toast   an hour had passed since their first meeting when austin jefferson and two navy men sat round a little table that had been laid out upon the cumbrias bridge deck it was slightly cooler there than it was below besides which the messrooms reeked with damp and mildew a lamp hung from one of the awning spars above them and its light fell upon the mens faces and the remnants of the very frugal meal the handful of bluejackets who came up in her had apparently gone to sleep beneath an awning on the flooring of the pinnace which lay alongside but a sharp clinking rose from the lighted engine room where a couple of naval artificers were busy with tom the donkeyman the gunboats surgeon who had been round the forecastle was talking to austin while her commander lay opposite jefferson immaculately neat in a canvas chair  our tale he said is a very simple one as we didnt seem to be wanted anywhere just now we moored ship snugly in the bight behind the island and decided to get a little painting done she was getting rusty along the waterline and one cant get at it well when shes washing through a swell you know under the circumstances i seized the opportunity to do a little rough surveying we are expected to pick up any information that may be of use to the admiralty hydrographers  jefferson lay very limply in his chair but his eyes twinkled appreciatively well he said i guess that would look all right in the log but any one who had seen you start surveying would wonder why you brought those cases of provisions as well as engine oil and packing and two or three ingots of bearing metal we were uncommonly glad to get them and see the artificers though im not sure your admiralty would approve of the way youre squandering its stores  onslow laughed we are not forbidden to offer assistance to any one in want of it and the provisions at least do not belong to our parsimonious lords in fact they were handed me at las palmas by a friend of yours on the off chance of our falling in with you of course i could not exactly promise that you would get them though i had reasons for believing the thing was possible  jefferson filled a wineglass and thrust the bottle across the table  i think i know the ladys name he said this is the first wine ive drunk since i came to africa and it will probably be the last until i get out of it again tomorrow its going forward to the sick men in the forecastle the lady who sent it is not going to mind my passing the kindness on  i venture to think she would approve and onslow glanced at austin in fact i couldnt quite help a fancy she intended it as a peaceoffering miss brown is as you are probably aware capable of conveying an impression without saying anything very definite and the one i received from her was that she felt she had been a trifle hard on somebody i should of course not have presumed to mention it had it not been borne in on me that it was not intended i should keep that impression entirely to myself if i have been mistaken i must apologise to her and both of you  jefferson stood up with the wineglass in his hand and the others rose with him  this he said is a little out of my usual line but its her wine were drinking and i cant quite let the occasion pass to her serene excellency the cleverest woman in the canaries who hasnt forgotten us  austin stood opposite him a ragged climateworn skeleton with a little flush in his haggard face and he looked at the gunboats commander  my comrade hasnt gone quite far enough he said the queen who can do no wrong  then the glasses were emptied and there was a moments silence when they sat down three of them were after all somewhat reserved englishmen who had for once allowed their thoughts to become apparent and commander onslow who felt that he had perhaps exceeded his somewhat delicate commission was distinctly displeased with himself he had had a certain conversation with mrs hatherly who had been rather frank with him before he left the canaries and the attitude of the ragged adventurer who had proclaimed his unwavering devotion to the woman who had sent him there appealed to him so much so in fact that it made him uncomfortable it was he felt advisable to change the subject  considering everything it was perhaps as well we turned up when we did you see those niggers dont belong to us he said i was i may admit rather thankful when they disappeared since it might have made a good deal of trouble if we had taken a hand in now you understand that you may be willing to tell me what you purposed doing with the giantpowder  jefferson laughed grimly if you had come five minutes later id have blown half of them to the devil we at least cant afford to be particular  you had presumably a reason i wonder if you have any objections to telling us the rest of it in confidence  jefferson who lighted a cigar told him the story and onslow lay back in his chair listening with grave attention while the surgeon leaned forward with elbows on the table at last onslow shook his head  its interesting exceedingly he said still i dont think id recommend you to tell it in quite that shape to everybody it would probably make trouble and you mightnt find anybody very willing to believe you things of that kind dont happen nowat least theyre not supposed toand i fancy it would prove a good deal more convenient just to mention the simple facts you bought the steamer stranded and with considerable difficulty got her off  we had practically decided on doing no more than that already said austin still i wonder if now you have heard the story one could ask your views  onslow smiled drily i havent any and if i were you i wouldnt worry about anything beyond the financial aspect of the affair nobody is likely to thank you and the only men who could tell you what happened are dead you know  austin saw that jefferson also recognised that the advice was good and changing the subject he spoke to the surgeon the latter looked thoughtful  i cant tell you what that man was afflicted with he said there are several african diseases we are not acquainted with and a good many of their troubles are supposed to be contagious of course you could apply to the college of tropical diseases theyve lately started in liverpool if you are really interested  i am said austin in fact im very much so indeed you see i had practically nothing on and he got his festering arms round me  the surgeon looked at him gravely i scarcely think you need worry but if you have to do any rough work i would endeavour to avoid any lacerated bruises and as far as possible keep your skin unbroken  its a little difficult on board this steamer there are several raw patches on my arms now  the surgeon promised to attend to them but just then onslow turned to jefferson  have you opened up any of the gum yet he asked  jefferson said he had not and was rather anxious to do so whereupon onslow and the surgeon offered to accompany him and they went down the ladder together to where the bags still lay upon the forward hatch  i shouldnt wonder if you were right about its value said the surgeon when jefferson held up the lantern one of the spaniards had handed him we took a senegal frenchman down the coast last trip and he had rather a craze upon the subject there is i understood from him a particular gum the niggers find somewhere between here and the head of the niger for which one could get almost what he liked to ask from the makers of special highclass varnishes in fact the man said that one of them who had been trying it told him that it must be used in certain processes whatever its cost might be the only trouble was that it appeared very difficult to get hold of except in the smallest quantities but perhaps your frenchman had got on the track of it  austin tore one of the bags which were very rotten across and then slit the fibre package beneath it the surgeon who stooped beside him was the first to thrust his hand into the opening  the nodules seem very uniform in size he said and then stood up suddenly with astonishment in his face im almost afraid that somebody has been beforehand with you  what do you mean asked austin still tearing at the package  the surgeon turned and gazed hard at jefferson this is certainly not gum it looks very like an ordinary palm kernel  he held up a little round black object and jeffersons face grew grim while he clenched one hand then he wrenched the knife from austin and fell on his knees ripping at the fibre package savagely it opened beneath the steel and when its contents poured out on deck he rose with a little bitter laugh there was no doubt whatever they were palm kernels a curious silence followed during which jefferson leaned against the rail looking down upon the bags with expressionless eyes until he made a little gesture  well he said very quietly it seems we have had our trouble for nothing you may as well open the rest of them  austin was not sure how he contrived to do it he felt suddenly limp and feeble but holding himself in hand by an effort he slit the remaining bags and flooded the deck with kernels there was nothing else and the kernels appeared half rotten  this must be a little rough on you said onslow with a trace of awkwardness i understand you expected to find more of the stuff yonder  i did said jefferson funnelpaint can have it now we have had about enough of this country and if your artificers fancy we could trust that starboard boiler well set about raising steam to take her out first thing in the morning  onslow made a little gesture of sympathy i almost think it is the wisest thing you can do he said in the meanwhile it is getting late and we have a long trip in front of us tomorrow i have no doubt you dont feel much like entertaining anybody just now  he and the surgeon withdrew to the rooms prepared for them and when austin who went with them came back he stood a moment by the doorway of the one beneath the bridge which jefferson now occupied alone the latter looked up at him with halfclosed eyes  we have the oil and the shipand that will have to be enough he said and then straightened himself with a fierce gesture get out and sleepif you feel like it the thing has shaken me and im not sure im very well  austin went away but it was almost daylight before sleep came to him and he had only been on deck an hour when their guests departed in the morning jefferson who bade them goodbye at the gangway stood leaning on the rail while the pinnace steamed away and then walked with curious heaviness towards his room he crawled into his bunk when he reached it and lay there while austin looked down on him with concern  ive had the fever on me for quite a while and at last it has gripped me hard he said ill probably be raving in an hour or two get steam up as soon as youre able and take her out of the devilish country  austin was very busy between his comrades room forecastle and stokehold during the rest of that day and he had very little time for rest at night but though half the men were sick and his own limbs were aching portentously it was with a little thrill of exultation he climbed to the bridge early on the following morning the windlass was rattling on the forecastle walleye stood by the winch astern and the surfboat was sliding towards the mangroves where a big wire hawser was made fast in the rain austin was not a professional sailor but he could handle surfboat and steam launch and in the good days had sailed his yacht along the coast at home he also had confidence in the grizzled olivefaced spaniard who stood gravely behind him gripping the steeringwheel  the anchor came home to the bows at last somehow the feverworn men on the forecastle hove it in the after winch hammered when he made a sign and the long rusty hull moved backwards towards the forest as her head swung slowly round there was a splash of dripping wire and he swung up an arm with a cry of largo  then the winch rattled furiously a gong clanged below and a wild exultant shouting went up when the cumbrias engines commenced to throb the gaunt hollowfaced men who stood dripping in the rain had borne everything but cold and now they were going home austin felt his eyes grow hazy for a moment as he leaned upon the rails and then with a little shake of his shoulders he fixed his gaze steadily upon the mangroves that came sliding back to him ahead he had he felt a task that would demand all his attention in front of him  they slid down stream unchecked until the afternoon and the cumbria steered handily which since there were awkward bends to swing round was fortunate for all of them but austin had misgivings when at last they approached one that appeared sharper than the rest for he could only see the close ranks of dingy mangroves in front of him as he gazed into the rain and mist the creek was too narrow to swing the steamer to an anchor and it was evident that if she was to get around the bend at all he most go at it hard for the yellow stream was running fast with them and unless she steamed faster the vessel would not steer he signed to the helmsman who edged her in near one bank to gain a little room and then set his lips tight as he clenched his telegraph and rang for full speed ahead it was consoling to remember that tom was below for a good donkeyman is as a rule more to be trusted than a junior engineer  ahead the oily current was sliding through the mangroves as well as among them covering all their higharched roots and he knew that there were a good many feet of water there for the creek was full and he had heard of steamers going full tilt into the watery forest at such times still he breathed unevenly as he watched the dingy trees slide past one another for the bend was opening very slowly and there was a long tongue of mangroves close in front of him the bridge planks were trembling beneath him now and he could hear the thudthud of the harddriven screw but the stream seemed to be running very fast at the bend and glancing round he saw something very like fear in the face of the man who held the wheel when he looked ahead again the long tongue of mangroves seemed flying towards him  he strode to the end of the bridge and glanced down at the lift of rusty side there was a good deal of it above the water for the cumbria was loaded easily and she was also he was very glad to remember light of draught he could not check her with an anchor under foot she would only swing to it and that would land her among the mangroves broadside on if he backed his propeller he would as surely go ashore and his face grew very grim as he made the helmsman a little sign since he must strike the forest he would strike it fair as hard as the engines could drive her bows on and he thrust down the telegraph once more for the last pound of steam  the throb of plank and rail grew sharper the trees seemed rushing at the forecastle the helmsman gazed forward with drawn face over his moving wheel and a shouting broke out on deck austin however did not move at all save when he raised a hand to the helmsman once more easygoing artist as he was the berserker fit was upon him and it was with a light only one or two of his friends had ever seen there in his eyes he hurled her full speed at the forest  she struck it with a crash that flung two or three of the spaniards staggering and it crumpled up before her mangrove boughs came streaming down on her grinding forecastle torn limbs clutched at rail and stanchion and were smashed by them mire was whirled aloft by the thudding screw and austin gripping his telegraph laughed a harsh laugh as he saw that she was going through how thick that belt of trees was or what water flowed among their roots he did not know but he remembered that he had found no bottom among them in other places with a boathook now and then  in another few moments the whitestemmed trunks fell aside again and they drove out once more into clear and swiftlyflowing water then the spaniards howled together and austin twining his hand in the lanyard unloosed the whistle and hurled back a great vibratory blast at the beaten forest it was he admitted afterward a somewhat feeble thing but he said he felt the occasion demanded something then  after that they had no great difficulty and by nightfall they drove her out with sluicing decks over the smoking bar dipping the bleached and rotten ensign to the little white gunboat that lay rolling behind the island then austin felt a great weight lifted off him as he flung himself into a canvas chair upon his bridge there was now only open sea in front of them and he had seen that the big pump could keep the water down he felt that he could contrive by some means to make las palmas     chapter xxviii  in command   austin was quite aware that he had his work cut out when he was left in command of the cumbria with half her crew sick and her skipper raving deliriously he knew very little about medicine and certainly no more about what he termed the astronomical side of navigation and after several attempts decided that it was beyond his ability to take an accurate solar observation there were however other though not very reliable means of approximately ascertaining the ships position which he was acquainted with and he nerved himself afresh for a grapple with what most men would under the circumstances have considered insuperable difficulties  he had two spaniards who could be trusted to keep the steamer more or less on the course he gave them while the cumbria steerd handily which is more than all steamers do there was a largescale chart considerably mildewed but still legible in the skippers room as well as a pilot guide to the west african coast while the patent log that towed astern to record the distance run appeared to be working accurately he could thus it was evident depend in some degree upon what is termed dead reckoning which is comparatively reliable in the case of short distances run in the vicinity of a high well lighted coast the one the cumbria steamed along was however not lighted at all and most of it scarcely rose a foot above sealevel while when he had ruled the line she was presumed to be travelling on across the chart and pricked off the distance the patent log told him she had run there remained the question how far the tide and the guinea stream had deflected it and whether the steering and her compasses could be trusted  it was also rather an important question and when he had on several occasions peered for an hour at a time through jeffersons glasses in search of a cape or island which the chart indicated should be met with and saw only a hazy line of beach or a dingy smear on the horizon which might be mangroves or quite as likely a trail of mist the probability of his ever reaching the canaries seemed very remote indeed there would he fancied be no great difficulty in obtaining a mate and two or three seamen from one of the steamers he came across but in that case the strangers would expect half the value of the cumbrias hull and cargo and very likely make their claim to it good he was also aware that more experienced skippers than he was had put their ships ashore upon that coast but what troubled him most was the fact that if he lost sight of it or found no point that he could identify he would have nothing to start from when he must boldly head her out across the open ocean  she had rolled along at six to eight knots with the big pump going for several days when a trail of smoke crept out of the western horizon austin watched it anxiously and when at last a strip of black hull and a yellow funnel grew into shape beneath it summoned the donkeyman and with his assistance which was not especially reliable worried over the signal code painted on the flag rack in the wheelhouse when he had stopped the engines it was almost obliterated and most of the flags themselves were missing but between them they picked out sundry strips of mildewed bunting and sent them up to the masthead the little westcoast mailboat was close alongside now and flags also commenced to flutter up between her masts while her whistle screamed in long and short blasts austin anxious as he was laughed a little  that is apparently the morse code and its unfortunate that neither of us understands it he said i presume it means that they can make nothing of our flags and one could hardly blame them any way we have got to stop her  tom grinned as he pulled an armful of tattered ensigns out of a locker this one should do the trick he said id start the whistle  austin drew the lanyard and when the ensign blew out on the hot air union down the mailboat stopped and considering that they were steamboat men her crew had a white gig over in a very creditable time she came flying towards the cumbria with four negroes at the oars and when she slid alongside a young mate in trim white uniform came up a rope  you might have slung me the ladder down he said gazing about him in blank astonishment paint is evidently scarce where you come from ive seen smarter craft in a wreckers yard still i cant stop here talking what do you want  a doctor for one thing said austin to gain time  we have half the crew down in the forecastle  the mate walked to the rails and shouted to his boatboys while when the gig slid away he pointed up at the drooping flags as he turned to austin  i suppose its artistic the colouring i mean he said  still its a trifle difficult to make out by either code austin laughed come into my room and have a drink there are one or two things i want to ask you  five minutes later he spread a mildewed chart on the table as they sat with a bottle of jacintas wine before them  now he said if you will tell me exactly where we are id be much obliged to you  you dont know and the mate looked at him curiously  since you cant undertake any salvage operations with the mails on board i dont mind admitting that im far from sure you see we have only one navigator and if you were forward just now you would hear him raving ive got to take her somehowon dead reckoningto the canaries  the mate opened his mouth and gasped well he said simply may i be   i suppose thats natural but it isnt much use to me ive been creeping along the coast so far but its evident that if i stick to it i wont reach las palmas i want a definite point from which to make a start for the ocean run  the mate pulled a pin out of the chart and measuring with the dividers stuck it in again youre not quite so much out as i expected you would be he said its a straight run to the isleta grand canary whether youll ever get there with the compass and the patent log is another matter though of course if you go on long enough youll fetch some part of america i dont want to be unduly inquisitive but you will have lost at least an hour of our time before i put pills on board again and i really think there is a little you should tell me  austin briefly outlined his adventures and when he had finished the mate brought his fist down with a bang on the table  well he said you have evidently excellent nerves of your own and im not quite so sure as i was that youll never get her home i dont mind admitting now that at first i thought you were crazy its evident that your compass and patent log are all right but youll have to get your latitude and longitude at least occasionally and ill bend on some signals any skipper you come across would understand if hes particularly goodnatured he might chalk it on a board  he stopped a moment with a little sardonic smile as a matter of fact its not quite so unusual a question as you might suppose  austin thanked him profusely and felt a good deal easier when he and the mailboats doctor who arrived presently and gave him good advice went away then with a blast of her whistle the cumbria steamed on to the west again and it was three or four days later and she was plunging along with dripping forecastle at a little over six knots against the trades when austin had trouble with jefferson he was asleep in his room aft and awakening suddenly wondered for a moment or two what was wrong until it dawned on him that it was the unusual quietness which had roused him then he sprang from his berth and hastened out on deck for it was evident that the engines had stopped  there was clear moonlight overhead and the ship was rolling heavily while as he looked forward a clamour broke out beneath the bridge where grimy men came scrambling up from the stokehole gratings it was light enough for him to see their blackened faces and their excited gestures other men were he fancied from the pattering on the iron deck also moving in that direction from the forecastle but what most astonished him was the sight of a gaunt white figure pacing up and down the bridge while he gazed at it walleye came running towards him breathlessly  the seÃ±or jefferson has stopped the ship he said he has a pistol and maccario who is shut up in the wheelhouse shouts us that he will go back to africa again  austin who knew a little about malarial fever by this time ran forward and met tom at the foot of the bridge ladder the latter laid a grimy finger on his forehead significantly  right off his dot i dont know whats to be done he said it would be easier if he hadnt that pistol  a gong clanged beneath them while they considered it and tom shook his head he has been ringing all over the telegraph from full speed to hard astern he said i dont know if hed give you the pistol but when i got half way up the ladder he said hed put a bullet into me any way if you went up and talked to him while i crawled up quiet by the other ladder i might get him by the foot or slip in behind him  austin was by no means anxious to face the pistol but it was evident that something must be done and he went up the ladder as unconcernedly as he could when he reached the head of it jefferson beat upon the wheelhouse window with his fist  whats her head to the westwards for he said port hard over cant you hear inside there  the steering engine rattled and it was evident that the helmsman was badly afraid but in another moment jefferson had swung away from the wheelhouse and was wrenching at the telegraph again  whats the matter with these engines he said i want her backed while i swing her under a ported helm ill plug somebody certain if this is a mutiny  he opened the big revolver and closed it with a suggestive click while it cost austin an effort to walk quietly along the bridge jeffersons eyes were glittering his hair hung down on his face which was grey and drawn dark with perspiration and his hands and limbs were quivering his voice however although a trifle hoarser was very like his usual one so much so in fact that austin found it difficult to believe the mans mind was unhinged by fever he whirled round when he heard austin without a trace of recognition in his eyes  now he said why cant i get what i want done  youre very sick said austin quietly hadnt you better go back to bed  jefferson laughed yes he said i guess i am or these brutes wouldnt try to take advantage of me still in another minute youre going to see me make a hole in somebody  he leaned heavily on the bridge rails with the pistol glinting in his hand and austin endeavoured to answer him soothingly  what do you want to go back to africa for he said there wouldnt be any difficulty about it if it was necessary  funnelpaints there they brought me away when i was sick or id have killed him he made a little gesture and dropped his hoarse voice you see i had a partner who stood by me through everything and funnelpaint sent down a  rotting nigger  your partners all right said austin who saw that jefferson was as far from recognising him as ever ive excellent reasons for being sure of it  jefferson leaned towards him confidentially with one hand on the rails  it hasnt come out but its bound to get him the nigger had his arms round him then hell have to hide in a dark hole where nobody can see him while the flesh rots off him until he dies  austin could not help a shiver he knew the thing might happen and he realised now that it had also been in jeffersons mind still it was in the meanwhile his business to get the pistol from the latter and then put him in his berth by force if necessary  the difficulty is that you cant kill a man twice he said i seem to have a notion that you hove a stick of dynamite into funnelpaints canoe  i could have done and i meant to but my partner was with me i had to humour him that man stood by me  austin stood still looking at him a little bewildered by it all the mailboat doctors and some of the traders he had met at las palmas had more than once related curious examples of the mental aberration which now and then results from malarial fever still jefferson whom he had left scarcely fit to raise his head in his bunk was now apparently almost sensible and what was more astonishing able at least to walk about then when he wondered how he was to get his comrade down from the bridge the latter turned to him with a sudden change of mood  youre keeping me talking while they play some trick on me he said all right in another moment youll be sorry  the pistol went up and austin set his lips while a little shiver of dismay ran through him the ladder he had come up by was some distance away the wheelhouse at least as far and he stood clear in the moonlight realising that the first move he made would probably lead to jefferson squeezing the trigger then with sudden bitterness he remembered what it seemed was in his blood and felt astonished that he should be troubled by physical fear it would be a swifter and cleaner end if his comrade killed him there that consideration however only appealed to his reason and the reflection came that jefferson would probably never shake off the recollection of what he had done and knowing it was safest he braced himself to stand motionless while the perspiration dripped from him steadily eyeing the fevercrazed man  if you will let me tell you why we are steaming west it would save a good deal of trouble he said as soothingly as he could though his voice shook you see you were too sick to understand and youre not very well yet  jefferson somewhat to his astonishment seemed willing to listen but he was unfortunately far from the side of the bridge below which austin surmised that tom was crouching he risked a glance round but the helmsman evidently dare not leave the wheelhouse for which austin could not blame him and the spaniards stood clustered together gazing up at them from below austin decided that if he signed or called to them jefferson would use the pistol though he fancied that one of them was trying to make him understand something  then suddenly a shadowy form glided out from behind the wheelhouse where jefferson could not see it there was a rush of feet and a spring and jefferson went down heavily with another man who wound his arms round him they rolled against the bridge rails and a breathless voice called to austin  get hold of the pistol it said  austin wrenched it from his comrade men came scrambling up the ladder and in another moment or two they had jefferson helpless and set about carrying him to his room when they laid him in his berth his strength seemed to suddenly melt away and he lay limp and still only babbling incoherently austin ventured to give him a sedative and then leaving walleye to watch him went out on deck tom who was waiting for him made a little deprecatory gesture  im sorry mr austin but he never came near my side of the bridge he said if i had got up hed have dropped me with the pistol and that wouldnt have done much good to anybody  of course not said austin i was uncommonly thankful when bill got hold of him send him along to my room and then start your engines  in another two or three minutes the cumbria was steaming west again and bill the fireman stood somewhat sheepishly in the doorway of austins room  i owe you a good deal and when the time comes ill endeavour to remember it said the latter still i dont want mr jefferson ever to know anything about the thing you did it cleverly  bill grinned well he said im quite glad i did i felt i had to do something for my five pounds any way  it dawned upon austin that once or twice when he had somewhat risky work to do bill had been near him  what five pounds he asked  the five pounds she shoved into my hand one night on board the estremeduranothe fact is im feeling a little shaky and i dont quite know what im saying the getting hold of mr jefferson has upset me when you think of it its only natural  then it has come on very suddenly said austin you seemed all right a moment or two ago am i to understand that somebody gave you five pounds to look after me  it was evident to bill that there was nothing to be gained by further reticence and he edged out of the doorway grinning more broadly than ever  well he said i guess she meant you though she said it was both of you still you wont tell her or i shant get any more  he had vanished before austin could ask another question but the matter was quite clear to the latter and his face grew hot while a little thrill of satisfaction ran through him as he recognised that jacinta had felt it worth while to do what she could to ensure his safety then he remembered something else and his face grew hard as he pulled off his jacket and glanced at his bare arm  he had torn and abraded it heaving in oil and coal and the gunboats surgeon had warned him that it was advisable to keep his skin unbroken there were several halfhardened scars upon it now and another had been torn away when he fell against the rail in a heavy lurch a day or two earlier he had worn no jacket at the time he had since noticed a curious tingling sensation in that part of his arm and holding it nearer the lamp he saw that the flesh was inflamed about the wound there was no doubt about the fact when he pressed it with his thumb all the lower arm was sore and he let it fall limply to his side and sat down with a little groan the horrible thing he shrank from had it seemed come upon him he sat very still for half an hour grappling with a numbing sense of dismay and then with a little shake of his shoulders went back to the bridge for he had still a duty to his comrades     chapter xxix  austin is missing   it was a fine morning and the signal steamer approaching from the south was flying from the staff high up on the isleta hill when pancho browns boat lay heaving on the smooth swell at the entrance to las palmas harbour mrs hatherly jacinta and muriel sat in the sternsheets and beyond them two barefooted canarios were resting on their oars while two or three miles away a smear of smoke that half hid a streak of dusky hull moved towards them across the shining sea brown was watching it attentively with a pair of marine glasses in his hand  you have brought me off several times for nothing but i almost think our friends have turned up at last he said of course from lieutenant onslows cable she should have been here several days ago but its very likely the engines would give them trouble any way well know in ten minutes or so theres the sanidad going off  a launch crept out from the mole and behind her in the harbour boats were being got afloat coaling clerks tobacco and wine merchants and a miscellaneous crowd of petty dealers were waiting to step on board but two at least of pancho browns party had no eyes for them they were watching the incoming steamer rise higher out of the shining sea and wondering if she was the one they had for the last few days looked for with tense anxiety they had onslows cable from sierra leone and the skipper of a big tramp which had come in for coals reported that a small british steamer had asked him for the latitude and longitude a week before nothing however had since been heard of her and jacinta had found the last three or four days as trying as muriel did the latter had however borne the suspense bravely and displayed a sublime confidence in her lover which jacinta for no very obvious reason found almost exasperating at times  cant we go out a little she said at last  brown made a sign to the canarios who dipped the oars and as they slid past the carsegarry which lay with steam blowing off and a water barge alongside captain farquhar leaned over her rails he had come in for coal on his way to liverpool the previous day and had spent part of the night with brown  i really think that is the cumbria he said any way shes much the kind of boat jefferson described to me and so far as i can make out they have a big boiler on deck i suppose you are going off to her  brown said they were and farquhar glanced at the boat hesitatingly id very much like to come with you but i cant leave just now he said still we wont have filled our tanks up for an hour or two and you might tell mr austin that i certainly expect him to pull across and see me in fact although we have steam up ill wait until he does  brown made a sign of comprehension and the boat slid away while when she stopped again outside the harbour the eyes of all on board her were fixed upon the steamer she had also stopped and lay rolling wildly with the yellow flag at her foremasthead and the sanidad launch alongside her but in another minute or two the flag came fluttering down and she moved on again towards the harbour brown signed to the oarsmen to turn the boats head  theres no doubt that shes the cumbria and they cant have had anything very bad on board he said  in another five minutes the cumbria crept up with them rolling wickedly with the big pump thudding on her deck and a stream of water spouting from her side rags of awnings fluttered about her her funnel was white with salt crust for the tradewind blows strong at that season and the blistered paint had peeled from her corroded sides her story was written upon her so that even the girls could read and both felt that no plainer testimony was needed to the courage of the men who had brought her home then they saw them jefferson leaning out gaunt and blanched in face from the bridge rails and austin standing amidst a group of haggard men on the forecastle jacintas heart was beating a good deal faster than usual and she saw the sudden tears rise to her companions eyes but as the long rusty hull forged past them austin made no sign he stood looking straight in front of him until he turned to the men about him who were busy with the anchor  he cant have seen us said muriel with astonishment in her tone and then touched browns arm tell them to row their hardest please  the canarios bent their backs and the boat swept forward for the steamer had already passed ahead of them jacinta sat unusually still watching her sensible at once of a vague dismay and a thrill of pride she had understanding as well as imagination and the sight of that rusty vessel and the worn faces of the men upon her deck had stirred her curiously it was she felt a notable thing they had done and she was she knew responsible for the part one of them had played in it he had come home with credit a man who had done something worth while and had doubtless learned his strength she could not fancy him frittering his life away after that but still she was perplexed and a trifle anxious for it seemed that he must have seen them and he had made no sign she had on her part twice passed him without recognition in the plaza at santa cruz and her heart smote her as she remembered it but he was not a vindictive man and must by that time have realised the misapprehension she had been under concerning him for that at least she would ask his forgiveness in another few minutes and her face burned as she wondered what he would say to her  then she saw the white wash of the cumbrias propeller as it whirled astern and there was a roar of running chain while two or three minutes later they were making their way up the lowered ladder amidst a crowd of petty dealers when jefferson came across the deck driving the latter aside jacinta saw that it cost muriel an effort to hide her consternation at his appearance but in another moment she was smiling at him with shining eyes and the haggard mans arms were about her that the deck was crowded with spaniards did not seem in the least to matter to either of them jacinta who would not have done as much felt a little thrill of sympathy and it was significant looked round for austin there was however no sign of him  then jefferson still holding muriels arm drew them out of the press and there was a general offering of congratulations and grasping of hands  i am he said uncommonly glad to be back again though im not sure wed have ever got here except for austin i have only been on my feet the last day or two and he did everything  where is he said muriel seeing that jacinta would not ask  across at the carsegarry at least he told me he was going when he recognised her  without coming to shake hands with us said muriel who flashed a covert glance at jacinta  i understand from one of these fellows that farquhar is just going to sea and its very probable that austin heard it too i have no doubt hell be back again in five minutes  you will come ashore with us and we will expect you and mr austin to make my house your home in the meanwhile said brown  i shall be very glad said jefferson you will however have to excuse me for an hour or two i have our consul to see and a good many things to do before i can call my time my own i wonder if you could get me a tartana  mine is waiting at the mole said brown  it was an hour later when they took their places in the vehicle but though brown bade the driver wait a minute or two there was no appearance of austin just then the carsegarry crept down the harbour and with a sonorous blast of her whistle steamed out to sea  there is no boat coming he must have landed on the other mole and perhaps met somebody he couldnt get away from said brown ill leave word that we are expecting him and no doubt hell turn up soon after we get home  they drove away and that afternoon sat together in browns cool patio the noise of the bustling city was deadened by the tall white walls over which there shone a square of cloudless blue and the scent of flowers was heavy in the shadowy space below jefferson lay attired becomingly once more in a big cane chair with a little smile of content in his hollow face and a pile of fruit and a flask of wine on the table in front of him the others sat about him and a fountain splashed behind them in the shadow  a very little of this will make me well he said in fact it is already a trifle difficult to believe that i could scarcely lift myself in my berth a few days ago i think it was the sight of gomera that cured me you see i was a little doubtful about austin finding the canaries and when they came to tell me they could see the peak walleye who was watching me ran out  what was he watching you for asked muriel  to see i didnt get up i had my chance then and i crawled out of my berth i believe i fell over several things before i got out on deck and then i knew we were all right at last there was the peakhigh up in the sky in front of us with gomera a blue smudge low down at its feet we ran in under the lee and because they were played out and tom had trouble with his engines stayed there three days  he stopped a moment with a little laugh i think austin was most astonished as i was to find hed brought her home hed been running four or five days on dead reckoning and wasnt much more than a hundred miles out  i wonder where he is said brown  jefferson looked a trifle perplexed and it was evident that others of the party had asked themselves the same question for there was a moments silence until muriel spoke  if he doesnt come soon i shall feel very vexed with him but we want to hear how you got the steamer off she said  jefferson commenced his tale diffidently but because austin had worked in the sombre backgroundmore effectively than he could do alreadythe rest listened with full comprehension his unvarnished narrative was however striking enough and save for the splashing of the fountain and his low voice there was a suggestive silence in the patio until he stopped abruptly when he came to the scene in which austin pleaded for the negro  the man wasnt fit to look at he said  but why did mr austin go near him asked muriel with a little shiver  to save his life said jefferson awkwardly you see we couldnt have him thereand he really wasnt a man then the thing he had we believed contagious and somebody had to put him into his canoe  muriel gazed at him with an expression of perplexity and it was clear that she did not quite understand what had taken place on the night in question which was however not astonishing brown appeared a trifle uncomfortable and jefferson was sincerely thankful when jacinta broke in  of course she said he couldnt have stayed there mr austin put him into his canoe she stopped for a moment and her voice seemed to change a trifle did he find it necessary to touch him  he did in fact the nigger got hold of him one of them slipped on the bridge deck ladder and they rolled down it together  again there was silence and all of them looked at jefferson who saw the question in jacintas eyes  no he said nothing came of it though for a week or so i was horribly afraid it isnt men like austin who take that kind of thing and its possible it maynt have been infectious after all  muriel heard jacinta softly draw in her breath as though she had been under a strain which had suddenly relaxed then a little colour crept into her face and a sparkle into her eyes  yes said jefferson though nobody had spoken it was a daring thing more in fact than i would have done my partner has the cleanest kind of real hard sand in him  he turned to muriel with a little deprecatory gesture i had more at stake than he hadand i was afraid that night  jacinta sat still a while a trifle flushed in face for the scene jefferson had very vaguely pictured had stirred her to the depths the man whom she had sent forth had done more than she would ever have asked of him and the gallantry of the action brought a dimness to her eyes then she remembered that it was not done recklessly for he had it seemed decided calmly which must have made it inexpressibly harder there were she could imagine circumstances in which a man might more or less willingly risk his life but the risk austin had taken was horrible and he stood to gain nothing when he quietly recognised the responsibility he had taken upon himself it was with an overwhelming sense of confusion she remembered the jibes she had flung at him concerning his discretion and yet under it there was still the sense of pride after all it was to please her he had gone to africa  well said jefferson quietly you are pleased with him  jacinta met his gaze unwaveringly and her voice had a little thrill in it  does it matter in the least whether i am pleased or not she said still since you ask i scarcely think i have heard of anything that would surpass what he did that night  jefferson made her a little inclination i am he said gravely not sure that i have either  he went on with his story but jacinta scarcely listened to it for she was wondering why austin had not come and waiting expectantly for the time when she could in selfabasement endeavour to wipe what she had said from his memory still he did not come and it was half an hour later when a barefooted boatman was shown into the patio he had an envelope in his hand and turned to brown  the englishman who was in the estremedura gave me this on board the carsegarry he said i am sorry i could not bring it before but several steamers i had to go to came in and then it was some time before i found out that the seÃ±or jefferson had gone home with you  when he went away brown handed jefferson the note while the latter who opened it straightened himself suddenly and seemed to be struggling with some emotion then he passed it to jacinta  you have good nerves miss brown he said if i had known it would come to this i think i would have left the cumbria there  jacinta took the letter in a steady hand but her face grew a trifle blanched as she read  i am going home with farquhar the message ran i could hardly go in a passenger boat and he is fixing me up a room by myself i didnt care to tell you when you were just shaking off the fever but one of my arms feels very much as that engineer said his did i am going to see if one of the big specialists or the tropical disease men can do anything for me  jacinta sat quite still a minute and then slowly rose  it is horrible but i suppose even a purpose of the kind he had does not exempt one from the consequences she said there are things to attend to you will excuse me just now  they looked at one another when she left them and then brown turned to jefferson  i wonder if you have any objections to showing me that note he said  it doesnt seem to be here said muriel what can she have done with it  dont worry about looking said jefferson sharply i can remember it it has in fact shaken a good deal of the stiffness out of me  muriel gasped with consternation when he told them and by and by the group broke up while it was a somewhat silent party that assembled for comida an hour later jacinta it was evident had very little appetite though she contrived to join in the somewhat pointless conversation and it was not until late that night brown came upon her alone on the flat roof she was leaning on the parapet and looking out across the sea but her eyes were turned northwards now and she did not hear him until he gently laid a hand upon her shoulder then she turned and looked at him with despair in her face she had not expected him or he would not have seen it though there was clear moonlight above them  brown sat down on the parapet and taking off his goldrimmed glasses held them in his hand  i think i understand my dear and i have something to say he said  jacinta made no disclaimer for one thing she saw it would have been useless and she had no strength left in her then  is it worth while she asked would anything that you could say change what has happened  no said brown reflectively i scarcely think it would still i would like to mention that we really dont know the thing is incurable in fact it may be a malady which is readily susceptible to the proper treatment and he has done wisely in going to england  a little gleam of hope crept into jacintas eyes i had hardly dared to think of that she said  well said brown i really fancy the thing may not be as serious as you and mr jefferson perhaps naturally seem to fear now as you know i was going to england about the new fruit contracts in a week or two and there is no particular reason why i shouldnt go the day after tomorrow i should make it my business to see mr austin has the best advice which can be got from the specialists in that country only my dear i want to ask a very plain question supposing he is curedwhat then  im afraid you must shape the question differently and a trace of colour crept into the whiteness of jacintas face  then i will tell you what i know you sent that man to africa and he went because he was in love with you he is also a man i have a considerable liking forand you are my only child i am getting old and would like to see you safely settled before i go there are and he made a little gesture occasions on which one must speak plainly  jacintas face was crimson at last but she in no way attempted to question the correctness of the announcement he had made  mr austin at least never told me what you seem to be so sure aboutand it is scarcely likely that he will ever do so now she said  brown smiled a little and tapped the palm of his hand with his glasses  my dear he said i think you know better of course you would never have admitted so much as you have done if i had not had you at a disadvantage tonight well the first thing is to see what can be done to cure him only if he comes back you will i suppose know your mind  he looked at her steadily and when jacinta lowered her eyes laid his hand gently on her arm again  i sail by the yellowfunnel boat the day after tomorrow he said     chapter xxx  jacinta capitulates   the carsegarry was not a fast vessel like most of the ocean tramp species she had been built to carry the largest possible cargo on a very moderate consumption of coal and speed was a secondary consideration she had also been in the warmer seas for some time with the result that every plate beneath her waterline was foul and as she fell in with strong northwest breezes she was an unusually long while on the way to liverpool austin was thus not astonished to find a letter from jefferson written four or five days after he left las palmas waiting him at farquhars brokers which made it evident that his comrade had got to work again  he smiled a trifle grimly as he read it for he fancied that its optimistic tone had cost jeffersonwho alluded to his apprehensions about his arm very brieflyan effort for the fact that he was asked to cable as soon as he had seen a doctor appeared significant the rest of the letter concerned financial affairs  we have had a rough preliminary survey and the result is distinctly encouraging he read after making a few temporary repairs i expect to bring her on to liverpool and there is every reason to believe we can dispose of her for a good round sum i could have got Â£10000 excargo as she lies here palm oil it also appears is scarce and dear at up to Â£30 the ton from which it seems to me that your share should approximate Â£7000 i have to mention that brown is on his way to liverpool and wants you to communicate with him at the address enclosed  this was satisfactory as far as it went the only trouble was that austin was very uncertain whether he would live to spend what he had so hardly earned his arm had become exceedingly painful during the voyage and after a consultation with the ship broker he telephoned an eminent specialist  i will expect you at two oclock the doctor said if it appears advisable we can of course avail ourselves as you suggest of any views the tropical disease men may favour us with in the meanwhile i will arrange for a gentleman who has made considerable progress in similar researches to meet you  austin went out of the brokers office with three hours to spare and wandered aimlessly about the city in a state of tense suspense he felt that he could not sit still and in any case he was dubious as to whether he was warranted in going back to the hotel indeed he wondered whether he had any right to be at large at all and after a while hung about the wharves where there was less chance of any one coming into perilous contact with him he had never spent such a morning in his life and decided that what he had done and borne in africa was not worth mention by comparison still the hours dragged by and at last he set out for the specialists surgery without daring to wonder what the result would be and found two gentlemen awaiting him there one of them who had grey hair and very keen eyes motioned him to a chair  now he said before we proceed to an examination it might be better if you told us concisely what happened to you in africa  austin who sat down did so and wondered a little that he was able to speak coherently and quietly for every nerve in him seemed tingling with tense anxiety then the man with the grey hair asked him a few terse questions about the negros appearance and when he had described it as well as he could remember glanced at his companion  do you recognise the symptoms he said  no said the other man who was younger there are one or two complaints not unusual in that country which appear to somewhat resemble it but they are seldom so virulent i would like to talk to mr austin about it later but in the meanwhile  exactly and the specialist made a little gesture mr austin is no doubt anxious to hear our opinion if you will permit me  he drew the jacket gently over austins swollen arm and the latter who held it out bare to the shoulder felt the perspiration start from him as he watched the doctors bend over the limb they said nothing for a space of seconds and austin fancied he would remember that time while he lived then to his astonishment the greyhaired man glanced at his companion with a little smile  i fancy this case has lost its special interest to you he said  the other man nodded it has he said our views evidently coincide  i would venture to point out that any decision you may have arrived at is naturally of considerable importance to me said austin a trifle sharply  the specialist smiled again i expect you will be pleased to hear that it is not a peculiarly african disease you are suffering from it is in fact no more than a by no means infrequent form of blood poisoning  austin gasped and felt his heart beat furiously from relief and the specialist waited a moment or two before he went on it is evident that you had several lacerations on your lower armmade by corroded iron or something of the kind  i tore the skin rather frequently working cargo and when the scars had partly healed opened up rather a nasty wound by falling on the steamers rail  exactly the result is not astonishing in the case of a man weakened by fever who has attempted to work harder than is advisable in a country like the one you mention in the meanwhile this arm is going to give you trouble and i should recommend you to go into the private ward of the  hospital i will telephone them if that would suit you  austin said he placed himself in the doctors hands and half an hour later was being driven to the hospital where the other man who was apparently anxious to know more about the negro asked permission to visit him he also came in due time but so far as austin could ascertain never quite decided what the negro was suffering from though he admitted that there were african troubles of the kind which were infectious  in the meanwhile austin realised how much he needed rest and how heavy the strain he had borne had been he did not even want to read and was languidly content to sit still and think of nothing until one day when it was evident that his arm was healing a nurse came in to announce a visitor  if its that doctor man you can tell him i cant remember anything more about the nigger and dont mean to try he said  the nurse laughed it isnt she said its a little gentleman with goldrimmed spectacles  austin started ah he said will you please tell them to send him in  in a few more minutes brown came in and sitting down shook his head reproachfully  you have really given your friends a good deal of anxiety and i was almost afraid i would have to go back without learning what had become of you he said still though i know the thing isnt fortunately what you thought it was the first question is how are you  recovering said austin with a smile i understand that my arm will be all right again very shortly it was a very usual trouble as you seem to recognise i let my imagination run away with me  i am very pleased to hear it why didnt you cable  i understood that you had left las palmas and jefferson was on the point of doing so i could scarcely suppose there was any one else who cared enough about what happened to me to make it necessary  brown looked at him with a curious little smile which austin found disconcerting there are mrs hatherly and muriel i almost think jacinta would have liked to know that you and jefferson were under a misapprehension too still that is perhaps not very important after all i suppose jefferson told you that he expects to get a good deal for the cumbria and her cargo  i was pleased to hear that my share might amount to Â£7000  brown took off his glasses and held them in one hand which as austin knew was a trick of his when he had anything on his mind  i am going to take a liberty he said have you decided yet what you will do with it  no that was one of the points i meant to wait a little before grappling with  well said brown reflectively there is something i could suggest but i would like to ask another question he stopped a moment and tapped the palm of one hand with his glasses why did you go out to africa  wouldnt the chance of winning Â£5000 which was what jefferson estimated my share would be appear a sufficient reason  no said brown drily not to me when he first made you the offer you wouldnt go  i went however when i heard that he was sick it was then a very natural thing that ought to satisfy you  i scarcely think it does  then if i had any other reasons though i am not exactly admitting it they concern myself alone  brown made a little gesture well he said i dont suppose it matters in the meanwhile you have once or twice asked my advice and now you have some Â£7000 and i understand dont know how to lay it out to the best advantage  exactly i dont feel the least desire to undertake the heaving off of any more steamers  brown leaned forward and tapped his hand with the glasses an enterprising man could do a good deal with Â£7000 it would for example buy him well call it a third share in a certain rather profitable fruit and wine business in las palmas that is of course on the understanding that he devoted his whole time and energy to it  austin gazed at him in blank astonishment for a moment or two and then a red flush crept into his face  i fancy a third share in the business you are evidently alluding to would be worth a good deal more than that he said  probably said brown with a trace of dryness that is i might get more for it but i have no intention of offering it to everybody i would like to ask your careful attention for a minute or two mr austin  he stopped a moment and his tone had changed when he proceeded there is nothing to be gained by hiding the fact that i am getting old and i begin to feel that i would like to take my life a little more easily he said indeed i want somebody i could have confidence in to do the hardest work for me i made the businessand i am a little proud of it it would not please me to let go of it altogetherand as a matter of fact i have been warned that if i retired to england the climate would probably shorten my life for me you are perhaps aware that i came out to the canaries originally because my constitution is not an excellent one  he stopped again and added with a certain significance i have however been told that my ailments are not likely to prove hereditary well as i mentioned i do not want to give the business up entirely and it would be a matter of grief to me to see it go to pieces in the hands of an incompetent manager that is why i have made you the offer  austin met his gaze steadily though the flush was still in his face i scarcely think anybody would call me an enterprising business man that is at least from the conventional english point of view  brown chuckled softly i believe you know as well as i do that a man of that kind would not be of the least use in spain they would drive him crazy and he would probably have insulted half his clients past forgiveness before he had been a month among them now you understand the spaniards and what is as much to the purpose they seem to like you  austin sat still looking at him and at last he saw that browns reserve was breaking down his hands seemed to be trembling a little and there were other signs of anxiety about him  i dont know why you have made me that offer sir he said there must be plenty of men more fitted to be the recipient of it  it is at least wholly unconditional and brown made a little gesture that curiously became him i may say that i had already satisfied myself about you or i should never have made it  then said austin a trifle hoarsely i can only thank youand endeavour to give you no cause for being sorry afterwards that you fixed on me  they had a little more to say but the nurse appeared during the course of it and informed brown that the surgeon was coming to dress austins arm  just a minute said the latter will you be kind enough to pass me that pad and pencil  she gave it to him and he scribbled hastily and then tore off the sheet and handed it to brown  i wonder if that message meets with your approval sir he said  brown put on his glasses and smiled as he read miss brown casabrown las palmas ran away without a cause almost well may i come back as your fathers partner  brown chuckled softly though there was a curious and somewhat unusual gentleness in his eyes  it has my full approbation though considering the cable companys charges isnt it a trifle loquacious  does that matter asked austin  brown laughed and grasped the hand he held out no he said i dont suppose it does after all these things only happen once in the average lifetime well i must evidently go now but i will come back to see what jacinta says tomorrow  he went out and that night austin got jacintas answer  come was all it said but austin was well content and though he was not a very sentimental man went to sleep with the message beneath his pillow  it was however rather more than three weeks later when as a yellowfunnelled mailboat slid into las palmas harbour austin leaning down from her rail saw jacinta and mrs hatherly in one of the crowding boats below the little lady discreetly remained where she was and when jacinta came up the ladder austin met her at the head of it she flashed a swift glance into his face and then for a moment turned hers aside  ah she said you have forgotten what i said to you and you are really well again  austin laughed a quiet exultant laugh i was never particularly ill but you know all that and we have ever so much more pleasant things to talk about he said in the meanwhile i fancy we are blocking up the gangway  holding the hand she had given him he drew her behind the deckhouse masterfully and looked down on her with a little smile  i almost think you are pleased to see me back he said  ah said jacinta if you only knew what the past few weeks have cost me  austin laying both hands on her shoulders stooped and kissed her twice that was worth going to africa for and if jefferson had only bought the cumbria sooner i would have ventured to do as much ever so long ago  there was apparently nobody else on that side of the deckhouse and jacinta who did not shake his grasp off looked up at him with shining eyes  you are quite sure of that she said  the wish to do so was almost irresistible the first time i saw you it has been growing stronger ever since  jacinta laughed softly though the crimson was in her cheeks still you would have mastered it you were always discreet you know and that was why at last iwho have hitherto told all my friends what they ought to dohad to let some one else make it clear how much i wanted you now you are going to think very little of me after that  my dear said austin you know there was only one thing which could have kept me away from you  as if that mattered and jacinta laughed scornfully now stoop a little though perhaps i shouldnt tell you and if you hadnt gone to africa of course i shouldnt have done it i knew when you went away how badly i wanted youand i would have done anything to bring you back however much it cost me  a couple of seamen carrying baggage appeared from behind the deckhouse just then which naturally cut short their confidences and austin made his way with jacintas hand upon his arm towards the boat he was a trifle bewildered as well as exultant for this was quite a new jacinta one in fact he had never encountered before she gave him another proof of it when he made an observation that afforded her the opening as they were rowed across the harbour  no she said quite disregarding mrs hatherly i am not going to give you any advice or instructions now you belong to me after managing everybody elses affairs successfully for ever so long i made a deplorable mess of my own you see  then what am i to do when we have difficulties to contend with said austin we may have a few now and
