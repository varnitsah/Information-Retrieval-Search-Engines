impatiently beside an opening in the hazel hedge that overhung the lane wisps of hay were strewn about it but already the nut bushes were sprinkled with the honeysuckles flowers beyond the hedge cornfields blotched with poppies and cropped meadows faded into the cold blueness of the east  ingleby looked out upon the prospect with a slight hardening of his face for he loved the quiet green country in which there was apparently no room for him but a little thrill of expectancy ran through him as he glanced back across the stile towards the little white village he had left a few minutes earlier a broad meadow shining with the tender green of the aftermath divided it from the lane and light laughter and a murmur of voices came faintly across the grass again a trace of grimness which seemed out of place there crept into his face and it was with a little resolute movement of his shoulders that he turned and raised his eyes to the dim blue ridge behind which burned the sunsets smoky red he vaguely felt that it was portentous and emblematical for that evening the brightness of the west seemed to beckon him  he had graciously been permitted to play for a somewhat exclusive club during the afternoon as well as to make himself useful handing round tea and carrying chairs because he played tennis well and the presidents wife had said that while there was a risk in admitting that kind of people young ingleby evidently knew his place and was seldom guilty of presumption this was true for ingleby was shrewd enough to realize that there were limits to the toleration extended him though the worthy lady would probably have been astonished had she known what his selfrepression occasionally cost him that a young man of his position should not esteem it a privilege to teach beginners and submit to be snubbed by any one of importance who happened to be out of temper had never occurred to her still he certainly knew his place and having played well to please himself and his partner had slipped away when the last game was over since he understood that the compliments were not for him  suddenly his heart beat a trifle faster as a figure appeared in the meadow it was a girl of about his own age which did not greatly exceed twenty who carried herself well and moved it seemed to him with a gracefulness he had never noticed in any other woman she wore a white hat with red poppies on it and he noticed that the flowers he had diffidently offered her were still tucked in the belt of the light grey dress she was walking slowly and apparently did not see him in the shadow so that when she stopped a moment with her hand upon the stile he could although he felt the presumption of it look at her steadily  there were excuses for him since any one with artistic perceptions would have admitted that grace coulthurst made a sufficiently attractive picture as she stood with the white clover at her feet and the glow of the west upon her face it was warm in colouring and almost too cleanly cut but essentially english with a suggestion of pride and vigour in it the eyes were grey and perhaps a trifle too grave and imperious considering her age the clustering hair beneath the white hat shone in the sunset a gleaming bronze she was also very dainty though that did not detract from the indefinite something in the pose of the shapely head and figure which the lad vaguely recognized as patrician the term did not please him indeed it was one he objected to but he could think of nothing more appropriate and as he watched her he became almost astonished at his temerity ingleby was young and fancied he knew his own value but he was also acquainted with the unyielding nature of social distinction and it was wholly respectful homage he paid grace coulthurst she was major coulthursts daughter and a young woman of some local importance when she saw ingleby a faint tinge of warmer colour crept into her face for just a moment  he swung off his straw hat and held it at his knee as he raised a hand to her and though his deference was perhaps a trifle overdone it was redeemed by its genuineness and did not displease her  i was afraid you would never come he said  the girl descended the stile before she looked at him and then there was a suggestion of stiffness in her attitude for the speech which seemed to imply something of the nature of an appointment was not a tactful one  why did you think i would come this way at all she said  i dont know said ingleby with a trace of confusion of course there wasnt any reason still i hoped you would that was why i waited  grace coulthurst said nothing for a moment it was though she would never have admitted it not altogether by accident that she had met and walked home with him somewhat frequently during the past month  as it happened i was almost going round by the road with lilian fownes she said  young ingleby as she did not fail to notice set his lips for miss fownes had on that and other occasions been accompanied by her accomplished brother who was an adept at graceful inanities  then i should not have seen youand i especially wanted to he said  his voice had a little uncertain note in it and grace glanced at him sharply in that case why did you run away as soon as the game was over  dont you know and inglebys laugh had a trace of bitterness in it when it is over they dont want me of course we helped them to win but that was what i was there forthat and nothing morewhile you played splendidly you see one depends so much upon his partner  does he  of course and ingleby lost his head nowi dont mean at tennis onlyi could do almost anything with you to encourage me still that is evidently out of the questionlike the rest  he concluded somewhat incoherently for he realized that this was going too far and in his embarrassment naturally made matters worse by the attempted qualification still though the girls colour was a trifle higher she was not altogether displeased and felt that there was perhaps some excuse for his confidence as she glanced at him covertly walter ingleby was not remarkably different from most other young englishmen but he had a sturdy well setup figure and an expressive and by no means unattractive face with broad forehead fearless blue eyes and a certain suggestive firmness of his mouth he had also a trick of looking at one steadily with his head held well erect and then speaking with a curious clipped curtness it was a trifling mannerism which nevertheless carried with it a suggestion of vigour and straightforwardness just then there was a little scintillation in his eyes and he looked like one who had at least the courage to attempt a good deal  well she said in a noncommittal fashion we certainly won the match and i think you were wrong to slip away one would almost fancy that you are unduly sensitive now and then  ingleby laughed perhaps i am but it isnt so very astonishing that i should occasionally resent a slight that isnt meant when there are so many of them that certainly are no doubt its my own fault i should have known what to expect when i crept into the exclusive tennis club at holtcar  then i wonder why you joined it at all  so do i at times still i wanted to see what people of position and refinement were really like and to learn anything they might be inclined to teach me i was ambitious you seeand besides i was really fond of the game  and you were disappointed when you met them  ingleby made a little expressive gesture chiefly in myself i thought i was strong enough not to mind being treated as a professional and politely ignored except when i was useful then i imagined it would be excellent discipline and discipline is presumably good for one as the worthy vicar who really appears to have ideas is fond of observing  again the girl glanced at him sharply with a faint but perceptible arching of her brows  isnt that a trifle patronizing she said you cant be very much older than i am and he has at least seen a good deal of the world  ingleby laughed frankly though there was a little flush in his face i know i very often talk like a fooland the difference between you and the others is that you very seldom think it necessary to remind me of it that is of course one difference the rest  i think said the girl severely we were talking about the vicar  well said ingleby i really believe he means well but he is after all part of the system and naturally interested in maintaining the existing state of things we have in england a few great bolsteredup professions one could almost call them professional rings and the men fortunate enough to enter them are more or less compelled to play into one anothers hands the millions who dont belong to them are of course outsiders and couldnt be expected to count you see  the girl stiffened perceptibly and really looked very patrician as she turned and regarded him indignantly  you appear to forget that my father belongs to one of those professions she said  he did corrected ingleby and then stopped abruptly as he remembered it was reputed that it was not exactly by his own wish major coulthurst no longer actively served his nation  i wonder if you have deliberately made up your mind to offend me asked grace coulthurst with icy quietness  you know i would cut my hand off sooner than do anything i thought would vex you ingleby answered im afraid i talk too much but i cant help it now and then there are you see so few people who will listen to me seriously unless you are content to adopt the accepted point of view everybody seems to think it his duty to put his foot on you  graces anger was usually shortlived for she had a generous nature as well as a sense of humour and the lads naive admission appealed to the latter  well she said with a little gleam in her eyes i really think i at least have listened to you with patience but your views are likely to lead you into trouble where did you get them  ingleby laughed to tell the truth i often wonder myself in any case it wasnt from my father he was a staunch and consistent churchman and kept a little book shop you can see it in the high street now he sold booksand papers behind the counter i would like you to remember this still as i said he was consistent and there was literature he would not handle nor when they made him a councillor would he wink at certain municipal jobbery the latter fact was duly remembered when his lease fell in as well as on other occasions and when he died when i was fourteen there was nothing left for me he was a scholar and an upright manas well as a tory of the old school and a high churchman  is it very unusual for a scholar to be either of the latter then  well said ingleby with a little twinkle in his eyes one would almost fancy that it ought to be however you cant be in the least interested in these fancies of mine shall i gather you that spray of blossom  grace looked curiously at him instead of at the paletinted honeysuckle whose sweetness hung about them she was quite aware that he had somewhat eccentric views and it was perhaps his originality which had attracted her when prompted chiefly by pity for the lad who was usually left out in the cold she had made his acquaintance but her interest in him had increased with suspicious rapidity considering that it was only a month or two since she had delicately made the first overtures she was quite willing to admit that she had made them for she had understood and under the circumstances sympathized with the lads original irresponsiveness which had vanished when he saw that her graciousness sprang from a kindly nature and was unspoiled by condescension and grace coulthurst could afford to do what other young women of her age at holtcar would have shrunk from she had also a certain quiet imperiousness which made whatever she did appear fitting  i am afraid you are an inveterate radical she said  i scarcely think that goes quite far enough as radicalism seems to be understood by its acknowledged leaders blatant is the adjective usually hurled at us and no doubt i deserve it as witness what you have endured tonight still you see i wasnt talking quite without a purpose because i want you to understand my attitudeand that brings me to the point im afraid i cant play with you at the tournament as was arranged  no said grace a trifle sharply for she was very human and after somewhat daringly showing favour to the man of low degree it was a trifle galling to discover that he failed to appreciate it you have presumably something that pleases you better to do that day  ingleby turned partly away from her and glanced across the valley no he said with unusual quietness i think you know that could not be i am in fact going away  grace was a trifle startled as well as more concerned than she would have admitted and had ingleby been looking at her he might have seen this it had not been exactly pleasant to hear that he was an advanced democrat for while by no means unduly conventional she had an inborn respect for established customs and procedure and she felt that the existing condition of affairs while probably not beyond improvement might be made considerably worse at least so far as she and her friends were concerned still it was disconcerting to find that he was going away for there would then be no opportunity for teaching himindirectly of coursethe erroneous nature of his views this at least was the reason she offered herself  where are you going she asked with studied indifference  ingleby swung around with head tilted a trifle backwardsshe knew that unconscious pose and the little gleam in his eyes which usually accompanied itand looked across the cool bluegreen meadows towards the fading splendours of the west  out there where men are equal as they were made to be and the new lands are too wide for the cramped opinions and prejudices that crush one here then he turned to the girl with a little laugh i wish you would say something quietly stinging i deserve it for going off in that way again still i really felt it  do you think i could and graces tone was severe  ingleby was even more contrite than she expected it was absurd to suggest it you could never say an unkind or cutting thing to anybody in fact your kindness is the one pleasant memory i shall carry away with me iyou see  he pulled himself up abruptly but the colour was in his cheeks and the little thrill in his voice again while it seemed only natural that the girl should smile prettily  i wonder she said if one might ask you why you are going  the lane was growing dusky now and grace as it happened held a white glove and a fold of the silvery grey skirt in an uncovered hand for the dew was settling heavily upon the grass between the wheel ruts ingleby did not look at her  i dont think i could make you understand how sordid and distasteful my life here isand it cant be changed he said every door is closed against the man with neither friends nor money he must be taught his place and stay in it dragging out his life in hopeless drudgery while i  he stopped again and then looked his companion steadily in the face i have found out in the last month how much life has to offer one who has the courage to make a bold bid for what he is entitled to  and you expect to make it out therewhich presumably means america or canada  they had reached an oaken door in a mossy wall and ingleby stood still yes he said slowly i intend to make it there life holds so muchi did not know how much a little while agoand there are alluring possibilities if one has the courage to break away from the groove prejudice and tradition force him into here i may never see you againunless i am successful i think i never shall would it be a very great presumption if i asked you for something a trifle to carry away with me  he stood looking down upon her with a curious wistfulness in his face and grace afterwards tried to believe that it was by accident she dropped her glove just then in any case next moment young ingleby stooped and when he straightened himself again he not only held the glove exultantly fast but the hand she had stretched out for it then a patch of vivid crimson showed in grace coulthursts cheek as they stood face to face in the summer twilightthe lad of low degree with tingling nerves and throbbing heart and the girl of station rudely shaken out of her accustomed serenity in those few moments they left their youth behind and crossed the mystic threshold into the ampler life of man and woman  then ingleby swinging off his straw hat let the little hand go and looked at the girl steadily  if that was wrong you will have a long while in which to forgive me he said if i live and prosper out there i will bring you back the glove againand whatever happens you cannot prevent my carrying your memory away with me  then he turned away looked back still bareheaded and with a little resolute shake of his shoulders swung away down the darkening lane while grace inserted a key in the oaken door with somewhat unsteady fingers she was as yet neither pleased nor angry but bewildered and only certain that he had gone and her face was burning still     ii  ingleby stands by his opinions   it was late on saturday night and unpleasantly hot in the little dingy room where ingleby sat with a companion beneath the slates of a tall fourstory house in a busy clothmaking town there were several large holes in the threadbare carpet and a portion of the horsehair stuffing protruded from the dilapidated sofa while the rickety chairs and discoloured cloth on the table were equally suggestive of severe economy a very plain bookcase hung on the wall and the condition of the historical works and treatises on political economy it contained seemed to indicate that they had been purchased secondhand while an oil lamp burned dimly on the mantel for the room was almost intolerably stuffy already and the gas supplied at hoddam was bad and dear a confused murmur of voices came up from the narrow street below with the clatter of heavy shoes and the clamour of the cheapjacks in the neighbouring market square  ingleby who had taken off his jacket lay in a decrepit armchair holding a slip of paper in his hand opposite him sat another young man with the perspiration beaded on his face which was sallow and somewhat hollow he was watching ingleby with a faint smile in his eyes  the little excursion doesnt seem to commend itself to you he said  no answered ingleby drily i cant say it does i had looked forward to spending a quiet day on the moors tomorrow it will in all probability be the last sunday i shall ever pass in this country besides considering that i dont even belong to the society this notice is a trifle peremptory why should the committee confidently expect my cooperation in enforcing the right of way through willow dene i certainly did not tell anybody to keep me a place in the wagonette which they are good enough to intimate has been done  still after that speech you made you will have to go youre in sympathy with the movement anyway  ingleby made a little impatient gesture i dont know what came over me that night and to tell the truth leger ive been almost sorry i got up ever since it was in one way an astonishing piece of assurance and i cant help a fancy that most of those who heard me must have known a good deal more about the subject than i did  its not altogether improbable and his companion laughed in fact twice when you made a point i heard a man behind me quoting your authorities still they didnt expect you to be original  one or two of the others certainly were but thats not quite the question of course there is no excuse for the closing of willow dene but driving out in wagonettes on sunday doesnt quite appeal to me its over three miles too unfortunately one has after all to consider popularprejudiceyou see  leger was slight of physique and of wholly undistinguished appearance as well as shabbily dressed but there was a hint of rather more than intelligence in his sallow face and he had expressive brown eyes a little twinkle crept into them just then  i can remember occasions when it seemed to please you to fly in the face of them but your thoroughness isnt altogether above suspicion now and then one has to be one thing or the other  you know my opinions  oh yes said leger smiling most of your acquaintances do it would be a little astonishing if they didnt still you have a few effete aristocratic notions clinging about you why shouldnt we drive out on sunday with the traditional crimson neckties and clay pipes if it pleases us even if our presence is no great improvement to the scenery when it ought to be clear that we cant go any other day besides what is a man of your opinions doing with those luxuries yonder  he pointed to inglebys tennis flannels and black swimming costume which hung behind the door ingleby laughed  are cleanliness and decency quite out of keeping with democratic views im fond of swimming and the only place where i can get into the river now is the big pool beside the thorndale road its a trifle public even at seven a m but my landlady objects to my bathing here and since i cant afford the necessary apparatus i dont blame her she says it brings the plaster off the lower ceilings and i really think it does  there is the establishment provided by a beneficent municipality  where they charge you sixpence  leger nodded sixpence he said is certainly a consideration still there are days on which one can obtain a sufficiency of water for half the sum the plunge bath is i believe forty feet long  it is the quality and not the quantity to which i object  leger shook his head reproachfully im afraid those effete prejudices are still very strong in you you play tennis too how much does that cost you  its a question im not going to answer and ingleby flushed hotly anyway ive had full value for the money  leger smiled in a curious fashion as he looked at him but he changed the subject and pointed to the pamphlet on the floor what do you think of the new apostles speeches  a little sparkle crept into inglebys eyes they are he said slowly almost a revelation even on paper one feels the passion and the truth in them the mans a genius and you have to believe in him i could fancy him doing anything he liked with you if you came in contact with him  it is not quite out of the question it was an oregon paper that first printed what he had to say and i believe that state is on the pacific slope where you are going you evidently still mean to go  yes said ingleby shortly what chance is there for meor any of ushere  leger threw up the window and looked into the street the lights of a big gin palace flared down in the narrow gap and a stream of perspiring humanity flowed along beneath them slatternly women and men with flattened chests and shoulders bent by unhealthy toil jostling one another the garish brilliancy touched their pallid faces and the harsh murmur of their voices came up hollowly between the tall houses with the reek of gas fumes and other confused odours there were many poor in hoddam and in hot weather bargains were to be had in the neighbouring market at that hour while trade was bad just then and a little lower down the street shadowy figures were flitting into a pawnbrokers door legers face grew a trifle weary as he watched them  at the best it is a poor one he said one feels inclined to wonder ifthisis to last forever  its too big a question give it up and come out with me  and let the powers that be have it all their own way said leger  im afraid neither you nor i can prevent them besides from what this american says there seem to be people with grievances out yonder too a good many of them in fact i expect there are everywhere  leger smiled i wonder he said whether that has just dawned on you still im not so strong as you areand theres hetty youll have to go alone but youll leave at least two people behind you who will think of you often  he stopped abruptly for there was a patter of feet on the stairway and ingleby rose as the door swung open and a girl came in she carried a basket and appeared a trifle breathless for the stairs were steep but her dress was tasteful and most men would have admitted that she was pretty she took the chair ingleby drew out and smiled at him  do you know that the people downstairs would hardly let me in she said you seem to be very well looked after but i knew you wouldnt mind me ive come for tom  ingleby laughed but it was a trifle uneasily for he was young and by no means the girls equal in the matter of selfpossession in fact one had only to look at hetty leger to recognize that she was capable and could be on occasion a trifle daring for there was courage as well as cheerfulness in her clear blue eyes which met ones glance steadily from under dark and unusually straight brows  you have been marketing he said  hetty nodded yes she answered you can if you know how to go about it get provisions cheap after ten oclock on saturday night and i have had the usual difficulty in making ends meet this week wouldnt it be a relief to live in a country where there was no rent to pay and you take a spade and grow what you want to eat  inglebys going where they do something of that kind though i believe they now and then dig up gold and silver too said her brother  hetty for no ostensible reason pulled up one of her little cotton gloves which did not seem to need it and then looked quietly at ingleby  then you are going away she asked  her brother nodded yes he said to the pacific slope of north america he was just suggesting that we should come too  hetty sat silent for several moments  well she said at last  i told him it couldnt be thought of for one thing it would cost a good deal of money  hetty glanced swiftly at ingleby and an older man might have noticed the suppressed intentness in her face  im afraid tom is rightthough i wish you could come he said when i mentioned it i didnt remember that he isnt very strong and that it must be a very rough country for an englishwoman you wouldnt care to live in a log hut forty miles from anywhere hetty  the girl now looked straight in front of her no i suppose not but as i shall never get the chance that doesnt matter well i think you are wise to go there are already more of us here than there seems to be any use for  ingleby almost fancied that there was something slightly unusual in her voice but her face was impassive and she rose with a little smile  it is getting late tom she said you are both going to the demonstration tomorrow  ingleby said they were and hetty waited a moment apparently doing something to her hat when her brother who took the basket passed out of the room she had a pretty figure and the pose she fell into with one rounded arm raised and a little hand busy with the hatpin was not unbecoming she was also on excellent terms with ingleby who leaned against the mantel watching her until she shook the hat a trifle impatiently when he stepped forward  if you want the thing put straight let me try he said  then to his astonishment the hand he had laid upon the hat was snatched away and next moment hetty with a red spot in her cheek stood at least a yard away from him she had moved so quickly that he was not quite sure how she had got there  do you think i am less particular thanany one else  no answered ingleby contritely with a trace of confusion certainly not i would never have offered only we are such old friends and i think that when you brought that hat home after buying it you let me put it on for you  hettys face was still a trifle flushed but she laughed that she said was a long time ago but after all we neednt quarrel in fact i let tom go on because i had something to ask you  of course anything i can do  hetty smiled sardonically oh yes i know still its really very littleor i wouldnt ask you just to look after tom tomorrow now he has in most ways a good deal more sense than you  i can believe it said ingleby it really isnt very astonishing  still you are stronger than he is and he hasnt been very well since he took up the night work at the mill if there should be any trouble you will look after him  ingleby promised and hearing her brother reascending the stairway the girl swiftly flitted out of the room while ingleby sat down to consider with the warmth still in his face for he was not quite pleased with himself and as a natural result a trifle vexed with hetty it was true he admitted that the girl had made a somewhat enticing picture as she stood with face partly turned from him and one hand raised to her head but it was he decided merely the brotherly kindness he had always felt for her which had prompted his offer and it was unpleasant to feel that he had done anything that might hurt her selfrespect still he could not understand why this should be so since she had undoubtedly permitted him to put the hat on and admire her in it not so very long ago and he failed to discover any reason why she should in the meanwhile have grown stricter in her views as to what was fitting nor could he understand her question which suggested that she considered herself entitled to at least as much deference as a person she preferred not to name  then remembering that most young women were subject to unaccountable fancies now and then he dismissed the matter as of no importance after all and once more busied himself with the americans speeches they were certainly stirring and made the more impression because he was unacquainted with western hyperbole but there was in them as wiser men had admitted the ring of genuine feeling as well as a logical vindication of democratic aspirations ingleby was young and his blood warmed as he read while hetty leger as she walked home through the hot streets of the still noisy town with her brother was for once curiously silent and almost morose though considering the life she led she was usually a cheerful girl  it was not much quieter on the following afternoon when ingleby who partly as a protest against the decrees of conventionality wore a soft cap and his one suit of light summer tweed met leger on the doorstep of the committee rooms of a certain society several big wagonettes were already drawn up and men with pallid faces sat in them neatly attired for the most part though somewhat to inglebys annoyance several of them smoked clay pipes and wore brilliant neckties and hard felt hats he was quite aware that it was unreasonable of him to object to this but nevertheless he could not help it they were however quiet and orderly enough and indulged in no more than goodhumoured badinage with the crowd that had assembled to see them off but ingleby felt inclined to protest when leger led him to a place on the boxseat of the foremost vehicle where a man was scattering leaflets among the crowd  couldnt we sit anywhere else he asked its a little conspicuous here  leger shook his head that cant be helped he said its the penalty of making speeches you are considered one of the stalwarts now theres no use in objecting to the result when you have been guilty of the cause you know  ill be especially careful another time said ingleby with a little grimace in the meanwhile im ready to do anything you can reasonably expect of me  then there was a cracking of whips and a rattle of wheels and the discordant notes of a cornet broke through the semiironical cheer and as they rolled across the river which foul with the refuse of tanneries and dyeworks crept out of the closepacked town a man who sat on the bridge waved his hat to the leading driver  take them straight to the lockup jim he said it will save everybody trouble and whats the use of going round  then they wound through dusky woods out of the hot valley and down the long white road across a sunbaked moor where the dust whirled behind them in a rolling cloud however the men in the foremost vehicle got little of it and ingleby felt that the drive would have been pleasant in different circumstances as he watched the blue hills that rose in the dazzling distance blurred with heat only one white fleecy cloud flecked the sweep of cerulean and the empty moor lay still under the drowsy silence of the sunday afternoon it seemed to him most unfitting that the harsh voices of his companions the clatter of hoofs and the doleful tooting of the cornet should jar upon it then as they dipped into a hollow they came upon other travellers all heading in the same direction who hurled somewhat pointed jests at them as they passed but these did not exactly resemble the men in the wagonettes their attire was by no means neat and they had not in the least the appearance of men about to discharge a duty while several of them carried heavy sticks  i wonder what they mean to do with those bludgeons said ingleby a trifle uneasily  leger laughed i have no doubt they would come in handy for killing pheasants there are i believe a good many young ones down in the dene of course the committee could very well dispense with the company of those fellows but we cant prevent any man from asserting his rights as a briton  that said ingleby grimly is in one respect almost a pity the difficulty is that somebody will get the credit of our friends doings  of course and leger laughed again you cant be a reformer for nothing you have to take the rough with the smooththough there is as a rule very little of the latter  ingleby said nothing further but it dawned on him as it had indeed done once or twice before that even a defective system of preserving peace and order might be preferable to none at all still he naturally would not admit his misgivings and said nothing until the wagonettes rolled into a little white village gay with flowers and girt about by towering beeches the windows of an old grey house caught the sunlight and flashed among the trees and as the vehicles drew up a trim groom on a splendid horse swept out through the gate of a clematiscovered lodge  then there was a hoarse cheer from a group of dilapidated and dusty loungers as the men swung themselves down outside the blackbeamed hostelry which bore a coatofarms above its portal they were unusually quiet and leger who glanced at them touched inglebys shoulder  theyll do their work he said still i fancy we are expected and im not sure that id be sorry if we had the thing done and were driving home again     iii  conflicting claims   the sunlight beat down fiercely on the shaven grass and a drowsy hum of bees stole through the stillness of the sunday afternoon when grace coulthurst and geoffrey esmond strolled across the lawn at holtcar grange there were at least two acres of it flanked by dusky firs and relieved on two sides by patches of graduated colour while on the third side one looked out towards the blue hills across the deep hollow of willow dene into which the beech woods rolled down a low wall along which great urns of scarlet geraniums were set cut off the lawn from the edge of the descent and grace seating herself on the broad coping glanced down into the cool shadow out of which the sound of running water came up  it really looks very enticing on a day like this dont you think it is a little hard on the hoddam people to shut them out of it she said  her companion who leaned with his straw hat tilted back against one of the flowerfilled urns smiled as he glanced down at her he was a young man of slender wiry frame with an air of graceful languidness which usually sat well upon him though there were occasions on which it was not readily distinguished from wellbred insolence  i suppose it is but they brought it upon themselves he said nobody would mind their walking quietly through the dene even if they did leave their sandwich papers and their bottles behind them  i have seen wire baskets provided in such places said grace  the young owner of holtcar grange laughed so have i in fact i tried it here and put up a very civil notice pointing out what they were for the hoddam people however evidently considered it an unwarrantable interference with their sacred right to make as much mess of another persons property as they pleased for soon after the baskets arrived we found that somebody had taken the trouble to collect them and deposit them in the lake  a gardener could however pick up a good many papers in an afternoon  it would naturally depend upon how hard he worked and as you may have noticed undue activity is not a characteristic of anybody at the grange still it would be several years before he made a young holly from which the leading stem had been cut out grow again besides which the proletariat apparently consider themselves entitled to dig up the primroses and daffodils by basketfuls with spades  grace was not greatly interested in the subject but it at least was safe and geoffrey esmonds conversation had hitherto taken a rather more personal turn than she cared about  still you could spare them a few wild flowers she said  she turned and glanced across the velvet lawn towards the old grey house flanked by its ancient trees the sunlight lay bright upon its timemellowed façade and was flung back from the halfhidden orchid houses and vineries esmond apparently understood her and for a moment his eyes rested curiously upon her face  you mean i have rather more than my share of what most people long for still you ought to know that nobody is ever quite content and that what one has only sets one wishing for more  grace laughed one would certainly fancy that you had quite enough alreadybut i wonder if one might ask you if you have heard from reggie lately  esmonds face hardened a trifle you at least might he does not write oftennaturallythough i always had a fancy that reggie mightnt after all have been so very much to blame as most people seem to think anyway we had a letter a few weeks ago and he had got his commission in the canadian mounted police he ought to be thankfulin the circumstances  i am pleased to hear it and a just perceptible trace of colour showed in graces cheeks it is rather a coincidence that my father who went up to london a week ago came back with the expectation of obtaining a government post in western canada a crown commissioner on the new goldfields i think he was in charge of a mining district in western africa you know i should probably go to canada with him  then one would sincerely hope that major coulthurst will get a post at home  he stopped perhaps warned by something in his companions attitude and she deftly turned the subject back to the grievance the hoddam people thought they had against him the fact that they had apparently a good deal to say to each other had in the meanwhile not escaped attention a few lounge chairs had been laid out about a little table in the shadow of a big chestnut and from one of them a lady of some importance in that vicinity watched the pair with distinct disapprobation holtcar grange was but a portion of young esmonds inheritance and she had several daughters of her own she frowned as she turned to the lady nearest her  that girl she said acidly is making excellent use of her opportunities it does not appear to matter which one it is so long as he belongs to the family  her companion looked up languidly the drift of that last remark is not especially plain  it would have been if you had seen what went on before reggie esmond went or rather was sent out to canada the major was in africa then and the girl was staying here she was only just out of the schoolroom but that did not prevent her attaching herself to reggie it was only when he was no longer worth powder and shot that she turned her attention to his cousin  this as it happened was very little nearer the truth than such statements usually are when made by a matron who has an unappreciated daughters future to provide for but the lady who heard it understood the reason for her companions rancour  grace coulthurst she said is pretty and has really an excellent style besides her father evidently has means of his own  the first speaker smiled compassionately major coulthurst thrives upon his debts he threw away what little money he had in speculation then he got himself sent out to west africa and either allowed the niggers too much of their own way or worried them unnecessarily for they turned out and killed some of their neighbours who worked at the mines that resulted in black troops being sent up and coulthurst who led them into a swamp they couldnt get across was afterwards quietly placed upon the shelf in fact i believe he pins his hopes upon the men appointed by the new government remembering their unfortunate friends  that remarked her companion drily is after all what a good many of us seem to think the government is there for  she might have said more but a little blackrobed lady and a burly redfaced man with a merry twinkle in his eyes and a tinge of grey in his hair appeared just then the latter held himself well and did not in the least look like a man who had borne much responsibility in pestilential africa as a matter of fact major coulthurst who was by no means brilliant either as administrator or soldier took his cares lightly  and you fancy you will get the appointment asked mrs esmond looking up at him  i hope so said coulthurst i really think the people in office ought to do something for me i contrived to save them a good deal of trouble with the french on the frontier still i dont know what to do with grace if i get it though i had thoughts of taking her out to canada  mrs esmond appeared to reflect for a moment or two  is there any reason why you shouldnt leave her here she said i think i took good care of her before  they had almost reached the table where the others sat and coulthurst stopped with a shadow of perplexity in his sunburnt face he was a widower with insufficient means and had one or two somewhat pointed letters from importunate creditors in his pocket then he had also been a friend of mrs esmonds for more than twenty years but though by no means fastidious in some respects there were points on which he possessed a certain delicacy of sentiment  i almost think there is grace you see is older now he said  mrs esmond looked up and as it happened grace coulthurst and geoffrey esmond came slowly towards them across the lawn just then the young mans gaze was fixed upon the girl but she was looking away from him which increased the suggestiveness of his attitude and expression for both of those who watched them could see his face grace was indeed distinctly pretty and that afternoon the indefinite but unmistakable attribute which the woman who had defended her termed good style was especially noticeable it was expressed in the poise of the little head the erect carriage and even the fashion in which the light draperies hung in flowing lines about the shapely figure then the blackrobed lady turned and looked at coulthurst steadily  yes he said though she had not spoken her mother would have known what was rightand fitting but since she was taken from me i feel ita responsibility to say the least  could you not trust me  in everything that is unless it was to your own disadvantageor what would certainly be regarded so you mean me to be frank i think  of course in any case i am not sure that you are capable of concealing your sentiments  then said coulthurst gravely i should like you to remember that grace has nothing  mrs esmond smiled and geoffrey has a good deal still we have it on excellent authority that the value of a good woman is above rubies  major coulthurst was redfaced and burly and usually abrupt in his movements but his attitude became him as he made his companion a little grave inclination  grace is very like her motheri cannot say more than that  perhaps it was not very tactful though he did not know what the gossips had whispered when he was a reckless subaltern long ago in any case he had married a woman with as few possessions as he himself had and his life had been a hard one ever since his companion however smiled somewhat curiously  i think she is in many ways like her father too but that is scarcely the point she said i have offered to take care of her for you  well said coulthurst quietly when the time comes we will try to decide and in the meanwhile i can only thank you  then they joined the others and for awhile sat talking in the shade until geoffrey esmond who had taken his place beside them looked up suddenly with a curious contraction of his face  i am almost afraid we are going to have some undesirable visitors he said  from beyond the trees that shut the lawn off from the village there rose the tooting of a cornet which was followed by a cheer and a rattle of wheels then there was a murmur of harsh voices which broke portentously through the slumbrous quietness and esmond rising abruptly glanced at the major who walked a little apart with him esmond looked worried  yes he said in answer to the majors questioning glance i fancy they are coming to pull my gates and fences down roberts the groom heard enough in hoddam to suggest that they were plotting something of the kind and i told him to have a horse saddled though i didnt quite believe it myself there are however evidently several wagonetteloads of them yonder  the question is said coulthurst sharply do you mean to let them in  the young man laughed i should almost have fancied it was unnecessary including the keepers i can roll up six men that makes eight with you and me while leslie who is a magistrate as you know lives scarcely two miles away  then you had better send for him eight men with the law behind them should be quite enough to hold off the rabblethat is so long as no blow is struck but you will excuse my mentioning that you will require to keep a firm hand on your temper  ill try though i have been told it isnt a very excellent one said the younger man now if you will beguile the women into the house ill make arrangements  coulthurst was not a clever man but he contrived to accomplish it and it was some twenty minutes later when he and esmond walked down a path beneath the beeches with four or five men behind them the major carried a riding whip and there was a curious little smile in his eyes while the rest had sticks though in accordance with his instructions they made no display of them the wood was shadowy and very still and there was no sound but that made by startled rabbits until they came out into the sunlight where a spiked railing crossed a narrow glade there was a mossy path beyond it chequered with patches of cool shadow and a group of dusty men were moving down it towards the padlocked gate the foremost of them stopped when they saw the party from the grange and then after a whispered consultation came on again  where are you going asked esmond  into the dene said one of the strangers  you have been to the lodge to ask permission  no said another hot and perspiring man we havent it isnt necessary  im afraid it is said esmond quietly in fact there is a board to that effect a few yards back no doubt you noticed it  the man laughed we did it isnt there now we pulled it up  esmond flushed a trifle then if you ever wish to get into the dene i think you made a mistake he said still as you cant get any farther today you may as well go back this gate is locked  that dont count said somebody well have it off its hinges inside five minutes  the lad swung round sharply towards the speaker but coulthurst laid a restraining hand upon his arm steady he said and raised his voice a trifle now look here my men you certainly cant come in and youll only get yourselves into trouble by trying this is private property  of course said one of the strangers everything is youve got the land and youve got the waterone cant even bathe in the river now its not your fault you cant lay hands on the air and sunshine too  there was an approving murmur from his comrades and esmond shook off the majors grasp  that is rot he said willow dene belongs to me and you are certainly not coming in i dont feel inclined to explain my reasons for keeping you out of it and its quite probable you wouldnt understand them have you brought any responsible person to whom one could talk along with you  the languid insolence in his even tone had an effect which a flood of invective might have failed to produce and once more there was a murmur from the crowd while a man with a grim dustsmeared face held up a bludgeon  weve brought these and theyre good enough he said  then the men moved a little and there were cries of let him have a chance as a young man pushed his way through them he was plainly and neatly dressed and carried nothing in his hand  im sorry our committee is not here to lay our views before you mr esmond which was what we had intended but if you will try to look at the thing sensibly it will save everybody trouble he said  what has become of the worthy gentlemen werent they capable of walking from the griffin asked esmond drily it really isnt very far  the young man did not appear to notice the jibe the fact is we had a little dispute among ourselves he said the views of the committee didnt quite coincide with those of the rest but since the committee is not here i should like to point out that the hoddam people have passed through the dene without hindrance for at least twenty years and as that gives them a legal right of way they mean to continue doing it now if you will make no opposition we will promise that no damage whatever will be done to your property  dont you worry about the concerned committee said a voice from the crowd its got the sulks only two turned out were going by what mr leger says  esmond glanced at the man in front of him with a little sardonic smile i have only your assurance and im afraid it would scarcely be wise to place more confidence in your friends than their leaders seem to have done their appearance is unfortunately against them  there were cries of stop it leger youre wasting time tell him to get out of the way were coming in  the young man raised his hand i believe they mean it mr esmond now there are two sensible courses open to you unlock that gate and make no further opposition or stand aside while we lift it off its hinges and then proceed against us for trespassing you will if you are wise make no attempt to prevent our getting in  there was a moments silence and the little knot of men behind the gate and the crowd outside watched each others faces one or two were evidently uneasy others a trifle grim but there was a portentous murmur from the dusty rabble farther back in the shadow then young esmond laughed in an unpleasant fashion as he drew the lash of his dogwhip suggestively through his hand  whoever lays a hand upon this gate will take the consequences he said  coulthurst touched his shoulder and said something in his ear but the young man moved away from him impatiently  am i to be dictated to by this rabble let them come he said  the major made a little gesture of resignation well he said if you are determined to make trouble i think you will get your wish  then the front of the crowd split up and several men came out from it carrying between them what appeared to be the post to which the noticeboard had been nailed they came on at a ran and disregarding the majors warning swung it like a battering ram next moment there was a crash the gate rattled but still held fast while the lash of esmonds dogwhip curled round one mans hand he loosed his hold upon the post with a howl his comrades recoiled and there was an angry cry from the rear of the crowd while a sod alighted squarely in the majors face he wiped it quietly with his handkerchief and then seizing esmond by main force thrust him a few paces aside  go home my men and you have my word that the affair shall go no further he said its your last chance well have a magistrate and several policemen here in a very few minutes  look out for yourself said somebody weve nothing against you now pick up your post boys and down with the thing  the men with the post came on again there was a roar from the crowd and a crash as the gate swung open then as a man with a stick sprang through the gap esmonds dogwhip came down upon his face next moment somebody had hurled him backwards and the crowd rolled through the opening  back there look after your master jenkins the majors voice rang out and a man dropped suddenly beneath his ridingcrop  then nobody knew exactly what happened but while the sticks rose and fell ingleby and esmond who had evaded the burly keeper found themselves face to face esmond who was flushed and gasping swung the dogwhip round his head but before he struck leger sprang straight at him with empty hands then a stick that somebody swung came down and esmond fell just clear of the rest with a gash on his forehead from which there spread a crimson smear leger staggered forward and the major gripped his shoulder and flung him into the arms of a keeper  hold him fast thats the lad who did it he said and faced round on the crowd with hand swung up and voice ringing commandingly  you have already done as much as you will care to account for he said manslaughter is a somewhat serious thing  the tumult ceased for a moment and everybody saw esmond lying very still upon the turf with the ominous smear of crimson on his blanched face his eyes were half closed now and they had an unpleasantly suggestive appearance then ingleby stepped forward and turned to coulthurst  nobody will interfere with you while you take him away but the man you have was not the one who struck him down he said give him up and well go back quietly  the major smiled grimly i hope he said to hand him to the police inside five minutes  look here said somebody it was all mr esmonds own fault and so to speak an accident go and get a doctor for him and let us have our man  there was a little hard glitter in coulthursts eyes he will find it difficult to persuade a jury of that stick to the lad jenkins and pick mr esmond up two of you stand aside there and its possible that we will not proceed against any more of you  ingleby turned to the crowd youre not going to let them hand him to the police for a thing he didnt do  there was a rush and a scuffle the majors ridingcrop was torn from him and groom and gardener and keeper were swept away while ingleby laughing harshly reeled into the shadow of the trees with his hand on legers shoulder  i think he said theres nothing that need keep us here  then while some of his companions pursued esmonds retainers and the rest stood still uncertain what to do next ingleby started back through the woods towards hoddam dragging leger who seemed a trifle dazed     iv  legers responsibility   leger was paler than usual as well as breathless and very dusty when he flung himself down in a dilapidated armchair in inglebys room the window was open for it was very hot and ingleby who stood near it appeared to be listening intently to the patter of feet that came up from the narrow street until he moved forward and laid his hand upon the sash then leger laughed hollowly  i dont think thats necessary and i wish you would leave it as it is just now he said considering that you live on the fourth story theyre scarcely likely to come in that way  i did it without thinking said ingleby who turned to him a trifle flushed in face youre looking faint i can get you some waterfortunately its cheap  ill be all right in a minute or two and leger made a little deprecatory gesture im not sure i ever made four miles quite so fast before and the blow i got from that fellows dogwhip the handle end must have shaken me never mind the water  ingleby sat down a trifle limply and unconscious of the fact that his own clothes were badly torn gazed at his companion legers dusty disarray heightened the effect of his pallor and his hair dank with perspiration lay smeared upon his forehead while there was a big discoloured bruise upon one cheek they had come home across the meadow and through the woodland instead of by the road and neither of them remembered how many hedges and thickets they had scrambled through since the one thing apparent was the advisability of escaping attention  we made an excellent pace ingleby said i scarcely think that the others can have got here yet they hadnt the same necessity for haste still im almost afraid it was wasted energy you see the police wouldnt be very long in tracing us  i dont suppose so that big militarylooking fellow meant to make sure of me no doubt hell send a groom over with our description he seemed to recognize you too  ingleby rose abruptly and leaned against the mantel with his lips firmly set it was several moments before he spoke again  i think he did he said in fact id have done almost anything sooner than have had this happen though that doesnt matter now theres a more important questionand it has to be faced  they looked at each other in silence for a second or two and both their faces were very grim with the shadow of fear in them they were young and shrank from the contemplation of what it seemed had been done the thing was horrible in itself quite apart from the consequences which promised to be disastrous  you mean said leger very quietly is he dead  ingleby made a little gesture and once more for almost a minute the heavy silence was intensified by the ticking of his watch and the sounds in the street below both of them listened intently almost expecting to hear the tramp of heavy feet upon the stairway  heaven forbid said ingleby a trifle hoarsely still he looked horribly like it theres just one thing of which i should like to be quite certain  of course and leger met his comrades gaze suppose i told you i did it would it separate us  no said ingleby you know that it might have been i and anyway we were both in the thing  then as you supposed the military man was mistaken i had nothing in my hands and never even reached him  ingleby in spite of his protestations drew a deep breath of relief but leger who appeared to be recovering now smiled  well he said youre satisfied but it doesnt in the least affect the position you see the military gentleman appeared certain he saw me strike the blow and i scarcely think my word would go very far against his with the usual kind of jury  you know who did it  leger smiled curiously i do but you ought to understand that the fact isnt of much use to me  you mean  i could plead not guilty but i couldnt point out the man responsible you see i induced him to join the society and gave him the americans pamphletsi believe the more virulent ones they seemed to make a strong impression on him one cant well back out of his responsibilityespecially when the adversary is always ready to make the most of the opportunity besides the man has a family  ingleby clenched one hand and you have hetty  yes said leger with an impressive quietness and hetty has only me still one must do what he feels he has to  but you cant leave hettyand what would happen to her if you were  if i were in jail and legers face went awry she would be turned out of her berth to a certainty it didnt quite strike me until you put the thing before me theres the lads mother too a little horrible isnt it how long does one usually get for manslaughter  again there was silence save for inglebys groan democratic aspirations were very well as subjects for discussion but now that he was brought face to face with the results of attempting to realize them they appalled him he did not remember that usually very little worth the having can be obtained without somebodys getting hurt and it would have afforded him no great consolation if he had remembered since for the time being he had had quite enough of theories then he made a little abrupt gesture  tom he said what dolts we are the thing is perfectly simple you have only to come out with me and the fact that youve made a bolt of it will be quite enough to divert suspicion from the other man  there is a difficulty steamboat fares cost money and im not sure hetty and i have five pounds in the treasury  ingleby laughed almost lightheartedly i think i have enough to take us all out at the cheapest rates and you must let me lend it to you if only to prove that what you believe in isnt an impracticable fancy  leger slowly straightened himself i dont want to be ungraciousbut its a difficult thing to do the moneys yoursand youd have nothing left  ingleby laid a hand on his shoulder and gripped it hard are you willing to see your sister cast adrift to save your confounded pride the fact that she has a relative undergoing penal servitude isnt much of a recommendation to a girl who has to earn her bread besides like a good many of us youre not logical you thought you had a claim on esmonds property  there was a light step on the stairway and he stopped suddenly theres hetty he said well leave it to her  the door swung open and the girl came in gasping with horror in her eyes  oh she said its awful theyve come in with the wagonettes and harry told me how did it happen  sit down said ingleby gently tom will explain  leger did so concisely and hetty clenched the chairarm hard as she listened to him still young as she was she held herself in hand and sat very still with the colour ebbing from her face  what shall we do she said  ingleby has asked us to go out to canada with him he offers to lend us the money  the girls face flushed suddenly and she glanced at ingleby who appeared embarrassed  how much will you have left if you do that she asked  i dont know yet anyway it doesnt matter if you make any silly objections hetty tom will go to jail  the girl turned to her brother with the crimson still in her cheek and her lips quivering and it suddenly struck ingleby that she was really remarkably pretty though that appeared of no great moment just then  that would happen tom she said  yes said leger quietly i believe it would  hetty turned again and looked at ingleby with a curious intentness you are quite sure you want us  ingleby moved by an impulse he did not understand caught and held fast one of her hands hetty he said arent we old friends there is nobody i would sooner take with me but we shall certainly quarrel if you ask me a question of that kind again  the girls expression perplexed him and with a sudden movement she drew her hand away well she said we will come i would stayonly i know tom would not go without me but whatever happens we will pay you back the money  i dont think you want to be unpleasant hetty said ingleby anyway you have only about an hour in which to get ready because if were not off by the next train its quite likely that we shall not have the opportunity for going at all get what you want together and meet us behind the booking office on the main line platform tom and i will take the back way to the station  hetty turned and went out without a word and leger looked at his companion  i dont think she meant to hurt you but what she did mean exactly is a good deal more than i understand he said  ingleby made a little impatient gesture i dont suppose it matters girls seem to have curious fancies in the meanwhile it might be as well if we made a start ill lend you a decent jacket and as you had a cap on it would be advisable to take my straw hat to carry out the same notion ill slip on my one dark suit they usually make a point of mentioning ones clothes  they were ready in about ten minutes but when they had descended the long stairway ingleby stopped in the dingy hall and stood still a moment irresolute  if it wasnt for the harpy downstairs we might get clear away before anybody was aware that we had gone he said i cant leave her what i owe her either for one never does seem to have change when he wants it how much have you got on you  a handful of copper said leger with a little grim smile  ingleby appeared to reflect i could send her the few shillings from wherever we stop  the post office people obligingly stamp every envelope with the name of the place it comes from i dont think we want to leave a trail behind us  ingleby stood still a moment longer with a flush in his face nothing would stop that womans talkingnot even a gag its horribly unfortunate  it usually is and leger looked at him with a curious little smile the worst of having a propaganda is that the people who havent any get indignant when one doesnt live up to it they naturally lay part of the blame on the fallacies he believes in  ingleby swung round id sooner face a batterybut im going down  he disappeared down the basement steps and in another minute a harsh voice apparently vituperating him rose up and when he rejoined his comrade his face was redder than ever  now he said well go the sooner the better everybody in the neighbourhood will know what she thinks of me inside of ten minutes  they slipped out into the street and ingleby stopped a moment at the end of it and looked back with a curious expression in his face the sunlight that lay bright upon one side of it emphasized its unattractiveness tall houses grim in their squalid ugliness shut it in and the hot air that scarcely stirred between them was heavy with the sour odours from a neighbouring tanyard a hoarse clamour and a womans voice highpitched and shrill with fear or anger came out of a shadowy alley where unkempt children played in the gutter the uproar did not concern them they were apparently used to it  ive lived five years in the midst ofthisand now im almost sorry to leave it he said theres no reason in us  then he turned again with a little resolute shake of his shoulders well we have done with it at last and if half what one hears is true there is a chance for such as us in the country we are going to  leger said nothing and it was silently they threaded their way deviously in and out of alleys and archways towards the station their life had been a hard one in that squalid town but the place had after all been home and they could not tell what awaited them in the unknown they had in them the steadfastness which is born of struggle but the unthinking courage of youth that has felt no care is quite a different thing  however nobody appeared desirous of preventing their departure and they eventually got away by a steamer for which they had to wait several days in liverpool  in the meanwhile geoffrey esmond lay one evening propped up amidst the pillows in a darkened room at holtcar grange he was blanched in face and his eyes were heavy while a big wet bandage was still rolled about his head major coulthurst was by his bedside and a burly sergeant of police sat on the very edge of a sofa with a notebook in his hand the window was open behind the blind and a little cool air that brought the fragrance of flowers with it crept into the room  major coulthurst fancied he could recognize the man who assaulted you mr esmond and i have no doubt we will lay hands on him in a day or two said the officer if you could identify him too it would make the thing more certain and i would like to read you the description furnished me before we go any farther  if that is the usual course i dont see why i should object said esmond drily still isnt it a trifle suggestive  the sergeant did not appear to notice the irony of the inquiry and launched out into what was in the circumstances a tolerably accurate description of leger esmond listened quietly with a little smile in his halfclosed eyes  major coulthurst he said is evidently astonishingly quicksighted if he saw all that  im not sure i understand you esmond and coulthurst looked up sharply  well said the younger man reflectively i always fancied you were a sportsman and we had our fun of course while it lasted i would cheerfully have broken the socialist fellows head if i could have managed it but just now the odds seem a trifle heavy against him  coulthurst laughed a little but the sergeant shook his head thats not at all the way to look at it sir he said in a case of this kind one has if i may point it out a duty to society  and the police said esmond who made a little gesture i really do not think i should ask the opinion of the latter as to what is incumbent on me still that is scarcely the point you want me to identify the manand i cant do it  you must have seen him close to sir  esmond laughed have you ever had incipient concussion of the brain you probably havent i believe they line your headgear with cork or cane well in one respect its a little unfortunate since it would have helped you to understand my position now the major says the mans hair was light brown but so far as i can remember it was red are you quite sure it wasnt coulthurst  coulthurst appeared reflective he certainly had his hat on  a cap sir said the sergeant  esmond glanced at the major reproachfully you will notice sergeant how reliable he is  the fact mentioned wouldnt prevent your seeing what kind of man he was said the sergeant tartly he is described as little and pale and of a delicate appearance  then if the blow on my head is anything to go by i really think my friend was mistaken said esmond its my firm opinion the man was distinctly muscular  the sergeant stood up and closed his book the affair is a serious one and we naturally look to a gentleman of your position for  esmond stopped him with a gesture and a little languid smile under which however the burly sergeant flushed  as i fancy i mentioned there are matters in which it is hardly the province of the police to instruct me he said im sorry i cant do anything more for you today sergeant but if you were to come round when my head has settled down a little i might be able to recollect the fellows appearance rather more distinctly  if we are to lay hands on him we must have a warrant at once  then if it depends on me im very much afraid you will not get itand now as the doctor insists on quietness you will excuse me can you reach the bell major  the sergeant went out fuming inwardly and coulthurst laughed im not quite sure that i should have let the fellow off he said what made you do it  i really dont know and scarcely think it matters said esmond languidly still you see i fancy we went a little farther than the law would sanction and that being so one could scarcely expect the other fellow to pay for everything now if i might remind you miss coulthurst was kind enough to promise to come in and talk to me     v  the new country   it was a still evening and major coulthurst and mrs esmond paced slowly side by side up and down the terrace at holtcar grange the house looked westward and the last of the sunshine rested lovingly upon its weathered front where steep tiled roof and flaking stone that had silvery veins in it were mellowed to pale warm tints by age beyond it orchid house fernery and vinery flashed amidst the trees while the great cool lawn shaven to the likeness of emerald velvet glowing borders and even the immaculate gravel that crunched beneath the majors feet conveyed the same suggestion to him it was evident that there was no need of economy at holtcar grange and coulthurst who had faced the world long enough to recognize the disadvantages of an empty purse sighed as he remembered the last budget the post had brought him  he had served his nation sturdily according to his lights which however were not especially brilliant wherever work was hardest and worst paid while now when it was almost time to rest he was going out again to the wilderness on the farthest confines of a new country where even those who serve the government live primitively he longed to stay in england and take his ease but funds were even lower than they usually were with him still he shrank from exposing his daughter to the discomforts he was at last commencing to find it hard to bear and she had but to speak a word and remain with all that any young woman could reasonably look for the mistress of holtcar grange though he roused himself with an effort he felt that his conversation was even less brilliant than usual and that his companion noticed it it was certain that she smiled when she surprised him glancing somewhat anxiously across the lawn  you have quite decided on going out she asked  i have said coulthurst simply in ten days from today the commissions in my pocketi was uncommonly glad to get it  still said mrs esmond the pay cannot be very high and it must be a wild country  it is quite sufficient for a lonely man and now grace  he stopped abruptly a trifle flushed in face and his companion smiled at him  yes she said i understand and if it happens as we both wish i shall be content geoffrey has been a good son but i could not expect to keep him always to myselfand i would rather it should be grace than any one else  thank you said coulthurst simply whether i have done right in allowing her to come here i do not know in any case i never suspected what might happen until a month ago then i was a trifle astonished but the mischief was done  mrs esmond laughed you might have expressed it more happily though it is perhaps only natural that there was a day or two when i would not have found fault with you  coulthurst said nothing further but his thoughts were busy he knew better than most men what life in the newer lands is and he had no desire that grace should share it with him what she thought of esmond he did not know but the latter had told him what he thought of her and his mother was it seemed content with the choice he had made a good deal depended on the girls fancy  they had turned again when she came towards them across the lawn as though she did not see them until hearing their footsteps she stopped abruptly nobody spoke for a moment or two but she felt their eyes upon her and the crimson grew deeper in her cheek as she turned to the elder lady  i see you know she said with a little tremor in her voice you will forgive me if he feels hurt over itbut i felt i could not geoffrey of course is  the major groaned inwardly when she stopped and there was a sudden slight but perceptible change in his companion her face lost its usual gentleness and became for a moment not hard or vindictive but impressively grave  i am gladbecause he is my only sonthat you had the courage to do the right thingnow she said  grace flashed a swift glance at her and the colour showed a trifle more plainly in her face but saying nothing she hastily turned away coulthurst stood stiffly still evidently perplexed at something in the attitude of both until mrs esmond looked at him  i am disappointed she said  coulthurst raised his hand in protest it is very good of you to say so but while she is my daughter and i am naturally a trifle proud of her the advantages would in one sense have been so much in her favour  i dont think you apprehend me these affairs seldom fall out as one would wish them which is perhaps now and then fortunate for all concerned it is grace i am disappointed with  coulthurst smiled somewhat grimly im by no means sure that i do understand but one thing at least is plain she has made her own choice and must abide by it  it was ten minutes later and mrs esmond had left him when he came upon grace sitting where a shrubbery swept round a bend of the lawn she looked at him deprecatingly  i am very sorrybut it was out of the questionquite she said  coulthurst made a little gesture of resignation for if he seldom foresaw a difficulty where others would have done so he at least made no futile protest when it had to be faced  i suppose he said you realize what you have turned your back upon today  still i felt i had to do so  coulthurst checked a groan then since you presumably know your own mind there is nothing more to be said you will be ready to come out to the northwest with me  grace rose and slipped her hand through his arm father she said im sorrydreadfully sorry i must be a horrid responsibility  coulthurst smiled somewhat ruefully so am i no doubt we will worry along as we have already done but it is a very hard country we are going to  it was scarcely a sufficient expression of what he felt but coulthurst had his strong points and his daughter knew it was very unlikely he would ever allude to the subject again there were however as usual guests at holtcar grange just then and they had formed a tolerably correct opinion as to what was happening it was also natural that they should discuss it and on that evening two matrons and the lady who had taken graces part on a previous occasion expressed their views concerning the conduct of the latter  the girl led him on shamefully said one of them that was evident to everybody and one would have fancied the reason was equally sothough of course we know now it wasnt the right one  graces advocate appeared reflective and as it happened her opinion was usually listened to i have watched the girl and she is interesting as a study she said i am of course not infallible but it seems to me from what i have heard of the major that she has inherited his disregard of consequences coulthurst one would conclude is not a man who ever saved himself or others trouble by anticipating anything  one of her companions signified concurrence and the fact that the opportunity for a flirtation with the most eligible man in the vicinity appealed to her natural arrogance accounts for the rest  not exactly though you are in a measure right i should rather call it love of influence for though im not sure grace coulthurst realizes it one could fancy that the opportunity for dominating a man of position or more especially character would prove almost irresistible to her still one must discriminate between that and the not unusual fondness for lovemaking  the distinction is a little difficult it seems to lead to much the same thing  the previous speaker who was a woman of discernment shook her head there is a difference she said the girl has i think a personalityby which i do not altogether mean physical attributesthat is apt to appeal to a man of character though i almost fancy she will sooner or later be sorry she was ever endued with it there is a good deal that is admirable in grace coulthurst but unfortunately in one respect perhaps notquiteenough  it was not evident that the rest altogether understood her but mrs esmond appeared just then and the subject was changed abruptly  in the meanwhile there were at least three people who would have found no fault with major coulthursts description of western canada having discovered somewhat to their astonishment that the population of quebec and montreal was already quite sufficient and that strangers without means were not greatly desired in either city these three had in accordance with inglebys previous purpose started west again and on the fifth day sat spiritlessly in a colonist car as with whistle screaming the long train rolled into sight of a little desolate station on the albertan prairie  all the way from winnipeg a dingy greyness had shrouded the apparently interminable levels which lay parched and white beneath an almost intolerable heat while the lurching cars swung through a rolling cloud of dust that blurred the dreary prospect now as they were slowing down grimy faces were thrust from the windows and perspiring men leaned out from the platforms gazing down the track and inquiring with expletives why they were stopping again  hetty leger however sat languidly still where the hot draught that blew in through an open window scattered the dust upon her her face was damp and unpleasantly gritty for the water in the tank had long run out her head ached as did every bone in her body for colonist cars are not fitted as the pullmans are and she had with indifferent success for four nights essayed to sleep on a maple shelf which pulled out from the roof above when one wanted it she had certainly hired a mattress but its inch or two of thickness had scarcely disguised the hardness of the polished wood beneath it and although the cost of it and the little green curtain had made a serious inroad on the few dollars left in her scanty purse they had not solved the problem of dressing while the atmosphere of a closepacked colonist car when the big lamps are lighted in hot weather is a thing to shudder at it is also in view of the fact that most of the passengers dispense with curtains somewhat embarrassing to rise in the morning and wait amidst a group of halfdressed men and women for a place in the cupboard at the rear of the car where ablutions may at least be attempted when there is any water in the tank  presently however a big bell commenced to toll and the jolting of the airbrakes flung her forward in her seat while in another few moments the long cars stopped and the conductor pushed his way through the perspiring passengers who surged towards the vestibule  theyve had a big washout up the track he said you can light out and admire the scenery for two hours anyway if you feel like it  hetty looked round but could see nothing of her brother or ingleby she had seen very little to admire at other prairie stations but anything seemed better than the close heat of the car and when the vestibule was clear at last she went out languidly and stepped down upon the track  beside it rose two desolate frame houses a crude structure of galvanized iron and a towering water tank but that was all and beyond them the gleaming rails ran straight to the rim of the empty wilderness nothing moved on its interminable levels the dingy sky seemed suffused with heat and along the track a smell that was stronger than the reek of creosote rose from the baked and fissured earth the withered grass was of the same tint as the earth save where the clay on the bank of a coulée showed a harsh red and the vast stretch of dusty prairie seemed steeped in the one dreary grey this she reflected with a sinking heart was the land of promise to which she had journeyed five thousand miles to find a home but though the track was suggestively littered with empty provision cans there was as yet very little sign of the milk and honey  hetty was usually sympathetic but the sight of the frowsy passengers and unwashed children wandering aimlessly round the station aroused in her a curious impatience that was tinged with disgust that hot afternoon she wanted to be alone and noticing an ugly trestle bridge a mile or so ahead followed the rails until she came to it a river swirled beneath it but it too was utterly devoid of beauty for the banks of it were crumbling sunbaked clay and it swept by a dingy slatey green thick with the mud brought down by the rockies glaciers however it looked cool and she climbed down until she found a place she could stand on and laved her arms and face in it then as it happened a piece of the crumbling clay broke away and one foot slipped in above the ankle while the skirt of her thin dress trailed in the water too it was a trifling mishap but hetty was overwrought and when she had climbed back and taken off and emptied the little shoe she sat down on the dusty grass and sobbed bitterly she felt insignificant and lonely in that great empty land and its desolation crushed her spirits  she did not know how long she sat there but at last there were footsteps behind her and she coloured a little and strove to draw the shoeless foot beneath the hem of the dripping skirt when she saw ingleby smiling down upon her then she remembered that the sleeves of the thin blouse were still rolled back and the crimson grew plainer in her wet cheeks as with a little adroit movement she shook them down ingleby smiled again in a complacent brotherly fashion which she found strangely exasperating just then and sitting down beside her took one of her hot hands  crying hetty that will never do he said  hetty glanced at him covertly his face was compassionate but there was rather toleration than concern in it and she pulled her hand away from him  i wasntat least not exactly she said and if i was it was the weatherand why dont you go away  ingleby smiled again in a manner which while kind enough had yet a lack of comprehension in it that made her still angrier  people dont generally cry about the weather he said  well said the girl sharply some of them say things they shouldnt i heard youin a crowded car too  she stopped abruptly as she remembered the scanty privacy of the colonist train and that she was supposed to have been asleep about the time ingleby had allowed his temper to get the better of him he however only laughed  hetty he said what is the matter i always thought you brave and i have almost a right to know  i think you have and there was a little flash in hettys eyes it was you who brought us here and this is a horrible country it frightens me  ingleby was a trifle perplexed and showed it he had known hetty leger for four or five years and had never seen her in a mood of the kind before it also occurred to him as it did every now and then that although she was not to be compared with miss coulthurst hetty was in her own way beautiful just then a pretty plump arm showed beneath the unfastened sleeve of the thin blouse and the somewhat dusty hair with the tint of pale gold in it lying low on the white forehead matched the soft blue eyes though there was a hint of more character than is usually associated with her type in hettys white and pink face ingleby noticed all this with impersonal appreciation as something which did not greatly concern him  well he said im sorry and by no means sure im very much pleased with the country myself but i dont quite see what else i could have done in the circumstances still it hurts me to see you unhappy  hetty turned to him impulsively never mind me im an ungrateful littlebeast thats the fact and you neednt try to say anything nicei know i am if it hadnt been for you tom would have been in prison now  ingleby looked out across the endless dusty levels im sure the country must be a good deal better than it lookswhen one gets used to it he said a trifle dubiously anyway we are three to one against it and neednt be afraid of it while we stick together that is the one thing we must make up our minds to do  there was a time when you didnt seem very sure you wanted tom and me  didnt you feel that i was right a little while ago  hetty said nothing for a space she was quickwitted and not infrequently understood her companion rather better than he understood himself while recollecting the halfshy delicacy which occasionally characterized him she felt a trifle comforted it was not she fancied to please himself that he had been willing to leave her behind and she watched him covertly as he too sat silent gazing at the prairie with thoughtful eyes he was not she was quite aware as clever as her brother and he certainly had his shortcomingsin fact a good many of them but for all that there was something about him which so far as she was concerned set him apart from any other man exactly what it was she persuaded herself that she did not know or at least made a brave attempt to do so for it was evident that he had only a frank brotherly regard for her still the silence was getting uncomfortable and she flung a question at him  how much have we left she asked  ingleby laughed somewhat ruefully eight dollars i believe still we shall cross the rockies tomorrow and start at once to heap up riches we are certainly going to do it as others have and you will never be frightened any more  hetty had a stout heart of her own but nevertheless she was glad of the reassuring grasp he laid upon her shoulder as she looked out across the muddy river and desolate greywhite plain however she smiled at him and once more they sat silent until a curious and unexpected thing happened  far away on the rim of the prairie there was a stirring of the haze and a dim smear of pinewoods grew out of the dingy vapour then a vista of rolling hills rose to view and was lost in mist again until high above them all a great serrated rampart of nevermelting snow gleamed ethereally against a strip of blue it was a brief bewildering vision sudden as the shifting of a gorgeous transformation scene and then the vapours rolled down again but they felt that they had looked upon an unearthly glory hetty turned to her companion with a little gasp  oh she said it was wonderful  it was real at least said ingleby your first glimpse of the country to which i have brought you i think we shall be happy thereand we will remember afterwards that we saw it together  again the little pink tinge crept into hettys cheek but she said nothing and inglebys glance rested on the shoe which he had not noticed before  hetty he said severely do you want to catch cold what is that doing there  hetty essayed to draw her foot farther beneath the hem of the dusty skirt and the colour grew a trifle plainer in her face but ingleby made a little reproachful gesture and taking up the shoe rubbed it with his handkerchief  now he said im going to the bridge put it on  he turned away but the leather was stiff with water and hetty struggled fruitlessly with the buttons and when she rejoined him ingleby noticed that she was walking somewhat awkwardly  stand still a minute he said you cant limp back along the track like that  he dropped on one knee and hetty turned her face aside when he looked up again  it is such a pretty little foot he said  then as they went back together they met leger on the trestle he said nothing but though he endeavoured to hide it there was concern in his sallow face     vi  hall sewell   the afternoon was clear and cool but bright sunlight filled a glade among the towering pines which creep close up to the western outskirts of vancouver city they are very old and great of girth and though here and there a path or carriage drive has been hewn through the strip of primeval wilderness the municipal authorities have been wise enough to attempt no improvement upon what nature has done for them and stanley park remains a pleasance whose equal very few cities possess it is scented ambrosially with the odours of balsam and cedar deep silence fills the dim avenues between the colonnades of towering trunks and from every opening one looks out upon blue water and coldly gleaming snow  on the afternoon in question the stillness was rudely broken by a murmur of voices unmodulated and sharp with an intonation which sounds especially out of place in the wilderness though it is heard there often enough from the redwoods of oregon to where alaskan pines spring from ten feet of snow a crowd of people were scattered about the glade and while some were dressed in store clothes and a few in coarse blue jean the eyes of all were turned towards the stump of a great cedar sawn off a mans height above the ground which formed a natural platform for a speaker whose address had astonished most of them ingleby and leger lay a little apart from the rest where the sunlight fell faintly warm upon the withered needles while hetty was seated near them upon a fallen fir displeasure in her eyes and her lips set together her eyebrows also seemed unusually straight as they often did when she was angry and that gave to her delicately pretty face a curious appearance of severity one would scarcely have expected to find there she was dressed tastefully for she earned a sufficiency as a boardinghouse waitress  ingleby who lay nearest her looked up at her with a little smile  you would make rather a striking picture just now hetty he said that is a most attractive frown i dont know where you got it but taken together with your attitude itsi cant think of a better comparisonalmost roman  hetty glanced at him sharply her education had not been very comprehensive and she scarcely understood the allusion but ingleby who had made it at random was nevertheless in a measure right for there is a recurrent type of feminine beauty not exactly common but to be met with among women of her station in the north of england while they are young at least which approaches the classical hetty might have posed just then as a virgin sitting with turneddown thumb  well she said im vexed with you and tom as well as with that man i wish he hadnt come now when we are nice and comfortable and you are both earning good wagesat least when the steamers come in  ingleby shook his head reproachfully you have spoiled it he said hasnt she tom a young woman who frowns in that imperial fashion talking of wages  leger only laughed as turning over among the firneedles he filled his pipe again but hetty was still a trifle angry  of course i dont understand you she said i never do but its a good thing ive more sense than either of you now you know what came of listening to speeches of that kind in england and youre doing the same thing again ive no sympathy with that man everybody has enough to eat and looks contented and comfortable why does he come here worrying them  leger smiled im not sure that the contentment of ignorance is the blessing some people would like us to believe you see when one doesnt know what hes entitled to hes apt to be satisfied with a good deal less while when men like hall sewell point out that you dont get half as much as you ought to you are apt to believe them  ingleby laughed though as sewells writings had stirred him to intense appreciation even in england he was not altogether pleased with the little twinkle in his comrades eyes he was quick to fire with enthusiasm while it occurred to him that leger was a trifle too addicted to looking at both sides of a question and occasionally admitting the weak points of his own case with dry goodhumour he had also a shrewd suspicion that leger was a cleverer man than himself  well he said looking at hetty if you are content to carry plates to sawmill hands and wharflabourers its more than i am to see you do so  why shouldnt i and hetty who flashed a covert glance at him noticed the tinge of heightened colour in his face and was not displeased at it they are all of them very civil to me and the one who can get nothing to do as a doctor  oh yes said ingleby curtly ive noticed his confounded assurance every time i see you going round with his dinner i feel id like to poison him  leger looked up again with the twinkle in his eyes showing plainer still  you havent answered her and im not sure you can he said she put the whole thing in a nutshell when she askedwhy shouldnt she  ingleby was silent but he fidgeted and leger grinned  dont you find it a little difficult to cling to aristocratic prejudicesthough i dont know how you became possessed of themand believe in democratic theories at the same time he said one would fancy they were bound to run up against each other occasionally  just then an urchin with a satchel on his back came along  hall sewells latest speeches he said fourth edition of the new brotherhood and the grip of capital  give me them all said ingleby how much do you want  a quarter said the lad handing him several flimsy pamphlets and while hetty glanced at him severely leger laughed  twentyfive cents he said it would have purchased a packet of caramels for hetty  we might manage both said ingleby im sorry i didnt think of it earlier hetty but you havent yet told me your opinion of the man himself  hetty glanced at the man upon the firestump he was dressed as a workman in blue jean which seemed to her a piece of affectation since when workmen of that city take their recreation they usually do so attired in excellent clothing but he had a lithe wellproportioned figure and it became him though neither his face which was bronzed by exposure nor his hands were quite in keeping with it it was a forceful face with keen dark eyes in it but the mouth was hidden by the long moustache hall sewell was in his own sphere a famous man whose printed speeches had been read with appreciation in europe and he had not long ago played a leading part in a great labour dispute he had just finished speaking and another man was somewhat apologetically addressing the assembled populace  hetty who surveyed him critically shook her head if you buy me any sweets now ill throw them away she said well hes a goodlooking man  oh said ingleby hes goodlooking cant you get beyond that hetty  hetty pursed her lips up reflectively well why shouldnt he be its a pleasure to see a man of that kind there are so few of them still ill try to go a little further of course hes clever at least everybody says so but theres something wanting i think hes weak  weak said ingleby indignantly youre wide of the mark this time hetty ive read every line he has had printed and any one could feel the uncompromising strength in it theyve put him in prison and tried to buy him but nothing could keep a man of that kind from delivering his message  hetty still pursed her lips up and when she spoke again she somewhat astonished ingleby  if i were a little cleverer and richer i think that i could that is of course if i wanted to she said  leger looked up with a little whimsical smile i hope she isnt right but she now and then blunders upon a truth that is hidden from our wisdom delilah is after all a type you see and one cant help a fancy that she has figured even more often than is recorded in history go on hetty  hetty put her head on one side i never could remember very much history but that mans vain vainer than most of you she said a girl above him who pretended to believe in him could twist him round her finger  above him said ingleby  hetty looked at him curiously yes you know what everybody means by that and its generally a girl of that kind that men with your notions fall in love with its because you want so much more than is good for you that you have such notions  considering that she is a girl and by no means clever hettys reflections occasionally at least display an astonishing comprehension said leger i really dont mind admitting it though i am her brother  ingleby said nothing though he felt uncomfortable he was fond of hetty in a brotherly fashion but as he had never supposed her to be indued with any intellect worth mentioning her occasional flashes of penetration were almost disconcerting the last one was certainly so for there were two people of diametrically opposed opinions whom he respected above all others one was hall sewell the reformer and the other major coulthursts daughter he was glad of the opportunity for changing the subject when the man who had been speaking stopped a moment and looked at the crowd  i guess im through and you have been patient boys he said hall will be quite willing to answer any reasonable questions ill get down  there was a little goodhumoured laughter and a man who stood forward turned to the assembly  everybody knows jake townson and theres no wickedness in him hes a harmless crank he said what i want to ask hall sewell is whos paying him to go round making trouble among people who have no use for it or him its a straight question  there was a little growl of disgust as well as sardonic laughter and while one or two angry men moved towards the speaker the man with the dark eyes stood up suddenly  let him alone boys we dont want to use our enemies methods and im quite willing to answer him he said nobody has paid me a dollar for what ive tried to do for the cause of brotherhood and liberty but i was offered a thousand to betray it not a month ago  name the men who did it cried somebody  i will said sewell when i consider the time is ripethey may count on that but in the meanwhile you will have to take my word for it so far ive been found where i was wantedand that as our friend suggests was generally where there was troublebut i never took five cents for reward or fee  there was a murmur of approbation as well as incredulity and then a cry broke through it  howd you worry along then a man has got to live  sewell held his hands up and though small and wellshaped they were scarred and brown  what i wantand its very littlei can earn with the shovel and the drill ive given your man his answer but im going farther  there was a clamour from one part of the crowd hes an insect weve no use for him let up halls talking were here to hear him  what did i get for my pains said sewell thats what the question comes to and ill tell you frankly since until we or our children bring in the new era its all that the man has to expect who believes this world can and ought to be made better ive been ridden over by u s cavalry and beaten by patrolmens clubs ive been hounded out of cities where i lawfully earned my bread and sandbagged by hired toughs that would be a little thing if i were the only victim but you knowyou can read it in your papers almost any daywhat happens to the men who have the grit to work as well as to hope for the dawn of better days for downtrodden humanity youre to wait for iton the other side of jordanyour teachers say boys we want it here and now and its coming a little nearer every day you have got to believe that and when the outlook grows black get a tighter clinch upon your faith was it a shadow and a fancy that the men died for who went down in every struggle for the last ten yearswe neednt go back farther right across this prosperous continent youll find their gravesmen shot and sabred strung to bridges and telegraph poles boys weve been waitingwaiting a long while  he broke off abruptly for a little stolid parkwarden and an equally unimpressed official of the vancouver police pushed their way through the crowd  i guess said the former youll have to light out of this you cant hold no meetings here  the crowd was a canadian one goodhumouredly tolerant respectful of constituted authority and what was more to the purpose reasonably contented with their lot they were also as usual somewhat deficient in the quick enthusiasm which is common across the frontier had ample time been afforded him the orator might have got hold of them and impressed upon them a due comprehension of their wrongs but a good many of them were by no means sure that they had very much to complain of as yet still there were angry expostulations  have you any ground for preventing my speaking here sewell asked  yes sir said the warden i guess we have its down in the park charter you cant peddle those papers either call your boys in  the men who made those laws as usual made them to suit themselves  well said the warden i guess that dont matter now there they are all you have to do is to keep them and nobodys going to worry you  there was an embarrassing silence for a moment or two for everybody felt the tension and realized that the position was rife with unpleasant possibilities but the stolid warden stood eyeing the crowd unconcernedly and as usual the inertia of british officialdom conquered sewell made a little whimsical gesture of resignation and raised his hand  im afraid well have to break up boys theres nothing to be gained for anybody by making trouble now he said if we can hire a big store of any kind ill talk to you tomorrow  he sprang down from the stump the crowd melted away and hetty laughed as she glanced at her companions  that man has really a good deal more sense than some people with his notions seem to have she said  ingleby shook his head at her you mean people who pull gates down on sunday afternoons he asked still i scarcely think it was to save himself trouble he told them to go home and nobody could have expected very much sympathy from the men who listened to him hes wasting his time on themtheyre too well fed what do you think tom  leger who did not answer him for a moment glanced thoughtfully through an opening between the stately trunks towards the faroff gleam of snow  this province he said drily is a tolerably big one and from what ive heard they may want a man of his kind in the northern ranges presently it isnt the supinely contented who face the frost and snow there and the crown mining regulations dont seem to appeal to the men who stake their lives on finding a little gold they appear to be even less pleased with those who administer them     vii  hetty bears the cost   it was towards the end of the arduous day and ingleby was glad of the respite the breakage of a chain cargosling afforded him the white side of a big empress liner towered above the openfronted shed and a string of box cars stood waiting outside the sliding doors behind him a swarm of men in blue jean were hurrying across the wharf behind clattering trucks laden with the produce of china and japan for the liner had been delayed a trifle by bad weather and the tea and silk and sugar were wanted in the east already a great freight locomotive was waiting on the side track and as ingleby knew the long train must be got away before the atlantic express went out that evening he had been promoted to a post of subordinate authority a few weeks earlier and both he and leger were in the meanwhile at least contented with their lot for the great railway company treated its servants liberally  there was however nothing that he could do for a minute or two and he leaned against a tier of silk bales with a bundle of dispatch labels and a slip of paper in his hand while leger sat upon the truck behind him he had though it was no longer exactly his business been carrying sugar bags upon his back most of that afternoon partly to lessen the labour of leger who had not his physique and now the white crystals glittered in his hair and clung smeared with dust to his perspiring face his sleeves were rolled back to the elbow showing his brown arms which had grown hard and corded since he came to canada while his coarse blue shirt which was open at the neck and belted tight at the waist displayed as more conventional attire would not have done the symmetry of a well setup figure  we are still short of a few tea chests said leger however if you would mark the two lots ive got yonder we could clear that car for dispatch as soon as the rest come out  ingleby glanced at his slip ill wait until i get the others it will keep the thing straighter theres a good deal more in sorting cargo than i fancied there could be until i tried it and its remarkably easy to put the stuff into the wrong car  then it might be well to keep your eye on those chests of tea i cant keep the boys off them theres another fellow at them now  ingleby swung round and signed to a perspiring man who stopped with a truck beside the cases in question  leave that lot alone its billed straight through express freight east he said stick this ticket on the cases tom  leger moved away and ingleby was endeavouring to scrape some of the sugar off his person when a man whom he recognized as one of the leading citizens of vancouver and several ladies came down the steamers gangway then he started and felt his heart throb as his glance rested on one of them who as it happened looked up just then it was evident that she saw him and he was unpleasantly sensible that his face was growing hot there was he would have admitted at any other time no reason for this but in the meanwhile it was distinctly disconcerting that grace coulthurst should come upon him in his present guise smeared with dust and halfmelted sugar then he occupied himself with his cargo slip for it was in the circumstances scarcely to be expected that she would vouchsafe him any recognition  the longing to see her again however became too strong for him and looking up a moment he was conscious of a blissful astonishment for she was walking straight towards him with a smile in her eyes she seemed to him almost ethereally dainty in the dust and turmoil of the big cargo shed and for the moment he forgot his uncovered arms and neck and felt every nerve in him thrill as he took the little gloved hand she held out what she had done was not likely to be regarded as anything very unusual in that country where most men are liable to startling vicissitudes of fortune and there are no very rigid social distinctions but ingleby failed to recognize this just then and it was not astonishing that he should idealize her for her courage  you are about the last person i expected to meet what are you doing here she said with the little tranquil smile that became her well  inglebys heart was throbbing a good deal faster than usual but he held himself in hand miss coulthurst was apparently pleased to see him but there was an indefinite something in her serene graciousness which put a check on him it was he felt perhaps only because she was patrician to her fingertips that she had so frankly greeted him a girl with less natural distinction could he fancied scarcely have afforded to be equally gracious to a wharflabourer  i am at present loading railway cars with tea and silk though i have been carrying sugar bags most of the day he said  grace showed no sign of astonishment as she glanced at his toiling comrades and though this was doubtless the correct attitude for her to assume ingleby was in spite of his opinions not exactly pleased until she spoke again  dont you find it rather hard work she said of course one cannot always choose the occupation one likes here but couldnt you find something that would be a little moreprofitable  ingleby laughed im afraid i cant he said in this city the one passport to advancement appears to be the ability to play in the band and i was unfortunately never particularly musical still there is no reason why i should trouble you with my affairs i wonder if i might venture to ask you how you came to be here  it is quite simple major coulthurst was appointed gold commissioner in one of the mining districts and i came out with him but he has been sent to an especially desolate post in the northern ranges and i am staying with friends in the city for a week or two then i am going to join him  she stopped a moment and then looked at him reflectively why dont you go north and try your fortune at prospecting too they have been finding a good deal of gold lately in the green river country where my father is  it had seemed to ingleby almost unnatural that he should be so quietly discussing his affairs with the girl he had last seen nearly six thousand miles away this was not the kind of meeting he would have anticipated but as she made the suggestion a little thrill once more ran through him for he had heard that the district in question was a great desolation and it almost seemed that she desired his company however he shook off the notion as untenable for there would be he knew a distinction between a placer miner and the gold commissioners daughter even in that land of rock and snow  i have thought of it he said some day i may go but it is at the far end of the province and for one who works on a steamboat wharf the getting there is a risky venture i dont suppose everybody finds gold  im afraid they dont and the cost of transporting provisions is a serious matter to those who fail in fact some of them have been giving my father trouble they appear to lay the blame of everything on the mining regulations  she stopped and glanced at him with a little smile from what i remember of your views you would no doubt be inclined to agree with them  ingleby laughed though it was pleasant to be told that she remembered anything he had said i really fancy i have learned a little sense in canada and i am not going to inflict my crude notions upon you again still there is a question i should like to ask did mr esmond of holtcarrecover  grace noticed the sudden intentness of his tone and looked at him curiously of course in fact he got better in a week or two and i think behaved very generously the police could not induce him to give them any information about the men who injured him  ingleby started and the girl saw the relief in his face  i wonder he said if you ever heard who they were supposed to be  grace turned a trifle and gazed at him steadily though there was now a little flash in her eyes  you she said with incisive coldness were one of them  ingleby grew hot beneath her gaze for he felt that all the pride and prejudices of her station were arrayed against him you will remember the form of my question i was supposed to be one of thembut that was all he said  graces face softened and she glanced at her companions who after waiting a little while were just leaving the shed of course she said i should have known it was absurd to fancy that you could do anything of that kind  i am afraid i have kept you said ingleby perhaps i should not have abused your kindness by letting you stop at all but the desire to see you was too strong for me i wonder whether even you would have dared to do as much had it been in england  there was a faint flush in the girls cheek but she smiled as she held out her hand  i scarcely think we need go into that and i cant keep the others waiting any longer she said perhaps i shall meet you in the green river country  she swept away with a soft swish of dainty garments and ingleby whose face grew curiously intent as he watched her climbed the slanting gangway to the deck of the liner when she disappeared from there he could see the white tops of the ranges gleaming ethereally as they stretched back mountain behind mountain towards the lonely north the green river country lay far beyond them and there were leagues of tangled forest and thundering rivers to be crossed but that day the untrodden snow he gazed upon seemed to beckon him and a sudden longing to set out upon the long trail grew almost irresistible there was gold in the wilderness and with enough of it a man might aspire to anything even the hand of a crown commissioners daughter  then the winch beside him clattered and he shook off the fancies as a fresh stream of bales and cases slid down the gangway whatever the future might have in store there were several more hours of arduous work in front of him then one of them had passed when leger came hastily up to him  i suppose you got those last few cases he said  ingleby started im afraid i never remembered them until this moment have they pulled the car out tom  its not there anyway i fancied you had made the lot up somebody has put those cases in  while they looked at one another the tolling of a locomotive bell broke through the clatter of the trucks and ingleby sped towards the door of the shed with leger close behind him when they reached it the hoot of a whistle came ringing down the track and they saw the great locomotive vanish amidst the piles of lumber outside a big sawmill with the long cars lurching through the smoke behind it ingleby said nothing then but turned back into the shed with his lips set and questioned several men before he looked at leger  nobody seems to know whether they put that tea into the through east car or not and its no use being sorry now we didnt see it done he said the sooner we have a word with the freighttraffic agent the better  the gentleman in question had however very little consolation to offer them  the fast freight has got to make kamloops ahead of the atlantic express he said shes not going to be held up more than ten minutes there and theyll have the mountain loco ready to rush her up the loops and over the selkirks ill send a wire along but so long as the road is clear its going to be more than any mans place is worth to sidetrack that train for freight checking  inglebys face grew anxious well he said what is to be done  nothing said the traffic manager if theres anything wrong with your sorting youll probably hear about it in a week or so  they went out of the office and ingleby turned to his comrade  im afraid well be adrift again before very long and while i wish you had seen nobody moved those cases its my fault he said theres another thing i must mention so that you may realize all you owe me that was miss coulthurst of holtcar to whom i was talking though of course i should have been attending to my business instead and from what she told me it seems that i neednt have brought you and hetty out here at all esmond got better rapidly and could not even be induced to prosecute  leger smiled well he said im uncommonly glad to hear it and in regard to the other question neither of us has any intention of blaming you so far we have been a good deal better off than we probably should ever have been in england  nothing further was said about the affair though both of them devoted more than a little anxious thought to it until one morning they were summoned before the head wharfinger  theyre raising cain in the office about a consignment of tea billed through urgent to the east thats gone down the soo line into the states he said i guess ive no more use for either of you  i cant grumble said ingleby who had almost expected this still i should like to point out that only one of us is responsible  no said leger as a matter of fact there were two and if there hadnt been it would have come to the same thing anyway  the wharfinger nodded well he said id keep you if i could but after the circus thats going on about the thing its out of the question i guess id try the green river diggings if i were you  they went out together and when ingleby was about to speak leger checked him with a gesture i think i know what you mean to saybut theres another question to consider he said trades slack in the city just now and taking it all round i fancy that mans advice is good if we can induce hetty to stay here well try the new mining country  in different circumstances ingleby would have been exultant at the prospect but as it was he recognized his responsibility it was however late that evening before they were able to lay the state of affairs before hetty and ingleby was almost astonished at the quietness with which she listened  well she said theres no use worrying about it now all you have to do is to try the mines the man who came down with the gold yesterday said they were offering five and six dollars to anybody who would work on some of the claims  but you dont seem to realize that we should have to leave you behind said leger  hetty laughed and flashed a covert glance at ingleby no she said im coming with you  the two men looked at each other and leger protested hetty he said its out of the question you couldnt face the snow and frost and i dont even know how we could get you there there are forests one can scarcely drag a packhorse through as well as rivers one has to swim them across and we should probably have to spend several weeks on the trail in fact it seems to be an appalling country to get through  go on said hetty drily isnt there anything else  there are certainly mosquitoes that almost eat you alive you know you never could stand mosquitoes  are they quite as big as bluebottles said hetty  leger made a little gesture and glanced at ingleby as if to ask for support but though hettys brows were assuming a portentous straightness she smiled again  walter was anxious to leave me behind once before so you neednt look at him she said in fact theres not the least use in talking im coming  ingleby said nothing he did not wish to hurt the girl though he fancied he knew how hard she would find the life they must lead in the great desolation into which they were about to venture that grace coulthurst was going there did not affect the question for there could be no comparison between the lot of a prospectors sister and that of the daughter of the gold commissioner then he saw that hetty was watching him  of course you dont want me walter she said  ingleby felt his face grow hot hetty he said simply you ought to know that isnt so if you must come we shall be glad to have you and if you find the life a hard one you must try to forgive me if i had known what i was doing i might have spared you this  they had decided it all in half an hour but ingleby frowned when he and his comrade were left alone  the whole thing hurts me horribly tom he said of course we can worry along and may do wellbut you have read what the country is likeand hetty  leger appeared unusually grave it is he said certainly a little rough on hetty she at least was not to blame but she will have to face the results all the same and whatever we have to put up with will be twice as hard on her  ingleby said nothing for he realized his responsibility in compensation for the few minutes he had spent with grace coulthurst hetty leger must drag out months of privation and peril     viii  on the trail   darkness was settling down upon the mountains and the chill of the snow was in the air when hetty leger and ingleby sat beside a crackling fire down in the great gorge beneath them the white mists were streaming athwart the climbing pines and no sound broke the deep stillness but the restless stamping of the tethered packhorses and the soft splash of falling water hetty had a brown blanket rolled about her and there were hard red blotches where the mosquitoes had left their virus on the hand she laid upon it leger lay not far away and his face was swollen but ingleby had escaped almost scatheless as some men seem to do from the onslaughts of the buzzing legions which had pursued them through the swampy hollows  a blackened kettle a spideras a fryingpan is usually termed in that countryand a few plates of indurated fibre lay about the fire for the last meal of the day was over and it had been as frugal as any one who had not undertaken twelve hours toil in that vivifying air would probably have found it unappetizing where resinous wood was plentiful ingleby could make a fire but he could not catch a trout or shoot a deer indeed a man unaccustomed to the bush usually finds it astonishingly difficult even to see one and provisions were worth a ransom in the auriferous wilderness into which they were pushing their way they had spent several weeks in it now travelling where the trail was unusually good eight to twelve miles a day though there were occasions when they made less than half the distance with infinite difficulty and hetty alone knew what that journey had cost her  the white peaks that gleamed ethereally high up in the blue crystal lakes and the endless ranks of climbing pines scarcely appealed to her as she floundered through tangled undergrowth and tenfoot fern or stumbled amidst the boulders beside thundering rivers she had lain awake shivering with the illpacked fir twigs galling her weary body high up on great hill shoulders and fared spartanly on a morsel of unsavoury salt pork and a handful of flour while ingleby set his lips now and then when he saw the little forced smile in her jaded face it was no great consolation to reflect that other women in that country had borne as much and more  walter she said you and tom are very quiet i expect youre tired  ingleby smiled though his heart smote him as he saw the weariness in her eyes  i certainly am he said still we cant be half as worn out as you are you were limping all the afternoon  if i was it was only the boot that hurt me said hetty all those loose stones and gravel made it worse you see how many miles have we come today  i feel that it must have been forty but you shall have a rest tomorrow and you dont look as comfortable as you ought to now would you mind standing up a minute  hetty rose hiding the effort it cost her and when he had shaken up the cedar twigs into a softer cushion sank gratefully down on them then she turned her face aside that he might not see the little flush that crept into it as he gravely tucked the coarse brown blanket round her  now he said i think that ought to be a good deal nicer youre too patient hetty and im almost afraid we dont take enough care of you  the girl saw his face in the firelight and sighed as she noticed the gentleness in it she knew exactly how far his concern for her went leger noticed it but his shrewdness failed him now and then  he will make somebody a good husband by and by he said she will have a good deal to thank you for hetty  ingleby smiled with an absence of embarrassment which had its significance for one of the party  there are after all a good many advantages attached to being a single man and i shall probably have to be content with them he said  of course said hetty softly it is no use crying for the moon  what do you mean by that  nothing in particular and hetty glanced reflectively at the fire still i dont think you would be content with any girl likely to look at you and most of us would like to have a good deal more than we ever get  ingleby was a trifle disconcerted though hetty had an unpleasant habit of astonishing him in this fashion but leger laughed  it probably wouldnt be good for us to have it at least that is the orthodox view and after all one can always do without  of course said hetty with a curious little inflection in her voice still it is a little hard now and then isnt it walter  is there any special reason why you should ask me  hetty appeared reflective perhaps there isnt i really dont know do you hear a sound in the valley tom  they listened and a beat of hoofs came out of the sliding mists below for the last week they had met nobody upon the trail but now several men and horses were apparently scrambling up the hillside for they could hear the gravel rattling away beneath them the sound grew louder and at last a man called to them  lead that beast of yours out of the trail he said  ingleby glanced at his comrade for the voice was english and had a little imperious ring in it and leger smiled  there is no doubt where that man comes from but i scarcely think theres any great need of haste he said  do you mean to keep us waiting the voice rose again sharply its some of your slouching prospectors major get down and cut that beasts tether trooper  ingleby rose and moved out into the trail and had just led the packhorse clear of it when a horseman rode up he was dressed in what appeared to be cavalry uniform and was ingleby surmised that worn by the northwest police a detachment of which had lately been dispatched to the new mining districts of the far north it was also evident that he held a commission for the firelight which forced it up out of the surrounding gloom showed the imperiousness in his face it also showed ingleby standing very straight in front of him with his head tilted backwards a trifle then there was a jingle of accoutrements as the young officer turning halfround in his saddle with one hand on his hip glanced backward down the trail  look out for the low branch as you come up sir he said  ingleby stood still nettled by the fashion in which the man ignored him for no freighter or prospector would have passed without at least a friendly greeting and while he waited it happened that leger stirred the fire a brighter blaze sprang up and flashed upon the officers accoutrements and spurs and then there was a pounding of hoofs and a horse reared suddenly in the stream of ruddy light the officer wheeled his beast with a warning shout but ingleby had seen the shadowy form in the habit and seized the horses bridle  hold fast he said theres a nasty drop just outside the trail  then for a few seconds man and startled horse apparently went round and round scattering fir needles and rattling gravel until the halfbroken cayuse yielded and ingleby stood still gasping with his hand on the bridle while a girl who did not seem very much concerned looked down on him from the saddle  you she said i fancied the voice was familiar so you are going to the mines after all  the firelight still flickering redly upon the towering trunks showed hetty leger the curious intentness in inglebys gaze then having done enough to disturb her peace of mind for that night at least it sank a trifle and as two more men rode out of the shadow the officer turned to ingleby  have you no more sense than build your fire right beside the trail he asked  ingleby quietly turned his back on him and patted the still trembling horse  i hope you were not frightened miss coulthurst he said  grace smiled at him but before she could speak the young officer pushed his horse a few paces nearer ingleby  i asked you a question he said  ingleby glanced at him over his shoulder yes he said drily i believe you did  he turned his head again and hetty sitting unseen in the shadow failed to see his face as he looked up at the girl whose bridle he held she could however see the young officer glancing down at him apparently with astonishment as well as anger and the police trooper behind sitting woodenly still with a broad grin on his face until a burly man appeared suddenly in the sinking light then grace coulthurst laughed  will you be good enough to ride on reggie i told you my opinion of this horse she said father i really think you ought to thank mr ingleby  major coulthurst turned suddenly in his saddle  ingleby he said very much obliged to you im sure i have a fancy ive seen you before  i once had the pleasure of handing you a cup of tea at a tennis match at holtcar  coulthurst laughed yes he said i remember it now especially as it was a remarkably hot day and i would a good deal sooner have had a whiskyandsoda still ive seen you somewhere since then havent i  yes sir said ingleby drily on a sunday afternoonat willow dene  coulthurst laughed again goodhumouredly of course i remember that too though i hope youve grown out of your fondness for taking liberties with other peoples property that kind of thing is still less tolerated in this country in the meanwhile we have a good way to go before we camp once more im much obliged to you  he touched his horse with the spur and when he and the troopers melted into the night ingleby turned with one hand closed a trifle viciously towards the fire  major coulthurst is human anyway but the other fellows insolence made me long to pull him off his horse he said is there after all any essential difference between an officer of the northwest police and a mineral claim prospector  one cant help admitting that in some respects there seems to be a good deal said leger drily still i should scarcely fancy the canadian ones are likely to be so unpleasantly sensible of it the gentleman in question was apparently born in england  where else could you expect a man of his kind to come from and ingleby kicked a smouldering brand back into the fire i fancied we had left that languid superciliousness behind us its galling to run up against it again here  my uncles spirit in these stones said leger still arent you getting a little too old now to run a tilt against the defects of the national character one feels more sure of doing it effectively when hes younger  ingleby laughed for his ill humour seldom lasted long i suppose nobody can help being an ass now and then and after all the best protest is the sure and silent kick when people who treat you like one unnecessarily add to your burden anyway that troopers grin was soothing it suggested that there was a good deal of human nature under his uniform  i was looking at the officer man and scarcely noticed him it occurred to me that the attitude you complain of probably runs in the family  i cant say i understand you  well said leger reflectively i cant help a fancy that we once met somebody very like him on another occasion when we both lost our temper  at willow dene  exactly said leger you can think it over ill wash the plates at the creek and get some water  he turned away leaving ingleby considerably astonished and halfpersuaded that he was right the latter was still looking into the darkness when hetty spoke to him  its not worth worrying about come and sit down she said who was that girl walter  miss coulthurst said ingleby  hetty moved a little so that the firelight no longer fell upon her and ingleby noticed that she was silent a somewhat unusual time then she asked the girl you used to play tennis with at holtcar  yes  hetty wished that she could see his face you have met her before in canada  once only on the vancouver wharf the day i let them put the tea into the wrong car she was coming from the steamer  hettys face grew a trifle hard for a moment as she made a tolerably accurate guess at the cause of his neglect on the afternoon in question then with a sudden change of mood she laid her hand gently on his arm  dont you think it would have been better for everybody if she had stayed in england walter  i expect it would have been for tom and you if i had remembered what my business on the wharf was i should never have brought all this upon you  hettys hand closed almost sharply on his arm no she said i dont mean that you see i was really glad to get away from the boarding house  you assured me you liked it once said ingleby  well perhaps i did but we neednt go into that i was thinking of you just now  ingleby would not pretend to misunderstand her he felt it would probably be useless for hetty he knew could be persistent  men get rich in this country now and then he said it would at least be something to work and hope for  he could not see hettys face but he noticed that there was a faint suggestion of strain in her voice  do you think she would ever be happy with you even if you found a gold mine she said  what do you mean hetty and ingleby turned towards her suddenly with a flush in his face  i only want to save you trouble dont you think when a girl of that kind found out how much there was that she had been accustomed to think necessary and that you knew nothing about she might remember the difference between herself and you after all its not always the most important points that count with a girl you know  she stopped somewhat abruptly but ingleby made a little gesture i would rather you would go on and say all you mean to  well said hetty reflectively if i had been rich i think i should like the man i married to do everythingeven play cards and billiards and shoot pheasantsas well as my friends did it wouldnt be nice to feel that i had to make excuses for him and im not sure i wouldnt be vexed if he didnt seem to know all about the things folks of that kind get for dinner  inglebys laugh was a protest but it was only halfincredulous for he had now and then realized with bitterness the deference paid to conventional niceties in england  you cant believe that would trouble any sensible woman he said  well answered hetty perhaps it mightnt for a little while or if there was only one thing you seebut if you put everything together and kept on doing what jarred on her  one could get somebody to teach him  hetty laughed to be like the officer man or mr esmond of holtcar  ingleby understood the significance of the question the little conventional customs might be acquired but the constant jarring of opinion and absence of comprehending sympathy or a common point of view was he realized quite a different thing still though there was concern in his face he had the hope of youth in him there was silence for a moment or two and then hetty spoke again  besides she said after all arent gold mines a little hard to find  just then leger made his appearance somewhat to inglebys relief and ten minutes later hetty retired to the tent while the men rolling themselves in their blankets lay down upon the cedar twigs beside the fire one of them however did not sleep as well as usual and leger noticed that his sister appeared a little languid when she rose in the morning they were weary still and it was afternoon when they once more pushed on into the wilderness along the climbing trail that had for guideposts empty provision cans     ix  hetty finds a way   the days work was over and once more the white mists were streaming athwart the pines when ingleby lay somewhat moodily outside the tent that he and leger occupied on the hillside above the green river just there the stream swirled smeared with froth and spume through a tremendous hollow above which the mountains lifted high their crenellated ramparts of ice and nevermelting snow still though usually termed one that gorge was not a cañon in the strict sense of the word for a sturdy climber could scale one side of it through the shadow of the clinging pines and there was room for a precarious trail the one road to civilization between the hillside and the thundering river  farther back the valley opened out and up and down it were scattered the green river diggings from its inner end an indian trail which as yet only one or two white men had ever trodden led on to the still richer wilderness that stretched back to the yukon above the tent stood a primitive erection of logs roofed with split cedar and hemlock bark which served at once as store and hettys dwelling she was busy inside it then for ingleby could hear the rattle of cooking utensils and listened appreciatively for he was as hungry as usual although dispirited his limbs ached from a long days strenuous toil and the stain of the soil was on his threadbare jean he and leger had spent a good many weeks now upon a placer claim and the result of their labours was a few grains of gold  he rose however when hetty came out of the shanty and stood looking down into the misty valley she was immaculately neat as she generally was even in that desolation divided by a many days journey from the nearest drygoods store and where the only approach to a laundry was an empty coaloil can and she turned to ingleby with a little smile in her eyes hetty had her sorrows and the life she led would probably have been insupportable to most women reared in an english town but she had long been accustomed to turn a cheerful face upon a very hard world and ingleby though he did not know exactly why felt glad that she was there there are women who produce this effect on those they live among and they are seldom the most brilliant ones still he did not speak for hetty leger was not a young woman who on all occasions demanded attention  no sign of tom she said  no said ingleby i only hope he brings something with him and hasnt lost the flies again i gave a man who went out a dollar each for them and i couldnt get another if i offered ten the plain hooks i got in vancouver are no use either when there apparently isnt a worm in the country  hetty smiled though there were reasons why a trout fly was worth a good deal to them and one of them became apparent when she glanced at the empty spider laid beside the fire which burned clear and red between two small logs laid parallel to each other and about a foot apart  if he doesnt youll have to put up with bread and dried apples the porks done she said  it was perhaps not the kind of conversation one would have expected from a man at an impressionable age and a distinctly pretty girl especially when they stood alone in such a scene of wild grandeur as few mens eyes have looked upon but hetty did not appear to consider it in any way out of place indeed though there had been a time when she had accepted inglebys compliments with a smile and even became a trifle venturesome in her badinage there had been a difference since they left england and while ingleby did not realize exactly what that difference was he felt that it was there hetty leger had not enjoyed any of the training which is usually at least bestowed upon young women of higher station but she had discovered early that as she expressed it there is no use in crying for the moon and she had a certain pride it was also a wholesome one and untainted by petulance or mortified vanity  i dont think she said reflectively i would worry too much about those flies  no said ingleby nobody could have called that pork good but dried apples ad libitum are apt to pall on one  hetty shook her head im afraid theyre not even going to do that she said theres very few of them left in the bottom of the bag  just then leger appeared carrying a fishingrod which ingleby had laboriously fashioned out of a straight fir branch he had also a string of trout but was apparently dripping below the knees and somewhat disconsolate the trout were dressed ready and he laid two or three of them in the pan and then sat down upon one of the hearth logs  i expect thats the last well get he said  you havent whipped those flies off said ingleby  leger nodded ruefully im afraid i have he said at least i let them sink in an eddy and hooked a boulder it comes to very much the same thing  hetty laughed as she saw inglebys face perhaps id better go away she said arent there times when it hurts you to be quiet  there are said ingleby drily this is one of them  well said hetty you can talk when you break out i heard you one night in the carbut well get supper and then if youre very good ill show you something  she stirred the fire and laid out the inevitable dried apples and a loaf of bread which was not exactly of the kind somewhat aptly termed grindstone in that country then when the edge of their hunger was blunted she took out a very diminutive fluffy object and handed it to ingleby  i wonder if the trout would be silly enough to jump at that she said its a little plumper than the other ones but i hadnt any silk to tie it with  ingleby stared at the fly in blank astonishment and then gravely passed it to leger  look at that and be thankful you have a sister he said  i am said leger with a little smile though something in his voice suggested that he meant it but whatever did you make it out of hetty  strips of frayedout cloth the blue grouses feathers and the very little threads there are in a piece of cotton when you unwind it  the tail was never made of feathers or cotton said ingleby no more was this wing hackle thats quite sure look at it tom youll notice the bright colour  hetty unwisely snatched at the fly but legers hand closed upon it and a moment or two later he laughed softly it certainly wont come out in the water and that is presumably more than could be said of everybodys hair  ingleby took the fly from him and leger proceeded now we have got over that difficulty there is another to consider  there generally is said hetty  this one is serious said her brother one can no more live upon trout and nothing else than he can upon dried apples and while the flour is running out we have neither dollars nor dust to buy any more with our friend the freighter cannot be induced to grubstake everybody and im not sure one could blame him for asking five or six times as much for his provisions as they are worth in the cities when you consider the nature of the trail of course walter and i could earn a few dollars at tomlinsons mine  he stopped and looked at ingleby whose face grew a trifle grave  a placer claim said the latter can only be held while you work upon it continuously  exactly seventytwo hours after we lay down the shovel any other man who thinks it worth while can seize upon our last chance of making a fortune i think you understand that considering the present cost of provisions we are scarcely likely to save as much as would keep us while we try again out of what we make on tomlinsons claim  ingleby realized this and said nothing the giving up of his claim implied the parting with certain aspirations which had of late supported him through long days of feverish toil but one must live and he had discovered that to work as the free miners do in that country a somewhat ample diet is necessary he sat near the fire and hetty who saw the hardness of his face understood it  you really think there is gold in the claim she said  yes said ingleby tomlinson and one or two of the others who have played this game half their lives admitted that the signs were as good as any they had seen still im by no means sure we can hold out until we strike it  hetty smiled in a curious fashion especially while you have me to keep  even leger appeared astonished and ingleby flushed hotly as he turned to her hetty he said sternly what do you mean by that  the girl laughed and pointed to the loaf that is nice bread  it is said ingleby still i dont see what that has to do with it  theres no bread like it in the green river country persisted hetty they taught me to bake at the boardinghouse i made it  ingleby looked at her in astonishment go on he said ill wait a little  well and though hetty spoke quietly her voice was not quite her usual one what are you and tom longing for just now more than anything  the means to go on working on our claim  then what would you say if i gave you them  ingleby gasped for days he had been haunted by the fear that their provisions would run out before they found the gold he believed in for a little very simple figuring had shown that there was only a faint hope of their making more than the value of their days labour once they relinquished the hitherto unprofitable claim there was also it was evident no great probability that a mere wielder of pick and shovel would ever gain the regard of the gold commissioners daughter though miss coulthurst whom he met occasionally had of late been unusually gracious to him he had however not the faintest notion of the fact that hetty leger read his thoughts  you see its quite simple she said i made this bread and there are men up the valley who are really finding gold they dont want to waste a minute doing anything else and it takes time to bake you cant even make flapjacks in a moment now if i had two or three sacks of flour i think i could get almost what i liked to ask for every loaf  leger looked up with a little expressive smile i believe she has found the way out of the difficulty  it was however ingleby at whom hetty glanced though it did not strike him thenas it did long afterwardsthat she must have been quite aware what she was offering him  well she said  inglebys lips were set and his face a trifle grim to live even for the purpose of working for a result by which she would benefit upon the yield of a womans enterprise and toil did not commend itself to him though he could not very well tell her so  we havent got the flour he said  no said hetty still it can be bought at the settlement and no doubt you could find the packhorses in the bush you could go down and get it while tom holds the claim  there is still the difficulty that i havent got the money  hetty laughed i have the wages were really good at the boardinghouse of course you and tom could build the oven and chop the wood while i wouldnt mind your kneading the dough either if you wanted to that would leave me with nothing to do but watch the bread baking  ingleby still said nothing but his face as the firelight showed was a trifle flushed and leger shook his head at him one cant afford to be whimsical up here he said anyway im willing to give the thing a trial and if we dont strike gold we can always go over to tomlinsons or start baking too i shouldnt wonder if it should turn out as profitable as mining and it is certainly likely to be a good deal more reliable  hetty once more glanced at ingleby of course we cant make you join us if you dont want  at last ingleby turned to her hetty he said quietly i dont think you could understand how much you have done for me i would sooner cut my hand off than let the claim go  hetty only smiled and they had almost thrashed out the scheme when a thud of hoofs came up faintly through the roar of the river from the gorge below then the figure of a horseman became visible and when he swung himself very stiffly from the saddle in front of the fire ingleby rose hastily and held out his hand  mr sewell he said i dont mean it conventionally thisisa pleasure  the stranger who swept his wide hat off as he turned to hetty laughed i have just come in i wonder if i could askmrs ingleby isnt itfor a little supper  the request was a very usual one in a country where the stranger is rarely turned away unfed but hetty who seemed to draw a little farther back into the shadow was a trifle slow in answering it  miss leger she said of course you shall have supper put on two more trout and fill the kettle tom  sewell gratefully took his place beside the fire and for he had an engaging tongue had almost gained hettys confidence which was not lightly given by the time the meal was over then she looked hard at him  what did you come here for she asked  wouldnt the fame of the green river mines be excuse enough said the man  hetty shook her head no she said i dont think it would people who talk as you do arent generally fond of digging  then finding i wasnt wanted in vancouver i went back into the states and as usual got into a trifling difficulty there that was in colorado where the men and the manager of a certain big mine couldnt come to terms the manager was as not infrequently happens friendly with the constituted authorities and between them and the mens executive with whom i managed to quarrel they made that town unpleasant for me of course one gets accustomed to having his character pulled to pieces and being hustled in the streets but they go rather farther than that in colorado  and so you ran away  sewell laughed i certainly went when it was evident that i could do no good still it was in the daylight and half the populace came with me to the station  i asked you what brought you here said hetty severely  sewell made a little expressive gesture between friendsi think i can go so far he asked and it was hetty alone he looked at you see i met your brother and mr ingleby in vancouver  hetty regarded him silently for a moment or two he was a wellfavoured man with a curiously pleasing manner yes she said i think you can  then i came here to see what i could do at miningi have really used the shovel oftener than you seem to fancyand when it is necessary go through by the indian trail to the camps between this country and the yukon though they will probably work on quietly while the ground is soft theyre not pleased with the mining regulations yonder  he looked out into the soft blue darkness which now veiled the great white peaks that lay between him and the vast desolation of the northwest and the smile died out of his eyes a few moments slipped by before leger broke the silence  i believe that trail is scarcely practicable to a white man only one or two have ever tried it he said  that is so much the better i am however certainly going in  there was a little silence and then ingleby said suggestively they have been sending a good many of the northwest police into that country  sewell smiled from one point of view i think they were wise its not the contented that one usually finds mining in the wilderness the soil of course is british but that after all does not imply very much  you mean that the men up there have no country asked leger  some of them at least have unpleasantly good memories they are the castouts and the superfluities but as no doubt you know it is not their criminals the older lands get rid of now  that said hetty sharply is all nonsense if theyre really bad they are put into prison  sewell laughed i believe they are now and then now suppose you tell me about the green river country  they sat late that night about the crackling fire though there was a vague uneasiness upon two of them hetty liked the stranger as a man but she had seen that trouble came of following out the theories he believed in while all ingleby wished for just then was an opportunity for toiling quietly at his claim  sewell naturally slept in their tent and it was not until he had breakfasted next morning that he rode into the valley ingleby walked with him a short distance and as it happened they met grace coulthurst on the trail she smiled as she passed ingleby sewell his companion fancied looked at her harder than was necessary as he sat still in the saddle a somewhat striking figure of a man with his wide hat in his hand  who is that he asked  miss coulthurst daughter of the gold commissioner  there is no reason why a prospector shouldnt look at a queen and she has a striking face of course one would hardly call it beautifulstill it is distinctly attractive  you have no doubt met a good many beautiful women of her station asked ingleby who was a trifle nettled and could not quite restrain the ironical question  sewell laughed well he said i have certainly come across one or two besides i had rather a fancy that i might be an artist oncea good while ago  ingleby was duly astonished but no more was said on the subject and in another few minutes sewell rode on up the valley alone     x  unrest   it was as hot as it can be now and then during the fierce brief summer of the north and the perspiration rose in beads on the crown recorders face as he stood on the rude verandah of his logbuilt dwelling looking down at the tents and shanties which showed here and there amidst the pines he was a little man with a quiet and almost expressionless face and attired although he lived far remote from civilization in the wilderness with a fastidious neatness which with the erectness of his carriage furnished a hint as to his character there was however nothing that any one could have termed finicking about him he was precise formal and unemotional a man of fixed opinions as little to be moved by argument as by any attempt at compulsion for recorder eshelby was one of the insular englishmen who when entrusted with authority on the outskirts of the empire are equally capable of adding to their nations credit or involving it in difficulties by their soulless and undeviating regard for its law there are a good many of them and while occasionally respected they are as a rule not greatly loved in any of englands dependencies  sitting in the shadowy room behind him a hardbitten canadian of a very different stamp watched eshelby with an ironical twinkle in his eyes he had won his promotion on merit in the northwest police and there was red dust on his faded uniform which showed a roughly stitchedup rent here and there  outside the sunglare was dazzling and when he turned his eyes from eshelby he could see the peaks gleaming with a hard whiteness against the blue they were by no means high for the level of perpetual snow is low in that country and it was only on the eastern hand that they rose to any elevation west and north a desolation of swamp muskeg wherein few living creatures could face the mosquitoes rock and river stretched back to the yukon and eshelby was there to carry out the mining laws of that district which are less lenient than those of the province to the south of it  the valley was very still and the drowsy fragrance of the firs crept into the dwelling but slavin who would sooner have heard the clatter of shovels or the crash of a blasting charge was not in the least deceived he knew that unusual quietness now and then presages storm and he had felt that there was a tension in the atmosphere for some little time he smiled however when eshelby glanced into the room  if they do not turn up in another minute i will walk across to the outpost with you said the latter the time is up  he spoke concisely with a clean english intonation and as usual betrayed no impatience but slavin fancied he was by no means pleased at the fact that a band of miners with grievances should presume to keep him waiting for even a few moments  i guess theyll come he said if i were you id promise them something if its only to humour them  eshelby glanced at him coldly for he was not as a rule addicted to considering any advice that might be offered him  a concession he said is usually regarded as a sign of wavering in dealing with a mob of this kind firmness is necessary  slavin made a little gesture and smiled in a somewhat curious fashion he had shepherded the blackfeet on the plains as well as put down whiskyrunners and carried out the prohibition laws and he knew that to gain an end one must yield a point occasionally it was however not his business to instruct the crown recorder and eshelby seldom deviated a hairsbreadth from the course he had once decided on  well slavin said i guess i hear them and ill stay right where i am they cant see me in the shadow and if they knew i was hanging round it might worry them you dont want to hang out a red rag when you have a difference of opinion with a bull  he moved his chair back a little farther from the door when a murmur of voices and patter of feet came up through the dimness beneath the stunted pines for he was quite aware that his warning was not likely to restrain eshelby from a display of the exasperating crimson on the smallest provocation then he leaned forward with a quiet intentness in his eyes as a group of men came out of the shadows they were dressed for the most part in soilstained jean and were all of them spare of flesh and sinewy they had bronzed faces with a significant grimness in them and moved with a certain air of resolution that did not astonish slavin they were hard menenglish canadians americans teutons by birththough that meant very little to most of them then men who had faced many perils and borne as much privation as flesh and blood is capable of to men of their kind all countries are the same and they have not as a rule any particular tenderness for the land which had in their phraseology no use for them  they had also or at least so they thought legitimate grievances for the exactions of the crown were heavy and it is because the opinions of such as they were are seldom listened to that news now and then reaches england which is unpleasant to complacent optimists with imperialistic views the wonder is however that the latter are not more frequently disturbed in their tranquillity for even when peace and prosperity are proclaimed at st stephens there is usually and probably must necessarily be all round the fringe of the empire a vague unrest which is occasionally rife with unpleasant probabilities the men of the outer marches have primitive passions and or they would in all probability never have been there at all an indomitable will slavin at least understood them and knew that while it is well to keep a tight grasp on the reins it is not always advisable to make those driven unduly sensible of it  two who came foremost stopped in front of the veranda and one of them was a wellfavoured man with restless dark eyes slavin fancied he had seen the picture of somebody very like him in an american paper the rest waited a few yards away and the man with the dark eyes greeted eshelby who responded with the curtest inclination courteously  we have come for an answer to the request we handed you he said  eshelby glanced at him coldly you are a free miner what is the name on your certificate  sewell said the other you may perhaps have heard of it  slavin started a little and then smiled to himself for there was at least no sign in the recorders face that he attached any particular significance to the announcement  well he said i have as i promised glanced at what you are pleased to term your request though it bears a somewhat unfortunate resemblance to a demand  were not going to worry bout what you call it said the man who had not spoken yet we have come here so you can tell us what you mean to do  eshelby smiled a little though it would have been wiser if he had refrained from it  personally he said i can do nothing whatever  there was a low murmur with an unpleasant note in it from the rest of the deputation the curt non possumus is usually the last resource of the diplomatist when argument has failed and it very seldom makes for peace as everybody knows slavin wondered why the crown authorities should have inflicted upon him such a man as eshelby when his burden was already sufficiently heavy  well said the miner grimly something has got to be done we let you know what we wanted havent you anything to say  only that i shall send your petition to the proper quarter  i wonder said sewell drily if you would tell us what is likely to be done with it there  it will receive attention when the department is at liberty to consider it  sewell laughed presumably at any time during the next two years can you guarantee that it will not be neatly docketed and put away for ever  and said one of the men who stood behind we may be dead by then howre we going to worry through when the snow comes and its going to cost a fortune to get provisions in when the crown takes the big share of what most of us make  eshelby did not even look at the last speaker as he answered sewell  i certainly cant guarantee anything he said  there was a little murmur from the men but sewell raised his hand restrainingly we had he said with a quietness which had nevertheless a suggestion of irony in it the honour of pointing out to you some of our difficulties and suggesting how they could be obviated we may now take it that you can give us no assurance that the matter will even receive the attention we at least think necessary  i am said eshelby not in a position to promise you anything the petition will be submitted to men qualified to deal with it  with a recommendation that as the matter is urgent it should be looked into  eshelby straightened himself a trifle my views will be explained to those in authority i do not recognize any necessity for laying them before you  the rest of the deputation had drawn a little closer to sewell and slavin was watching their faces intently he felt that unless they had confidence in their leader and he was endued with all the qualities necessary for the part there was trouble on hand sewell who made a little forceful gesture as he glanced at the rest was however apparently still master of the situation  then he said there is in the meanwhile nothing you can suggest  i fancied you understood that already said eshelby if those whose business it is think fit to modify the regulations you complain of i will let you know unless that happens they will be adhered to as usual rigorously  his coldly even voice was in itself an aggravation and slavin who saw one of the deputation move forward with a little glow in his eyes rose sharply to his feet he however sat down again next moment with a smile for sewell quietly laid his hand upon the mans arm and the rest stood still in obedience to his gesture slavin was not astonished for he too was a man who understood how to wield authority  then said sewell we need not waste any more of your time we have heard nothing that we did not expect boys and now we at least know where we stand  he turned once more to eshelby raising his wide hat and then moved back into the shadow of the pines taking care as slavin noticed that the others who did not seem greatly desirous of doing so went on in front of him the recorder glanced at slavin complacently when they disappeared  a little firmness is usually effective in a case of this kind he said i will of course send on the petition but as i scarcely suppose it will be referred to again we can consider the affair as closed  slavin smiled i am not quite so sure as you seem to be the fellows last remark was a significant one and hes not the kind of man to stand still anywhere very long anyway he and you between you have forced my hand and while i have got to take your lead the game is going to be a risky one  eshelby sat down with a little gesture which implied that he had already given the trifling affair rather more attention than it merited and slavin went out to take such proceedings as appeared advisable though it was not until that night that the result of them became evident  sewell was then sitting with eight or nine men in the general room of hobsons oregon hotel it had walls of undressed logs but the roof was still of canvas for hobson had been too busy watching over his interests in several profitable claims and dispensing deleterious liquor to split sufficient cedar there was another room in the building in which he slept with any newcomer who was rash enough to put his hospitality to the test rather more than a hundred miners were at work in that valley but only a few whose views and influence with the rest were known had been invited to attend the conference  the room was foul with tobacco smoke and the reek of kerosene for the big lamp smoked when the roof canvas flapped now and then sewell sat in a deerhide chair with a pipe in his hand and a man with a grim bronzed face and a splendid corded arm showing through the torn sleeve of his shirt was speaking he spoke quietly and like a man of education  we have he said as our host has pointed out done the straight thing and given constituted authority a show the constituted authority as usual prefers to do nothing we naturally consider our grievances warranted but i need not go into them again some of us risked our lives to get here the rest will probably do so by holding on through the winter and considering how we work it is not exactly astonishing that we wish to take back a little gold with uswhich we are scarcely likely to do under the present regulations i however fancy the position is plain enough to everybody  the question hobson said another man is hows it going to be altered  by kicking said hobson drily you want to start in hard and stay right there with it  there was a murmur of approval and a man stood up  that i guess is just the pointwhos to begin and when he said theres mighty little use in three or four of us wearing our shoes out before the rest no sir slavin would come round with his troopers and run those men out  sewell nodded our friend has hit it we have got to go slow he said there are at least a hundred men in this valley and a good many more with the same grievances farther west without mentioning the green river country where the regulations are easier now it will be your business to go round and make sure of the men here joining us a good many of them are ready and well strike when you can get the rest the kick will have to be unanimous  thats so said another man lie low until were ready well when the time comes youll have your programme  sewell leaned forward in his chair with a little glow in his eyes then he said we will for one thing show recorder eshelby out of the valley by way of a protest and if it appears necessary as it probably will do seize slavins armoury well make our regulations and give the crown people a hint that they had better sanction them  there was a little hum of approbation and a man stood up i guess thats the platform he said half the men in this country are americans and alaska is not so far away once we show we mean it theyre coming right in and when we start in twisting the beavers tail were going to get some backing at home do you know any reason why we shouldnt send somebody down south to whip up a campaign fund there was plenty of money piled up when the chicago irishmen were going over to ask why the british nation threw out the home rule bill  most of the others laughed but while there was no expression of sympathy it was significant that there was as little astonishment visionaries talked of founding a new republic in the north just then and some of annexation but still the beaver flag flapped over every government outpost there were many men with grievances in that country but they knew the world and were far from sure that there was anything to be gained by changing their accustomed burden for what might prove to be a more grievous one there were others who while by no means contented with the mining regulations were still characterized by the sturdy imperialism which is to be met with throughout most of canada  hobson turned to the speaker with a whimsical grin the chicago irishmen stayed right where they were he said i dont know what they did with the money but they bought no riflesthey werent blame fools the moral is that what an irishman looks at twice is too big a thing for us no sir you wouldnt raise ten dollars in a month down there america has all the trouble she has any use for already what we want to do is to put up a good big bluffand no more than thaton the british empire  hows the empire going to take it asked another  sewell smiled patiently i think that is if we go just far enough and know when to stop they move slowly in englandi was born thereand im not sure theyre very much quicker in ottawa in fact they rather like an energetic protest and you very seldom get anything without it once we show were in earnest theyll send over a special commissioner with instructions to make any concessions he thinks will please us  there are slavin and his troopers to consider said the man who had spoken first theyre not going to sit still and if any of them got hurt during the proceedings its quite likely we might be visited by a column of canadian militia  others commenced to speaktwo or three together in factbut sewell raised his hand  that eventuality will have to be carefully guarded against he said slavin seems to be a man of ability and sense and he would never pit his handful of troopers against a hundred men in the meanwhile everything depends on secrecy and no move must be made until you are sure of everybody i will answer for the green river men i am going back there shortly  then they put their heads together to consider a scheme and there was only a low hum of voices until hobson stood up suddenly a tramp of feet and a sharp order rose from outside  slavin and the troopers he said we dont want him to know whos here get out through the roof boys put the lamp out  it was done and while a sound of ripping and scrambling became audible in the black darkness hobson touched sewells arm  you and i have got to see it out i guess hes sure of us he said  in another moment or two somebody beat upon the door and getting no answer drove it open then a sulphur match sputtered and the trooper who stood in the entrance turned to a man behind him  there are only two men here sir he said  light that lamp said the other man i feel tolerably certain there were considerably more  hobson stood forward when the feeble light of the blue flame made him dimly visible  i guess its broke he said  bring rignaulds lantern said the man in the darkness  it was at least a minute before another trooper appeared with a light and sewell surmised that his companions had made good use of the time slavin who as he quite expected was standing in the doorway seemed to realize it too for he glanced at the torn canvas  i might have thought of that he said you and rignauld will start down the trail and stop any man you come across though i guess theyre back in their tents or in the bush by now  the trooper went out and slavin turned to hobson with a smile on his face we have got you anyway and youll spend tonight at least in the outpost tomorrow ill look into the question of the liquorsale permits and its quite likely this saloon will be closed ill have to take you along as well mr sewell  sewell made a goodhumoured gesture of resignation i suppose ill have to come its a proceeding im not altogether unaccustomed to still im not sure there is any charge you can work up against me  slavin looked at him almost appreciatively well he said i fancy youre not going to make any trouble here in fact its very probable that you will leave this settlement early tomorrow though it would have been a good deal better had i choked you off from coming here i would have done it had i known who you were you will take any steps that seem necessary if these gentlemen try to get away trooper nixon  sewell spent that night at the outpost but not in the same room with hobson and when he had breakfasted tolerably well slavin came in  your horse is waiting and you will start at oncefor wherever you like so long as its outside my boundaries though i may as well mention that every officer in the district will be warned against you he said if you feel yourself aggrieved you can of course complain to victoria  sewell made no protest when he knew it would be useless he seldom did and slavin who handed him several days provisions waited until he swung himself into the saddle  it wouldnt be wise to push your luck too hard by coming back he said  sewell smiled from the saddle and rode away he knew that the seed was sown and need only be left to spring and ripen though he would have felt easier had he been sure that slavin did not know it too eshelby could be trusted to stimulate the growth of the crop but he had already grasped the capabilities of the quiet police officer who it was evident was a very different kind of man     xi  ingleby ventures a remonstrance   it was late in the afternoon when ingleby who led two jaded packhorses limped into the green river cañon his long boots which were caked with the mire of leagues of travel galled him cruelly every joint was aching and it was only by an effort he kept himself on his feet at all it had rained most of the way from the distant settlement where he had been for the flour hetty had asked for and during the last week he had slept by snatches amidst the dripping fern while the pitiless deluge thrashed the fir trunks that indifferently sheltered him the few strips of natural prairie in the valleys had turned to treacherous swamps where he sank to the knee and every few miles there was a furious torrent to be forded perilously  had he been called on to make that journey under such conditions when fresh from england he would probably never have reached the cañon but strenuous toil with pick and shovel and the simple life of the wilderness had hardened him and endued him with the strength of will which holds the wornout body in due subjection mans capacity for endurance is as even the hardhanded bushman knows moral as well as physical but ingleby was making his last effort when he reached the great rift between the hills  the river roared close beneath him swirling among its boulders stained green with the clay of a great glacier and overhead the sombre pines were blurred by mist and rain no laden beast could scale the slope they clung to and a treacherous bank of gravel on which a man could scarcely keep his footing dropped to the river just outside the slushy trail ingleby sank ankledeep in mire at every step but he held on doggedly with a hand on the leading horses bridle and the rain on his face for legers camp was not very far away and he feared that if he rested now his wornout limbs might fail him when he came to start again  that was sufficient to account for the sudden hardening of his face when a thud of hoofs came out of the rain the trail was especially soft and narrow just there and it would evidently be a risky matter to attempt to lead two horses past each other thrusting the leading beast close in to the inner side he raised his voice as two figures materialized amidst the trunks in front of him down in that great hollow the light was dim but the clatter of accoutrements told him it was a couple of police troopers who were approaching  stop where you are until i get by theres scarcely room for both of us he said  it was evident that the men heard him for one said something to the other sharply but they did not stop they came on at a floundering trot instead until ingleby saw who the foremost was and pulled the packhorse across the trail then there was a musical jingling as the men drew bridle and ingleby and the leader looked at each other he wore an officers uniform and there was just then a little sardonic gleam in his dark eyes he was also very like the man ingleby who now knew he bore the same name had faced at willow dene  why didnt you pull up behind there packer he asked  you couldnt have got past captain esmond said ingleby i was well into the narrow stretch when i called to you  that said the policeman is a trifle unfortunatefor you it ought to be tolerably evident that i cant wheel my horse now  it was apparently out of the question but inglebys wet face grew a trifle grim for the assurance with which the young officer claimed precedence was exasperating and he knew that any miner in the valley seeing him hampered by two laden beasts would have made way for him one of them it was evident must leave the trail but ingleby felt that the question which that one would be was by no means decided yet he glanced at the swirling pool below and though he fancied there was no great depth of water it was clear to him that even if he could lead the wornout beasts down the slippery slope of gravel he could never drag them up again  you should have foreseen that when i warned you to stop he said  a little flicker of colour showed in esmonds face but he sat easily and as it seemed to ingleby insolently still in his saddle looking at him with an excellent assumption of ironical incredulity as though unwilling to believe that he had heard correctly this was the more exasperating because ingleby had his share of the sturdy english independence and an almost unreasoning dislike of anything that savoured of arrogance it was however consoling to remember that in the wilderness the patrician is held of no more account than the manhood inherent in him warrants and must either waive his claim to superiority or support it by his own resources there was also no sign that the trooper sympathized with his officer  will you be good enough to get out of my way asked esmond with portentous quietness  there was no answer and he touched his horse with the spur the beast floundered forward splashing in the mire but ingleby stood still with a grim wet face in the middle of the trail and a faint trace of astonishment crept into the young officers eyes for as sometimes happens in the case of men with sufficient belief in themselves he had hitherto found the world inclined to take him at his own valuation now he found the position as galling as it was unexpected for it was evident that the nerve of the wet and miry man who stood awaiting him with exasperating quietness was quite equal to his  esmonds blood was up and it is very probable that he would have risked the encounter had he been free from official responsibility as it was however he remembered that an officer of police is not warranted in riding down an unoffending citizen and in addition to this the heavilyladen packhorse drawn right across the trail promised to prove an embarrassing obstacle even if ingleby had not been standing beside it with a heavy fir staff in his hand it occurred to esmond that there was very little to be gained except damage to his personal dignity by riding into two bags of flour while a second packhorse similarly encumbered blocked the trail close behind  thus at the last moment he swung himself backwards with a wrench upon the bridle and there was a scattering of mire and gravel as his horse reeled down the slope to the river the beast was used to the mountains and the man had ridden from infancy so that when they plunged to the girth in the swirling pool he was still in the saddle and ingleby saw that his face was dark with a flush of anger how he was to get out was his own business and it was evident that he was in no danger so ingleby turned and gazed at the trooper who sat still with a faint but suggestive twinkle in his eyes  i dont want to wait here both the beasts and i are badly played out he said  the trooper rubbed his chin with a wet hand and glanced at his officer who had however his back to him just then as he picked his way amidst the boulders  well he said i guess if i got down and edged out to the off side you might pass me the trails a little wider here  thanks said ingleby and looked at the man as he carefully led his beasts by him the trooper also looked at him with a little comprehending grin  somebodys going to make trouble if he can find a speck on anything tomorrow he said  he swung himself into the saddle with all the haste he could contrive and with one eye still upon his officer ingleby plodded on and as dusk was closing in limped into sight of a ruddy blaze among the pines leger who had heard his approach took the packhorses bridles and ingleby stood stupidly still blinking at him  ive got it he said pointing to the flour where is it to go ill give you a hand to heave it down  leger laughed and pointed to the shanty go right in ill manage the bags myself he said tomlinson and the boys have been up and built us a new storeshed  ingleby turned towards the shanty and as he neared the doorway a slim figure cut against the light and a hand was stretched out to draw him in then he felt a little thrill run through him as he stood in the welcome warmth with hetty looking up at him there was an almost maternal gentleness and compassion in her eyes for inglebys face was a trifle grey and the water ran from him then she turned swiftly and thrust an armful of clothing upon him  put them on this minute theyre warm and dry theres a light in the new shed she said then come back here youre not to go outside again  ingleby was glad to obey her and when he came back hetty had drawn a rude chair of deerhide towards the fire  sit down and dont worry about trying to talk she said  ingleby sank wearily into the chair and lay there in a state of blissful content watching her with halfclosed eyes it was an inestimable luxury to be free from the chill of his saturated clothing and feel the warmth creep through him but by degrees he became sensible that his contentment had more than a physical origin the soft rustle of hettys dress was soothing as she laid out a simple meal her quick light footsteps suggested a gratifying anxiety to minister to his comfort and he found the fashion in which she smiled at him as she did once or twice especially pleasant hetty had a spice of temper and a will of her own but she was also endued with the kindliness which makes up for a good many deficiencies ingleby turned his head at last and looked at her languidly  you make this shanty feel like homethough it is a very long while since i had one he said  hetty flushed ever so slightly and ingleby naturally did not notice it  we have been making improvements since you left she said it really doesnt need very much to make a place look comfortable  ingleby appeared reflective well he said i suppose it doesnt i dont know how you manage it hetty but everything seems just as one would like it when you arrange it still thats not quite what i mean either im really not sure i know what i do meanyou see im sleepy  hetty stopped close beside him and looked down with a little smile though there was just a shade more colour than usual in her face  you are worn out and neednt worry about it until you have had supper she said if i had known you would come back like this i would never have let you go  still you wanted the flour  i didnt mean you to wear yourself out to save those lazy miners from baking their own bread  ingleby shook his head i shall be all right tomorrow and im going to talk he said that wasnt why you sent me one doesnt start a bakery out of philanthropy  well said hetty you know i wanted the money  for tom and me said ingleby reproachfully i felt horribly mean about it all the way to the settlement  is it very unpleasant then to let me do anything for you  no said ingleby that is of course its generally very nice still in this case  hetty looked at him curiously oh i know still you seemed quite angry once because i didnt care to let you lend tom the money to bring us out  that of course was very different  hetty smiled yes she said when one is a girl it usually is  ingleby who was very drowsy did not seem quite sure what to make of this and gazed meditatively at the fire  that stone hearth wasnt there when i left he said who made it hetty  tomlinson tom went round to tell the boys about the bakery and tomlinson came over to show him how to build the oven  and he made this chair now i think of it we hadnt one before and tom certainly didnt make it its too comfortable  yes said hetty  and he built the new shed  he certainly did  ingleby seemed by no means pleased it seems to me he said severely that tomlinson has been doing a good deal here now you ought to know that when you want any improvements made you have only to ask tom and me  could you build a chimney like that one  no said ingleby decisively if i must be honest i dont think i could still there wasnt the least occasion to ask tomlinson he must have been here more than once  i believe he was here three or four times  why did he come so often  hetty laughed he said it was to see how tom was getting on with the oven  of course said ingleby well i suppose one excuse was as good as another one would however fancy that tomlinson had quite enough to do looking after his mine  hetty flashed a swift glance at him but ingleby was not looking at her he was too drowsy to be quite sure of what he felt but the fact that tomlinson had been there on several occasions was far from pleasing him just then tom leger came in with the kettle which he had boiled on the fire outside and ingleby roused himself  i suppose you have struck nothing on the claim he said  no said leger only a trace of colour but i dont want to talk of that tonight you can tell us about your journey when you have had supper  ingleby did so though the narrative was distinctly tame in its unvarnished conciseness until he came to his meeting with esmond he had no desire that hetty should know what he had endured on her account while it is after all difficult to make another person understand what one feels like when wornout to the verge of exhaustion ingleby did not attempt it but his tone changed a trifle as he tried to picture the policeman floundering in the river leger laughed softly but the firelight showed a little flash in hettys eyes  splendid she said and her voice had a little vindictive ring  leger looked up with a whimsical smile  you appear almost as angry with the man as walter was he said  well replied hetty sharply so i am  it did not occur to ingleby to wonder why the fact that the policeman had attempted to drive him off the trail should cause her so much indignation and when hetty abruptly asked a question calculated to give a different trend to the subject leger answered her  i fancy i should have endeavoured to let him scrape by if i had been there he said crowding a police officer of that kind into a river may be soothing to ones ruffled temper but i cant help concluding that its likely to turn out expensive  ingleby did not answer this and shortly afterwards retired to the tent where he spent the next ten hours in dreamless sleep he rose a little later than usual next morning but did his accustomed work at the mine though leger fancied he was a trifle preoccupied during most of the day shortly before they left their task in the evening they saw tomlinson climbing the trail to their camp with a heavy burden on his shoulders the miner had apparently got rid of it when they met him coming back and smiled in a deprecatory fashion in answer to inglebys inquiring glance  i struck a fir that was full of resin knots when i was chopping props he said it kind of struck me miss leger would have some use for them at the bakery and i just took one or two along  ingleby appeared rather more reflective than ever when the big miner went on and finally laid his hand on his companions shoulder  of course its not exactly my business but are you wise in encouraging that man to prowl about the shanty continually tom he said  leger looked at him in astonishment im not aware of having done it but if it pleases him to come there why shouldnt he  i suppose it doesnt occur to you that there is anything unusual in the fact that a man whose time is worth a good deal just now should spend several hours of it hacking pine knots out of trees and then scramble two miles with as much as a horse could carry on his back over an infamous trail  you mean that he does not do it to please you or me  yes said ingleby that is it exactly of course i know im taking an unwarranted liberty but if i had felt that hetty could have had any liking for him i should not have mentioned it to you still dont you think it might be better if she didnt see so much of him  leger laughed so far at least she hasnt shown the smallest sign of recognizing the merits of the fortunate tomlinson  ingleby looked down across the pines we are old friends and you wont mind my saying that im very glad  well said leger who glanced at him sharply i cant quite see why you should be the man has an excellent character and i like him he has also what some folks would consider of as much importance a profitable mine  still he isnt half good enough for her persisted ingleby  leger did not speak for a moment and during the somewhat embarrassing silence his face grew a trifle grave then he said quietly i fancy that is a point for hetty to decide     xii  the majors bear   darkness had closed down on the hillside and supper was over when ingleby and leger lounged on a cedar log outside the shanty hetty lay close by in the deerhide chair and tomlinson had stretched his long limbs just clear of the fire he lay placidly smoking with no more than an occasional deferential glance at hetty now and then the flickering firelight touched his face and showed the harsh lines of its rugged chiselling and the steadiness of his contemplative eyes tomlinson it was generally admitted could do more with axe and shovel than most of the men in that valley but a certain deliberateness of speech and gesture characterized him in repose he was a man who worked the harder when it was necessary because he seldom wasted an effort  it was slowly he raised his head and glanced at hetty the boys can get away with another twenty loaves this week he said jake figured youd have seven or eight more of them from the gully workings coming in they told him theyd no use for flapjacks or grindstones when they could get bread like that  very well said hetty ill have an extra batch ready on saturday  she cast a little quick glance at ingleby for it was gratifying that he should have this testimony to the quality of her bakery though it was scarcely necessary the venture had in fact been a success from the commencement and though hettys flour was rapidly running out she found it just as profitable to bake what the miners brought her at a tariff which in few other regions would have been thought strictly moderate she was also as popular as her bread for she turned nobody away though there were men in that valley with neither money nor provisions left who had failed to find even the colour of gold her boys she said would strike it rich some day and one must risk a little now and then but it is not given to many women to win the faith and homage accorded her by most of them in return for a handful of flour tomlinson however had not delivered all his message yet  i ran up against wolverine gordon yesterday he said he wants more salt in his bread says that sweet doughs ruining his digestion and if you cant fix it to suit him hell do his own baking i guess id let the old insect have his salt by the handful  hetty laughed goodhumouredly i must try to please him  tomlinson watched her with grave reflective eyes gordon was most glad to eat cedar bark not long ago he said did you ever get a dollar out of him  that said hetty quietly is not your business mr tomlinson  the longlimbed miner apparently ruminated over this  well he said i guess it isnt but you just let me know when you want any debts collected i figure i could be quite smart at it  they do it with a gun in your country asked leger  tomlinson held up a hard and distinctly largesized hand no sir if ever i get that on one of the fakirs who sling ink at us i guess ill make my little protest  there was silence for a minute or two and during it the beat of hoofs came out of the valley they drew nearer and tomlinson laughed softly as he glanced at the listeners faces  hall sewell hes coming back he said  mr sewell is across the divide ever so far away said hetty  well said the big prospector that cayuse of his is coming up the trail most too played out to put its feet down  it was five minutes later when sewell appeared leading the horse which was in almost as sorry a case as he was his jean garments hung about him torn to rags and his face was gaunt and drawn with weariness and hunger he stood still smiling at them in the uncertain light of the fire  ive come backwarned off by the police as usual he said in the language of the country nobody seems to have any use for me  the naive admission appealed to hetty as much as the signs of privation which were plain upon him did and stirred her more than any account of a successful mission would have done sewell was perhaps aware of this for he had the gift of pleasing women  well she said where else would you come to whenever you want it theres room here for you walter take his horse and then spread his blankets out near the fire tom youll get another trout and fill the kettle  they did her bidding though ingleby wondered a little as he set about it for hetty had astonished him somewhat frequently of late he had long regarded her as a girl devoid of intellectuality to be petted with brotherly kindliness and taken care of in case of necessity and it had never occurred to him until he came to canada that there was any depth of character in hetty leger it was in fact almost disconcerting to find that she had changed into a capable woman who had by her enterprize alone enabled him and her brother to hold on to their claim she was virtually mistress now as the commands she had given him indicated but while it afforded him a gratification he did not quite understand to do her bidding it was a trifle difficult to accustom himself to the position  in the meanwhile tomlinson who chafed inwardly because no commands had been laid on him lay with respectful admiration watching her prepare sewells supper when it was ready sewell made an excellent meal and then stretched himself out wearily on a pile of branches near the fire the red light flickered uncertainly upon the towering trunks behind him and now and then fell upon the longlimbed tomlinson lying in the shadow and hetty sitting in her deerhide chair with ingleby and leger stretched close at her feet it never occurred to her that there was anything anomalous in this they were in the phraseology of the country her boys and though hetty leger was far from clever she had the comprehension that comes of sympathy and she understood and ruled them as a woman with greater intellect probably could not have done the night was cool and still and the hoarse murmur of the river came up in pulsations across the pines  after a long journey through the bush this is exceptionally nice even though it is a little rough on miss leger said sewell with a quiet smile her cares are increasing for another of her boys has come home a trifle the worse for wear tonight but i scarcely think she minds it is the women who never do mind that are worth all the rest  once more ingleby was astonished and gratified sewell was of course a speaker by profession but there was a vibration in his voice which signified that this was more than a passing compliment ingleby believed implicitly in sewell and the fact that the man he looked up to should regard hetty as he evidently did had naturally its effect on him since it not infrequently needs the appreciation of others to make clear the value of that which lies nearest to one hetty however as usual evinced no originality  when you came in one would have fancied it was quite a long while since you were a boy she said  now and then i feel it is men who lead the life i do grow old rapidly you see we are in fact nurtured on the storm but that is really no reason why we shouldnt occasionally like to rest in the sunshine  it has been dark most an hour said tomlinson the practical  sewell turned and glanced at him reproachfully it is always sunshine where hetty leger is  well said hetty with a little laugh you havent seen me when the dough wont rise and i dont like idle boys they get into mischief what are you going to do  peg down a claim and earn my living virtuously i have you see tried mining already i like this end of the valley and because you have made me one of the family i fancy ill put up a shanty here that brings on the question of provisions and when i was clambering down the range i came upon two or three blacktail deer im going back to get one as soon as the stiffness has worn off me will you or leger come with me ingleby  walter will go said hetty  ingleby turned towards her slowly and she noticed the jaded look in his face which was a trifle hollow as well as bronzed he had toiled with a fierce feverish impatience for long weeks at two profitless claims and mind and body felt the strain still he remembered that it was some time since he had contributed anything to the common fund  ive ever so much on hand he said send tom  hetty made a little authoritative gesture tom couldnt hit a deer to save his life and my boys are expected to do what theyre told you will take him mr sewell and if you let him come back to the claim in less than a week ill be vexed with you  ingleby who knew that hetty could be persistent permitted sewell to arrange the expedition and when the latter retired shortly afterwards tomlinson who had said very little looked up  you like that man he asked  of course said hetty if i hadnt i wouldnt have had him here  tomlinson said nothing further but hetty laughed when he glanced inquiringly at ingleby  you neednt ask walter there are two people he believes in before anybody else and mr sewells one of them  and i guess i know who the other is said tomlinson who was a trifle tactless now and then  hetty looked at him instead of at ingleby  no she said reflectively i dont think you do it doesnt matter who she is anyway and you havent told me what you think of mr sewell  tomlinson who watched her with steady eyes sat silent a moment as though ruminating over something he could not quite understand then he said the man has grit still i havent much use for his notion of going round trailing out trouble  it isnt difficult to find it said ingleby  well said tomlinson im not going to light out when it comes along my way but i guess ill wait until it does like a sensible man and just now i have no use for any our folks in oregon are poor and if my luck holds out theres an old woman whos had bout as much trouble as she can bear going to have an easy time the rest of her life  he stopped a moment and rose leisurely to his feet well ill go along now i guess sewell means well good night  he turned away and when he lumbered into the shadow of the pines leger smiled at ingleby  it seems to me that tomlinsons recommendation didnt go very far he said  ingleby laughed a trifle scornfully did you expect anything else when a man who could have made himself almost anything he wished gives himself up to a life of privation for the good of his fellows its a little gained when men of tomlinsons description are willing to admit that he probably has good intentions  he retired to sleep shortly afterwards for he and leger commenced their labours at sunrise every day a week later towards dusk one evening he and sewell stopped near the edge of a deep ravine some distance from their camp in the ranges  the torrent which had worn it out moaned far down in the shadow below and the sombre firs rolled up to the edge of it two hundred yards away thickets of tall fern and salmonberry hung over the brink and for a score of yards or so a slope of soil and gravel sprinkled with tufts of juniper and dwarf firs ran down steeper than a roof then it broke off abruptly and from where they stood ingleby could not see the bottom of the gulf beneath though he knew that the depth of such cañons is often several hundred feet they had left their camp that morning and one small blacktail deer which sewell had shot was all they had to show for a day of strenuous labour  no way of getting across there said sewell as he flung himself down at the foot of a cedar its a little unfortunate too because from what tomlinson said its a good bear country on the opposite side one deer wont last very long even if we can manage to dry it and there are parts of the black bear that are a good deal nicer than you might suppose  have you ever tried them asked ingleby  sewell laughed i have in fact i lived on black bear for rather longer than i cared about when i was up in the ranges once before its not unlike pork i mean the kind the canadian usually keeps for home consumption  that a man who could probably get nothing else should have lived on bear meat is of course not necessarily any great recommendation but the fact tended to increase inglebys respect for his companion there was it seemed very little that sewell had not done or borne for the cause of the democracy and ingleby had already indued him with the qualities of garibaldi other men older and shrewder than he was are however occasionally addicted to idealization and sewell could certainly ride and shoot as well as he could rouse the hopes and passions of the multitudewhich was a good deal ingleby who could do neither had the englishmans appreciation of physical capability and it had once or twice been a grief to him to discover that other exponents of the opinions sewell held were flabby softfleshed men whose appearance warranted the belief that the adoption of the simple laborious life they lauded would promptly make an end of them  the hard and wiry sewell who while he preached his gospel earned his bread by bodily toil a man of comely presence and finished courtesy spartanly temperate in everything but speech with unquestioned physical as well as moral courage approached in his opinion the paulinian ideal it was however seldom that he permitted it to become apparent for ingleby like most men who shape their lives by them kept his deeper thoughts to himself and on that occasion he complained about a boot which had split in an untimely fashion at a seam until sewell looked up  did you hear anything he asked  ingleby who had not lived very long in the bush naturally heard nothing until the sudden crash of a rifle was flung back by the hillside then there was a sharp smashing of undergrowth and it was plain to him that a beast of some description was travelling through the bush  a bear exclaimed sewell the small black kind go straight at everything which lies between them and their covert i fancy that ones partly crippled too its your shot if he breaks cover you might stop him for the man he belongs to  ingleby took up the rifle he was not greatly accustomed to and waited crouching with his eyes on the forest and one foot drawn under him while the snapping and crackling drew nearer until a shambling form lurched out of a thicket then while the foresight which he could not keep still wobbled all over it he pressed the trigger or at least attempted to do so as the miner to whom the rifle belonged had instructed him he felt the butt jar his shoulder and the smoke blew in his eyes while a man burst out of the undergrowth there was no sign of the bear and ingleby fancied it had plunged over the edge of the ravine the man was red in face and gasped as he brandished his rifle in their direction  who the devil are you trying to shoot he said  he did not stop however and sewell who recognized him as major coulthurst sprang to his feet and sent a warning shout after him  hold on sir theres a big gully right in front of you he said  the major did not seem to hear him and next moment there was a crash as he floundered through a thicket then he disappeared suddenly and ingleby felt a little shiver run through him as he heard a suggestive rattle of stones  gone over he said hoarsely still the top parts not quite so horribly steep  they made for the spot at a floundering run for it is a trifle difficult to travel fast in the bush and came gasping to a rent in the undergrowth on the edge of the gully ingleby set his lips as he looked down  the major who looked up at them with fear in his eyes lay full length on the steepest part of the slope beneath with both hands clenched upon a little bush of juniper two or three yards beneath him lay a shadowy gulf and the dull roar of water that came up suggested its depth  i think this thing is coming out he said  ingleby saw a diminutive fir close to the man and two more between himself and the edge of the cañon for in that country the firs will grow on anything short of an upright wall and next moment he swung himself over the edge however he did it cautiously taking care to drive his feet well into the gravel and finally contrived to slide down to the nearest tree sewell was evidently coming down behind him for the stones went rattling by and struck the upturned face beneath it was flushed and distorted with swollen veins on the forehead for the man was evidently feeling the strain  can you hold on for a minute or two sir ingleby asked  i might manage onenot more was the hoarse answer  that should do said ingleby reassuringly and letting himself go again clutched at the tree close above the brink of the declivity he also grasped sewell who was coming down backwards amidst a shower of stones and when he arrived safe lay full length with his comrades hand upon his waist and one arm stretched out nor did he stop to consider whether he could get back to the tree again when the major clutched his hand  hold fast and well pull you up he said  next moment a strenuous grip closed upon his hand and he felt his arm being drawn out of its socket as he strove to bend his back coulthurst was horribly heavy and apparently incapable of rendering him any assistance indeed for a moment or two he was far from sure that they would not slide down into the shadowy gorge together he could see the majors suffused face and hear sewell gasping behind him  then coulthurst apparently by a supreme effort raised himself a trifle and he was a foot or two nearer the fir when he lay prone again ingleby fancied he could feel his sinews cracking and knew they would not endure that tension long  reach your left hand back said sewell hoarsely ingleby did so and felt the bark of the slender tree while sewell leaned out recklessly over him and clutched coulthursts shoulder then for a few seconds they made a very grim effort until the major got one foot under him and seized the tree after that there was no great difficulty and when they dragged him out of peril he lay still gasping for almost a minute then he raised himself so that he could sit  i think my rifle went over he said wheres the bear  sewells eyes twinkled and ingleby laughed as did the major  of course he said very much obliged im sure i mean it butwhere isthe bear  personal peril was not exactly a new thing to the major who was also a man of fixed ideas but he made a little comprehensive gesture when sewell glanced significantly at the edge of the precipice  i dont know sir and really dont think an attempt to find out would be advisable he said  as a matter of fact they never did discover what became of the bear but in the meanwhile nobody said anything further for a moment or two then the major rubbed his leg  we couldnt very well stay here all nightand ive hurt my knee he said  ingleby glanced at the almost precipitous descent im afraid we couldnt get you up without a rope  i am quite satisfied that you couldnt and dont propose to let you try said the major there are however the packhorse lariats at my camp and it cant be more than two miles away i have a police trooper there one of you could get up  ingleby fancied that it was within his powers  ill try sir if its only because i believe i came very near shooting you he said  coulthurst laughed you were within an ace of it  ingleby said nothing further but crawled very cautiously up the slope     xiii  esmond acquires information   ingleby contrived to discover coulthursts camp and when a police trooper carrying a stout lariat accompanied him back to the ravine they had some little difficulty in transporting the major who was no light weight to the surface it was however safely accomplished and ingleby was not greatly astonished to hear he had in the meanwhile insisted upon their spending at least that night in his commodious tent sewell possessed the useful faculty of making a good impression upon almost anybody and generally exercised it even when it did not appear worth while  they spent the next day with the major who extended them a bluff but cordial invitation to visit him at his official residence which ingleby for reasons of his own promised to do he was however a little astonished that sewell who had not his inducement and could scarcely be expected to consider major coulthursts patronage any particular compliment should evince an equal alacrity still he did not feel warranted in inquiring his comrades reasons and promptly forgot all about it when a few days later he and leger bottomed upon gold it was not a rich find indeed they laboriously transported and washed down a good many hundredweights of débris in return for an insignificant quantity of the precious metal but it was sufficient to fill ingleby with fresh ardour and he lengthened his hours of toil until it was with difficulty he dragged himself back at night to the camp on the hillside every stroke of pick and drill brought him so much nearer the realization of his aspirations  leger protested now and then but hetty who was wiser said nothing though there were times when she watched ingleby who naturally never suspected it with anxious eyes the physical strain and tension were commencing to tell on him for even the experienced placer miner seldom knows whether the next few strokes of the shovel will bring him wealth or make it evident that he has thrown his toil away  there however came an evening when ingleby desisted early in order to redeem his promise to coulthurst and when he had made what he felt was a very insufficient toilet sewell who had pegged out a claim in the vicinity arrived at the bakery hetty and leger were sitting as usual at that hour beside the fire and there was a little twinkle in the latters eyes as he glanced at sewell  i suppose he said major coulthurst knows whom he is to have the pleasure of entertaining  sewell laughed i felt it my duty to inform him but my name did not seem to convey very much to him in fact i dont mind admitting that one could have fancied he had never heard of it then having a certain sense of fitness i endeavoured to make him understand what my views were they didnt appear to affect him greatly either he was good enough to predict that i would probably grow out of them  he hasnt told you all ingleby broke in major coulthurst graciously admitted that most men are occasionally afflicted with fancies of the kind when they are young no sensible person minded it he had even indulged in them himself when his colonel had been unduly hard on him and he seemed quite under the impression that people generally took to our opinions by way of protest when they fancied themselves badly used  for a moment it almost seemed to ingleby that sewells face hardened and he remembered that his comrade had appeared faintly disconcerted when the major expressed this view in camp it had naturally not occurred to ingleby that major coulthursts deductions like those of other men with no great appearance of intelligence might come near the truth now and then hetty who was looking at sewell did not however appear to notice anything unusual  so you told him who you really were she asked  sewell for no very evident reason stooped and flicked a little dust off one of his boots and it was a few moments later when he looked up with a smile  i think you heard me mention it he said you are ready ingleby  ingleby stood up with a somewhat rueful glance not altogether unwarranted at his attire he did not know what hetty meant and felt no great interest in the question for he had a supreme faith in one man and one woman and if he had discovered that sewell had been charged with felony it would not have concerned him greatly he would have believed in him almost in spite of the evidences of his senses  coulthurst received them cordially when they reached his little logbuilt dwelling which stood not far from the police outpost beyond the cañon where a tremendous wall of hillside shut in the adjacent valley that region while unpleasantly remote from civilization was still accessible and the gold commissioners quarters were considering their situation far from uncomfortable there was even a very artistic set of chessmen at which coulthurst glanced during a pause in the conversation  i was once in a native indian state and those pieces are a little memento he said they played the game rather well there and ive had a liking for it ever since  now inglebys father had also played chess well and he knew a little of the game but he was accustomed to yield his comrade priority and was more than usually content to do so that evening sewell who seemed to understand this smiled  im afraid i should make a very indifferent opponent sir but that is your affair he said  coulthurst drew out a little table with some alacrity and grace and ingleby found a place apart from them the latter made no great attempt at conversation for he was wornout by a long days toil and quite content to be there and listen to his companion ingleby could talk when he felt prompted to but like other men with the capacity for strenuous effort he could be silent without embarrassing himself or those about him  in the meanwhile the surroundings had their effect on him the soft light of the big shaded lamp was pleasant after the glare of the crackling fire the hangings that hid door and windows conveyed to one who had lived as he had done a suggestion of comfort and luxury and his eyes did not miss the fashion in which each trifle brought up through long leagues of forest on the packsaddle had been arranged grace coulthurst had artistic tastes and she had also to some extent the means of indulging them  it was however her propinquity that most affected him her daintiness appealed to his senses and the faint perfume that hung about her and the touch of her gown when it brushed against him sent a little thrill through him miss coulthurst was possibly not unaware of this but she was none the less gracious to him ingleby was a wellfavoured man and physical effort and endurance with a wholesome singleness of purpose had set a stamp on him that almost amounted to distinction athletic toil and plain living with the moral discipline which binds the wornout flesh in obedience to the will have a refining influence on most men and there was in inglebys gaunt face steady eyes and clear bronzed skin the faint suggestion of spirituality which in that country at least not infrequently characterizes even the placer miner of low degree grace coulthurst who had quick perceptions recognized it but naturally kept her impressions to herself  mr sewell plays chess very well she said in fact he made what seemed to me a really brilliant opening  he is one of the men who do everything that is worth while well said ingleby that sounds a little comprehensive but i almost think its no more than the fact  grace asked no very pertinent question that ingleby could remember but she nevertheless induced him to speak of his comrade which being simple of mind in some respects he had evident pleasure in doing in the meanwhile she watched the man at the chesstable and it seemed to her that part at least of his friends belief in him was justified sewells face was expressive and mobile as well as forceful and there was a subtle suggestive gracefulness in his speech and gesture which was not to be found in inglebys then she smiled and changed the subject  i wonder she said why he sacrificed the castle  the knight said ingleby gravely was certainly not a very good exchange  grace laughed i scarcely think you would ever as they say in this country go back on a friend my father as he said is fond of the game but that doesnt go very far after all  he plays it creditably  and mr sewell as you are quite aware plays it exceptionally well i wonder if he realizes that the major is not fond of losing  ingleby smiled as he again glanced round the room then he turned to her the origin and complement of its refinement and she read his thoughts without difficulty  i scarcely think that anybody who knows how we live would blame him he said  grace laughed then she said as im not quite sure that i know suppose you tell me  ingleby did so in simple fashion and it is probable that most young women would not have found his story entertaining grace coulthurst who had lived in the bush however had comprehension and could fill in a good deal that he did not supply it was also in its own way to one who knew that country an epic a recital of mans high endeavour and herculean grapple with untrammelled nature for in the struggle for the subjugation of the wilderness the placer miner leads the van the smothering rush of slipping gravel the crash of shattered props as the little shaft closed up and the unexpected fall of halfcharred trees had a place in it as well as the monotony of toil and the girl listened gravely  and you have found the gold she said  a little said ingleby but not half enough we have failed to bottom quite on the old creek bed and are going to sink again or drive an adit  the mention of insufficiency was in itself significant for though he had spoken no word in canada that could afford the slightest hint of the aspirations that had animated him grace was quite aware of them there are not many women who do not know when a man is in love with them  but there are only two of you and it will take you ever so long she said  still we will get it done and there was a curious brightness in inglebys eyes  grace noticed the hollowness of his quiet face and the leanness of his hard scarred hands and her heart grew soft towards him the sign of the strain was plain upon him though the breaking point had not yet been reached and it was for her that he had done so much  and you expect the effort will be warranted she said  ingleby turned and looked at her gravely  men get rich placer mining now and then and it might happen to me he said in fact i almost think from what one or two of the old prospectors tell me that i am going to be successful i dont know if you will understand me but after a life like mine the probability of being so is a little overwhelming  there was a tension in his voice which had its effect upon the girl and she sat silent for a moment or two until the majors voice broke sharply in on them  check i fancied at one time the game was in your hands but theres seldom much use in anticipating when there are points you cant foresee he said  grace glanced at ingleby who smiled  im afraid major coulthurst is right one can only wait he said  just then there was a tapping at the door and ingleby moved abruptly when esmond came in the officer however showed no sign of astonishment when he saw who was there but smiled as he looked at grace and turned to the major  i have just come across for a few minutes and will not disturb you sir he said i dont suppose you have any objections to my looking over your register  no said coulthurst its yonder has anything gone wrong  esmonds eyes rested for just a moment on sewell only two or three of the men talking rather wildly sir somebody has been putting notions into their heads it occurred to me i might as well make sure they all had certificates  quite right said coulthurst appreciatively i have decided objections to their doing me out of my money  esmond took down the register which was not remarkably well kept and had some little trouble in tracing out the information he desired at last however he read thomas leger free miners certificate five dollars also five dollars walter ingleby  he made a careful note of the date and then turned over the pages systematically later on he found walter ingleby five dollars but there was no further entry for leger then he put the book back and the major glanced at him  check he said i almost think ive got you mr sewell you found what you wanted reggie  yes sir said esmond whose eyes now rested on grace and ingleby i fancy i have  he crossed the room in a leisurely fashion and ingleby rose when grace turned to him  you have no doubt come across mr ingleby in the course of your duties reggie but i should like to present him formally as one of my friends she said  esmond made ingleby who responded as briefly a little curt inclination  i have he said certainly met mr ingleby at least twice already  i believe i remember one occasion said grace with a little twinkle in her eyes she had naturally not heard of the second encounter im not sure you were in quite as good a temper as usual that night still you see circumstances are very different now  esmond laughed but there was a dryness in his tone which ingleby afterwards remembered  circumstances have a trick of changing somewhat rapidly in this country he said you have i believe bottomed on gold mr ingleby  yes said ingleby  you struck it rich  no said ingleby still the signs are promising we hope to be more fortunate when we have driven our adit  how long do you expect to be over it  it is a little difficult to tell  esmond appeared to reflect and grace who watched him did not quite understand his face  well he said i suppose placer mining is always a trifle uncertain one would almost fancy that baking was more profitable your friend miss leger seems to be doing well or is it your venture  ingleby wondered if this was meant for miss coulthursts enlightenment but he could not very well permit his dislike of the man who would seize such an opportunity to become apparent then and there was also something in esmonds tone which suggested that he might after all have a different purpose unfortunately he had no notion of what that purpose was  she is he said quietly selling a good deal of bread  at excellent prices still she probably deserves all she gains it would cost a good deal to bring flour up how did she get it  ingleby was a little astonished at the mans persistence and grace noticed it  are you going to turn baker too she asked  esmond laughed in a fashion which brought the blood to inglebys face still he answered the mans question  i went down for it he said  just then the majors voice broke in again a very good fight mr sewell i scarcely think i could have beaten you if you hadnt let me see your game however strong your position is that is very seldom wise  major coulthurst said esmond is now and then astonishingly accurate one could generalize from such a speech as that but to resume the topic wasnt it a little careless of you ingleby you invalidate your record when you leave a placer claim  ingleby secure as he fancied smiled leger he said holds a share with me  of course said esmond as though the subject had no longer any interest to him so you left leger well i must get back to the outpost now grace you will excuse me  he went out and while grace entertained ingleby the major and sewell who lost again played another game then she made and served them coffee with her own hands and ingleby at least went back to his tent filled with the memory of how she did it  in the meanwhile grace sitting by the fire when he had gone away glanced at her father  i wonder she said what you think of mr sewell  the man said coulthurst is in spite of the opinions he seems to hold evidently a gentleman i cant think of a more appropriate word for it there is also i fancy a good deal more in him than any one who was not good at reading character might suppose he plays chess exceptionally well in fact almost as well as i do  grace smiled a little i fancied he did she said were you equally pleased with his companion  yes said the major reflectively he strikes me as sensible and solidand one has a fancy that theres often a screw loose somewhere about brilliant men they are apt todouble up unexpectedlywhen the strain comes the other kind i always find are more likely to wear well  grace laughed but made no observation major coulthurst as she was quite aware was almost painfully solid himself but he had at least stood the rough usage of a hard world remarkably well and she was disposed to admit the correctness of his opinion still there was in spite of his name something about sewell that ingleby did not possess which appealed to her     xiv  the necessary incentive   while ingleby and sewell made their way back to their tent esmond sat thoughtfully in his comfortless room at the outpost cigar in hand he felt distinctly pleased with his astuteness but he was by no means sure what use he would make of the information ingleby had somewhat unwisely supplied him esmond was merely a capable police officer with certain defects in his character and not a clever scoundrel in fact he had his good points or he would not have retrieved his credit in a service which demands a good deal from those who would rise in it after becoming involved in difficulties in england but he was arrogant vindictive and apt to be carried away by his passions  he disliked ingleby and would in any circumstances have found it difficult to forgive the miner for having twice caused him to appear at a disadvantage while the fact that grace coulthurst had shown ingleby some degree of favour was an almost worse offence esmond had the prejudices that occasionally characterize men of his station and it seemed to him distinctly unfitting that the gold commissioners daughter should patronize as he expressed it a placer miner he was not exactly in love with her though he had once come near being so but he cherished a tenderness for her which might in favourable circumstances have ripened the circumstances were not however favourable for there was a certain stain on his reputation which he fancied major coulthurst at least remembered  it was therefore pleasant to feel that he held the whip over the presumptuous miner and could apply it when advisable though he had in the meanwhile no very definite purpose of doing so it was not his business to see that major coulthurst carried out the mining laws and in any case ingleby had found no gold that would render the sequestration of his claim a matter of very much moment besides which esmond reflected that it would be considerably more congenial to humiliate him openly in person instead of inflicting a malicious injury on him by the hand of another man an opportunity would no doubt be forthcoming and he could afford to wait with this commendable decision he flung his cigar away and went to bed  however he became a little less sure that reticence was advisable when he saw that ingleby and sewell visited the gold commissioner every now and then and it happened somewhat unfortunately that he dismounted to take up a stirrup leather when riding back to his outpost through the cañon one evening save for the hoarse roar of the river the tremendous hollow was very still and the sound of voices came faintly up to him turning sharply he made out two figures among the pines and an expletive rose to his lips as he recognized them one was a miner in miry long boots and soilstained jean the other a girl in a light dress  esmonds eyes grew a trifle vindictive as he watched them and though he had one foot in the stirrup he did not obey the impulse that prompted him to swing himself to the saddle and ride away instead he led the horse behind a widegirthed cedar and stood still with a trace of darker colour in his face it was unfortunate that he did not know grace had met ingleby by accident and that he could not hear their conversation when they stopped for a few minutes by the edge of the river  you have not been near us for awhile said the girl  i have been busy though i am not sure that is a very good excuse said ingleby besides one feels a little diffidentin the circumstancesabout presuming too much on major coulthursts kindness  grace laughed though she understood the qualification i am of course not going to press you but come when you wish the major if one might mention it rather approves of you and when he and mr sewell play chess there is nobody to talk to me  ingleby who had sense enough to take this admission for what it was worth looked thoughtful  sewell he asked has been there without me  once or twice  then he certainly never mentioned it to me  does he give you an account of everything he does and grace laughed how is your work at the mine progressing  slowly in fact considering our appliances we have had almost overwhelming difficulties to contend with still one could scarcely expect you to be interested in them  i am however and there was a faint but subtle suggestion of sympathy in the girls voice that sent a thrill through him  it cost him an effort to hold himself in hand but ingleby had been taught restraint in canada one sign of which was that he seldom inflicted his opinions on other people he had decided that it would be time to let his aspirations become apparent when he had found the gold and made himself a position it never occurred to him that the girl was probably quite aware of them already it was not an easy thing to hide them and though he was growing accustomed to the discipline the topic she had suggested was a safe one  well he said the gold we expect to strike lies in what was presumably an ancient river bed though there is strange to say very little of it in the green river now it was probably deposited there thousands of years ago and it is evident that we have struck only the outer edge of the patch of sand and gravel containing it we tried tunnelling but twice the soil came in and nearly buried leger and at tomlinsons advice we sank another shaft all the work had to be done again and we often go on half the night now it is i think only a question if we can hold out long enough for winter is coming still itmustbe done  he had not purposed to indulge in more than a very matteroffact narration and had in one respect certainly not exceeded this but there was a curious ring in his voice and grace understood his thoughts as she flashed a swift glance at him his face which was a trifle haggard had grown intent and the little glint in his eyes had its meaning grace coulthurst recognized as hetty leger had done some time earlier that ingleby was toiling harder than was wise she also knew as well as if he had told her what purpose animated him still she had no intention of admitting it just then  i think she said you should be careful not to do too much and if you are going back to work tonight you must come no farther  ingleby protested but grace was resolute and turning left him standing in the trail she walked homewards thoughtfully with a faint trace of colour in her face for the mans unexpressed devotion had stirred her then in a somewhat unfortunate moment she looked up and saw esmond waiting beside the trail for her a glance at his face sufficed to show her that he was quite aware she had not come there alone and roused in her a curious sense of antagonism it had become evident to her already that he bore no particular good will toward ingleby  the view is really worth even your attention she said  esmond knew what the suggestion of hardness in her tone meant and smiled as he glanced down the frothsmeared river towards the tremendous rift in the rocks through which it thundered beyond it the mists were streaming across the deep valley and crawling filmily athwart the pines that climbed in serried battalions towards the gleaming snow  it is in fact i scarcely think i could improve on it but it was not the view that kept me here he said  no and graces voice was a trifle harder still  esmond looked at her steadily i had he said the pleasure of seeing you coming down the cañona little while ago  his meaning was very plain but he had given her an opportunity for grace had noticed that the cedar he stood near was great of girth and the undergrowth was trampled at one side of it the man winced as she moved forward a little and glanced at it  i suppose she asked with quiet contempt that was why you thought it necessary to lead your horse out of the trail  esmond who had not expected affairs to take this turn fumed inwardly he was not quite sure why he had stayed there at all but in his indignation he had become possessed by a vague and very senseless notion that a friendly remonstrance might be admissible and at least afford him an opportunity for expressing his opinion of ingleby he was of course by no means a clever man and angry at the time or he would never have made that mistake but his purpose was not altogether a base or selfish one grace coulthurst who was of his own station must he felt be guarded against herself and since there was apparently nobody else available he undertook the task he became vindictive however when he realized that it would be difficult to carry out his commendable purpose  i think we need not go into that he said perhaps i did wrong but it would only lead us away from the topic i want to talk about has it occurred to you that unless you put a stop to his presumption that miner fellow might get ideas into his head  grace appreciated his courage in persisting especially in view of the result of her previous thrust but while she was not exactly sure of her sentiments towards ingleby he was at least the man who loved her which counted a good deal in his favour esmond she was quite aware chiefly loved himself  isnt that a trifle vague what ideas do you mean she asked  esmond stood silent a moment or two for his task was becoming unpleasantly difficult but his bitterness against ingleby rashly determined him to go on  i should prefer not to be more definiteand im not sure that it is necessary he said still one might perhaps venture to warn you that the miners and my troopers who of course have eyes have already found an entertaining topic  grace coulthursts face grew a trifle colourless with anger though she did not quite believe him  so you can listen while your policemen discussme she said  no said esmond unguardedly i would have risked my commission by thrashing the man i heard mention you  a sardonic gleam crept into graces eyes then since you havent done it it is a little difficult to understand how you could be aware of what they are saying  the mans embarrassment was evident but it lasted only a moment and he made a little abrupt gesture  im no match for you at this game grace he said of course im taking a great liberty but if you think a little you might find some excuse for me  for playing the spy on me  esmonds lips set tight and the bronze in his cheeks took on a still deeper tinge but there was as is usually the case good as well as evil in him and he was to some extent endeavouring just then to discharge what he considered a duty  i suppose i deserve it and i am in your hands but you can be angry with me afterwards if you will let me speak we are old friends and i feel that implies a certain responsibility there is nobody else in this country except the major who would concern himself about you and he with all due respect to him seldom sees beyond his nose  there was a suggestion of genuine solicitude in his voice now but grace was unfortunately far from being conciliated  and you possess the faculty of seeing very much farther  esmond made a little deprecatory gesture in this case at least you see i know the presumption of those halftrained fellows of inglebys description and i would like to save you the unpleasantness i think you are courting there are times when one has to be candid the fellow is quite capable of fancying you are in love with him  he stopped for there was a red spot of anger in grace coulthursts cheek which was otherwise curiously colourless  i think she said incisively you had better change the topic you have gone quite far enough  esmond gazed at her with evident appreciation she had never seemed so alluring to him as she did just then while she stood very straight in front of him quivering a little with illsuppressed anger in fact he felt very far from sure that he was not in love with her still he persisted  it would have been less preposterous had he been a man with any education or nicety of feeling but you have even to take his antecedents on trust and a good many of the men here have a somewhat astonishing history  grace stopped him with a little imperious gesture i have heard enough she said in fact a good deal more than i shall probably ever forgive you besides it was scarcely advisable of you to allude to other peoples antecedents one would have fancied that you had a better memory  esmond closed one of his hands for he had almost hoped that grace had not heard of the little discreditable affair in england the contempt in her face made the fact that he had deceived himself unpleasantly plain  i scarcely think that is quite what one would have expected from you he said a little charity is always advisableand you may find it indispensable  he swung himself into the saddle and grace went on alone well content that he had gone but nevertheless wondering whether she had ventured too far on inglebys behalf for she realized that the rejoinder which had closed the discussion was not altogether excusable she did not care to ask herself why esmonds insinuations should have stirred her to an indignation that was stronger than her sense of what was fitting  esmond rode back to the outpost furious and since he could not retaliate on the girl decided to seize the first opportunity for injuring the man and he had reasons for believing that one would shortly be offered him it is however probable that he would never have profited by it had not the girl stung him to vindictive passion it was though she was not aware of it by no means a kindness grace coulthurst had done ingleby     xv  ingleby strikes it rich   it was late at night but the red light of a fire flickered among the trunks where a creek swirled across the bottom of the valley and leger who had just flung fresh branches upon it leaned against the rude windlass at the head of the adjacent shaft the roar of the river seemed to have sunk to a lower tone that night and save for its dull reverberations there was deep silence among the pines across which the fleecy mists were drifting it seemed to emphasize the harshness of the persistent clink of the pick which broke sharply though the stillness of the night  leger was stiff in every joint and his limbs were aching from a long days labour he was also wet with the dew and now and then shivered a little for the night air was chilled by the snow but he scarcely noticed this as he listened to the sound of his comrades toil below he had not inglebys incentive but it is probable that very few men would have concerned themselves much about weariness or discomfort just then the shaft they had painfully driven had at last reached or was very close upon the ancient river bed and now any stroke of the pick might make the result of their labour plain to them it might be disastrous failure or a competence for the rest of their days and the oldest prospector could have done no more than guess at the probabilities placer mining is a gamble in which in the northwest at least man stakes the utmost toil of his body and often his life on the chance of finding a very uncertain quantity of the precious metal  at last the tension grew almost unendurable and leger wornout as he was felt his courage fail him his body craved sleep and he dreaded the answer to the question which had occupied him ceaselessly for the last few days he felt that should it be unfavourable he could hardly face it then and even the harrowing uncertainty was better than a negative  come up walter im getting cold he said  there was a harsh laugh below and a voice that sounded strained and hollow rose from the shaft  then sit by the fire it said  come up said leger sharply if you must have the truth ive borne about as much as you could expect of me today well probably know the result soon enough  i cant wait said ingleby  leger said nothing further he could not leave his comrade there and he sat down by the windlass with his fingers trembling a little on the pipe he did not light the faint sighing in the fir tops had died away and only the noise of mans petty activity ran on discordant and it almost seemed presumptuous a halfmoon hung above the shoulder of a towering peak wrapped in a mantle of everlasting white the river twinkled in the gloom below but it counted for nothing with leger that earth and sky were steeped in a profound serenity he was sensible only of the jar of the pick below  in the meanwhile ingleby stripped to the waist toiled feverishly by the light of a few blazing resinknots in the narrow pit his hands were bleeding and the dew of effort dripped from him while he swung with the clinking pick like an automaton he was grimed with mire his long boots were sodden and the drip from the shaft side splashed upon his naked shoulders while his face was grim and grey with the weariness he did not feel at last there was a sharp ringing as the pick went down and while his raw hands tingled he flung the implement aside  bed rock or a boulder he said hoarsely send the bucket down  it was a bald announcement but that was not a time for speech and leger fully realized the significance of it the crazy windlass rattled and the rude receptacle of deerhide stretched on a willowhoop came down ingleby filled it with the shovel and then pressed down a further load of sand and soil and pebbles with quivering hands  heave he said sharply  the bucket went up and it was with a little grim smile ingleby struggled into his rent shirt though the operation cost him at least a minute there was he knew a necessity for keeping his head now and holding himself in hand by an effort he crawled slowly up the notched firpole lowered into the little shaft then he and leger saying nothing proceeded to the creek with the heavy bucket and a big indurated basin ingleby went in kneedeep with the firelight flickering on him and with a twirl of his hands washed out half the lighter contents of the basin then he glanced at leger  shall we try it now he said  no said leger a trifle hoarsely put in the rest  ingleby emptied into a little heap what was left in the basin after which he filled it again and repeated the process several times while leger stood still upon the bank watching him neither said anything though there was a strained expectancy in their faces that showed the importance of the result at last there was nothing left in the bucket and legers hands shook as he scooped up the little heap upon the bank and flung it into the basin  get it done he said  ingleby stepped back into the stream and was busy some little time tilting and twirling the basin and now and then stirring its contents with his hand then he very carefully let the water run away and waded with a curious slowness to the bank he stood there for a tense moment while he and leger looked at each other until the latter turning stirred the crackling fire  pour it out he said hoarsely i cant stand much more of this  ingleby shook out the contents of the basin on a little strip of hide and for a moment or two could scarcely discern anything for his heart throbbed painfully and his sight was a trifle dim then he made out that there were little yellow grains scattered about the hide and when he stirred the fragments of stone and pebbles with his fingers larger particles of the same hue became visible he straightened himself slowly with a little gasp and the blood surged to his face  i almost thinkweve struck it rich he said  leger said nothing whatever for there are times when it is difficult to express ones feelings articulately and he stood quite still in the firelight blinking at ingleby then he sat down and scraping the precious grains into a little bag poised it in his hand  there will be no need for any more bakingat this rate well go home and tell hetty he said  shes asleep said ingleby whose voice shook a little  perhaps she is said leger with a curious smile i fancy i shall rest tonight  they climbed the hillside together ingleby carrying the little bag but he scarcely saw the glow of the fire that still burned outside the shanty or the clustering pines his heart no longer throbbed as it had done and while a curious lassitude came upon him alluring visions floated before him then as they stopped in front of the shanty a shadowy figure slipped out of it and for the firelight fell upon them hetty felt her fingers quiver as she glanced at inglebys face  oh she said with a little gasp you have found the gold  ingleby gravely held out the bag that is the first of itand its yours he said if it hadnt been for you we should never have held the mine one third of it all belongs to you  hetty took the gold with a little smile  i am very glad you found itand remembered me she said  then she turned away somewhat abruptly and went back into the shanty  hetty scarcely seems as delighted as one would have expected said ingleby  leger whose face had grown a trifle grave laughed in a fashion which suggested that it cost him an effort one so seldom gets a windfall of this kind that its a trifle difficult to know how to express ones satisfaction the only thing that occurs to me is to smash all the cooking utensils but considering the distance from the settlement that would scarcely be convenient  ingleby who flung himself down beside the fire made no answer but vacantly drank the coffee and ate the food that hetty brought him he was in fact almost oblivious of his surroundings for again his fancy was busy with alluring visions and now that the tension was over his perceptions were dulled by the weariness of his wornout body at last however he became sensible that leger was no longer there and that hetty was sitting alone on the opposite side of the sinking fire  wheres tom he asked  i think hes asleep said hetty its no wonder arent you very tired walter  ingleby laughed drowsily and stretched his aching limbs i really believe i am though i scarcely felt it until this moment what are you sitting up for hetty  i dont quite know still one doesnt come into a fortune every day i suppose it is a fortune walter  inglebys face grew a trifle grave it at least looks like it but nobody could tell just now a placer mine often works out unexpectedly  still if it doesnt what are you going to do  why dont you saywe  hetty smiled curiously and shook her head you will not want tom and me now  if you fancy i would ever be willing to lose sight of either of you you are doing me a wrong havent i been living on your bountyon what you made by baking with your own little hands would we have found the gold if it hadnt been for you  hetty flushed a little but she persisted  im not sure the new friends you will make would approve of us she said  then said ingleby decisively they will not be friends of mine you dont seem to understand that you have a third share in the mine and tom holds another the result of that will be that you will be able to live as you like and dress as prettily as anybody still dont you think that old print gowni suppose it is printyou put on to bake in is worth all a courtladys finery  hetty once more shook her head i should still be hetty legerwho waited at a boardinghouse and sold bread to the miners she said if i pretended to be any one else people would only find me out and laugh as well as look down on me nothing that i could put on or any one could teach me would make me quite the same asmiss coulthurstyou see  ingleby who had not expected this was not exactly pleased he was very grateful to hetty and thought which was how he expressed it a good deal of her but since she had raised the point there was certainly a difference between her and grace coulthurst it did not occur to him that the difference might after all be in hettys favour and that there were qualities she possessed which are worth more than many accomplishments and a reposeful manner in the meanwhile hetty appeared to expect an answer and he felt that she had placed him in a difficulty  what you have suggested applies as much to me he said  hetty laughed i was wondering what you would sayand i suppose it does still nobody seems to mind the little difference so much in a man when he has plenty of money you are going to marry miss coulthurst if you get rich walter  yes said ingleby gravely if she will have me which i am afraid is far from certain but i must make myself more than a placer miner first that is why if tom is willing i shall probably start a contractors business and build roads and bridges they are always wanted in this province and i fancy making them wouldnt be so very difficult tom would stay in the officehe has the brains you seeand i like the outside life in the bush it is a useful profession that everybody looks up to here and we could of course bring out a young english engineer  he had sunk back a little upon the pile of branches where he lay and hetty noticed that his eyes were heavy but he roused himself with an effort  we will go back to vancouver when the mine works out you shall choose the houseone of the pretty ones outside the town with the wooden pillars and painted scrollwork we will get a china boy to cook for youand you shall have a pair of ponies to drive in stanley park tom will keep the books and get the orders while i do the work roads and bridges flumes and dams are always wantedand i must be more than a placer miner  then his head sank forward and hetty who sat still for a minute rose with a little wistful smile and looked down at him he lay with eyes quite closed now and one arm stretched out for the needs of the wornout body had at last proved stronger than his will his jacket had fallen open to the waist and hetty noticed how thin he was and the hollowness of his quiet face then she slipped softly into the tent where leger lay asleep and coming out with a coarse brown blanket spread it over ingleby though as she did it the flickering light showed a rich damask in her cheek then laying fresh wood on the fire she stole away and left him to sleep the great branches that met above him kept off the dew and one could sleep as well there as in the tent  the sun had cleared the redwoods when he opened his eyes again and saw leger smiling down at him  its a very long while since i got up so late and i dont quite know how i came to be lying here he said i suppose i fell asleep beside the fire but in that case its a little difficult to understand how i could have got the blanket and tucked myself in  then he stood up and stretched himself while leger glanced at him curiously  i dont think it matters very much you looked halfdazed when i left you and scarcely likely to remember what you did he said breakfast is almost ready and we have a good deal on hand today  within the next halfhour they were at work again and by afternoon had satisfied themselves of the richness of the claim they also in accordance with established custom put up a little flag to show all whom it might concern that they had bottomed on gold as it happened nobody but a police trooper who asked them a few questions saw it for the pines were thick and most of the placer workings situated farther up the valley the trooper mentioned the matter to esmond and the latter forthwith called upon major coulthurst his opportunity had come  i wonder if you know that your friend ingleby has struck gold he said  i didnt said coulthurst who did not appear to notice his sardonic tone im pleased to hear it  esmonds smile might have meant anything it would he said have been wiser if ingleby had stayed on his claim you remember that he left it for a considerable time  i do said coulthurst who glanced at him inquiringly with a trace of dryness in different circumstances it might have cost him his title  esmond sat silent for a moment or two  so far as i understand the enactments one only holds a placer claim on the condition that the work goes on continuously he said  in the case you are referring to i believe it did ingleby left his partner in possession  esmond smiled it is one understands essential that everybody holding a mineral claim of any kind should have a free miners certificate  of course ingleby and leger each took one out i remember it very well  all certificates said esmond expire on the thirtyfirst of may  ingleby renewed his said coulthurst and stopped abruptly  ingleby as you remember invalidated his title  coulthurst rose sharply and took down his register he flicked over several pages and closed it with a little bang then as he turned to esmond his face grew a trifle grim  im not quite sure how far my authority goes until i look it up he said i have rather a liking for ingleby  esmond smiled in a deprecatory fashion it is not exactly my business but one would fancy that you couldnt very well discriminate sir anything of the kind would have an undesirable effect upon the other men  that is my affair and coulthurst glanced at him sharply it is a little difficult to understand why you raised the question only when they had found the gold  i fancy that it is very natural sir it is no part of my duty to see the mining regulations are carried out and it was not until i heard they had struck the lead that i remembered the little fact i noticed in looking over your register it seemed advisable to let you know the men seem inclined to find fault with everything just now and if it came out that inglebys claim had not been sequestrated when it should have been they might get it into their heads that you had winked at the irregularity because you were on good terms with him that would naturally increase my difficulties with them  coulthurst stood looking at him with a hardening face i am he said very sorry that this has happened but it will be gone into may i trouble you to send one of your troopers over for ingleby and leger     xvi  an invalid record   supper had just been finished and ingleby was lying pipe in hand beside the creek waiting until leger should bring another load of washdirt from the mine the sunlight was still pleasantly warm the air filled with the balsamic odours of the pines and there was a little smile of unalloyed content in inglebys face as he drank them in though he had toiled since morning those few minutes would be the only rest he would enjoy until long after darkness closed in and once more he indulged in visions of a roseate future as he made the most of them  they had washed up each bucketload as they brought it to the surface and the result had made the richness of the mine increasingly plain ingleby was getting accustomed to the fact that he was now in all probability at least comparatively rich and already his brain was occupied with halfformed projects they did not include a further course of prospecting for he had discovered that placer mines are addicted to playing out with disconcerting rapidity and that in case of the deep lodes it is not as a rule the man who records the claim but the capitalist or companyjobber who takes the profit  he would go back to civilization and embark on an industrial career for there was he fancied not altogether incorrectly wealth awaiting the resolute and enterprising man with sufficient money who was willing to play his part in laying the foundations of the future prosperity of that rich land and he had a young mans faith in his abilities which was in his case more or less warranted then when he had won a footing he would boldly ask major coulthurst for his daughters hand social distinctions count for little in western canada and though the waiting would be hard there was consolation in the thought that every bold venture would bring him so much nearer her ingleby was proud and content to possess his soul in patience until he had shown that he could hold his own with his fellows and hew his own way to fortune  it was at least a wholesome resolution and there was behind it a vague participation in the belief held by primitive peoples and proclaimed in courts in the days of chivalry that man before he mated should be required to make his manhood plain by deeds accomplished and pain endured it was not fitting he felt that the woman should give everything or stoop too far he must have something to offer as well as the ability to lift himself to her level and through all there ran the desire of the democratic englishman for an opportunity to prove himself at least the equal of those accounted his betters  before leger reached him with the bucket there was a rustling in the tall fern behind him and tomlinson came out upon the bank of the creek he glanced at the little flag above the mine and the pile of debris at the waters edge and then took up the pan ingleby had laid down and dipped it in the stream a whirl of it in his practised hand was enough for him  yes he said quietly i guess youve struck it rich  ingleby laughed and handed him a little bag  i almost think we have feel that he said  tomlinson poised the bag in one hand and then sat down with a little gesture of assent for he was not by any means a demonstrative man  well he said it will make it easier for hetty and im glad of it slaving away at that bakery isnt the kind of thing for her its going to the opera at vancouver with the best of them she ought to be doing i guess that would suit most young women quite as well as baking bread but its a little rough on me that hetty leger would sooner stay right where she is  what do you mean asked ingleby  tom knows said tomlinson ruefully i havent put it quite straight to hetty just now anyway it wouldnt be any good shes quite happy holding on to that blame bakery though what she wants to do it for is more than i can figure it cant be the money because ive a claim back yonder thats turning out a pile of it every day and she could have all shed any use for  ingleby found himself in a position of some perplexity he could not well admit that there was any reason why an honest man of excellent character such as tomlinson appeared to be should not marry hetty and yet the mere probability of this was distasteful to him it was in fact unpleasant to contemplate the possibility of hettys marrying anybody he remembered that she had by no means displayed the satisfaction one would have expected when they found the gold and from this it appeared that tomlinsons suggestion that she was quite content to continue the bakery was warranted it was however difficult to discover any reason for this and he was still considering the question when leger came up tomlinson turned to him  you kept the thing kind of quiet told nobody yet he said  only one of the policemen we were too busy to spend a good deal of the day coming over to let the boys know though ingleby was thinking of going across tonight you have a good claim already and you cant hold more than one you know  tomlinson nodded thats quite right he said its kind of unfortunate sewell isnt here you dont know where he is  no said ingleby he has been away for two days looking for a deer i suppose anybody pegging off a claim next to ours would strike gold  its quite likely hed get the colour sure but when the creek that washed the metal out was running it dropped the heavy stuff only here and there anyway the chances would be good enough i figure what policeman was it you told  probyn  tomlinsons face hardened suddenly oh yes he said hes quite often hanging around here  it occurred to ingleby now that the trooper in question had certainly found occasion to visit their mine or the bakery somewhat frequently but just then the lad in question appeared and came up to them he disregarded tomlinson who showed no sign of recognizing him and looked at ingleby  major coulthurst would be glad if you and leger could find it convenient to see him now he said  what does he want asked leger sharply  i dont know said the trooper im telling you what he said  there was a curious silence for a moment or two and ingleby felt a little thrill of apprehension run through him then tomlinson rose with sudden abruptness  i guess youve got to go im coming along he said  the recorder did not mention you if hed been anxious for your company he probably would have done so said the trooper drily  tomlinson looked at him with a little glint in his eyes and then laid his hand on inglebys shoulder  ive played this game quite a long while and i guess i know the pointers most as well as anybody he said  ingleby said nothing but his face became suddenly intent and though the pace they made was fast he grew feverishly impatient as they swung along the trail to the gold commissioners office coulthurst was awaiting them when they reached it and glanced at tomlinson inquiringly  you have some business with me he said  tomlinson sat down uninvited with a smile well he said the fact is i dont quite know yet when youve trouble with the crown folks in the cities you can take a lawyer along at this game im most as good as one  coulthurst made his indifference apparent by a gesture i dont suppose it matters will you sit down mr leger theres a seat yonder ingleby  ingleby sat down and with a sinking heart watched him open a book there was a difference in coulthursts manner he was precise and formal and did not appear quite comfortable one could almost have fancied that what he was about to do was distasteful to him  you left your claim on or about the twentieth of june ingleby he said you did not return until  hold on said tomlinson youve got to prove that i guess theres no reason why you should admit anything walter  just then there were footsteps outside and ingleby looked up sharply as esmond came in he appeared a trifle disconcerted when he saw what was going on and turned towards the door again  i didnt know you were busy sir he said  sit down and the majors tone was very dry i should prefer you to hear this affair with me you remember on what day mr ingleby left his claim  tomlinson nodded thats the straight thing major he said keep him right there i guess the insects at the bottom of everything  we can dispense with your advice said coulthurst chillingly though there was a suggestion of a twinkle in his eyes  in the meanwhile ingleby looked at esmond and his face was a trifle pale though a faint tinge of darker hue showed in the young officers cheek he was apparently not altogether free from embarrassment it was ingleby who spoke  i have no doubt captain esmond remembers exactly when i left the claim sir and there is nothing to be gained by disputing over a day or two he said i was away a good deal longer than the seventytwo hours the law permits  which invalidates your title said the major you failed to notify me or claim the privilege which under certain conditions i might have accorded you  ingleby who had been anxious hitherto but by no means dismayed gasped  if i understand the regulations it would be quite sufficient to leave another miner to carry on the work on my account besides under the mineralclaim enactments which i think apply the title would in any case revert to my partner  esmond who appeared to have recovered his tranquillity smiled a little and there was a curious silence in the room as coulthurst took down a book ingleby could feel his heart throbbing as he listened to the sharp rustle of the leaves while the major looked for the clause he wanted  you hold a free miners certificate leger he asked  yes sir said leger and then started visibly while ingleby who saw his face closed one hand a trifle as he leaned forward in his chair  you can produce it said the major  leger dejectedly passed the paper across to him but ingleby who found the suspense becoming unendurable turned to him  tom he said hoarsely you didnt neglect to renew it  leger did not seem to remember that anybody else was there he smiled wryly and made a little gesture  im afraid i did he said i hadnt the money when the time came round i didnt want you to know thatand i couldnt ask hetty we scarcely expected to find anything you see afterwards i suppose it slipped my memory  ingleby said nothing though his face was very grim and the little thud of coulthursts hand upon the book broke sharply through the silence  should a free miner neglect to renew his certificate upon expiry all mineralclaims held by him under it revert to the crown he said  then he stood up straight and burly though his face was a trifle flushed  im sorry ingleby but im afraid you have thrown away your claim  ingleby sat very still for part of a minute with one hand closed tightly then he also rose  i cant blame you sir he said hoarsely i dont think there is anything to be gained by protesting  well said tomlinson youre way more patient than i would be why did they let you go on working until you had found the gold  ingleby turned and looked at the police officer with a very unpleasant glint in his eyes that he said is a little kindness for which i fancy i am indebted to captain esmond  he would have gone out but tomlinson laid a hand upon his arm and turned to the recorder  now he said im going to do some talking that claims inglebys major until youve declared it open and wiped out his record  well said coulthurst drily i am sorry to find myself compelled to do it the claim lately held by walter ingleby and thomas leger having reverted to the crown is open for relocation a notice will be issued to that effect i may however point outto youthat no free miner can hold more than one claim in the same vicinity  thats all right said tomlinson the one ive got is quite enough for me you have a certificate ingleby take out a new one leger  leger drew the little bag from his pocket but tomlinson waved it aside and threw another down before coulthurst glancing at esmond as he did so  that gold came out of the reverted mine and they might claim it wasnt yours well make sure he said theres a man worth keeping your eye on who has a hand in this deal more than the necessary amount there sir let him have his certificate ill look in for the rest any time that suits you  coulthursts eyes twinkled a little as comprehension dawned on him and he passed leger the paper  i fancy any advice that prospector tomlinson desires to give you would be worth considering he said  tomlinson wasted no further time but drove ingleby and leger before him out of the room  its rustle now he said theres nothing to stop either of you pegging a new claim down on the lead alongside the old one its even chances you strike it quite as rich there get your stakes in  where are you going asked leger  tomlinson laughed to put the boys on the lead still its quite likely that a friend of mine will relocate your old claim a little ahead of them hell be there most as soon as the major puts up his notice that its open he may think it worth while to let me in somehow for telling him  he set off at a run and as he disappeared ingleby and leger leaving the winding trail went straight through the undergrowth towards the cañon vigorous movement with a definite purpose was a relief to them and they were gasping and dripping with perspiration when at last they stopped beside the sequestrated claim nobody else had reached it and the bush was very still but it was in feverish haste they hewed and drove in certain squarefaced stakes they were still on the lead and once more a little hope sprang up in them  in the meanwhile coulthurst sat at his table looking hard at esmond  i hope he said grimly that you are now satisfied  esmond met his gaze without embarrassment im not sure i quite catch your meaning sir  in that case said coulthurst it is a trifle difficult to understand how you came to hold a commission in a service in which one understands intelligence is necessary i have carried out the law but i dont mind admitting that i do not appreciate being made use of in this fashion it is very evident you do not like ingleby  esmond who made no disclaimer appeared to reflect for a moment or two  well he said you have perhaps some ground for feeling aggrieved sir but i cant help thinking that i have done nothing that was unnecessary  i am not blaming you fordoing your duty  i scarcely think you would be warranted in considering me very much at fault for going a little beyond it i admit that it would please me to see ingleby driven out of the valley the fellows presumption is almost insufferable  coulthurst glanced at him sharply and his face grew a trifle red ingleby is very young in comparison with myself but you were once good enough to allude to him as a friend of mine and you certainly met him at my house as my guest if there was any particular meaning in your speech it would be better to come straight to the point i dont like hints  i can only offer you my excuses for momentary bad memory sir absurd as it may seem to you im far from sure that ingleby is likely to be content with the status mentioned a very little reflection should make the warning clear in the meanwhile i have a couple of troopers waiting for me  he went out and coulthurst sat still at his table gazing vacantly in front of him with his lips unusually firmly set then he rose with a little shake of his shoulders and a gesture of relief  the thing is quite out of the question grace has too much sense he said     xvii  trooper probyns misadventure   nobody blamed coulthurst for dispossessing ingleby of his claim in fact the bluff and usually goodhumoured major was more or less a favourite with the miners who admitted that while it was rough on ingleby no other course was open to him for all that the affair made an unfortunate impression when news leaked out of the part esmond had played in it for the latters arrogance had gone a long way to gain him the hearty dislike of every man in the valley  the canadian is as a rule a sturdy imperialist with democratic tendencies a type of citizen which would elsewhere probably be thought an anachronism there were however as sewell had pointed out a good many men in the north just then who had no country and a vague unrest and discontent that once or twice came near producing unpleasant results spread sporadically across the wilderness that season nobody was pleased with the mining regulations and there were quiet canadian bushmen who thought the drafting of detachments of the northwest police into that country not only unnecessary but a reflection upon them there were also other men who had carried the memory of their wrongs with them from lands ruled by the mailed fist to whom this symbol of imperial authority was as a red rag to a bull and here and there a heavy responsibility was laid on the agents of the crown  major coulthurst however felt very little he was not a keensighted man and there were no signs of discontent in the green river country so far at least as he could discern it was true that sewell who played chess with him somewhat frequently now and then made disturbing recommendations which the major occasionally went so far as to consider but the country was apparently quiet and might have remained so in spite of esmonds insolent tactlessness had it not been for a little mistake made by trooper probyn  he was a reckless stripling with a certain grace of manner which he could scarcely have acquired in the ranks of the northwest police though men whose family name is well known in the older country occasionally join that service for reasons which they do not as a rule explain he was comely and he not infrequently loitered at the bakery even when he was supposed to be elsewhere at his duty it happened that he stood there one saturday afternoon watching hetty leger with undisguised appreciation when there was nobody else about he had perhaps chosen that particular time because leger who had shown that he did not approve of him was at the mine but there were smears of flour upon his uniform which suggested what his occupation had been  hetty who rather liked the lad looked distinctly pretty just then as with sleeves rolled to the elbow she moulded a loaf for the oven the bush was very still and it was pleasantly cool in the shadow of the pines which rolled in sombre ranks down the face of the hill it was perhaps unfortunate that hetty smiled as she held out the bread  you can put this loaf in and seal up the oven if youre very good she said  probyn seized the loaf somewhat clumsily so that in steadying it hettys fingers left an impression on the plastic dough  now said probyn gravely that ought to make it worth another ten dollars to anybody  would you think it worth all that  a hundred said probyn would not be too much id buy the thing now only unfortunately i havent a coin of any kind by me there are you see a good many disadvantages attached to being a police trooper  are there said hetty then why did you become one and what would you have liked to be  that answered the lad with a trace of dryness is neither here nor there then his eyes twinkled again a baker couldnt you give me that loaf on creditto keep forever  i certainly couldnt besides you would eat it the first time you were hungry hold it still while i make it smooth again  she did it with dainty little pats and the lad watched her openly appreciative with his head on one side for her pose and the movements of arm and shoulder effectively displayed a prettily moulded figure  theres a little bit you have left out hadnt you better go round it again he said  it was perhaps not altogether wise of hetty to laugh provokingly as she glanced at him but she was young and masculine approbation was no more distasteful to her than it is to most young women she also believedas she had indeed once pointed out to tom legerthat though trooper probyn had very little sense there was not a grain of harm in him  why its quite smooth enough she said  you do it so prettily of course thats only what one would expect from a girl with a hand like that the wrist runs into it so nicely too when some people try to work their wrists get red you know  put the bread into the ovennow said hetty severely  the lad who noticed a certain warning tone he had heard before did as he was bidden and luted up the door of the big claybuilt oven when he returned there was no longer any of hettys arm visible beneath her sleeve  its getting late and i have the boys supper to look after she said significantly  probyn knew by the lengthening of the shadows that this was true and he had still a long round to make but he was a trifle more inconsequent than usual that afternoon and in place of taking his departure leaned against a cedar  well he said i mean to stay a little its very pleasant here  the statement was perfectly warranted for the sound of the river came up soothingly across the pines and through openings between them one could see the tremendous ramparts of nevermelting snow that cut cold and white against the blue hetty too standing with fluffy hair a trifle disordered and with the sunlight streaming between the great branches upon her was very alluring but still it was unfortunate that trooper probyn did not go he was not aware that tomlinson who had had difficulties with the flume he was building was just then coming up the hillside in a somewhat uncertain temper  you have been here quite an hour said hetty  a year said probyn wouldnt be half enough for me now ive a piece of news i hadnt the heart to tell youand youll try to be brave esmond is sending two or three of us south very shortly and im very much afraid i will be one of them  is that all and hetty laughed  the lad looked at her reproachfully you seem to bear up astonishingly well it will be different with me you may even have married one of those miner fellows by the time i come back again  there was no apparent reason why the suggestion should drive the smile out of hettys eyes but it certainly did though probyn did not notice her sudden change of mood  yes he said im afraid ill have to go and thats why i want you to give me something to remember you by when im far away it neednt be very much that pretty little ribbon at your neck would do  the request was not out of keeping with the troopers usual conversation which consisted largely of badinage and hetty could not be expected to realize that he now and then meant what he said it however happened that ingleby who said it suited her complexion had once laughingly bought her that ribbon in a vancouver drygoods store  you certainly cant have it she said a trifle sharply  probyn who perversely fancied her decisiveness was assumed and intended to be provocative lost his head  then you dont mean to give me a trifle of that kind after chopping wood for you two days every week and kneading an ovenful of bread he said  no said hetty who was by no means anxious to detain him now it wasnt anything like that often and i told you i was busy why dont you go  then im afraid ill have to take it said probyn with a reckless laugh  in another moment his hand was on hettys shoulder and it was unfortunate he did not see the indignation in her face as she strove to thrust him away there was no doubt about the genuineness of it now for her cheeks were flushed with anger but the troopers persistence was not lessened by the fact that a pin entered one of his fingers as he clutched at the little bow the momentary pain indeed drove what little sense he had out of his head and he became the more determined upon obtaining possession of the coveted ribbon  just then a big longlimbed man with a grim bronzed face came out of the shadow of the pines and stopped for a moment with a smothered expletive it was not altogether unnatural that he should misunderstand the situation and he sprang forward suddenly when he recovered from his astonishment probyn had by this time succeeded in tearing away the bow and there was a rustle of draperies as hetty who shook off his relaxing grasp inconsequently fled but in another moment a hard hand fell upon his shoulder and swung him round in fact so rude was the wrench that he reeled backwards for a pace or two and on recovering his balance found himself face to face with a big and very angry man who regarded him out of halfclosed eyes in a distinctly unpleasant fashion  its you tomlinson what the devil did you mean by that he said  well said the miner drily i guess it ought to be quite plain to you  probyn who looked around saw that hetty had vanished into the shanty  now look here there really isnt the slightest reason why you should make an ass of yourself he said i am of course not telling you this because i am afraid of anything you can do  tomlinsons face grew a little darker in hue as he glanced at the strip of crumpled ribbon still in the lads hand  i want that thing pass it across he said  probyn smiled for his recklessness was perhaps partly accounted for by the fact that there was what is usually termed good blood in him  ill have considerable pleasure in seeing you hanged first he said  well said tomlinson well fix all that now light out of this you dont want the circus right in front of the shanty  the lad made a little gesture of comprehension as he swung round and tomlinson gravely walked after him until they could no longer be seen from the shanty then probyn turned to him again  were far enough i think he said  he stood strung up but apparently impassive with his left arm across him and his right hand clenched at his side and only a suggestion of watchfulness in his steady eyes tomlinson smiled grimly  if i were to hit you hard id kill you sure im raised today he said i guess a souse in the creek will have to do instead  probyn saw that the issue must be faced and he was by no means deficient in courage or he would not have ridden long with the northwest police stepping forward with a thrust from his right foot he feinted with his left hand at the miners face and then swinging downwards with lowered head got in a righthand body blow that would probably have staggered another man tomlinson however took it with no more than a gasp and flinging out his right hand closed with him which was singularly unfortunate for trooper probyn he had been accounted tolerably proficient with the gloves in another land but it is not for pastime that men fight in the wilderness and there the disablement of ones opponent by any means available is the object of the game  probyn had the pride which breeds courage and endurance as well as vigour but he had not swung the axe and shovel for twenty years as tomlinson had done in the strenuous unceasing grapple with unsubdued nature which hardens every muscle and sinew in the men of the northwest they have the pride of manhood in place of the pride of birth and a grim optimism which chiefly finds expression in attempting that which is apparently beyond accomplishment and in holding on in spite of frost and snow and icy gale until achievement comes thus it came about that in a very few seconds trooper probyn recognized that he was no match for the miner though he had no intention of admitting it or of being put into the creek if he could by any means avoid it  for several strenuous minutes they reeled locked together about the trail and fell against the trees while neither of them concerned himself greatly about the strict rules of the game they smote when it was possible and clinched when they could but all the time they were drawing steadily nearer the creek  in the meanwhile leger and ingleby as well as one or two miners who purposed purchasing bread from hetty came out from among the pines and a corporal of police rode up on the opposite side of the creek the miners who did not notice him naturally stopped  its that young ass probyn said ingleby no doubt he deserves all he is apparently getting  he is in uniform anyway said leger well have to stop them let the lad go tomlinson  tomlinson did not hear him for just then he swung the trooper off his feet and staggering forward a pace or two fell with him into the creek they splashed into the water and apparently rolled over and over in the midst of it while confused shouts rose from the miners  pull him off no stand clear let them have a show  then the corporal of police trotting forward pulled his horse up at the edge of the creek  let up on that man prospector he said sharply  tomlinson seemed to hear him for he relaxed his hold and slowly stood up while trooper probyn rose in the middle of the creek with the water draining from him and blood on his cheek the miners gathered round but the corporal sat stiffly in his saddle with expressionless face  stand off you he said with a glance at them and then turned to probyn now what in the name of thunder is the meaning of this circus  its a little difference of opinion said the trooper prospector tomlinson felt id said something insulting to him  the corporal appeared to reflect considering where you were sent to i cant quite figure what you were doing here anyway but thats not the point he said ill trouble you to come along to the outpost tomlinson  one of the miners stepped forward hes staying where he is he said i guess the trooper made the trouble and only got what he wanted hadnt both of you better light out of this  there was a little grim murmur of approbation but the corporal who dropped his bridle looked at the men with steady eyes  im not asking your opinions boys he said  then probyn turned to him as a matter of fact theyre right in one respect he said the little row had nothing to do with any question of duty it was a private affair of mine if it appears necessary you can report it to captain esmond  once more the corporal who was a shrewd man appeared to reflect well he said i saw your grey tethered when i came along the trail youd better get him if youre wanted well come along for you tomlinson  tomlinson turned and looked at probyn i guess he said slowly and distinctly if ever you start the same circus again ill kill you  the corporal who did not appear to hear him though everybody else did wheeled his horse and probyn walked by his stirrup when he rode away then ingleby turned to tomlinson  theres a good deal i want to know he said  well said the big miner drily theres very little you need worry about you see that young trooper isnt fond of me and there was a kind of unpleasantness when we ran up against each other  you were coming down the trail from the bakery when i saw you said leger  yes said tomlinson we were  then said leger since he ran up against you probyn must have been going there  tomlinson appeared to be considering the point well he said it looks quite like that  there was evidently no more to be got out of him and leger and ingleby went up the trail together towards the bakery tomlinson however stayed behind and slipped a little crumpled bow of ribbon into his pocket     xviii  ingleby goes away   it was a week after the sequestration of the claim and ingleby leaned against a cedar with the firelight on his face which was unusually resolute and a bundle of clothing and blankets at his feet hetty sat on one of the hearthlogs in the shadow watching him quietly and leger stood in the doorway of the shanty with something very like anger in his eyes he had for the last ten minutes enlarged upon every reason he could think of why ingleby should remain with them and the latter was still apparently as firmly decided as ever on going away  theres not a grain of sense in your point of view said leger its sentiment run to seed and sentiment of the most maudlin kind at that of course i know all this is uselessnothing would move youbut its some small relief to let you know what i think of you i suppose you will admit that what youre going to do isnt quite in keeping with the theories you once professed to believe in  hetty who had a spice of temper laughed walter never believed in themhe only thought he did hes like the rest of you you keep your ideas to talk about and worry people with  ingleby made a little deprecatory gesture ive no doubt i deserve it hetty but you ought to see that i cant stay here i should in fact have gone away before but i felt almost sure we would find the gold sooner or later  who is responsible for throwing the claim away broke in leger  both of us i fancy anyway thats not quite the question  leger made a last effort now he said you know very well that your chance of finding gold on the new claim is good and we can very easily afford to grubstake you until you strike it in this country its quite a common arrangement apart from thatsince you seem to be so abnormally sensitivetheres enough for you and me to do chopping wood for the oven in the evenings to square the account altogether i have of course pointed that out already but if you will make an effort i think you will remember that there was a time when you insisted on lending me what was in the circumstances a considerable sum of money  i can remember most clearly that only the fear of seeing you arrested for manslaughter induced a certain young lady to agree to it  hetty looked up sharply im not going to answer thatim too vexed she said it isnt the least use trying to persuade him tom  no said leger with a little gesture of resignation im afraid it isnt you are going to work for tomlinson walter  yes said ingleby that is now and thena day or two to keep me going while i find out what is in the claim he wants more water and is putting up a flume i had a fivedollar bill from him yesterday  he stopped a moment and the firelight showed there was a trace of deeper colour than usual in his face as he held out a little strip of paper to hetty  will you put that to my credit and let me have two loaves now he said  leger said something viciously that was not very distinct while hetty sat still a moment glancing at the paper without touching it and then gravely held out her hand  you will get them in the store she said  ingleby disappeared into the shadows and the two who were left said nothing whatever but hetty moved a trifle so that leger could not see her face then ingleby came back with the bread and quietly slung his traps about him before he held out his hand  i dont want to go hetty but it cant be helped he said of course ill come back often in the evenings  hetty did not move out of the shadow and though ingleby did not seem to notice it there was a curious hardness in her voice  well she said quietly i suppose you know best  ingleby turned away and shook himself in a fashion that suggested relief as he swung down the trail he had left a good deal behind him and it was a hard thing he had done much harder in fact than he had ever anticipated but he could not live on the bounty of a girl for all that he shrank from the loneliness of the life before him and his fancy would dwell upon the evenings he had spent with hetty and leger beside the crackling fire hetty was by no means cleverat least in some respects but he did not expect her to be so and where she was there was also cheerfulness and tranquillity now the bush in front of him seemed very black and lonely  he had scarcely disappeared when hetty rising slowly crumpled a strip of paper in her hand and flung it into the fire as it happened it fell upon the side of one of the logs a little distance from the hottest blaze and leger made a little instinctive movement and then sat still again  i suppose you realize what that is he said  yes said hetty whose face showed flushed in the flickering light it is a fivedollar bill  leger looked at her sharply and then laughed well he said i suppose you can afford itand after all im not sure it isnt the best thing you could do with it  hetty said nothing but went into the shanty and it was next morning before leger who looked very thoughtful as he sat beside the fire saw any more of her he had already realized that the possession of a pretty sister is a responsibility  for a week or two afterwards ingleby alternately assisted tomlinson in the building of a flume and worked on his claim but it was perhaps fortunate that he had now shaken off the fierce impatience which had driven him to overtax his strength when hope was strong in him indeed of late a curious lassitude had crept upon him though he still toiled on and it was only the fact that provisions were a consideration which induced him to accompany sewell and tomlinson on an expedition to look for a blacktail deer  tomlinson brought a tent with him and ingleby and sewell were sitting outside it one evening when trooper probyn and the corporal came up leading a laden horse horses were very little use for riding in that country but there were trails they could with some difficulty be led along and the few strips of natural prairie afforded them a precarious sustenance there was also no other means of transport except the miners back the corporal bade probyn pull the beast up beside the tent and loosed the packlariat  you can get up when weve hove the traps off and see if the indians there he said if he is bring him along i guess well make nothing by pushing on tonight  trooper probyn swinging himself into the saddle scrambled up the hillside which was comparatively clear of undergrowth just there while the corporal sat down beside the fire  weve had supper you dont mind our camping here he asked  sewell who lay pipe in hand upon a bundle of withered fern raised his head  theres room in the tent its a fairsized one he said youre going on into the ranges  the corporal looked at him meditatively right through to the westerhouse gully if we can get there it appears a blame rough country but captain esmond has a notion that a trail could be made this way and from westerhouse one could make the yukon its part of his business to see what can be done to open up communication  sewell turned and glanced towards the snow which stretched in a great white rampart across the valley beneath it a tremendous wall of rock dropped to the pines below which crawled round the crests and up the gullies of a desolation of jumbled crags dark forest streaked by filmy mist filled the devious hollows at their feet  you are right about the country i should imagine it to be a particularly rough one he said  well said the corporal it seems quite certain the indians used to go through after the deer and salmon and its believed that one or two white men have made westerhouse that way too  he stopped a moment and glanced at sewell you were away somewhere quite a while werent you  sewell laughed and ingleby who watched them both wondered whether the corporal knew that he was one of the few white men who had traversed the defiles of the divide  i was he said still you see it really isnt any other persons business where i go to  the corporal nodded with dry goodhumour i guess it wasnt westerhouse anyway he said im not sure well get there though an indian came along to the outpost who figured he could take us  ingleby glanced at sewell with a little smile the corporals belief in the capabilities of the police was admirable and more or less warranted for the wardens of the northwest are hardriding men but he was after all from the prairie and horses are very little used in the green river country ingleby however fancied he was not quite certain that communication had not been already effected with the westerhouse gully sewell who apparently understood inglebys glance said nothing  there are only two of you here asked the corporal  no said ingleby tomlinson is with us he went out this afternoon to look for a deer and should be back any minute now  the corporal looked thoughtful im not quite sure wed have camped here if id known that he said still if you can keep your man in hand i guess i can answer for the trooper  ingleby fancied they could promise this and for a while nothing more was said darkness crept up the valley though there was still a saffron light on the towering snow and the peaks that lay in shadow cut with a cold blue whiteness against a wondrous green transparency then the dew began to settle calling up the drowsy odours of the pines and an impressive stillness pervaded the mountain solitude it grew colder rapidly and ingleby who rose and flung fresh branches on the fire stood looking towards the west a spare black figure with outline cleancut as a cameo against the flickering light when the sharp ringing of a rifle came suddenly down the valley it rang from rock to rock as the hillsides flung it back and died away among the dimness of the pines  tomlinson said sewell i fancy he has got that deer theres scarcely wood enough to keep the fire in until morning walter if you dont want to light another for breakfast hadnt you better cut some more  ingleby who took up an axe moved back into the bush and the silence was broken by a rhythmic thudding that vibrated among the shadowy trunks which was unfortunate because it tended to confuse the corporals hearing he was an opinionated man and a good deal depended upon his being able to correctly locate a sound just then he would however probably have done so had his attention not been fixed upon the tobacco he was shredding a minute or two had passed when the crash of a rifle came down the valley again and he laughed  i guess your man didnt get that deer right off he said  sewell smiled and waited until ingleby came back with an armful of wood  our friend suggests that tomlinson has been throwing cartridges away he said  well said ingleby its a thing he very seldom does and i feel almost sure the last shot came from a different direction and was farther off probably trooper probyn fired at something in the bush  it was an unfortunate suggestion for the corporal who had spent a good many years on the lonely levels of the prairie was with some reason proud of his fine sense of hearing and it by no means pleased him that a young man new to the wilderness should presume to throw the least doubt upon his ability to locate a rifle shot this naturally confirmed him in his belief in the correctness of his opinion  it was tomlinson who fired twice he said i guess probyn knows better than to blaze away government ammunition without permission  ingleby said nothing the point was or so it appeared to him of no importance and the three drawing in closer to the fire sat smoking in silence while the pale stars came out above the pines at last there was a tramp of feet and tomlinson strode out of the shadows carrying a deer with its forelegs drawn over his shoulders he threw it down and stood flushed and gasping with the firelight on his face ingleby fancied he did not see the corporal who could however see him  i suppose you didnt meet trooper probyn asked sewell  tomlinson started a little and there was for a moment a curious look in his face which did not escape the corporals attention  no he said shortly i dont know that i want to what is he doing here  he went out to meet an indian whos to show us a trail across the divide said the corporal rode out most an hour ago hed keep the range side  then as i came down the south fork of the creek i wouldnt have met him anyway said tomlinson promptly he stood still a moment and then turned to ingleby hang that deer up walter ill have supper if its ready  sewell set food and a can of green tea before him and he ate in silence until ingleby glanced at him  did you get that deer a little while ago he said  no it was two hours since anyway  still we heard you shooting  tomlinson who was an excellent shot and somewhat proud of the fact laughed in a slightly embarrassed fashion  well he said i guess you may have done so but i didnt get the deer it was in the fern and the light was going i just got the one shot and it was too dark to follow up the trail  one shot said ingleby with a little smile the corporal heard two both close together and there certainly was another  then it was another man who fired it said tomlinson shortly i guess i dont often waste cartridges  the corporal who was usually a trifle persistent took up tomlinsons rifle and pushed back the slide of the magazine  a fortyfour marlin it was full when you went out he said  yes sir two cartridges gone youll find one bullet in yonder deer  the corporal for no particular reason jerked a cartridge into the chamber and then snapped it out you use nicked bullets  tomlinson did not as everybody noticed appear exactly pleased in fact it was not difficult to fancy that he was a trifle embarrassed it is a little easier to bring down a deer with a bullet that will split up into a torn strip of metal when it meets a bone than with one that has a solid nose and makes a clean punctured wound  well he said i dont know any reason why i shouldnt and now and then i get the hacksaw and cut one or two across when i go shooting its a deer i want  nothing more was said on that point though ingleby fancied that the corporal was a little incredulous still he rose and looked up the trail as though listening  i cant quite figure what is keeping probyn he said the indian was to meet him at sundown where the north creek fork twists round the rocks and he should have been back by now  they sat silent a minute or two but no sound came out of the silence of the pines there was not even the murmur of water the wilderness was very still  then tomlinson laughed perhaps hes not coming back  what do you mean by that  well said the miner ive heard esmond has been worrying the boys lately they dont seem quite fond of him anyway it kind of seemed to me probyn might have lit out without you  now it is not often that a trooper takes the risk of discharging himself from the ranks of the northwest police but the thing has been done it was however unfortunate that tomlinson made the suggestion the corporals face grew a trifle grim as he looked at him  ive no use for that kind of talk he said theres not a man up here im not most as sure of as i am of myself  then hes probably up there with the indian said ingleby it would be a little risky leading a horse down the big gully in the dark  another hour passed and as there was still no appearance of trooper probyn the corporal decided that ingleby was right and rolling themselves in their blankets they lay down inside the tent they were fast asleep when a beat of hoofs came out of the silence of the night as a jaded horse floundered along the hillside and the corporal wakened only when there was a trampling of undergrowth outside the tent he shook the blankets from him and stood up  is that you probyn tether the beast and come in he said  there was no answer and the corporal stooping suddenly touched tomlinsons shoulder  i guess you had better get up youre awake ingleby he asked  ingleby who had been roused by the sound noticed that he had not asked tomlinson this but they were both on their feet in another moment and went out of the tent the fire had almost burned out but a few red brands still gave a faint light and the spires of the pines seemed a little blacker and sharper than they had been when the men went to sleep it was very cold for dawn was coming and they shivered a little as they looked about them there was nothing to excite apprehension only a jaded horse that stood just within the uncertain light with loose bridle and lowered head but ingleby felt a curious uneasiness come upon him the sight was unpleasantly suggestive  probyn the corporal called again  there was no answer and though he scarcely knew why ingleby felt that he did not expect one then the horse moving very lamely walked up to the corporal whom it apparently recognized and he laid a hand upon the bridle  throw on a piece or two of wood and stir the fire he said  ingleby did it and nothing more was said until a blaze sprang up then the corporal ran his hand along the horses coat there was a smear of blood on it when he glanced at it  been travelling quite fast before he dried he said through some thick bush too heres a scar where a branch ripped the hide looks to me as though hed been scared and bolted though i dont quite see what has lamed him  the rest watched him with a curious intentness while he lifted one of the beasts hoofs it was plain to all of them that there was something wrong but nobody cared to give his misgivings vent then as the firelight blazed up a little more ingleby touched the corporal  you are looking in the wrong place he said  the corporal raised his head and saw a deep red scar stooping he drew a brand from the fire and the men looked at one another uneasily when he held it up  yes he said grimly that was made by a bullet i figure the beast was going away from the man who fired it  again there was silence for almost a minute the pines were growing a trifle blacker and clearer in outline and it was very cold ingleby shivered again for a curious creepy feeling troubled him the corporal stood very still a tense black figure apparently gazing fixedly at tomlinson it was the latter who spoke first  i fired onceat the deer he said  well said the corporal with a curious certainty that jarred on inglebys nerves probyns back yonder and it will be daylight in an hour wed better look for him  then he turned towards the jaded horse its kind of unfortunate that beasts cant talk  nobody said anything further and they plodded silently into the gloom that still shrouded all the hillside it was dusk when they came back again but they had found no sign of trooper probyn or anything that might account for his disappearance except an empty 44cartridge lying not far from his trail     xix  trooper probyn comes back   it was late next night when the corporal reached the police outpost and on the following morning esmond and major coulthurst sat at a little table in the latters dwelling the corporal who had told his story concisely had just gone out and coulthurst who rolled an unlighted cigar between his fingers was grave in face esmond glanced at him inquiringly  it is in one respect not exactly your business but you and i are between us responsible for the tranquillity of the green river country and i should be glad of your opinion sir he said i dont want to make a mistake just now there is no doubt that most of the men are in an uncertain temper and they do not seem pleased with me  coulthurst smiled a trifle drily i presume you dont want me to go into that  no the fact is after all of no great importance the point iswhat do you make of the corporals story  the major appeared to be taxing his brain for a moment or two not being a detective i can make nothing at all i suppose he is trustworthy  as reliable a man as there is in the force let me try to set out what we know tomlinson thrashed probyn and pitched him into the creek neither of them would explain the cause of the trouble which is a trifle significant but tomlinson was heard to say that if the trooper played the same game again he would kill him he is apparently not an impulsive man and the corporal seems to think it was a warning and not mere bluster  that said coulthurst gives you a little to go upon we can admit that tomlinson fancied he had a grievance against the trooper he is not the man to say a thing of that kind without sufficient reason  then probyn leaves sewells camp and never comes back sewell ingleby and the corporal hear two shots apparently from the same part of the range  i understand ingleby does not admit that  esmond smiled one would scarcely expect ingleby to agree with a corporal of police still i may point out that he has been less than a year in the bush and the corporal has at least spent most of his life on the prairie you know the effect the life my troopers lead has in quickening the perceptions most of them could locate and tell you the meaning of a sound i couldnt hear at all  coulthurst made a sign of concurrence his view is certainly worth a good deal more than inglebys still admitting that the two shots were fired from about the same place it doesnt necessarily follow that they were fired by the same person  we know that leaving out probyn tomlinson and the indian could have been the only men on that part of the range just then when tomlinson appeared he seemed disconcerted to find the corporal there he also showed signs of embarrassment when questioned about the shots and persisted that he fired no more than one when told which way the trooper had gone he stated that he had come in just the opposite one it is significant that he did not mention where he had been until then several hours later probyns horse came back grazed by a bullet and a fortyfour cartridge was found beside the trail that is the size of rifle tomlinson uses  it seems to me the several hours are the difficulty  not necessarily whoever shot trooper probyn would naturally be afraid of his horse doing exactly what it did and fired at it the wounded beast would probably run as long as it was able it is evident that it must have smashed through several thickets somebody fired at it and the man who did so was the one who shot probyn  you dont know he was shot im not sure i should find it necessary to keep quite as tight a hand on your troopers as you do said the major suggestively  esmond flushed a little i feel absolutely certain the lad never intended to give us the slip  there were two men in the vicinity about that time said coulthurst reflectively  tomlinson was known to have a grievance against probyn the indian who apparently did not turn up at all had never seen him men do not kill one another without a strong inducement and nobody would expect to find much money on a police trooper  his carbine said the major would be worth a little  the man had an excellent rifle of his own  well said coulthurst it is tolerably easy to see what all this points to but i could never quite believe tomlinson would do the thing theres another point that strikes me  esmond appeared expectant though he had consulted coulthurst more from a sense of duty than because he looked for any brilliant suggestion  its rather an important one said the major gravely you cant well have a murder without a corpse you see  esmond failed to hide a little sardonic smile that is a trifle obvious sir you have no advice to offer me  i have its good as far as it goes lie low and keep your eyes open until you find probyn  esmond rose i suppose that is the only thing after all though it looks very much like wasting time i feel quite sure there will be a nicked fortyfour bullet in him when i do  he went out but the longer he considered the majors advice the more reasonable it appeared to him esmond with all his shortcomings had a keen sense of duty and had he consulted his own inclination would have wasted no time in seizing tomlinson he was however quite shrewd enough to recognize that he was not regarded with favour and that although the major did not seem to realize it the miners were not likely to content themselves with looking on while he did anything that did not meet their views he had reasons for believing that once tomlinsons culpability was evident he need expect no trouble from them but it was equally plain that unless he had definite proof it would be a risky thing to lay hands on him esmond was arrogant and impulsive but he had discovered in the northwest that it is not always advisable to run counter to popular opinion and in this case there was a faint probability that tomlinsons friends might be right he therefore set himself to wait as patiently as he could until trooper probyn should be found while the men who for the most part believed probyn to be living waited for him to come backwhich he eventually did though by no means in the fashion they had expected  there had been a sudden rise of temperature and a warm wind from the pacific had sent the white mists streaming across the mountain land it had rained for several days as it usually does in the northern wilderness in those circumstances and the snow on the lower slopes had melted under the warm deluge the river swirled by thick with the wreckage of the forests the snow had brought down frothing between its crumbling banks and on a certain saturday evening most of the men in the valley assembled by the ford where the trail crept perilously down the opposite side of the cañon it appeared very doubtful whether any man or beast could cross it then but the freighter with mails and provisions was already overdue and they had awaited him anxiously for a week or so it was possible that he might arrive that evening and in any case the six oclock supper was over and there was very little else to do  ingleby leger hetty and tomlinson were there with the rest and they sat among the roots of a great cedar where it was a little drier the rain had stopped at last but all the pines were dripping and the river came swirling out of a curtain of drifting mist the hoarse roar it made filled all the cañon  hetty was vacantly watching the slow whirl of an eddy when a great trunk that plunged into it held her eye it had been a stately hemlock well over a hundred feet in height and great of girth and now it gyrated slowly round the pool a splendid wreck with farflung limbs that thrashed the water as they rose and fell then the great butt tilted and there was a crash that rang high above the turmoil of the flood as the branches that smashed and splintered struck a boulder whose wet head rose just above the foam the forks held for a moment and then the ponderous trunk swung again and with its shattered limbs whirling about it drove madly down the white rush of a rapid  it was an impressive sight and the sound of rending and smashing was more impressive still but when the trunk had gone hetty found her attention fixed upon the pool it swirled and lapped upon the rocks with nothing on its surface now but muddy smears of foam but she watched it with a vague sense of expectancy it seemed to her that she and that sullen eddy alike were waiting for what should follow another trunk with branches that heaved out of the turmoil and sank into it again was coming down the river but a dusky halfsubmerged object slid on in front of it hetty could scarcely see it save when it was lifted by the buffeting of the flood until it plunged into the head of the eddy then she rose suddenly  look at it she said its likea bundle of old clothes  ingleby who was nearest her stood up the light was growing dim in the cañon and it was a moment before he could make out what she pointed to hetty however was staring at it with a curious intensity and there was he noticed apprehension in her eyes the object drove on quietly an insignificant dusky blur swinging and swaying with the pulsations of the river and ingleby felt the girls hand close suddenly on his arm  oh she said with a little gasp its coming straight here im afraid of it walter  the thing swung in towards them with the whirl of the eddy and ingleby had for a moment a glimpse of a white patch in the water that was horribly suggestive of a face then he seized hettys hand and drew her with him as he turned away  stay there he said when a great pine rose between them and the river and went scrambling back to the waters edge  two or three other men among whom was tomlinson had reached it by this time and sewell stood on a boulder gazing at the stream while the dusky object drawn almost under now swung by amidst a rush of foam then he stepped down and looked steadily at the men about him  i fancy trooper probyn has come back he said  ingleby was close beside him and for a moment the two men looked into each others eyes in less than another minute the object they had seen would swing out with the outflow at the tail of the pool and the long white rapid would whirl it beyond their reach into the gloom again night was close at hand and if they let him pass trooper probyn would by morning have travelled far into the heart of a wilderness where it was scarcely likely that any of them would ever overtake him the rivers of the north run fast and that is a country wherein the strongest man must travel slowly it seemed to ingleby that it might be better to let him go then he was ashamed of the doubt that this implied and sewell who knew what he was thinking glanced for just a second in tomlinsons direction  one cant hide the truth it will come out he said and then raised his voice thats a man we have something to do for the rapid will have him in a minute boys  tomlinson was first into the water with ingleby almost at his side and the rest floundering and splashing close behind they went straight while the thing that swung with the eddy went round but they were in the lip of the rapid before they came up with it ingleby gasped as he braced himself against the flood which broke in a white swirl to his waist while the streamborne gravel smote his legs and he clutched at the big miner as trooper probyn drove down on them  he evaded tomlinson but ingleby stooping seized his uniform and tightened his hold on his companion as his feet were dragged from under him he could almost have fancied that trooper probyn struggled to be free from them and while the current frothed about him tomlinson was dragged backwards by the strain ingleby went under still clinging fiercely to the sodden tunic and for a second or two it seemed that all of them the dead and the living must go down the rapid together in which case no man could have distinguished between them when they were washed out at the tail of it then a man clinging to his comrade with one hand seized tomlinson there was a straining of hardened muscles a wild splashing and floundering and while one who leaned across a boulder gasped and wondered if his arm was leaving its socket the line swung into slack water again still ingleby had driven against a stone with a thud that drove out most of the little breath left in him  they brought probyn ashore between them and sewell who kept his head left them a moment and went straight up the bank where he came upon hetty standing with hands closed at her sides she could see very little beyond a group of men bending over something that lay between them  go back to the shanty make a big fire and some coffee he said  hetty did not seem to understand him tomlinson held on to him but he struck a stone she said i couldnt see any more butof courseyou brought him out is he hurt  sewell looked astonished hurt he said you must know that the man is dead  then comprehension dawned upon him as he remembered that he had for several anxious moments fancied that the man who seized trooper probyn would drive with him down the rapid  i scarcely think tom is any the worseand ingleby appears to have got off with a bruise on his head he said  he saw the sudden relief in hettys face for she had not remembered the need of reticence then but she turned away from him silently and he went back to the river where the group made way for him sewell who held only an unremunerative claim was already an influence in the green river country  the light was rapidly failing but he could still see the faces of the men who turned to him as though uncertain what to do tomlinson stood still among the rest and his voice and attitude were both unmistakably compassionate  i hove him into the creek i most wish i hadnt now he said he was young and had no sense but there was good hard sand in him  sewell turned and looked down on trooper probyn who lay very still a rigid shape in sodden uniform with the water running from him and his face partly turned away from them which was just as well  two of you go for captain esmond boys he said it will be some time before you make the outpost and i want the rest of you there is something we have to do in the meanwhile the police make mistakes now and then and it is i think our business as well as captain esmonds  he knelt down and presently pointed to a little hole very small and cleanly cut in the soaked tunic  i think you know what made that he said one of you get down i cant do what is necessary alone  nobody seemed very anxious which was perhaps not astonishing and it was not until sewell looked up again that ingleby who shivered a little knelt down he wondered when he saw that sewells fingers were very steady as he opened the tunic and saturated vest then the latter signed to the men to draw a little nearer and pointed to what appeared to be a folded pad of wet cotton held in place by a strip of hide he moved it a little so that all could see it and then let the tunic fall again ingleby was however the only one who noticed that there was something in sewells hand that had not been there before  there is nothing to show whether trooper probyn was dead when he reached the water though i think he was he said he was certainly shot and it is evident that he did not shoot himself his uniform isnt charred you see then you saw the pad police troopers do not make their shirts or patch their clothes with cotton flourbags and a man hit where probyn was would not be very likely to bandage himself the man who shot him tried to save his life why should he do that if he meant to kill him  there was no answer and sewell stood up we dont know what has happened boys perhaps we never shall but it seems to me one thing is certainit wasnt murder  there was a little murmur of concurrence and then sewell made a gesture  its getting dark and were most of us very wet he said one or two of you cut a few fir boughs and well make a litter  it was done and in another few minutes a line of wet and silent men plodded behind their comrades who carried trooper probyn up the climbing trail     xx  accessories   esmond was not at the outpost when the messengers reached it nor was the corporal there and it was two troopers to whom the miners delivered the dead lad this fact however appeared to afford sewell a certain satisfaction and he and tomlinson went back with ingleby through the growing darkness to legers shanty it was once more raining hard when they reached it and when hetty had set a kettle of coffee before them they sat steaming in the little logwalled room with the door shut each of them was aware that there was a good deal to be said and in all probability little time in which to say it but the subject was difficult and hetty had cleared the table when sewell turned to tomlinson  theres a plant in this country whose leaves the indians believe are efficacious in stopping blood he said i wonder if you could tell me where to find it  tomlinson looked up with evident astonishment  if there is i never heard of it he answered ive no use for worrying bout any plants just now  then he glanced round at the faces of the rest and his eyes rested a moment upon hetty im in a tight place but you dont believe i did the thing  of course not said hetty with a little flash in her eyes why dont you answer him some of you  ingleby would have spoken but sewell held up his hand im not sure you know how tight the place is tomlinson if youll listen ill try to show you  he spoke for two or three minutes and even ingleby who had long looked up to him as a man of brilliant ability was a trifle astonished at the acumen which marked every point of the tersely logical exposition it apparently left no loophole for doubt as to who had killed trooper probyn and once or twice leger moved uneasily there was however a little incredulous smile in hettys eyes  now said sewell incisively have you anything to tell us  tomlinson sat gazing at them stupidly with the veins on his bronzed forehead swollen and a dusky hue in his face ingleby was troubled as he watched him and leger leaned forward in his seat as though in a state of tense expectancy but still the faint smile flickered in hettys eyes for almost a minute they could hear the wailing of the pines and the rain falling on the roof then tomlinson spoke  i fired onceat a deer thats all he said  ingleby was conscious at once of a certain sense of shame and an intense relief for he recognized the truth in the miners voice and sewell had set out with relentless effectiveness the view the prosecution might be expected to take the latter laughed as he glanced at hetty  you would not have believed he did it if i had talked for hours he asked  no said hetty simply  sewell made her a little inclination and then turned to the rest with a smile  we have only reason to guide us and we argue clumsily he said women we are told have nonein their case it apparently isnt necessary they were made differently insight it seems goes along with the charity that believes no evil  it was not evident that hetty quite understood him for she sat looking at the fire with hands crossed in her lap and sewell turned to tomlinson  i think the boys would believe you as we do but that after all scarcely goes very far we have esmond and the corporal to consider and they are certainly not troubled with instinctive perceptions or any excess of charity what is more to the purpose they wouldnt try you here  tomlinson made a little forceful gesture now if id nobody else to think of id stop right where i am but theres an old woman back there in oregon whos had trouble with the rest of usmost all she could bearand half of what i took out of the claim was to go to her she was just to sit still and be happy and never work any more i guess it would break her heart if they hung me here in canada  he stopped a moment and glanced at hetty still shed never believe i did it shes like you  there was very little on the face of the statement but a good deal lay behind it as hetty apparently realized for a flush spread across her cheek for a moment and then faded away  tomlinson turned to the others with a gesture that was merely clumsy now im going away boys and i want a partner to hold my claim for me if i leave it without an owner it falls to the crown youd do the square thing by me and a widow woman on a halfshare mr sewell  it was an offer most men would have eagerly closed with but sewell shook his head  you must ask some one elseit wouldnt do he said i have never taken a dollar i didnt earn and you see i would scarcely have tried to show you that you must clear out right away if i had meant to make a profit by your doing so  tomlinson smiled a little is there a man along the green river whod believe that of you  there are said sewell drily at least a few in other places who would be glad to make the most of the story in fact if certain papers got hold of it im not sure i could live it down that wouldnt matter greatly only you see a professional agitators character doesnt belong to himself alone still you are quite right on one point you must have a partnernow the agreement could perhaps be upset if it was made after it was known that there was a warrant out for you  it appeared to all of them that sewell had thrown away an opportunity for winning what might amount to a competence for life but he only smiled at tomlinson who turned to ingleby  then it has to be you a halfshare and you and leger can work the thing between you neither of you is going to go back on me  ingleby almost gasped and his face flushed a little it had seemed quite fitting that the offer should be made to sewell but there was no apparent reason why it should be thrust on him he also saw that leger was as little anxious to profit by it as he was himself  do you suppose i would take advantage of your necessity by making a bargain of that kind he asked  tomlinson made a clumsy gesture youd have to let your own claim go a man cant hold two placer claims and youre on the lead he said ive got to have a partner and i guess im not offering any more than the things worth to me  hes right in one respect said sewell there are of course men in the valley who would be glad to take the claim on a smaller sharebut theyre not here now and esmond and his troopers may turn up at any minute besides the prospects of your finding gold on the claim you hold are tolerably good  ill be gone in bout five minutes said tomlinson quietly if none of you will have the claim it falls to the crown  that at least was evident and leger nodded when ingleby glanced at him  a halfshare is more than you are entitled to but what you can do for tomlinson is as he pointed out worth something and you would have to let your own claim go he said  then ill offer him a thousand dollars for a third share on condition that he takes a four months bill for them ill divide the risk and profit with you leger  leger smiled it seems to me tomlinson is taking all the risk there is if you dont find the money in the mine its scarcely likely that you will meet the bill still the notions a good one the thing has a more genuine look when its based on value received  the agreement was drawn up hastily on a scrap of uncleanly paper with sewells fountain pen but he made it hard and fast while hetty flitted busily between the shed and the shanty then sewell carefully wiped and put away his pen  do you know where youre going tomlinson he asked  no said the miner simply i hadnt quite thought of that  then if you head south for the settlements you will certainly be overtaken in fact im not sure the corporal will not have sent a man along the trail already you cant live in the ranges with nothing to eat and that only leaves westerhouse they would never expect you to strike out for there but if you will listen for two minutes ill tell you the trail  he was scarcely so long for time was precious but though few men unused to the wilderness would have understood or remembered most of what he said it was quite plain to tomlinson who nodded  well he said ill light out when ive got the major to record the agreement  they pointed out that this was not exactly necessary and entailed a risk but tomlinson was quietly resolute  im going away to save my claim and ill make quite sure he said its an old woman back in oregon i want the money for she hasnt another sontheyre all gone but me well i guess im ready the troopers would pick up my trail if i took a horse along  he was scarcely a minute stowing the provisions hetty thrust upon him inside two blankets which he rolled up and lashed with strips of deerhide to pack upon his back and he wasted no time in thanks but when sewell opened the door he walked gravely up to the girl and laid both his big hands on the one she held out to him  i guess im not going to worry you any more its scarcely likely ill ever come back he said  hettys face flushed a little and there was a slight tremor in her voice  its all my fault she said  tomlinson slowly shook his head you couldnt do anything that wasnt just right if you tried and youll think of me now and then he said im going to remember you while i live  he did not wait for her answer but turned abruptly away and hetty stood still a moment with hot cheeks and misty eyes then she moved hastily forward and touched inglebys arm as he went out of the door  theres one of the horses in the swamp couldnt you put the packsaddle on him and make a trail down to the ford she said the troopers couldnt help seeing it the grounds quite soft  ingleby laughed of course its an inspiration hetty  he was some little time catching the horse and when he reached the commissioners house coulthurst was already sitting with a book in front of him he looked up with a little dry smile when ingleby came in  it is after my usual office hours but i understand from mr sewell that you are anxious i should register you tonight as one of the owners of the claim held by tomlinson he asked  yes sir said ingleby there are one or two reasons that make it advisable  he fancied there was a very faint twinkle which might have suggested comprehension in coulthursts eyes as the latter took up a pen  then i think i can make an exception in your case especially as tomlinson seems equally anxious and we will get the business done he said  there was silence for a minute or two and they waited with an impatience that was the fiercer because it was suppressed while coulthurst turned over the papers in front of him and took down a book there was no sound but the splashing of the rain upon the roof and the snapping of the little stove but ingleby felt his nerves tingle as he listened coulthurst however closed the book at last and handed him a paper  that should meet your requirements and it will be quite in order for you to carry on the work at the claim should tomlinson be absent from any cause he said and stopping abruptly looked up as though listening i fancy you were wise in getting the agreement recordednow delays as you are aware are apt to be especially dangerous in case of a placer claim  he appeared to busy himself again with his book but tomlinson rose suddenly and stood a moment tense and strung up with head turned towards the door as a sound that suggested men and horses splashing in the mire reached them faintly through the rain then he stepped forward towards the veranda by which they had entered but ingleby seized his arm and pointed towards the other door at the back of the room he and sewell knew that one could reach the bush that way through the outbuilt kitchen  coulthurst who could not see the door from where he sat looked up from his book for just a moment and did not appear to notice that tomlinson was no longer in front of him  i presume there is nothing more i can do for you and that is apparently captain esmond i think he has some business with me he said  the hint that he would excuse them was plain enough even if it went no further and he drew another bundle of papers towards him this no doubt accounted for the fact that he failed to notice that while leger and sewell moved towards the veranda ingleby slipped out through the other door sewell however gasped with relief when he saw it swing silently to just then there was a tramp of feet outside and in another few moments esmond sprang upon the veranda splashed with mire and dripping with rain two wet troopers appeared behind him carbines in hand he stopped them with a little gesture of command and then striding past sewell and leger into the room appeared to have some difficulty in restraining himself when he saw only the major there  you will excuse me for coming in unceremoniously sir but i had reasons for believing tomlinson was here he said  he was here said coulthurst in fact i dont quite understand how it was you didnt meet him going away  i certainly did not and esmond flashed a keen glance at him if i had done so i should naturally not have troubled you about him  coulthurst appeared reflective  he was here in fact i have just done some business for him he said and stopped for one of the troopers cried out and all could hear a thud of hoofs and the smashing of undergrowth coulthurst glanced suggestively at esmond  that sounds very much like somebody riding through the bush he said  esmond certainly wasted no time now in ceremony he was on the veranda in another moment and shouting to the trooper who led up a horse they vanished amidst a rustle of trampled fern and sewell laughed as he and leger turned back towards the shanty  one could fancy major coulthurst belonged to the aristocracy some of our friends are pleased to consider played out but there are at least signs of intelligence in him he said he is by the way i am somewhat proud to claim a friend of mine though that is of course no compliment to him  well replied leger drily it is seldom wise to generalize too freely which is a mistake we make now and then after all it may be a little hard on the major to blame him for being a gentleman he probably couldnt help it you see  he had spoken lightly to hide his anxiety but now he stopped a moment and stood listening intently a faint sound of splashing and scrambling came up out of the hollow through the rain  its not a trail most men would care to ride down in daylight but they seem to be facing it he said if they caught ingleby it would complicate the thing  its scarcely likely said sewell he got away two or three minutes before they did  the difficulty is that ingleby cant ride as you and the troopers can  sewell touched his shoulder  listen he said and leger heard the roar of the river throb across the dripping pines when they get near the ford the troopers are scarcely likely to hear anything else through that and they would naturally not expect the man theyre after to double back for the cañon if they push on as they seem to be doing they should be a good way down the trail by morning  they both laughed at this and were sitting in the shanty half an hour later when ingleby limped in smiling and very miry with his jean jacket badly split  tomlinson got away he asked  presumably said leger we were almost afraid you hadnt we havent seen him where are captain esmond and his troopers  ingleby laughed they were riding very recklessly over an infamous trail with my horse in front of them when i last saw them i was just then behind a tree the beast i couldnt stop simplified the thing by flinging me off i hadnt any stirrups perhaps fortunately  theyd catch the horse eventually said sewell  of course that is if they could keep in the saddle long enough which is far from certain considering the state of the trail then they would naturally fancy that tomlinson had taken to the range in fact i shouldnt wonder if they spent most of tomorrow looking for his trail still there is a question i should like to ask why did you worry tomlinson about that plant  sewell took a little packet from his pocket and opened it there were one or two pulpy leaves inside it  those grew on the plant in question which tomlinson had never heard of the indians use them for stopping blood he said i took them from the body of trooper probyn  there was silence for a little while and during it the sound of the river came up to them in deep pulsations through the roar of the rain then leger laughed  im afraid captain esmond and his troopers will be very wet he said he is a capable officer but such simpleminded persons as hetty and ingleby are now and then a match for the wise  havent you left somebody out asked ingleby  major coulthurst said leger is of course the gold commissioner and could not be expected to have any sympathy with such a man as tomlinson it would in fact be unpardonable to suggest that he could be an accessory still it is perhaps not quite out of the question that people outside the class to which hetty and ingleby and i belong should possess a few amiable qualities  you and ingleby and hetty said sewell reflectively  leger looked at him with a little smile  yes he said you heard me quite correctly its not worth discussing but i scarcely think one could place you in quite the same category     xxi  a doubtful exchange   it was the monday morning after the flight of tomlinson when ingleby stood beside a pile of debris on the claim which was no longer his the rain had stopped and there was a wonderful freshness in the mountain air overhead the mists were streaming athwart the forest pierced by arrows of golden light and the fragrance of redwood and cedar filled the hollow it is a scent that brings sound rest to the jaded body when night closes down and braces it as an elixir in the coolness of the dawn ingleby drank it in with vague appreciation there was hope in it and vigour and as he stood with the torn blue shirt falling apart from his bronzed neck looking out on the forest with steady eyes there was something in his attitude which suggested the silent hasteless strength of the wilderness  the impulsiveness which had afflicted him in england had gone and steadfastness had grown in its place the crude halfformed thoughts and theories which had worked like yeast in him had ceased their ebullition purging themselves perhaps by the froth of speech and had left him with a vague optimism too deep for articulate expression faith he had always had and now the halfcomprehending hope that looks beyond all formulas had also come so much at least the wilderness had done for him he laughed as he turned towards sewell and leger who sat on the pile of thrownup gravel behind him  ive been standing here almost five minutes doing nothingi dont know why he said one does not as a rule get rich that way in this country  leger grinned at him you have just finished a remarkably good breakfast for one thing he said still havent you made an admission you always knew why you did everything in england  ingleby smiled goodhumouredly well he said im seldom quite so sure now perhaps its because im olderor it may be the fault of the country floods and frosts slides of gravel and bluegrit boulders are apt to upset the results one feels reasonably certain of here that recalls the fact that i broke out a quantity of promisinglooking dirt the last time i went down this shaft and didnt try the colour  you have sunk several shafts now and youre evidently improving said sewell the original one wasnt sunk or driven it was scratched out anyhow  three or four and ive made some two hundred dollars out of the lot of them in fact ive been spending my labour profitlessly ever since i came into the country that is at least so far as one can see  sewell smiled theres a good deal in the reservation the whole countrys full of just such holes from caribou to kootenay a few men took gold out of them the rest put something in  buried hopes said leger with a grin  probably answered sewell now and then buried men still the ranches and the orchards came up after them it was presumably good for somebody although a little rough on the prospectors in question  leger appeared reflective i wonder if any one could grow plums and apples on captain esmond in the language of the country its about the only use it could have for him well ive smoked my pipe out are we going to stay here and maunder any longer ingleby  im going down the mine though as it doesnt belong to me now i dont know why still its close on bottom and id like to try the colour of the dirt i broke out on saturday  he went down the notched pole and filled the bucket sewell lowered after him and when the latter hove it up they proceeded to the creek and the others sat down while ingleby washed out its contents neither of them showed any particular interest in what he was doing they had been some time in the goldbearing region now and had discovered that it is generally wise to expect very little then ingleby scrambled up the bank with a curious look in his face and gravely held out the pan  placer mining is a tolerably uncertain thing but heres a result i never anticipated two or three days ago he said look at this  they bent over the pan and their faces grew intent at the sight of the little grains of metal in its bottom then leger looked up with a gasp  youve struck it again he said apparently as rich as ever  ingleby stood still a moment gazing straight in front of him with vacant eyes and one hand closed a trifle at his side  yes he said harshly the second time and once more its of no use to me when i recorded as partowner of tomlinsons claim this one fell in to the crown youre on the lead tom and youll strike it too but you can get your stakes in sewell sundays an off day or the major would have had his notice out by now  it was a relief to do anything just then and he cut and drove in two of the location pegs the law required then when the last was driven he turned to sewell with grim quietness  well he said why dont you get away and make your record theres no reason you should throw away a fortune too  sewell smiled a little for one thing major coulthurst would certainly not be up when i reached his office for another before i record the claim theres something to be said the law you see cannot be expected to cover every contingency and if you look at it from one point of view the claim is still yours ill buy the goodwill of you if youll take my bill  ingleby shook his head impatiently i cant sell you what isnt mine he answered anybody who thinks it worth while can record that claim it belongs to the crown i have my share in tomlinsons mine and in one respect im not sorry to see this one come into your possession you at least would not consider the gold you took out belonged to yourself  sewell looked at him with an expression in his face which somewhat puzzled leger  no he said its not wise to be too sure of anything ingleby  i believe you told us you had struck gold once before what did you do with it when we met you in vancouver you hadnt the appearance of a man who has a balance at his bank  a suggestion of darker colour crept into sewells face you cant carry on a campaign of any kind without funds the one i embarked upon not long before you came across me was too big for us it broke the exchequer and landed me in jail  precisely said ingleby and what title have i to the money you would hold in trust that is the difference between us im not a leaderim glad of it just nowand what gold i find i want for myself  once more sewells expression furnished leger with food for reflection though ingleby did not appear to notice it it is now and then a trifle embarrassing to have ones good deeds proclaimed to ones face and leger was aware that all sewell gained was usually expended on the extension of his propaganda but that did not seem to account for everything and he fancied the man had winced at his comrades speech as though it had hurt him then sewell made a curious little gesture  it is he said seldom worth while to decide what other people will do they dont know themselves very frequently well since nobody ever persuaded you ill get on and record the claim  he left them and neither ingleby nor leger broke the silence as they pushed on up the valley near the farther end of which tomlinsons claim lay leger knew that because his claim adjoined the one his comrade had allowed to fall to the crown he too would in all probability find gold and since now it would all be his that fact alone was sufficient to occupy him still he was getting accustomed to the dramatic unexpectedness of the results of placer mining and he was also sensible of a certain sympathy for ingleby who held no more than a thirdshare in tomlinsons mine then he recalled sewells face and wondered again  the man had certainly appeared embarrassed and that had its significance in connection with what ingleby had said sewell was certainly entitled to use what gold he dug toilfully from the earth as seemed best to him and there was no reason why he should devote it to the liberation or enlightenment of those he might regard oppressed unless he wished that he had done so hitherto was it seemed to leger plain but he fancied it was to be different now this led to the question what did sewell who lived with spartan simplicity want the gold forand to that there was no answer until he changed the what to whom then a reason suggested itself for sewell of late had played chess with major coulthurst frequently more often indeed leger fancied than ingleby knew  it was a relief to both of them when they reached tomlinsons mine which was by no means imposing at first sight consisting as it did of a little gap in the forest strewn with blackened branches and charred fir stumps a shanty a pile of shattered rock and gravel and a black hole with a very rude windlass straddling it it did not count at all that it was engirdled by towering trees whose sombre spires lifted one beyond the other in climbing ranks led the wondering vision upwards ever across the face of a tremendous crag where they clung dotted against the grey rock in the fissures to the ethereal gleam of nevermelting snow it was sufficient that the clink of the shovel and clatter of flungup gravel came out of the scented shadow in token that tomlinsons claim was on the lead the bed which had been worn out and left ages ago by the green river or some other which had washed away the matrix rock  ingleby stopped beside the windlass and rolled the sleeves of his blue shirt to the elbow as he looked into the shadow beneath him  exactly what is down there i dont know and it seems a little astonishing now that i didnt ask tomlinson when i bought the mine he said there should be a thousand dollars anyway tom are you going to stand shares with me  leger looked at the shaft and for no very apparent reason became sensible of unpleasant misgivings  no he said you hold only a thirdshare anyway and im not sure that if you split it up there would be enough for two still ill stay with you until this evening you should have some notion how the thing will work out by then  they went down and toiled steadily for several hours in the short heading tomlinson had driven then leger ascended and hove up the bucket ingleby filled after which they transported the debris to the rocker at the adjacent creek tomlinsons flume which would bring the water to the mine was not finished yet by the time this was done the dinner hour had come and leger looked at ingleby as he took up his axe  would you like to go on he asked  no said ingleby with a little harsh laugh there was a time when if id had no food since yesterday i should not have stopped but one gets over that besides i almost fancy we shall know quite soon enough what a thirdshare in the tomlinson mine is worth  leger made a fire and sewell appeared while they ate  i have made the record how have you got on he inquired  ingleby pointed to the pile of soil and stones and sand so far we are not going any farther until after dinner it is not very long since i turned prospector but i have twice bottomed on gold and had to let it go the last occasion was only two or three hours agoand im not quite sure ive got over it yet  sewell nodded sympathetically there is gold herethough its remarkable that nobody seems to know how much he said tomlinson apparently was not communicative  that said ingleby is of course the question if there is not a good deal a thirdshare is scarcely likely to recompense me for leaving the other claim especially when there is a thousand dollars to come out of this one thats one reason im getting dinner before i go any further i bought a pig in a poke you see and now im almost afraid to open it  i wonder why you made the bargain especially in view of the fact that tomlinson told you the chances of striking gold on your own claim were good  ingleby appeared a trifle confused well he said tomlinson had found gold while i hadnt thenand one naturally prefers a certainty the man was in a difficulty too  tomlinson in fact made use of the old woman back in oregon somewhat artistically  ingleby flushed a trifle he was one who though he had formerly at least proclaimed his views nervously concealed his charities  tomlinson never meant to wrong me of a dollar he isnt that kind of man he said  no said sewell with a little laugh i scarcely think he did well are we to help you with the washup  they toiled for awhile kneedeep in very cold water while the rocker clashed and rattled and ingleby whose face grew a trifle grim as the time wore on washed out the residue of its contents in a little pan then for the others insisted when there was a good deal of the pile left they went back to the mine and the hour of supper had crept round again when ingleby came out of the stream carrying the result of all that they had done in a little pan he stood still a moment in the shadow of the pines and his lips were set and his eyes unusually grave as he looked at sewell  if your new claim turns out dirt equal to what we found this morning you will go south rich he said i would sooner you had it than anybody elseand i dont think i grudge it you  sewell took the pan from him and glanced into it im sorry he said simply the thing is done now and i cant make you a partner unless you let tomlinsons claim go which i presume you dont mean to do  that is of course quite out of the question tomlinson went out believing it was safe with me  then we come back to the other suggestion i still fancy you are entitled to sell me what one might consider your option on the claim there are men in the valley who would have willingly handed you their bill for a thousand dollars for the information you supplied me  ingleby looked at him steadily with his head held back a little  it already belonged to the crown he said have i ever done anything that would lead my friends to believe they could bestow alms on me  sewell smiled i fancy there are one or two of them who advocate a community of property  it occurred to leger that it might be advisable to change the subject im afraid we usually stop there he said with a grin it has seemed to me lately that there are two difficulties in the way of bringing an equitable division about though most people only recognize the obvious one which is however serious enough i mean inducing the people who have anything worth having to part with it  and the other  the other said leger reflectively would consist in inducing the people who have very little to receive it there are a few of them who wouldnt be willing to do soat least in the colonies they want to reap only what they have sown  it isnt quite clear that they will be permitted  leger smiled drily though he looked hard at sewell well he said i almost fancy one could leave it to them it would be an unfortunate thing for the men who insisted on getting in the way of the sickle  then he turned to ingleby and laid a hand on his shoulder it might be worse he said  yes answered ingleby who laughed a little though it cost him an effort considerably the man who has what is evidently a very good living in his hands really doesnt deserve very much sympathy still you see i twice threw away what looked like a fortune any one would find the reflection apt to worry him  they went away and left him sitting on a blackened cedar stump in the desolate clearing the clink of the shovels no longer rose from beyond the sombre trees and there was deep stillness in the hollow the gaps in the forest grew duskier and a peak across the valley flung a cold blue shadow athwart the gleaming snow the dew was settling heavily but ingleby sat still grave in face seeing nothing until he rose with a little resolute shake of his shoulders and slipping down from the stump took up his axe  he had twice thrown away a fortune and with it for a time at least the prospect of realizing a very precious hope but fortunes are now and then retrieved suddenly in that country and in any case a man who would work must eat     xxii  alisons sault   some weeks had passed since ingleby took over tomlinsons claim when one lowering evening grace coulthurst pulled up her cayuse pony in the depths of the green river valley leaden cloud had veiled the peaks since early morning and now the pines were wailing dolefully beneath a bitter breeze a little dust of snow fine and dry as flour whirled about her and the trail was hard as adamant beneath her ponys feet the beast pricked its ears and stamped impatiently for it had been bred in the wilderness and knew what was coming  grace whose fingers were growing stiff relaxed her grasp on the bridle and looked about her observantly but without uneasiness she was some distance from home and daylight was dying out unusually early while few horses unaccustomed to the mountains could have scrambled over either of the trails there were two of them footwide tracks which climbed up and down steep hollows and twisted round great fallen trees and she had stopped at the forking though there was she knew very little to choose between them  the bush was a little thinner just there but she could see nothing beyond dim colonnades of towering trunks that were rapidly fading into the gloom the cold was nipping and she shivered when the breeze dropped a moment the silence was startling and she felt it almost a relief when a low crescendo murmur like the sound of distant surf rose from the pines as the wind awoke again then a puff of powdery snow stung her tingling cheeks and she shook the bridle and turned the cayuse into the lower trail  she had ridden to the mines at the head of the valley early in the afternoon while her father walked by her stirrup which considering the nature of the trail he had no difficulty in doing indeed he had led and now and then dragged the horse up parts of it there had as not infrequently happened been a dispute concerning the boundaries of a placer claim and the commissioner had gone over to adjudicate he was not a brilliant man but he showed no one favour and the whimsically expressed decisions which he apparently blundered upon gave general satisfaction and are still remembered in the green river valley it was also characteristic of him that he had saved more than one difficult situation in which a logical exposition of the mining laws would probably have been unavailing by a little free badinage  in the meanwhile his daughter whom he had bidden ride home realized without any undue anxiety that it might be advisable to reach there as soon as she could she was at home in the saddle and rightly thought herself secure from any difficulty that might not be occasioned by the weather the free miner is a somewhat chivalrous person which is going far enough by way of appreciation since the epithet which might suggest itself to those acquainted with his characteristics has little meaning in the land to which he belongs where men have outgrown the need of meretricious titles still when a thin white haze blotted out the dim colonnades and obscured the firs beside the trail she strove to quicken the cayuses pace a trifle the beast was apparently already doing what it could clambering up slopes of gravel sliding down them amidst a great clatter of stones and turning and twisting amidst tangled undergrowth  now and then a drooping branch whipped the girl as she went by or shook the snow that was gathering on it into her face and the withered fern smote smears of white powder across her skirt winter was closing in earlier than any one had expected and that night an arctic cold descended suddenly upon the lonely valley her hands grew numb on the bridle all sense of feeling seemed to go out of the foot in the stirrup and at last it was with difficulty she pulled up the cayuse which appeared as anxious to get home as she was they had floundered round the spreading branches of a great fallen tree and now there no longer appeared to be a trail beneath them  grace shivered all through as she looked about her the pines were roaring in the sliding haze the air was thick with dust not flakes of snow here and there she could dimly see a tree but the white powder obscured her sight and stung her face when she lifted it she could not remember having passed that fallen tree when riding out nor could she recall how long it was since she had seen the narrow trail in front of her where it was now she did not know but there was at least the sound of the river on one side of her when she could hear it across the moaning of the trees in heading for it she would probably strike the trail again and once more she spoke to the cayuse and shook the bridle she was becoming distinctly anxious now  then a hazy object appeared suddenly a few yards in front of her and stopped at her cry while in another moment ingleby was standing by her stirrup and her apprehensions melted away it was significant that she was by no means astonished she felt that it was only fitting that when she wanted him he should be there the mere sight of his face of which she caught a faint glimpse was reassuring  do you know that i am very glad i met you where is the trail she said  ingleby did not protest that it afforded him an equal gratification and if he had done so it would probably not have pleased her grace was critical and rather liked the reticence which was it seemed in harmony with his characterthat is since he had fortunately grown out of the evil habit of discussing social economics  i dont think it can be far away in fact i was just trying to cut off a bend of it he said with a little laugh  it isnt exactly a pleasant night for a stroll through the bush said grace suggestively  no replied ingleby who fell into the snare still you see they were expecting me at the bakery  grace was by no means pleased at this certain observations esmond had once let fall with a purpose had not been without their effect on her and she remembered that the girl at the bakery was it had to be admitted pretty it also appeared likely that she was what is now and then termed forward graces displeasure which she did not of course express might however have been greater had there been any delay in the mans answer  then if you will show me the trail i will not keep you i am getting cold she said  ingleby took the bridle and he and the cayuse floundered through what appeared to be a horrible maze of fallen branches and tangled undergrowth in fact grace fancied she heard her skirt rip as they struggled in it then the bush became a little clearer and they went on more briskly up and down steep slopes and past dim blurs of trees while soil and gravel alike rang beneath the cayuses feet how long this continued grace did not exactly know nor had she any notion as to where they were the only reassuring thing was the glimpse she had of ingleby plodding on beside her horses head which was however quite sufficient still civility demanded something and at last she bade him stop  im afraid i must be taking you away from the bakery she said  ingleby laughed i am of course not going there now  that should have been sufficient but grace was not quite contented compliments on her beauty seldom pleased her but she liked to feel the hold she had upon those she attracted and was not averse to having it explained to her  no she said then where are you going  ingleby appeared a trifle astonished as though he considered the question quite unnecessary which was naturally gratifying  to the gold commissioners residence he said  with my permission and grace laughed  ingleby did not look at her he was apparently staring at the forest which loomed through the whirling haze a faint blur of vanishing trees and he flung the answer over his shoulder  i think i would venture to go without it tonight he said  this was significant but although the snow was certainly getting thicker and the cold struck through her like an icy knife grace no longer felt any apprehension she was not unaccustomed to physical discomfort and peril and there could be she felt no doubt of her reaching home safely while ingleby plodded at the horses head he was young and by no means assertive but there were men in the green river valley who shared her confidence in him still the rough flounder through the brushwood was becoming irksome and where the trees were smaller she could not avoid all the drooping branches by swaying in the saddle and at last she bade him pull up again  we are a long while striking the trail she said  yes said ingleby without turning towards her  grace leaned down and touched him why havent we found it i mean you to tell me  the man made a little gesture for he recognized that tone  im sorry he said quietly we have struck it and didnt recognize it in fact we must have gone straight across and left it behind us  grace sat still and looked at him she could not see his face he was no more than a blurred shadowy shape in the haze of sliding snow still she could make out that he was standing very straight with slightly tilted head and she knew the intentness of gaze and look of tenacity in the hidden face which usually accompanied that attitude his answer also pleased her there was no attempt at concealing unpleasant probabilities for the man spoke frankly as to one whom he regarded as his equal in courage and everything except perhaps bodily strength in the meanwhile however they were alone in the wilderness cut off from all hope of succour by anything but their own resources in a haze of snow with their limbs slowly stiffening under the arctic cold  then what are we to do she asked  push on said ingleby the river must be close at hand to the right of us that is why im keeping to the higher ground i dont want to strike until we have passed alisons sault  he wrenched at the bridle but grace had faint misgivings as they floundered on again sault in that country implies a fall or rapid and the one in question was called after a prospector who had drowned himself and a comrade there it swept down to the mouth of the cañon in a wild white rush studded with great boulders that bruised and scarred the pines the flood hurled down on them and what made it more perilous in the dark was the fact that the trail dipped to the brink of the smaller rapids at the tail of it indeed it was often necessary to splash kneedeep through the slack of them along the shore and alison had come by his death through mistaking the big sault for one of the smaller ones on a black night the man who fished him out of an eddy a week later said that alison looked very much as though he had been put through a threshing mill  it was grace fancied half an hour later when they floundered down a declivity with the roar of the river growing louder in their ears it was with difficulty she kept in the saddle and she was vaguely conscious that her skirt was rent to tatters though she was too stiff and cold to trouble about that now even in the thicker timber the snow was almost bewildering and it was only now and then she could see ingleby scrambling and floundering in front of her he was evidently making his course by sound for there was nothing that she could discern to guide him  then somehow they slid down a bank and there was a splash that told her the cayuse was in the water ingleby seemed to be struggling with the beast but she could not make out why he did so nor did it seem of any moment she was dazed and bewildered and intolerably cold there was a further splashing a plunge and a flounder the water rose to her stirrup and for a few horrible moments she felt that the beast was going downstream with her it was evident by the depth that they were in the sault she fancied she cried out in her terror and that ingleby shouted in answer but the roar of the river drowned the sound in another few seconds however the horse apparently struck rock with its hoofs again then the water that had lapped about her skirt seemed to fall away and in a frantic scrambling ingleby dragged the pony up the bank the cayuse stood still trembling at the top of it and ingleby was apparently quivering too for his voice shook a little as he answered her halfcoherent questions  alisons sault he said hoarsely it should have been behind us i never recognized it until the river swept my feet from under me i suppose i was dazed by the snow  grace sat silent a moment she knew that they had looked death in the face for nothing made of flesh and blood could carry the life in it through the mad turmoil of rock and flood in alisons sault the roar of the river was very impressive now and the mans voice had shown that he was shaken by some strong emotion which was not personal fear then as the crash of a great pine against a streamswept stone rang through the deep reverberations she bent down and touched his shoulder the contact was momentary but she felt a little quiver run through him  nobody could have recognized it on such a night it was not your fault she said  i cant forgive myself the cayuse got out of handi couldnt hold him he was heading out into the stream if that ledge hadnt been there  he stopped with a gasp and grace was glad to recognize that of the two she was the one who showed less concern she guessed what he was feeling but could not restrain the desire to make certain  well she said if the shelf of rock had not been there  ingleby turned and seemed to be listening to the river perhaps he did it unconsciously but the hoarse roar of the flood among the boulders was sufficient answer  you were not cumbered with a horse that had lost its head there is a little slack close to the bank she said  the man turned and seemed by his attitude to be gazing at her in astonishment  you cant suppose i should have scrambled out alone he said  there was a suggestion of anger in his voice which grace recognized as wholly genuine she had met and formed her own opinion of the protestations of not a few young men in her time and it was evident to her that while inglebys attitude became him he did not recognize the fact  you felt yourself responsible then she suggested  no said the man slowly i certainly didnt though its clear that i was i dont think i felt anything except thatyouwere in the rapid  this was also evidently perfectly sincere but he seemed to pull himself up abruptly and laughed in a fashion that suggested embarrassment  you will not remember that little speech its not the kind of thing one is pleased with afterwards but in the circumstances it was perhaps excusable he said  he gave her no opportunity for answering but struck the cayuse and they went on again still grace had noticed the tremor in his voice and knew that he had meant exactly what he said nor was she displeased at it  then the thoughts and fancies which the moment of peril had galvanized into activity grew blurred again and she was only sensible of the physical pain and weariness and an intolerable cold as the man and beast stumbled on twice again they dipped to the river which however scarcely rose to his knee and after that there was only a sliding past of snowdimmed trees while by a grim effort she kept herself in the saddle then at last a light blinked in front of her through the filmy haze the cayuse stopped and ingleby it seemed lifted her down at least she felt his arm about her and then found herself standing beside him before the commissioners dwelling without any very clear notion of how she came there it was only afterwards she remembered with tingling cheeks how she had seen a miner walk away with a onehundredandfortypound bag of flour then they went into a lighted room together and stood still gasping a moment with a distressful dizziness creeping over both of them ingleby apparently roused himself with an effort and threw the door open  keep away from the stove he said a trifle faintly theres a chair yonder  he stood in the entrance white with snow looking at her the blood was in her head now and a most unpleasant tingling ran through her halffrozen limbs but ingleby was a trifle grey in face  you can shut the door in another minute or two i may come back tomorrow to make sure you are none the worse he asked  grace looked at him with a smile you cant go away now  ingleby turned and glanced at the whirling haze that swept athwart the light in the veranda  im afraid i must he said it would be difficult to get off the trail as far as the bakery and there is apparently nothing i can do for you here somebody lighted the fire  one of the police troopers said grace that doesnt matter it is snowing harder than ever you cant go away  she had brushed aside the dictates of conventionality and the blood was in her face and a curious sparkle in her eyes they had been close to death together a little while ago and it was a long way to the bakery still it was not this fact alone that impelled her to bid him stay  im afraid i must he said slowly as with an effort you see there is something i have to talk over with leger he expects me besides it would be advisable to send back any of the boys who may be there to see what has become of the major  then he turned abruptly and grace who had scarcely remembered the major laughed curiously when he went out of the door she knew now at least exactly what she felt for ingleby and had he stayed and declared boldly what his wishes were it is probable that coulthurst would have been astonished when he came home ingleby however had gone away and the girl was left standing flushed in face with the melting snow dripping from her beside the stove which she remembered with some little satisfaction was precisely what he had told her not to do then with a little disdainful gesture she swept into the adjoining room     xxiii  ingleby loses his head   a keen frost had followed the snow but there was warmth and a brightness in the little inner room of the gold commissioners house its log walls and double casements kept out the stinging cold the stove snapped and crackled and a big lamp diffused a cheerful light ingleby who had just come in sat with his back to the logs with coulthurst and grace opposite him grace was in the shadow but the light shone full upon the majors weatherdarkened face  grace he said is as you can see none the worse but it was a fortunate thing you turned up when you did very much obliged to you for taking such good care of her  it was evident to ingleby that coulthurst did not know what had nearly happened at alisons sault he had in fact already had reasons for surmising that miss coulthurst did not think it advisable to tell her father everything  im not sure it wouldnt have been better if i had not met miss coulthurst sir he said in that case she would probably have gone back and waited with you until daylight which would have saved you both a good deal of anxiety of course when we made up our minds to push on i had no idea the snow would be so bad  its questionable whether she could have found the way i could see nothing whatever and scarcely fancy i would have got here if two of the older prospectors hadnt come with me in fact i scarcely remember a worse night anywhere and one result of it is an unpleasant twinge in the shoulder i never used to get anything of that kind i suppose im getting old  it occurred to ingleby that coulthurst was certainly looking older than he had done in england there was a good deal of grey in his hair his cheeks were hollower and there were deepening lines about his eyes ingleby felt sorry for the man who had served his nation for so small a reward that after a life of hardship he must bear the burden still and yet the fact was in one respect encouraging since coulthursts means were scanty there was less probability of his objecting too strenuously to the successful miner who aspired to his daughters hand and though not so rich as the one ingleby had thrown away tomlinsons claim was yielding well he however said nothing and coulthurst went on again  a devil of a night it would be hard on any one in the ranges i wonder where tomlinson could have gone  one would naturally expect him to head for the settlements said ingleby indifferently  he left no trail behind him if he did at least esmonds troopers couldnt find any there was however a good deal it is difficult to understand about the affair one point that would strike anybody is how tomlinson got away from here without being seen by esmond who turned up almost as he must have gone off the veranda  it really is a trifle hard to understand sir  they looked at each other steadily for a moment or two and then ingleby could have fancied that there was a twinkle in coulthursts eyes  perhaps it was as well he got away after all he said appearances were against him and it might have gone hard with him but i cant quite bring myself to believe that tomlinson did the thing  then grace who laughed softly broke in of course she said you tried very hard  a moment later there was a tramp of feet outside and the major who passed into the outer room came back in a minute or two he smiled at ingleby somewhat drily  it isnt news of tomlinson he said noel has brought the frenchman over theyve been burrowing into each others claims and if i cant straighten the thing out theyll probably settle their differences in their own way with the shovel i shall probably be half an hour over it but dont go  he went out and left ingleby with grace she looked none the worse for the journey she had made the previous night and was dressed with unusual simplicity ingleby did not know what the fabric was or whether the colour was blue or grey nor did it occur to him that its severe simplicity was the result of skill but he noticed that it enhanced the girls beauty and added a suggestion of stateliness to her figure of which miss coulthurst was probably quite aware she looked up at him with a little smile when a murmur of excited voices rose from the adjoining room  they will of course both be disgusted with his decision whatever it is she said a gold commissioner has really a good deal to put up with  major coulthursts position is naturally a responsible one said ingleby  grace laughed with a very disproportionate emolumentwhich is a point one has to consider after all im not sure it wouldnt have been better if he had been a prospector  inglebys pulse throbbed a trifle faster he had no great knowledge of the gentler sex but he was not a fool and it seemed to him that the girl had not spoken altogether without a purpose  i dont think you really believe that he said  perhaps i dont and grace appeared to reflect at least i suppose i shouldnt have done so once but of course a prospector who has done sufficiently well for himself can take any place that pleases him in canada  still you dont think that right  it would naturally depend a good deal upon the prospector  ingleby sat still almost too still in fact for a moment or two but he could not hide the little gleam in his eyes he had it is true democratic views that is so far as everybody but grace coulthurst was concerned but he was quite willing to admit that she was a being of a very different and much higher order than his own that added to the attraction she had for him and now she had suggested that they were after all more or less on the same level it was almost disconcerting he did not know what to make of it but while he pondered over it she flashed a quick glance at him  i wonder if you know how tomlinson got away she asked  it was apparently an astonishingly abrupt change of subject but when ingleby who had grown wiser in the meanwhile afterwards recalled that night he was less sure that it might not have been after all part of an instinctive continuity of policy he had discovered by then that even very charming and ingenuous women not infrequently have a policy  i dont mind admitting that i doto you he said  grace was pleased and showed it it is gratifying to feel that anybody has complete confidence in one and the possession of a common secret of some importance is not infrequently a bond between the two who share it ingleby realized this and felt with a curious gratification that the girl recognized it as clearly as he did still she had said nothing that could lead him to believe so  then you no doubt know where he went she asked  i naturally know that too  grace smiled that means you helped him to get away are you wise in admitting that you were an accessory captain esmond is a friend of ours  ingleby made her a little whimsical inclination though there was a look in his eyes which was not quite in keeping with it  i am he said quite safe in your hands  it was a fortunate answer and worth the more because he was not usually a very tactful person as the girl was aware she was afflicted by a craving for influence and it was not the adulation of men she wanted but an insight into their thoughts and purposes and the privilege of controlling them thus ingleby who did not know it could not have done more wisely than he did in admitting that he had an unquestioning confidence in her he was as she had discovered some time ago in spite of his simplicity a man capable of bold conceptions and resolute execution the type of man in fact that usually came to the front in western canada she had the intelligence to realize and weigh all this and yet there was a strain of passion in her which he had awakened  i almost think you are she said how is the new claim progressing  reasonably well in fact although sewell is apparently getting rich on the one i threw away i cant complain what he makes will at least be spent on what he thinks is doing good while i want mine for my own selfish purposes  they are necessarily selfish  ingleby laughed though the little glow crept into his eyes again well he said i suppose so you see a thirdshare in tomlinsons claim is not of itself of much value to me it only provides the money to make a start with  grace nodded comprehendingly he was crude in his mode of expression but she understood him  that implies a going on she asked  it does and ingleby laughed there is room i think in this province for men who will take big risks and boldly stake what they have on the advancement of its prosperity im not sure there is any reason i shouldnt be one of them  and gather in the money more than you are entitled to havent you been changing your opinions  ingleby made a little whimsical gesture which alone sufficed to show that he had as the girl expressed it to herself expanded  i suppose i havethat is i have modified them one has to now and then he said still you see the men i mean dont grind money out of others they create it they take hold of the wilderness bridge the rivers drive the roads through it and the ranches and the orchards follow every man who makes a new home in the waste owes a little to them  still all that is not done easily one must have the faithand as you suggest the money with which to make the start even then the ladder is hard to climb  ingleby involuntarily glanced down at his hands and the girl noticed the scars on them which however did not repel her she also noticed the spareness of his frame the curious transparency of his darkened skin and the brightness of his eyes all significant of an intensity of bodily effort the man had been purged of grossness moral and physical by toil in icy water and scorching sun and the light that shone out through his eyes was the brighter for the hardships he had undergone he had gained more than vigour while he swung the shovel and gripped the drill with hands that bled from the blundering hammer stroke after other mens work was done it is possible that he had also gained more than tenacity of will  still he said slowly i think i shall manage it  grace felt that this was likely she realized the purpose which animated him and there suddenly came upon her a desire that he should tell it to her she knew that he would do so when he felt the time was ripe but she wished to hear it now or at least to see how far his reticence would carry him she leaned forward a little and looked him steadily in the eyes  it will be a struggle she said is it worth while  ingleby stirred uneasily beneath her gaze for it seemed to him that she had brushed aside every distinction there might be between them he did not know how she had conveyed this impression but he felt it she was also very close to him as she moved the hem of her skirt had touched him and he felt the blood tingle in his veins  it would be worth dying for he said  grace laughed in a curious fashion the money and the envy of less fortunate men  ingleby stood up suddenly though he scarcely knew why he did so or how it came about that he yielded with scarcely a struggle now to the impulse that swept him away it is however possible that grace coulthurst who had only looked at him understood the reason  success would be worth nothing without another thing he said like what i have already the money wouldnt be mine you see i am not poor nowbut i should never have held on here by any strength of purpose that was in me alone i borrowed it from another person  he stopped abruptly halfafraid wondering what had happened to him that the truth should be wrung from him in this fashion then he saw the clear rose colour creep into the girls cheeks and the sudden softening of her eyes and his courage came back to him he had ventured too far to be silent now  yes he said there is somebody i owe everything toand its you  grace do longer looked at him but sat still now with hands clasped on her knees and ingleby felt the silence becoming intolerable there was still a murmur of voices in the adjoining room and he could hear the wind outside moaning among the pines  i suppose i have offended past forgiveness i did not mean to tell you this tonight he said  grace looked up for a moment oh she said softly i think i knewand you see i am not blaming you  ingleby quivered visibly and his face grew hot but while the desire to kneel beside her and seize the clasped hands was almost irresistible he stood still looking gravely down upon her which was perhaps not wise of him  you knew he said  is that so difficult to understand after what happened at alisons sault  ingleby bent down and took one of her hands but he did it very gently though the signs of the fierce restraint he laid upon himself were in his face  i should never have told you gracei lost my head he said still the one hope that has led me so far and will i think lead me farther has been that i mightone day when the time was ripeinduce you to listen and not send me away now it must be sufficient that you are not angry i can take no promise from you  is it worth so little grace said softly  inglebys grasp tightened on her hand until it grew almost painful it would he said be worth everything to me but i dare not take it now what i am you knowbut the claim is yielding welland i only want a little time until i can ask major coulthurst for you boldly you must be free  grace looked up at him and you  i said ingleby with a little grave smile was your very willing bondsman ever so long ago  the hot flush had faded from his face and the girl swept her skirt aside and made room for him beside her there was she knew no fear of his again breaking through the restraint he had laid upon himself she was however not altogether pleased at this for while it was evident that his attitude was warranted the selfcommand which now characterized it was not quite what she had expected it scarcely appeared natural under the circumstances  well she said we will let it be so and i have something to tell you i am going to vancouver for the winter in fact i should have left already but for the snow  ingleby started visibly you are going away  yes said grace with a trace of dryness in her smile is that very dreadful you will go away in due time too while you struggle for what you think will buy my favour i must wait patiently  i suppose i have deserved it and ingleby winced still it will be horribly hard to let you go it is a good deal to know that you are here even when i may not see you  grace smiled well she said if that would afford you any great satisfaction is there any reason why you should not go to vancouver too most of the placer miners do  inglebys glance at her suggested that the notion had not occurred to him regular work at the mine would be out of the question until the spring came round again and already several of the men were talking of leaving the valley he could also readily afford to spend a few months in vancouver now still there was one insuperable obstacle  if i had only kept my claim he said it is horribly unfortunate i let it go  how does that affect the question  i made a compact with tomlinson to hold his claim for him  once more the colour crept into graces face you do not mean to let that stop you when there are men you could hire to do what the law requires  you dont seem to understand and there was a trace of astonishment in inglebys eyes one could not depend absolutely upon them and i made a bargain with tomlinson that claim is worth everything to him and his motheri think it isback in oregon  the flush grew plainer in graces cheek she was a trifle imperious and now her will had clashed with one that was as resolute as it she was however sensible that she had blundered  those men could do almost as much as you could which would after all be very little just now she said i never meant that you should risk the claim falling in  they might fall sick or get hurt  and that might happen to you  i should at least have kept my word to tomlinson said ingleby gravely  grace was too proud to persist he was right of course but the fact that he would sooner part from her than incur the slightest risk of breaking faith with tomlinson had nevertheless its sting that however she would not show  then i suppose i must not complain she said you evidently have no intention of doing so  ingleby made a little gesture it will be hardbut it cant be helped he replied as you said i must go away too one day still i think that i at least will feel by and by that it was all worth while  then there was a tramp of feet in the adjoining room and he raised the hand he held and just touched it with his lips it was not what grace would have expected from him but she noticed that he did not do it awkwardly  that is all i ask until i have won my spurs he said just now i am only the squire of low degree  grace said nothing for the door opened and the major came in     xxiv  the unexpected happens   it was a bitterly cold night and hetty leger sat close to the fire which crackled on the big hearth in the bakery shanty it flung an uncertain radiance and pungent aromatic odours about the little room but there was no other light kerosene is unpleasantly apt to impart its characteristic flavour to provisions when jolted for leagues in company with them on the same packsaddle and the bringing of stores of any kind into the green river country was then a serious undertaking tom leger sat by the little table and sewell lay upon a kind of ottoman ingeniously extemporized out of sprucetwigs and provision bags  it was significant that they were assembled in what had been hettys private apartment for the bakery had grown and there were two other rooms attached to it now leger had also struck gold a little while ago and there was no longer any necessity for hetty to continue baking though she did so she said she had grown used to it and would sooner have something to do but it had seemed to leger that while everything was done with her customary neatness and system there was a change in her and he fancied she did her work more to keep herself occupied than because she took pleasure in it it had not been so once in fact the change had only become perceptible after ingleby left the bakery but leger was wise in some respects and made no sign that he noticed this  on that particular evening hetty had not displayed her usual tranquillity of temper and she turned to her brother with a little shiver  cant you put on some more wood its disgustingly cold she said if id known they had weather like this here id have stayed in vancouver  leger remembered that she had once professed herself perfectly contented with the green river country but he did not think it advisable to mention the fact he rose and flung an armful of wood upon the fire and then stood still smiling  you know you can go back there and stay through the winter if you would like to he said  thats nonsense said hetty how could i go myself you and your friends havent made everybody nice to everybody yet im not going anyway and if you worry me ill be cross  she looked up sharply and saw that sewells face was unnaturally grave  of course she said you were grinning at tom a moment ago still i cant help it if i am a very little cross just now its the coldand tom spoiled the last batch of bread it is cold isnt it if it hadnt been we shouldnt have seen you  i dont know why you should seem so sure of that said sewell  hetty looked at him sharply well she said i am you would have gone on to the majors you know you would what do you go there so often for  sewell had occasionally found hettys questions disconcerting but he saw that she expected an answer  i am rather fond of chess he said  hetty smiled incredulously thats rubbish  the major at least likes a game and after pulling him back into this wicked world from the edge of a gully one naturally feel that he owes him a little  you didnt pull him it was walter hadnt you better try again  sewell appeared a trifle embarrassed for he saw that leger was becoming interested  it is to some extent my business to understand the habits of the ruling classes he said reflectively you see its almost necessary unless i know a little about them how can i persuade anybody how far they are beneath us as im expected to do  hetty laughed well she said you havent tried to do anything of that kind for a long while now anyway it seems to me that you knew a good deal about them before you ever saw major coulthurst of course its not my business but if i were the major id make you tell me exactly what you were going there for  sewell apparently did not relish this though he laughed it happens occasionally that those most concerned in what is going on are the last to notice it and it had not occurred to coulthurst or ingleby that sewell spent his evenings at the gold commissioners dwelling frequently he had however not often met ingleby there and it was significant that neither of them ever mentioned grace coulthurst to the other in any case sewell did not answer and while they sat silent there was a tramp of feet outside and the corporal came in he was a taciturn and somewhat unsociable man but he smiled as he looked at hetty and sat down where the rude chimney tomlinson had built was between him and the one small window  its a bitter night and theres most four foot of snow on the range i figured id look in to tell you it will be two or three days yet before you get the flour the folks at the settlements are sending up he said a trooper has just come in with the mail and he left the freighter and his beasts held up by the snow  he stopped a moment and looked at leger somewhat curiously somebody has just gone away  no said leger we have had nobody here we are expecting ingleby but he hasnt turned up yet  quite sure hes not outside there  its scarcely likely its a little too cold for anybody to stay outside when he neednt ingleby would certainly come in  well said the corporal i guess i didnt see anybody after all it was quite dark anyway in among the trees winters shutting down on us most a month before it should have done its kind of fortunate we sent the horses out when we did i dont know what they wanted to bring them for nobody has any use for horses in this country  it was evident that the worthy corporal was bent on getting away from what he felt to be an awkward topic and hetty laughed outright at his quite unnecessary delicacy  no she said you know you saw somebody and fancied it was one of the boys waiting to see me  the corporal appeared embarrassed but was wise enough not to involve himself further well he said when i was coming along the trail i saw a man slip in behind a cedar that kind of struck me as not the usual thing and i went round the other way to meet him it was quite a big tree and when i got around he wasnt there you keep the dust you get for the bread in the shanty leger  yes said leger most of the boys who come here know where it is i really dont think there is any reason why they shouldnt either  no said the corporal reflectively i guess there isnt ill say that for them still i did see somebody  he contrived to glance round at the faces of the rest unnoticed by any of them except hetty and was satisfied that they knew no more than he did the corporal had been a long while a policeman and had quick perceptions he decided to look into the matter later  well he said i guess its not worth worrying over  he drew a little closer to the fire and nobody said anything for a minute or two though hetty glanced towards the little window the room was dim except when a blaze sprang up and turning suddenly she stirred the fire and then for no very apparent reason set herself to listen the bush outside was very still and she could hear the frostdried snow fall softly from a branch then there was a sharp snapping of resinous wood in the fire and it was not until that died away she heard a sound again it was very faint and suggested a soft crunching down of powdery snow nobody else seemed to hear it not even the corporal who was apparently examining a rent in his tunic just then and she had almost persuaded herself that she had fancied it when she glanced towards the window again a flickering blaze was roaring up the chimney now  then a little shiver ran through her and closing her hands tight she stared at the glass in horror a face was pressed against it a drawn grey face that seemed awry with pain there was however something that reminded her of somebody in it and she was about to cry out when she felt a hand laid restrainingly on her arm glancing over her shoulder she saw that her brother was also gazing at the window and then she knew suddenly to whom the face belonged it had gone when she looked round again and it was evident that neither sewell nor the corporal had seen it unfortunately it appeared very unlikely that the man outside could have seen the latter and she knew that something must be done or in another moment or two prospector tomlinson would walk into the arms of the policeman leger appeared incapable of suggesting anything and was gazing at her with apprehension in his eyes  it was a singularly unpleasant moment hetty was aware that she and her brother owed tomlinson a good deal and in any case it would be particularly distasteful to see him arrested she was also by no means certain that her brother and sewell would permit it and the corporal was a heavilybuilt man it very seldom happens that a northwest policeman lets a prisoner go and hetty was quite aware that the result of a struggle might be disastrous to everybody she realized this in a flash and then there was a sound of shuffling feet outside in the snow they were approaching the doorway and she knew it would be flung open in another moment or two then the inspiration came suddenly  theres somebody outside she said and laughed as she noticed the bewildered consternation in her brothers eyes if its ingleby i dont think ill let him in  her voice was almost as steady as usual and apparently leger alone noticed the suggestion of strain in it while next moment she crossed the room and threw the door open it was narrow however and she stood carefully in the middle of it  youre not coming in walter until you cut some wood she said you never touched the axe the last time you came  hettys nerve almost failed her during the next few moments and she felt the throbbing of her heart while the man the others could not see blinked at her stupidly she dare venture no plainer warning and he was apparently dazed with cold and weariness  im not going to stand here its too cold she said if youre too lazy to do what i tell you ill ask the corporal  then she banged the door to and went back to her seat with a little laugh that sounded slightly hollow to her brother at least  if theres one thing walter doesnt like its chopping woodand thats why i wouldnt let him off she said he hasnt troubled to come round and see me for a week im vexed with him  now the corporal was of course aware that throughout most of western canada visitors to a homestead not infrequently lighten their hostesss labour by washing the dishes or carrying wood in the case of the miners who were pleased to spend an hour at the bakery chopping wood for the oven was the most obvious thing though those specially favoured were now and then permitted to weigh out flour or knead the bread there was thus nothing astonishing in what hetty had apparently said to ingleby nor did sewell who provoked the corporal into an attempt to prove that the troopers carbine was a more efficient weapon than the miners marlin rifle appear to notice anything unusual and only leger saw that hettys colour was fainter than it had been and that she was quivering a little  in the meanwhile there was a tramp of feet outside which grew less distinct until the ringing chunk of the axe replaced it and leger wondered how he could make sewell understand that it was desirable to cut the discussion short he could think of no means of doing it and glanced at hetty anxiously for how long the corporal meant to stay was becoming a somewhat momentous question a man accustomed to the axe can split a good deal of wood in ten minutes even when he works by moonlight and it was evident that the one outside could not continue his chopping indefinitely without the corporals wondering what was keeping him  ten minutes passed and the regular thud of the axe rang through the forest outside while the corporal who was a persistent man still discussed extractors and magazine springs leger felt the tension becoming intolerable then hetty contrived to catch sewells attention and looking at him steadily set her lips tight the corporal had as it happened turned from the girl but she saw a gleam of comprehension in sewells eyes  well he said reflectively i suppose you are right i like the easier pulloff of the american rifles one is less apt to shake the sights off the mark but no doubt with men accustomed to the handling of rifled weapons as the police troopers are the little extra pull required is no great matter  the corporal was evidently gratified ive shown quite a few men they were wrong on that point and now i guess i must be getting on youll excuse me miss leger  he put on his furcoat and opened the door but hettys heart throbbed again when he stopped a moment as it happened the fire was flashing brilliantly and the corporal appeared to be looking down at the footprints by the threshold  ive seen ingleby twice since the snow came and he was wearing gumboots he said the man who was outside here had playedout leather ones on  walter has an old pair he wore until lately said leger theres a good deal of sharp grit in the tomlinson mine and hed probably come along in the boots he went down in  this appeared reasonable and the corporal made a little gesture as though to show that he concurred in it and then stepping forward disappeared into the night sewell rose and shut the door and then glanced at hetty who stood quivering a little in the middle of the room  i fancy one of you has something to tell me he said  hetty gasped oh she said i thought he meant to stay until morning it was getting awful tom  then she looked at sewell dont you know she said its tomlinson  now said sewell whose astonishment was evident i think i understand there can scarcely be many girls capable of doing what you have done  hetty made a little sign of impatience yes there arelots of them of course you think all women are sillyyoure only a man besides tom pinched me but why are you stopping here and talking go and bring him  both leger and sewell went and tomlinson came back with them he was haggard and ragged and his thin jean garments were hard with the frozen snowdust he dropped into the nearest chair and blinked at them  yes he said im here and most starving get me something to eat and ill try to tell you  they gave him what they had and he ate ravenously while hettys eyes softened as she watched him  you have had a hard time she said  yes answered the man slowly i guess i had i got stuck up in the range couldnt make anything of the gorge in the loose snow tried to crawl up over the ice track and dropped through burst the packstraps getting out and dont know where most of the grub and one blanket went to it was the bigger packet that was why i had to come back i dont quite know how i made the valley  when did you lose the grub asked sewell  tomlinson shook his head i dont quite know he said i guess it must have been most three weeks ago  leger looked at sewell for that was quite sufficient to give point to the bald narrative  what was in the smaller package would scarcely keep a man in health a week he said im not going to keep you talking tomlinson butalthough its fortunate you did sowhy did you stop outside instead of coming in  i saw a man said tomlinson i figured it wouldnt be wise to show myself until i was sure of him then when i crawled up to the shanty i didnt seem to remember anything i only wanted to get in  he stopped and looked at leger i cant push on tonightim most usedup but im not going to stay here and make trouble for you ill light out again tomorrow  you are going to lie down and sleep now said hetty severely well decide what is the wisest thing to do tomorrow but you shant leave the shanty for a day or two anyway no im not going to listen to anything hes to sleep in the store tom  tomlinson appeared desirous of protesting but leger laid a hand on his shoulder and led him into an outbuilt room     xxv  tomlinson gets away   the early canadian supper had been cleared away and sewell was sitting with grace coulthurst opposite him by the little stove in the inner room of the gold commissioners dwelling as he had done somewhat frequently of late the major was apparently occupied with his business in the adjoining room for they could hear a rustle of papers and now and then the shutting of a book through the door which stood partly open he closed one a trifle noisily and the next moment his voice reached them  this thing has kept me longer than i expected but i must get it finished before i stop esmonds sending a trooper off first thing tomorrow he said still i shall not be much longer and then well get out the chess  coulthurst had spoken loudly and as sewell and grace did not raise their voices it appeared probable that he could not hear what they were saying sewell smiled as he glanced at the girl  i am not particularly impatient or sorry for major coulthurst though one could fancy that his dislike of official correspondence is quite as strong as his fondness for chess he knows exactly what he has to do and does it without having to trouble about the results which in his case concern the crown that naturally simplifies ones outlook  the major said grace reflectively has arrived at an age when one does not expect too much and is content with the obvious which is certainly an advantage  and we being younger are different in that respect  grace was a trifle disconcerted which occasionally happened when sewell talked to her though she looked at him with a little smile in her eyes it was at least not very clear to her why she found it pleasant to discuss such questions with him in a confidential voice when she had to all intents and purposes plighted herself to ingleby sewell was always deferential but there was something in his attitude which suggested personal admiration for her though she was not quite sure that the vague word liking was not a little nearer the mark how far that liking went she did not know but while she had no intention of allowing it in any way to prejudice her regard for ingleby sewell was she knew of subtler and more complex nature and the craving for influence was strong in her she knew what under any given circumstances ingleby would probably do and though this was satisfactory in one respect it had its disadvantages she had long been troubled with a fondness for probing into masculine thoughts and emotions and it pleased her to find an opportunity for directing them which was not often afforded her in inglebys case his programme was usually cut and dried and it was as a rule an almost exasperatingly simple one  i suppose we are she said when i know what is expected of me i usually want to do something else  now sewell was not aware how matters stood between her and his comrade but he might have guessed what she was thinking for his next remark was curiously apposite  im not sure that the obvious people are not the most fortunate he said with a little laugh they know exactly what they want which not infrequently means that what they have to do to get it is equally plain it must necessarily save them a good many perplexities now take the case of my very obvious comrade ingleby  well  ingleby wants to make a fortune placer mining  which is from your point of view a most reprehensible thing  sewell laughed that is not quite the point perhaps he means to do good with it and it ought to be quite plain that ingleby has no real sympathy with communist notions in any case he sets about it in the simplest fashion by working most of every day and often half the night as well the result is that he has acquired what is apparently a competence and is more or less contented with everything any one can see it in the way he looks at you lately  grace smiled for it was evident that there were directions in which sewells penetration was defective  the fortune will probably come later she said and then  yes said sewell with a little gesture of comprehension since he has made his mind up he will i fancy manage that too ingleby is that kind of person then if he does not do so sooner he will naturally marry hetty leger  grace turned to him sharply and then directed his attention to the fact that the door at the bottom of the stove admitted rather too much draught he was a moment or two adjusting it and when he looked up again she was smiling indifferently  you are sure of that she said  i think so ingleby invariably does the obvious thing and she is eminently suited to him im not sure he recognizes it yet but it will certainly become evident and then he will save himself and everybody trouble by marrying her offhand  grace sat silent for almost a minute it was perfectly clear that sewell did not know what his comrades aspirations were even as ingleby did not know how far her acquaintance with sewell went she was not altogether displeased that it should be so though she felt that it would after all make no great change in their relations to each other had they been aware she did not desire sewell as a lover though it was pleasant to feel that he valued her approbation and that she had his confidence  there are of course advantages in doing the obvious thing she said with a little laugh i suppose we are really different from ingleby in that respect  sewell looked at her reflectively i think you are one could almost fancy you wanted so many things that you couldnt quite decide which was the most important and give up the rest the difficulty is that we cant very often have them all you see  it seemed to grace that there was some truth in this you she said speak feelinglyas though it were from sympathy  well said sewell with a curious little smile perhaps i do in fact im not sure im not diagnosing my own case a little while ago i had a purpose and believed in it though the belief naturally cost me a good deal  the creation of a new utopia out of the wreck of the present social fabric asked grace a trifle maliciously  something of the kind though i did not expect to do it all myself while i was sure the thing was feasible the fact that i was or so i felt taking a little share in bringing it about was sufficient for me now however i am not quite so sure on any point as i used to be which is why i often envy ingleby  grace felt a little thrill of satisfaction he had of course spoken vaguely but she wondered how far she was responsible for the change in the opinions which he had held until a little while ago she knew that he had borne a good deal because of them for ingleby had told her so  then there may be a little good in a few of our institutions as they stand she said  of course answered sewell who smiled again most of them are however capable of improvement i am quite as sure of that as ever the question is whether anybody would gain much if it were effected too rudely  grace was not greatly interested in the point she preferred a more personal topic but she saw an opportunity for trying how far her influence went it had been a trifle painful to find that ingleby had not yielded to it when she had desired him to spend the winter in vancouver and leave somebody else to hold tomlinsons claim sewell was she recognized a cleverer man than he and it would be consoling if he showed himself more amenable  i think notat least so far as anybody in the green river country is concerned she said it seems to me that its tranquillity depends a good deal on you  on me  grace smiled of course you know it as well as i do wouldnt it be better for your friends to put up with a few little grievances rather than run the risk of bringing a worse thing upon themselves  would we do that  i think so the major is a lenient commissioner and the law would be too strong for you  sewell laughed that he said would have to be proved and i am not sure it is a good reason you are offering me  grace nodded no she said perhaps it isnt you rather like opposition dont you still i think one could leave it to your good sense while i would especially like to see all quiet this winter in the green river valley that however could of course scarcely be thought a reason at all  sewell made no disclaimer but he looked at her with a curious intensity  events he said slowly may be too strong for me and when i am sure they are right i cannot go counter to my opinions  of course and the girl leaned forward a little nearer him resting one hand on the arm of her chair that is more than i would ever ask of you still perhaps you could  sewell looked at her gravely and laid his hand upon the one that rested on the chair  i will he said quietly with that one reservation do whatever appears most likely to preserve tranquillity  grace did not shake his grasp off as she should have done indeed a little thrill of triumph ran through her as she realized the significance of what had happened the man who held her hand fast had borne imprisonment for his beliefs and had also braved hostile mobs hired bravos and detachments of us cavalry and now she had made him captive with a smile it was from one point of view a notable achievement and it did not dawn on her that if regarded from another point what she had done might wear a different aspect just then a book in the other room was closed with a bang and grace drew her hand away as coulthurst came in  sorry to leave you alone so long but we can get the chessmen out at last he said  sewell set out the pieces and grace who flashed a little smile at him which implied that there was now a confidence between them took up a book as it happened neither of them knew that prospector tomlinson was plodding down the trail that led south through leagues of forest and snowblocked defiles towards the settlements just then though the fact had its results for both of them  a halfmoon hung low above the white shoulder of a hill and here and there a shaft of silvery light shone down upon the snowy trail which wound in and out through the gloom of the firs tomlinson was one of the simpleminded persons who content themselves with doing the obvious thing and as it was quite plain to him that he could not stay at the bakery without probability of being discovered and getting his hosts into trouble he had in spite of hettys protests persisted in setting out for the settlements though he was still scarcely capable of the journey and it had been pointed out that there was a likelihood of his falling in with the police troopers the latter fact did not however so far as tomlinson could see affect the question the one thing that was clear to him was that he could not permit hetty and tom leger to involve themselves in difficulties  he carried two rolledup blankets and a good many pounds of provisions as well as a marlin rifle for it was a very long way to the settlements and the snow was deep in the passes he also walked slowly and with an effort for the strength he had exhausted had scarcely come back to him yet while the dusty snow balled beneath his wornout boots  the bush was very still for only a low murmur came up across the pines from the rapids which were free of ice the trees rose above him solid spires of blackness cut sharp against the white hillside beyond them and tomlinson was glad of their shadow because the corporal and one of the troopers had gone down the trail that afternoon and uncertain whether they had come back he had no wish to meet them it is scarcely likely that he would have done so for he had an excellent sense of hearing and was making very little noise had not a trooper stopped to do something to his newlyissued winter coat which did not fit him comfortably he spent some little time over it as it was necessary to take his big mittens off and the corporal improved the occasion by sitting down on a fallen tree to light his pipe they were both a little outside the trail and in black shadow  tomlinson in the meanwhile came to an open space some two or three score yards across there were black firs all about it but the snow among them seemed deeper and as he could hear nothing but the murmur of the river he made haste to cross it it appeared advisable that nobody should see him he had almost reached the gloom of the firs again when he heard a little scraping sound not unlike that the rubbing of a sulphur match would make and he stood still listening until a faint blue radiance appeared amidst the trees and then he moved towards the nearest undergrowth with long and almost noiseless strides in another moment he stopped abruptly and a man in uniform who came out from the dark gap of the trail also stopped and appeared to gaze at him he carried a carbine the men were close together and the moon which had just cleared the dark firtops shone down on both of them the miners face as the policeman saw was drawn and grim  tomlinson he gasped and then appeared to shake his astonishment from him stop right where you are  tomlinson said nothing but springing forward hurled himself into the undergrowth which opened with a crash and then closed behind him while the trooper who glanced over his shoulder as if to see where the corporal was wasted another moment then he too sped across the little gap in the forest floundering through loose snow and fell into a barberry bush which held him fast so far fortune had favoured tomlinson but as he flitted through the bush looking for a little byetrail which he knew was near the corporal appeared suddenly from behind a tree and threw his carbine up  hold on he said ive something to say to you  a stray gleam of moonlight that shone down just there flung a patch of brightness athwart the snow and tomlinson could see the white face pressed down upon the carbinestock but he did not pull up instead he leapt into the shadow and in another second there was a pale flash and a sharp detonation rang among the trunks then he whipped behind a tree and seeing two men close behind him now flung up his rifle in his country a man who is shot at usually considers himself warranted in retaliating and tomlinson was accustomed to the rifle in fact he handled it much as an english sportsman does a gun by the balance of it and with an instinctive sense of direction which did not necessitate the aligning of the sights the result of this was that as the butt came home to his shoulder the trooper dropped his carbine with a cry and tomlinson sprang away once more through the smoke he might have got away altogether but the corporal could shoot as well as he could and a few seconds later the fugitive felt a stinging pain in one shoulder  he staggered but recovered himself again and running a few yards farther dropped into a thicket and wriggled under it on his hands and knees then while an unpleasant faintness crept over him he felt for the long knife which the prospector uses for cutting up an occasional deer it did not appear advisable to snap another cartridge into the riflebreech just then and the knife would prove equally serviceable if his pursuers crawled into the thicket after him prospector tomlinson was like most of the men who sojourn in that wilderness a little primitive in his notions and the troopers had fired on him  one of them made a good deal of noise floundering through a belt of undergrowth just then and only stopped when the corporal called to him  wheres that blame branchtrail he asked  its right here said the trooper i guess our mans lit out along it  time was of some consequence and the corporal did not deem it advisable to stop and consider a man floundering through the undergrowth would he reasoned be heard a long way off while a bushman could proceed with very little noise along a beaten track thus as he could hear nothing it appeared very probable that tomlinson had taken the latter he and the trooper pushed on along it for awhile but there was no sign of the prospector and they came back moodily to where they had last seen him and proceeded to search every thicket in the vicinity they spent at least an hour over it but there was still no appearance of tomlinson and at last the corporal sat down disgustedly upon the fallen fir  i feel most certain i plugged him once he said what dyou let go your carbine for  the trooper held the weapon up in the moonlight and glanced at the grey smear down the barrel then he held up his left hand which was stained with red  im not quite sure if the top of one of my fingers is on or not he said anyway my mittens full of blood  the corporal nodded curtly i guess it will grow again he said well it seems to me nobody could do anything more tonight well pick his trail up soon as its daylight then they shook the powdery snow from them and plodded on towards the outpost     xxvi  the obvious thing   the stars were paling overhead and the snow that cut against the sky was growing white again but it was very cold among the pines where leger was busy about the crackling fire a column of smoke rose slowly straight up into the nipping air and the blaze flickered redly upon the clustering trunks while the sound of an unfrozen rapid broke faintly through the snapping of the fire leger who felt his fingers stiffening took up his axe and the rhythmic thudding rang sharply in the stillness of the woods when hetty appeared in the door of the shanty shadowy and shapeless in the coarse blanket she had thrown about her shoulders she shivered a little as she looked around her  it has been a bitter nightthe cold woke me when the fire got low she said tomlinson must have felt it horribly i wonder where hes getting his breakfast you shouldnt have let him go  leger laughed and leaned upon his axe i couldnt have stopped him and i dont think you need worry the cold is scarcely likely to hurt himhes used to it he is probably three or four leagues away down the trail by now  that isnt very far  its tolerably good travelling in this country besides nobody except sewell and ingleby has the faintest notion that he was here  hetty appeared reflective i wasnt quite sure about the corporal that night hes too quiet and has eyes all over him still i suppose tomlinson has got awayof course he must have done so his running away would look very bad if they did get hold of him isnt that kettle boiling tom  leger stooped above the fire and then straightening himself suddenly stood still listening he could hear the sound of the rapid and nothing else for a moment or two until a crackle of undergrowth came out of the gloom below then there was a tramp of footsteps coming up the trail and hetty turned to him sharply  tom she said with a little gasp who can it be  leger laid down the kettle he held in his hand the troopers im afraid he said  the light was growing clearer and they could see each others faces hettys was flushed and apprehensive legers portentously quiet  theyve come for tomlinson she said tom do you know why he threw probyn in the creek  i fancy i could guess tomlinson however never mentioned it  he wouldnt and hetty gasped again tom ill never forgive you if you let the troopers know anything about him  i really dont think that was necessary said leger with a faint dry smile  hetty clenched one hand tight oh she said cant we run away  leger turned and pointed to a shadowy figure that materialized out of the gloom among the trees below there were others behind it and the two stood still watching them as they came quickly up the trail then they stopped at a sharp word and a man in a big furcoat stepped forward hetty had no difficulty in recognizing him as esmond  are you willing to tell me where prospector tomlinson is it would be the wisest thing he said  i dont think that is quite the point answered leger quietly you see i dont know  then ill ask you where he went when he left here last night  you fancy he was here  esmond made a little sign of impatience i should like to warn you that a good deal depends upon the way you answer me you probably know that the person who hides a murderer or connives at his escape is liable to be tried as an accessory  leger stood silent a moment or two it seemed rather more than probable that esmond had only supposed it likely that tomlinson had visited the bakery but that did not greatly matter after all his course was clear and that was to allow the officer to believe as long as possible that tomlinson was in the vicinity every minute gained would be worth a good deal to the fugitive  i scarcely think i need worry myself about that he said you see before you could charge me as an accessory you would have to prove that tomlinson really killed probyn its tolerably clear that you cant have a trial without a prisoner and i dont mind admitting that tomlinson isnt here  esmond smiled unpleasantly and signed to one of the troopers who went into the shanty he certainly isnt very far away i have no doubt you could tell me where he would make for but you do not seem to know that he was shot and we have reason to believe badly wounded within a league of your house last night  it was growing light now and he saw the sudden horror in hettys eyes  if you have any control over your brother miss leger i think it would be wise for you to use it he said you would not like him to get himself into trouble  hetty straightened herself a little if he knew where tomlinson was and told you id be ashamed of him foreverbut he doesnt she said  esmond glanced at her sharply she stood very straight regarding him with a set white face and it was evident that she was resolute then he turned to leger  are you willing to expose your sister to a very serious charge he asked  again leger stood silent but when he glanced at her a little flash showed in hettys eyes  you darent disgrace us both remember it was all my fault she said  then leger turned to the officer i do not know where tomlinson is that is all i have to tell you  esmond raised his hand then i arrest you both for concealing prospector tomlinson and contriving his escape you will hand them over to robertson at the outpost trooper grieve and then come on after us as fast as you can i dont wish to submit either of you to any indignity leger unless you are likely to make it necessary  legers face turned crimson but he made a little sign of comprehension we will make no attempt to get away  esmond signed to the trooper who pointed somewhat shamefacedly to the shadowy path among the pines as he swung his carbine to the trail then hetty and leger moved on in front of him while esmond and the others vanished into the bush it was almost daylight now and the troopers spent some time tracing tomlinsons footsteps between the trunks they also found the thicket where he had flung himself down but that after all told them very little and both the byetrail and the larger one were tramped too hard for his wornout boots to leave any recognizable impression  it was however evident that tomlinson could have adopted only one of two courses if he had escaped uninjured he would certainly head for the settlements along the beaten trail down which a trooper had been sent already but no wounded man could face that arduous journey and assuming that the corporals shot had taken effect he would as a matter of course be lurking somewhere in the valley in that case the trailing of him could only be a question of a day or two for even if he could face the bitter frost in the open he must have food and there would be no difficulty in tracing the footsteps of any one who brought it to him the one question was whether tomlinson was badly hurt and as the corporal who fancied so could not be quite sure esmond pushed on southwards along the trail if tomlinson had not headed in that direction he was in the valley and if so he certainly could not get away  as a matter of fact he was just then lying weak from loss of blood in a little decrepit shanty on an abandoned claim he had contrived to reach one of the miners dwellings late the previous night though he was never quite sure how he accomplished it and fell in across the threshold when its astonished owner opened the door the man however kept his head and within an hour tomlinson was carried to the claim in one of the more distant gorges where it appeared a little less likely that esmond would lay hands on him now he was huddled halfsensible in his blanket upon a pile of cedar twigs with ingleby and a young american who had just dug out a carbinebullet which had badly smashed his shoulderblade sitting by his side ingleby did not know whether his companion was a qualified surgeon but he had at least contrived to cut out the bullet and stanch the wound he appeared a trifle anxious about his patient  the shock would have dropped a man raised in the cities right off but i think well pull him round he said still its not going to be done in a day or two  the fact was very evident and ingleby nodded how long do you think it will be before he can walk again he said  a month anyway and quite likely six weeks that is before you could let him start out on the trail i dont quite know what were going to do with him in the meanwhile  tomlinson who appeared to understand him looked up with his face awry  youre not going to do anything he said halfcoherently ill give myself up i cant stay here and make trouble for the boys  you go to sleep said the other man severely and made a little sign to ingleby who sat silent for a minute or two after tomlinson sank back again on the twigs  thats just the point he said the boys dont mean to let the police have him  no and inglebys manner suggested that the subject was not worth discussion they wouldnt think of it for a minute id have nothing more to do with them if they did  the american nodded well he said i can pull the man round but im not going to answer for what will happen if the troopers get hold of him hes tough but he wants looking after and theres no one at the outpost knows more than enough to pull a stone out of a cayuses hoof  you can take out a bullet anyway said ingleby suggestively  oh yes id have had quite a nice practice by this time if it had been convenient for me to stay in connecticut as it happened it wasnt  ingleby looked at him steadily tomlinson he said is a friend of mine and that of course implies an obligation you so far as i know have had very little to do with him and it seems only reasonable to warn you that you may get yourself into serious trouble by looking after him the law is generally carried out in our country  the american laughed i can take my chances im not going back on a sick man anyway  they said nothing more for awhile until a man who had apparently been running came in  wheres sewell he gasped  i dont know said ingleby he wasnt at home this morning most likely hes looking for a deer  then i guess youll have to do esmond has trailed tomlinson to the bakery he has got hetty and tom leger at the outpost now  ingleby rose suddenly to his feet youre quite sure  well said the other i guess i ought to be i met them trooper grieve didnt stop their talking and they told me esmond tried to bluff where tomlinson was out of them and theyre to stand in with him as accessories  it was evident to ingleby that since sewell was away a heavy responsibility devolved upon him as a friend of tomlinson and leger he was expected to do something and as usual he did the obvious thing without counting what it would cost him  where is esmond he asked  hitting the trail to the settlements all hes worth said the other man  then go round and let the boys know what you have told me they can meet outside ransomes shanty the dinnerhour will do ill be there to meet them  the man went out and at the time appointed ingleby stood outside a little hut of bark and logs with a crowd of bronzefaced men about him they were somewhat silent but their manner was quietly resolute it suggested that their minds were made up and that they were only waiting for a leader in whom they had confidence ingleby had gained their liking but he was young and they were not quite sure whether he would be the man or whether they must choose another in the meanwhile they were willing to give him a hearing it was evident that he was equal to the occasion when he stepped forward and looked at them with steady eyes  boys he said do any of you believe tomlinson killed trooper probyn  there was a general murmur of dissent and ingleby made a little sign of concurrence are you willing to let the troopers have him you must remember that the thing looks bad against him and he will not be tried by you  the murmurs were articulate now and it was very clear that not a man there had the least intention of giving up tomlinson  then it should be quite plain that you will have to keep the troopers from him it is only a question of a day or two at the longest before they trail him they may do it tonight esmond will very soon find out that he isnt pushing on in front of him for the settlements  a big man stood forward and glanced at the rest theres not a trooper in this valley going to lay hands on tomlinson  again the murmurs rose portentously and ingleby smiled  well he said since the trouble cant be shuffled off we may as well face it now we have got to make a stand and maintain it until esmond finds he has to humour us he has leger and his sister in the outpost do you know any reason why we shouldnt take them out  i guess not said the man who had spoken already still if theres any shooting two or three of us are going to smell trouble as well as tomlinson  there will not be any said ingleby esmond has only two men at the outpost nobody wants to hurt them the thing can be done without it in fact thats essential i want three or four determined men  they were forthcoming but one of the rest asked a question  have you figured whats going to happen when esmond comes back he said  i have said ingleby he will have a handful of tolerably active men under his orders then but only a handful after all now the outposts outside the cañon and theres a spot where a log barricade would effectively block the trail the troopers will have to be kept outside it until we can arrive at a compromise esmond will probably make it it would be two months anyway before he could get more troopers in and if theres another heavy snowfall it mightnt be done till spring  none of those who listened could find fault with the scheme it was evidently workable and they had already decided that tomlinson was not to be given up at any cost that as ingleby had pointed out would necessarily involve them in difficulties with the police there was thus very little further discussion and the men went back a trifle thoughtfully to their work until the evening  it seemed to most of them a long while coming and to none of them slower than it did to hetty leger who sat with her brother in a very little logwalled room at the outpost as dusk was closing down tom leger glancing at her as she sat huddled in a chair by the window fancied that she was crying  why did we come here tom she said everything has gone wrong since we left vancouver  the outlook certainly isnt very cheerful just now said leger with a rueful smile still after all you made a good many dollars at the bakery and my claim is doing well ingleby will see that while im kept here the work is carried on one can put up with a good deal of inconvenience when hes washing out golddust  dollars said hetty and golddust is there nothing else worth having  well said leger drily when you have no prospect of getting it its as well to content oneself with dollars if i remember rightly you used to think a good deal of a shilling in england  hetty glanced at him sharply with hazy eyes what do you mean byno prospect of getting it  i dont quite know you suggested the notion anyway i scarcely think esmond can make out very much of a case against us he doesnt really know that tomlinson was at the bakery  it isnt that thats worrying me itseverything said hetty  i dont think you need cry over tomlinson the boys will take care of him  i wasnt crying about tomlinson in fact im not sure i was crying at all still you see it was all my fault  leger smiled whimsically well he said i scarcely think that should afford you any great satisfaction though it almost seems to do so no doubt its part of a girls nature to make trouble of the kind  hetty closed one hand im going to be angry in a minute thats not the way to talk to any one whos feelingwhat i am just now  leger rose and patted her shoulder id sooner see you raging than looking as you do shake the mood off hetty it isnt in the least like you  hetty said nothing but turned from him and looked out of the little window a young trooper was leaning over the rude balustrade of the veranda and beyond him the sombre pines rolled down the darkening valley night had not quite fallen yet though a halfmoon that showed red and frosty was growing brighter above the white shoulder of a hill another trooper was apparently busy in the adjoining room for they could hear his footsteps as he moved but that was the only sound then a face rose suddenly into sight above the floor of the veranda where the trooper could not see it it was a horrible grey face and hetty shrank back while her chair grated harshly on the floor in another moment tom legers hand closed tightly on her arm  keep still he said its a masked man i fancy the boys have come for us  hetty looked again and saw that a strip of deerhide with holes cut in it was tied across the face then she became sensible that there was something suggestively familiar in the attitude of the man who moving noiselessly raised himself erect and stood watching the trooper whose back was towards him  oh she gasped its walter  be quiet said leger and the grasp upon her arm grew tighter  another face appeared between the rails but the first man had already swung one leg over them and in another moment he sprang forward along the veranda the trooper heard him and swung round but even as he did so the newcomer flung his arms about him and they reeled together down the little stairway then the second trooper flung open the door but as he ran out of it two or three men who had apparently crept into the veranda grappled with him and hetty could hear them tumbling up and down the adjoining room then there was a brief silence until somebody burst open the door of the room in which she was shut a masked man who strode in grasped her shoulder and she struggled vainly as he drew her towards the door  i wont go it will only get you into worse trouble she said  the man laughed if i had to face it all my life do you think i would leave you here  hetty recognized the tension in his voice and something that seemed to answer it thrilled in her but she still protested and the man who flung an arm about her waist swung her off her feet he did not let her go until he set her down flushed and gasping among the pines outside  then she laughed im not sure you could have done that in england walter  no said ingleby anyway you wouldnt have let me but we cant stop to talk now esmond may come back at any time and there is a good deal to do he turned from her suddenly you have got those fellows carbines  oh yes said another man wed better bring along their cartridges and heave them in the river too we havent hurt either of them much considering  ingleby signed to the rest though he still held hettys arm now he said the sooner we light out of this the better it will be for everybody     xxvii  the blockade   the moon was high above the white peaks and a stinging frost was in the air when ingleby and leger sat a little apart from a snapping fire behind a great redwood trunk that had been felled across the trail in the constricted entrance to the cañon it was wide of girth and lay supported on the stumps of several splintered branches breasthigh above the soil with the rest of its spreading limbs piled about it in tremendous ruin on the side where the fire was some of them had been hewn away and a handful of men lounged smoking in the hollow between them and the trunk another man stood upon the tree apparently looking down the valley with his figure cutting blackly against the blueness of the night  sewell leaned against a shattered branch a few feet away from ingleby gazing about him reflectively he noticed that the great butt of the fir was jammed against the slope of rock that ran up overhead too steep almost for the snow to rest upon it and that the top of the tree was in the river some twenty yards away the stream frothed and roared about it in a wild white rapid though long spears of crackling ice stretched out behind the boulders and there was a tremendous wall of rock on the farther side it was absolutely unscalable and from the crest of it ranks of clinging pines rolled backwards up a slope that was almost as steep  it was evident that nobody coming from the police outpost or the commissioners dwelling could approach the fallen tree except by the trail in front and on that side the branches formed an entanglement an agile man would have some difficulty in scrambling through even if nobody desired to prevent him while two or three of the men beside the fire had rifles with them the rest had axes sewell who noticed all this glanced towards them thoughtfully he could not see their faces but their silence had its significance and there was a vague suggestion of resolution in their attitudes most of them were men of singularly unyielding temperament who had grappled with hard rock and primeval forest from their youth up  it is a tolerably strong position and its the strength of it that particularly pleases me he said if there were any prospect of his getting in esmond would no doubt try it as it is he will probably find it advisable to stop outside and compromise  im glad youre satisfied said leger still its a little unfortunate you were not here this morning in that case we might have found some other means of getting over the difficulty though im not sure that there was any  ingleby glanced sharply at leger his face was clear in the moonlight and it was expressionless but his tone had been suggestively dry and for just a moment an unpleasant fancy flashed upon ingleby it was certainly unfortunate that sewell whom everybody looked to for guidance had been away that day and the fact might have had significance for any one who doubted him ingleby however had unshaken confidence in the man and thrust the thought from him sewell smiled as he turned to leger  i was looking for a deer he said anyway you had ingleby  ingleby said leger is usually where hes wanted some men have that habit its a useful one though im afraid i havent acquired it in fact i fancy im rather like trooper probyn he was addicted to turning up just when it would have been better for everybody if he had stayed away  he turned from them somewhat abruptly and strolled towards the men about the fire while sewell looked thoughtful as he filled his pipe  leger doesnt appear to be in a particularly pleasant mood but hes right in one respect he said it would have been a good deal better if he and hetty had been anywhere else when esmond turned up at the bakery of course they couldnt help it but the result of it is going to be serious it is not exactly convenient that the thing should have happened now  ingleby made a gesture of comprehension as he glanced towards the men about the fire their big axes gleamed suggestively and the rifle of the man upon the tree twinkled coldly where the moonlight rested on the line of barrel  its all of it unfortunate he said deprecatingly i suppose im responsiblebut i dont quite see what else anybody could have expected me to do i couldnt leave hetty in esmonds hands it was out of the question the police wouldnt have much difficulty in making her out an accessory  sewell smiled that was all that occurred to you  yes said ingleby i think so i dont seem to remember anything else anyway it was sufficient  he made a little forceful gesture which suggested even more plainly than what he said that the thought of leaving hetty exposed to any peril was intolerable  and you inconsequently decided to put up a bluff of this kind on the british nation because esmond might involve in difficulties a girl with whom you are not in love im presuming you are not in love with her  ingleby seemed a trifle disconcerted no he said sharply of course im not what made you suggest it  sewell laughed well he said for one thing if you had been in love with her you could scarcely have done anything that would have made the fact clearer  there was silence for a minute or two and ingleby leaned upon the tree with his thoughts in confusion he was not in love with hetty leger but it was certainly a fact that her arrest had filled him with an almost unaccountable consternation he also remembered the curious little laugh with which she had clung to him and that it had stirred him as no trifling favour grace coulthurst had ever shown him had done the commissioners daughter had however certainly never leaned upon his shoulder with her arms about him though he had on one occasion when she was halffrozen practically carried her into her fathers dwelling the thought of it was in a curious fashion almost distasteful as well as preposterous his regard for her was largely that of a devotee an æsthetic respect which would have made any display of purely human proclivities on the part of the goddess a trifle disconcerting  there are men like ingleby whose life is partly from inclination and partly from force of circumstances in some respects one of puritanical simplicity especially in the back blocks of englands colonies and startled by sewells suggestion he tried to reason with himself as he leaned against the tree he remembered now how he had thrilled to the girls touch as halfcrying and halflaughing she had rested in his arms a few hours ago and he could not admit the almost unpleasant explanation that this was because they were man and woman still he had felt her heart beating upon his breast and something in his nature had it seemed to him awakened and throbbed in response to it it was he felt not sensual passion it was not love since it was grace coulthurst he loved and his confusion grew more confounded as he vainly strove to classify it ingleby as one who did the obvious thing and was usually doing something unless he was asleep had seldom been led into any attempt to unravel the complexities of human thought and emotion men of his temperament are as a rule too busy for anything of the kind it is material facts that interest them and their achievements are usually apparent and substantial written in that country on hard rock and forest or on the orchards and wheatfields that smile where the wilderness has been  well said sewell at length  ingleby made a little gesture the thing is done why i did it doesnt after all greatly matter we have the results of it to face just now  precisely thats why im pleased you chose a very convenient spot to chop the tree in theres one of them becoming apparent already  he pointed across the fallen log and the man who stood upon it made a little sign the tree was in the shadow but beyond it lay a narrow strip of moonlit snow upon which the dusky pines closed in again a man moved out into the strip walking cautiously and carrying a carbine he stopped abruptly dropping the butt of it with a little thud and turning his head he apparently glanced at somebody behind him  theyve chopped a big tree right across the trail he said  his voice rang clearly through the nipping air and ingleby almost envied him as he stood unconcernedly still a dusky motionless object with a blacker shadow projected in front of him on the gleaming snow he at least had no responsibility and was there to do what he was bidden while the law would hold him guiltless the brief and decisive attempt on the outpost had scarcely given ingleby cause for thought but it was different now there was nothing exhilarating in standing still and wondering what course the police would take while other men have felt misgivings when brought face to face with constituted authority with arms in its hand  sewell in the meanwhile moved quietly towards the fire  you will leave this thing to me boys he said above all keep your hands off those rifles its a bluff were putting up  by this time several other men had moved out upon the strip of snow and one who came up from behind walked past them and stopped not far from the tree ingleby could see his face in the moonlight and recognized him as esmond he looked up at the man who though he had handed his rifle to a comrade still stood upon the log regarding him quietly  well he said what are you doing there  seeing that nobody gets over was the uncompromising answer  esmond laughed as though he had partly expected this there are no doubt more of you behind there if you have one i would prefer to talk to your recognized leader  sewell sprang up upon the tree i think i can venture to claim my comrades confidence he said in any case i am quite willing to accept the responsibility for anything that has been done  you may be asked to remember that said esmond drily do you mind explaining why you felled this tree  i think the man who answered you already made that clear to prevent anybodys getting over once you recognize that it would be difficult to do it without our permission well go a little further  then you are deliberately placing obstacles in the way of the police carrying out their duty i warn you that it may turn out a serious matter  sewell laughed im not sure the question is a very happy one it is rather too suggestive of monday morning in england still i suppose what we mean to do amounts to that although we will have pleasure in permitting you to enter the valley when you wish on one or two perfectly reasonable conditions  it remains to be seen whether you can keep us out esmond raised his voice a trifle climb up on that log trooper grieve and let me know who prospector sewell has with him he said you have authority to fire on anybody who tries to prevent you  it seemed to ingleby that esmond had displayed a good deal of tact he was aware that in an affair of the kind the right start counts for a good deal and that if the miners permitted the trooper to survey their position it might lead to an unwishedfor change in their attitude if they did not it would make them the aggressors and there was the further difficulty that they would probably shrink from offering violence to a single man  the trooper must not be hurt boys but he must not get up on the log he said and turned to sewell with a little gesture of deprecation  sewell nodded youre rightif we can manage it he said  in the meanwhile the young trooper was walking towards the barrier ingleby surmised that he had no great liking for his task but beyond the fact that he was holding himself unusually straight and looking steadfastly in front of him he showed no sign of it the moonlight was on his face and it was almost expressionless  stop right where you are said one of the miners sharply i guess youd better  the trooper did not stop nor did he answer if he had his misgivings as a human being he was also a part of the great system by which his nations work is done and its prestige maintained and he went on with stiff measured strides which suggested the movements of an automaton a handful of men behind the log and another handful standing in the moonlight on the gleaming snow stood silently watching him and most of them felt an almost unpleasant sense of tension  then he came to the branches and stopped a moment as though uncertain what to do his carbine presented the difficulty since to scramble over that tangle of branches and twigs both hands would be necessary then he slung it behind him and every one could hear the sharp snap of the cliphook through the bitter air after that there was a crash as he plunged into a maze of dusky needles and he was gasping when he emerged again he was however still coming on crawling over branches swinging himself under some of them while two miners waited for him intent and strung up behind the log when he reached it the top of the bark was almost level with his head and throwing an arm upon it he essayed to draw himself up at the same moment two pairs of sinewy hands seized his shoulders and lifted him from his feet then there was a shout and a swing and he was hurled backwards like a stone he broke through the shadowy needles amidst a crash of snappedoff twigs and there was a confused floundering in the darkness below then a head rose out of it and the trooper stood straight in the moonlight upon the fork of a great limb looking back towards his officer now  am i to try again sir he asked  there was a burst of approving laughter from the miners and the trooper sprang down from the branch and moved towards his comrades when esmond made a sign while a man who had been speaking apart with the latter suddenly stepped forward  its the major said one of the miners give him a show come right along sir nobody going to hurt you  coulthurst made a little gesture with a lifted hand and his remarks were brief  youll gain nothing by making fools of yourselves my men he said the law is a good deal too strong for you now try to tell me sensibly what is worrying you and if it comes within my business ill see what i can do  sewell stood up upon the log and took off his big shapeless hat there was silence for a moment while the major looked at him  mr sewell he said gravely im sorry to see you here  im a little sorry myself sir said sewell still thats not quite the point and if you will listen for a minute or two i will try to make our views clear they are really not unreasonable in the first place we want tomlinson tried here by his peers which although a little unusual could i think be done if captain esmond can prove him guilty we will give him up and he can get a regular court to confirm the verdict then we ask immunity for the men who held up the outpost and one or two trifling modifications of the mining regulations which are probably within the discretion afforded you by your commission  it seems to me said coulthurst drily that you are asking a good deal more in fact than you are likely to get you insist on all that  we feel compelled to do so sir  coulthurst made a little sign and moved back to where esmond stood they conferred together and the major spoke again  captain esmond is willing to promise that if you go home straightway no proceedings will be taken against any man for his share in this nights work he will promise you nothing further and i may say that in this i quite concur with him i must warn you that what you are doing is a very serious thing  then said sewell quietly there is nothing more to be said we have strength enough effectively to prevent captain esmond from going any further up the valley it would be better for everybody if he did not compel us to make use of it  esmond who had been unusually patient hitherto apparently lost his selfcommand  we will endeavour to whip the insolence out of you he said by the time the thing is settled your leaders will be exceptionally sorry for themselves  he drew back a little with the major and they appeared to be talking earnestly for a space it seemed to ingleby that esmond wished to chance an attack but perhaps the troopers were wornout or the major recognized the strength of the miners position for at last he made a little sign and the men moved back silently into the shadow of the pines then the tension slackened and ingleby shivered a little as he strode towards the fire  its horribly cold though i never felt it until a minute or two ago he said well i suppose we are in for it now  sewell laughed in a curious fashion i almost think so captain esmond is not a very imposing personage in himself but he stands for a good deal you see still its tolerably evident that he will not trouble us any more tonight  a few minutes later another miner climbed up on the log and the rest lay down rolled in their blankets about the crackling fire     xxviii  snowed in   two months passed almost uneventfully after the felling of the tree for esmond found no means of forcing the entrance to the valley the cañon furnished the only road to it and he found a band of determined men ready to dispute his passage each time he appeared before the tree a company of sappers could scarcely have raised them a more efficient defense than the one they had made at the cost of an hours labour with the axe and esmond reluctantly recognized that it was practically unassailable by the trifling force at his command an attempt to carry it by assault could only result in his handful of men being swept away and strategy proved as useless for when the troopers floundered upstream at night through the crackling icecake in the slacker flow of the rapid they came to a furious rush of water and with difficulty gained the bank again an attempt to crawl up to the barrier in the darkness resulted as unsuccessfully for a man leapt up upon the log with a blazing brand almost as they left the shelter of the pines  the getting in was also only half the difficulty for even if he passed the barrier the miners could muster a score of men for every one he had it was thus apparently useless to provoke actual hostilities the cards were evidently in sewells hand and it was clear that he recognized this and had his men in perfect command not a shot had been firedindeed no miner had actually been seen with a rifleand the only act of overt violence was the hurling of trooper grieve from the log in the meanwhile esmond had written to the provincial authorities in victoria but two different troopers who set out with his letters came back again the snowfall had been abnormal and though they were hard men they admitted that to force a way through the passes was beyond their ability as one result of this grace coulthurst had abandoned all idea of going to vancouver  in the meanwhile work was being carried on slowly and painfully in the valley where the men thawed the soil with great fires on the shallow claims and postponed the washing until the ice should melt again between whiles they mounted guard behind the log and slept when they could they were as far from submission as ever but the tension had slackened long ago and there was nothing but the breastwork to show that imperial authority was being quietly set at nought in the green river valley it was merely a question whose provisions would hold out longest now but the question was a vitally important one and one night three or four of the leaders sat discussing it in sewells shanty  so far everything has gone very much as one could expect he said the trouble will naturally come in the spring when esmond can bring more troopers in that is of course unless we can make terms before then which is i fancy quite probable  and if we cant asked the american who had attended to tomlinson that police captain shows very little sign of backing down  then well have to bring over the men from westerhouse said ingleby i think theyll come and because it will not be difficult to block out slavin who is in command of the police there if he comes along after them the position will be much the same as before  he looked at sewell who however did not appear to have heard him  whats going to stop the other people from sending a whole regiment along asked the american  the british official character said sewell drily it wouldnt look well you see and it would hurt somebodys dignity to admit that it was necessarythat is of course so long as we play our cards cleverly this trouble would be regarded from the official point of view as merely a little temporary friction which could be got over if handled tactfully indeed i shouldnt wonder if esmond is quietly reprimanded for causing it but one has to remember that if you persist in making our rulers see what they dont wish to theyre apt to display an activity thats likely to prove as unpleasant to men in our position as it is unusual they dont want to move if they can help it but somebody has to smart for it if theyre forced to  thats quite right said another man i remember riel and theyd have let him down again if hed known enough not to aggravate them by killing that man at fort garry well i guess weve no use for that while esmond keeps his head and the one question is what were going to eat its quite certain i cant live on cedar bark we want grub and weve got to get it there are men right here who could break a trail to anywhere  if we try the usual one well only clear it for esmond to bring troopers in said ingleby  that was evident to everybody and there was silence until sewell spoke again  ive been well up the south fork of the river looking for deer he said the valleys level and i didnt strike a rapid while with the snow on the river one could keep clear of the timber the slight thaw we had should make a good crust for travelling and it wouldnt be much trouble to make a few jumpersleds for the provisions the difficulty is that whoever went would have to cross the divide from headwater and pick up the usual trail on the other side  nobody has ever been over said another man ive no use for crawling up precipices with a big flourbag on my back  that might be because nobody has ever tried said sewell one advantage in going that way is that esmond wouldnt know you had either gone out or come back again we dont want to make a road for him then he turned to the american hows tomlinson tonight  going very slow the frosts against him wound wont heal and halfrotten pork and bread isnt quite the thing to feed a sick man he should have been on his feet quite a while ago  there was a brief discussion and as the result of it twenty men of whom ingleby was one were fixed upon to make the attempt they were all of them willing and started two days later before the stars had paled while every man in the valley except those on guard behind the log assembled to see them go though ingleby did not know that hetty leger stood a little apart from them watching the shadowy figures melt into the gloom beneath the pines it was everybody knew by no means certain that all of them would come back again  they made their way upriver dragging a few rude sledges with them and they crossed the big divide in the face of one of the blinding snowstorms that rage on the higher ranges most of the winter that cost them a week of tremendous labour and then they floundered through tangled muskegs where the stunted pines that grew in summer out of quaggy mire had been reaped and laid in rows by the arctic winds their branches were strewn about them and the men smashed a way through the horrible maze making with infinite pains scarcely a league a day still the muskegs were left behind and the ground was clearer in a big brûlée where fire had licked up undergrowth and branches and the great trunks rose gauntly charred and tottering columns there they made as much as four leagues in a day through ashes and dusty snow and at last came out on the trail to the settlement dragging with them one man whose feet were frostbitten nobody had crossed the divide before but that was probably because nobody had hitherto been driven by necessity into trying and now as usually happens in that country the thing attempted had been done  the settlement was not an especially cheerful spot consisting as it did of three or four loghouses roofed with cedar shingles which their owners had split a store and a frame hotel covered in with galvanized iron though slabs of bark had been largely used as well they however rested there several days and they needed it while the hearts of most of them sank a trifle at the contemplation of the journey home they had set out light but the store was crammed with provisions which the freighter who had somehow brought them there had abandoned all hope of taking farther it was evident they must each go back with a load which a man unaccustomed to the packing necessary in that country could scarcely carry a mile and the hardiest prospector among them shrank from crossing the divide with such a burden the thing however had to be done and on the night before their departure they were arranging their packs in the store when the man who kept it pointed to a pile of bags and cases in a corner  thats the police lot and i guess theyll want the grub he said i cant quite figure why none of them have come in for it but you could strike them for transport on anything you took along  the reason esmond had not sent down to inquire about his stores was of course quite plain to the miners but nobody in that settlement knew which way they had reached it or what had happened in the green river valley and sewell laughed  i am not he said a freightox or a dromedary and the rest of us have already got a good deal more than any one could reasonably expect them to carry  the storekeeper glanced at a stout deal box well he said i guess theres not much more than twelve pounds in there and its for the majortea and coffee and some special fixings from vancouver if he dont get it he and miss coulthurst will come right down to drinking water the freighter couldnt take more than a halfcase of whisky in for him last time and i guess thats not going to last the gold commissioner long  ingleby who was acquainted with the majors habits surmised that this was very probable but it appeared of much less consequence than the fact that grace might also have to do without even the few small comforts it had hitherto been possible to bring into the green river country he no longer remembered the galling of the packstraps or the tremendous struggle over the big divide but laid his hand upon the box  well manage this one anyway he said ill take it along with me  then turning at the sound of a step he saw that sewell who had followed apparently with the same purpose was looking at him  well he said what do you want  you cant take that case said sewell my packs lighter  ingleby was a trifle astonished i was first he said is there any special reason why you should have it instead of me  sewell laughed though his tone was not quite his usual one  no he said if one must be candid i scarcely think there is  it had never occurred to ingleby that his comrade might have set himself to gain miss coulthursts favour and in a measure succeeded he would have thought the notion preposterous in view of sewells opinions and he smiled goodhumouredly  it really doesnt matter i wouldnt have let you have it anyway he said and drew the storekeeper aside  they started at daybreak next morning and before they had gone a league ingleby found that the extra twelve pounds made his burden almost insupportable still he set his lips and bore it taking a grim pleasure in the nip of the straps that galled his shoulders as he remembered for whom he was carrying the box they were raw and he was wornout when the men made camp beneath a towering fir as the coppery sun went down but it was very much worse on the morrow when he rose with aching limbs from the frozen soil to start again somehow he kept his place with the others throughout that weary day and the ones that dragged by after it though when he remembered them afterwards the blurred pictures his fancy called up were like an evil dream of fatigue and pain  they sank ankledeep in ashes in the brûlée rent their limbs and garments smashing through the muskeg melted the snow with their campfires by lakes and streams whose shores even the wandering prospectors foot had scarcely trodden and slept or lay awake shivering with boots in the embers and halffrozen bodies radiating like spokes from the hub of crackling fire while the smoke which was sharp with the sting of the resin curled about them inglebys shoulders bled daily and troubled him seriously in the frost at night a seam of his boot had fretted a raw place across his foot and in the bitter mornings the cold struck deep and keen twelve pounds more count for a good deal when the burden is already all that its bearer is fit to carry and the effort drained the store of heat in his wornout body and left nothing for the upkeep of its vitality that heat is the source of energy everybody knows but only those who have taxed every muscle in the cold of the northwest realize the facts full significance the man who has tried his strength too hard in the arctic frost may char his boots in the campfire but he cannot get warm to add to his troubles ingleby had no proper mittens and when the one extemporized from a strip of flourbag burst the hand with which he clutched the packstraps split at every finger joint and at that temperature a sore will rarely heal  the others were not in much better condition though day by day the line of weary men stumbled on in a silence that seemed the grimmer for the burst of anathemas from the one or two of them who had to be dragged up from the fire and brutally shaken into wakefulness when the hour to resume the journey came then they came to the tremendous barrier of the divide a rampart of ice and snow which even in summer no man new to that country would attempt to climb  it cost them a day to make the first thousand feet or so and then they lost count of the rest during which they dragged themselves upward from dwarf pine to pine or crawled along scarped slopes with the peaks still above them they were waistdeep in snow when they crossed the ridge through the gap of a ravine down which all the winds of heaven apparently rioted but they fought their way foot by foot and were floundering down the farther side when ingleby who was staggering grey in face behind the rearmost of them lost his footing and rolled down a declivity he brought up with a crash in a juniper and rising halfdazed recovered his legitimate burden and dragged himself on again he could scarcely see the others for his head was throbbing intolerably and his sight was dim but it seemed to him that he was travelling a little more easily than he had done it was however not until they lay beside a snapping fire that night with their packs piled behind them as a barrier to the bitter wind that the reason for this became apparent  wheres that case of yours asked one of the men  ingleby glanced behind him and then laid down the blackened can of tea he held and rose unsteadily  you havent got it he asked hoarsely none of you  there was a little sardonic laughter and one of the others said i guess weve got most enough without humping another case along for anybody  then i must have left it where i fell into that juniper this afternoon  he shook his galled shoulders which were bleeding through the shirt that was glued to them and he winced as the movement tore it from the wound then he turned slowly away from the fire  hold on where are you going said one of the men  back for the case if im fortunate i may make camp before you start tomorrow  he stopped for just a moment and looked back at the fire with a fierce physical longing in his eyes for all that was animal in him craved for food and the rest of repletion sewell he saw was lying halfasleep with a partly consumed flapjack fallen from his hand  now see here said somebody we cant wait for you unless we get down out of the frost into thick timber by tomorrow night its quite likely one or two of us will stay up here altogether youve got a straight warning let the blame thing go  ingleby said nothing he knew that if he dallied his flesh would master him and he limped out of the firelight with a groan the red flicker faded suddenly and he was alone on a great sloping waste where a few dwarf firs and junipers were scattered black as ink on a ground of blinking white under the big coppery moon there was a pain in every joint the rag wound about one hand was stiff and he dare not move his shoulders now while at every step the torturing boot ate into his flesh that was all he remembered for he could never recall afterwards much of what he felt and did that night  he was not back at the camp next morning and when his comrades had waited an hour or two they moved on slowly without him one can live in the open under a greater cold than they were called upon to face that is if one is provided with costly furs and sleeping bags to suit it but there are reasons why the prospector usually has neither and there was no more endurance left in the men ingleby however would at least have no difficulty in picking up their trail and unless they made shelter that night it seemed very probable that some of them would freeze they found it at the foot of the mountain wall in a thick belt of young firs where the jumpersledges and two or three axes had been left and that night they lay in comfort about the fire with a kettle of strong green tea in their midst and the springy cedar and spruce twigs piled high about them two of them however were not there for sewell had gone back in search of ingleby  it was snowing a little and there was no moon visible while though the rest of the journey down the valley would by comparison be easy now they had the sledges the men were curiously silent as they lay about the fire nobody seemed disposed to sleep and the kettle had been emptied when one of them glanced round at the rest  if he doesnt come in by tomorrow im going back he said  i guess it mightnt be much use tomorrow said a comrade if i could get a move on me id go tonight but im not sure i can what dyou say he for anyway theres two of them  the men were deadweary too dazed with fatigue almost to think nor was there one of them anxious to make the effort which if successful might drag him from his rest thus they were willing to be led away from the point at issue which was what might have happened to ingleby  well said the first speaker sewells a smart man and he means well but i hadnt quite remembered him when i was broke and hadnt a dollars worth of dust to get the truck i had to have from the freighter ingleby went bond for me he dont know a good deal more than he has any use for like the other man but hes there when hes wanted thats the kind he is ill give him another halfhour then im going back for him  there was a drowsy murmur of concurrence sewell was liked in the green river valley and no man doubted his sincerity but that was after all not quite enough for it is though somewhat difficult of comprehension a fact that the dwellers in the wilderness who see fewer of their fellowmen have usually a clearer insight into the primitive essentials of human character than the men of the cities they do not ask too much of it but on certain points their demand is inexorable and it is very seldom that a simply meretricious quality goes far with them ingleby was not a genius he blundered in details and he had few graces but they believed in him  the halfhour had almost passed when one of them sharply raised his head and though few other men would probably have heard anything the rest shook themselves to attention high up on the range above them there was a soft pattering in the snow which grew louder until they could hear two men stumbling down the steep hillside after that there was a snapping of twigs among the firs and sewell strode into the red light with his hand on inglebys shoulder the latters face was grey and he staggered until somebody seized him and dragged him down beside the fire then he blinked at them out of halfclosed eyes  i got the case he said  thats all right said a man soothingly as he loosed the straps about his shoulders and lifted the case aside but ingleby turned upon him savagely  put it there  you i want to see it its hers he said  his voice was strained and broken and sewell did not hear all he said  get him some tea and flapjacks i think hes a little off his head he said     xxix  esmonds hands are tied   grace coulthurst had not long cleared the evening meal away but she was already waiting esmonds departure with an impatience which was somewhat difficult to hold in check he had come across from the outpost while she was occupied with the task and that in itself would have been sufficient to displease her but there were also other causes for the strain upon her temper miss coulthurst had not expected to fare luxuriously in the green river country and had hitherto borne the necessary discomforts exceptionally well but of late she had been actually hungry which in her case was as unpleasant as it was unusual  there was still a store of flour and saltpork in the gold commissioners house but there was practically nothing else and the pork was rancid while grace had a very rudimentary acquaintance with the art of cookery as one result of this she had risen unsatisfied from each untempting meal and brought up as she had been the deprivation had its effect on her physical nature though she felt the isolation which had succeeded the blockade even more of late the company of ingleby or sewell had become almost a necessity while she had naturally not seen either of them since the miners made their protest coulthurst had also been a trifle difficult to get on with he was not addicted to indulgence but neither was he particularly abstemious and tea brewed from leaves which had been infused once or twice already was not a beverage he appreciated or one that tended to make him more companionable  he lay somewhat wearily in a big deckchair beside the stove with an unlighted cigar in his hand while esmond sat opposite him with an unpleasant look in his face  there is nothing to be gained by hiding the fact that im a little anxious about the state of affairs sir he said the scoundrelly miners are still apparently as far from giving in as ever and unpleasant as it is to admit they have the upper hand  it looks like it said the major drily i suppose you havent thought of making a compromise nobodys hurt as yet and i fancy they would be satisfied if you met them with regard to tomlinson youre not bound to send a man up for trial unless its reasonably evident that hes guilty and i dont believe tomlinson did the thing myself couldnt you hold a kind of informal inquiry and give the boys an opportunity for proving him innocent  a vindictive sparkle crept into esmonds eyes and permit a rabble of that kind to teach me my duty im afraid not even if i wasnt sure the man was guilty which i am the thing would be out of the question  you feel warranted in calling all of themrabble asked grace  i do every one of them their leaders in particular belong to that most intolerable class to be found anywherethe halftaught proletariat with just enough education to increase their natural unpleasantness and inspire them with a hatred of their superiors that however is not quite the point  the blood rose to the girls face but remembering that the major occasionally displayed some little penetration she contrived to keep silent though this was by no means easy coulthurst however nodded  i scarcely think it is he said with a trace of dryness as i pointed out once before you do not seem to remember that i occasionally had mr sewell and ingleby here  im afraid i didntim sorry sir said esmond of course i should have done so one could almost have fancied that they were here frequently  again grace said nothing though it cost her a stronger effort and the major did not appear to notice the younger mans sardonic smile  since you dont seem to care for my suggestion have you any notions of your own  i havent which is partly why i came to you if i could only find a way of getting word to victoria and a few more troopers in it would be easy to bring them to reason as it is i have sense enough to realize that nobody would thank me for forcing a contest that could only end in disaster and the subsequent sending up of a battalion of canadian militia the miners are twenty to one you see  again coulthurst nodded you are right in one respect he said personally i shouldnt care to undertake the thing with less than three or four strong companies and im not sure i could get in then well since a compromise appears out of the question you can only wait events  that is the difficulty i cant wait too long were on full rations still but stores are getting low and certainly wont last until the thaw sets in of course if affairs had been different i could have hired enough of the fellows to break out a trail  perhaps the major did not intend it but he looked at grace and saw comprehension of his thoughts in her eyes they were not on full rations or anything approaching it at the gold commissioners house and a few of the comforts esmond could have spared would have been worth a good deal to them he was in some respects not an ungenerous man but though he must grace fancied have seen how meagrely they fared such a course had evidently never suggested itself to him and in that fact lay the sting he rose to go in another minute or two but just then there was a knocking at the door which swung open a moment later and grace gasped as she saw ingleby standing on the threshold with a heavy case in his hands  his garments were ragged and his gauntness showed through them his face was worn and darkened by exposure to the frost but his eyes were steady and he glanced at the girl with a smile there was a curious silence for a moment or two until he turned to the major  may i come in sir he asked  coulthurst regarded him sternly you could scarcely expect me to welcome a man in arms against his country  no said ingleby not as a friend that would be unreasonable still i have a little explanation to make and it is a bitter night to keep the door open with your permission  he swung round and closed it after which he laid down the case and grace felt a thrill of appreciation as she watched him his selfpossession appealed to her  you have comealone asked the major  of course said ingleby  esmond smiled though there was no goodhumour in his eyes and as if inadvertently dropped his hand on his hip his uniform was raised a trifle there in a fashion which suggested that a pistol lay beneath it  wasnt that a little rash he asked can you point out any reason why i shouldnt arrest you  i fancy i can and ingleby made a gesture of impatience for one thing if you attempted to lay hands on me or reached for your pistol i should fling you out into the snow that of course isnt in good taste to say in another mans house but it may save everybody unpleasantness and in any case im one of the proletariat from whom too much is not expected  there was a harshness in his voice and a glow in his eyes which seemed to indicate that he was perfectly willing to make his promise good while though his attitude was certainly not all that conventionality demanded it was at least natural in the circumstances and grace was not displeased by it esmond perhaps because he recognized the necessity for displaying his superior training kept his temper and coulthurst watched them both with a little grim smile  i havent the least intention of indulging in an exhibition of that kind which would be quite unnecessary said the police officer there is a trooper within call who has a carbine  i saw him though being a policeman on duty he naturally did not see me what would you gain by calling him  i think he and i between us could take you to the outpost  you might i havent a weapon of any kind with me but what then two of my comrades know where i am and you would have thirty or forty armed miners inquiring for me before morning it is of course quite plain that you cant afford to force an outbreak of that kind  esmond realized that this was true ingleby it was evident held the cards and was quite aware of it he wisely said nothing though his face grew hot and there was a wicked look in his eyes then ingleby turned to the major again  what i have to say is not in the least important and will not keep you a minute sir he said still there are reasons why i would sooner captain esmond didnt hear it  i believe he was going when you came in said coulthurst reflectively  the hint was plain enough and esmond moved towards the door while ingleby who stood between him and his furcoat handed the coat to him then as the officer went out he lifted a partlyfilled flourbag in from the veranda and when he had closed the door laid it with the case on the table  wont you sit down grace said quietly  ingleby looked at coulthurst i scarcely think major coulthurst would object to anything you suggest but i am in his hands  sit downand be hanged to you said the major whose face grew suddenly red do you suppose i enjoy the position you have forced me into  ingleby did as he was bidden i came across this case at the settlement sir and was told it was for you from what the storekeeper said i fancied miss coulthurst would be pleased to have it and that you wouldnt mind my bringing it up with me  you were at the settlement and coulthurst glanced at him almost incredibly perhaps you know esmond sent down two or three troopers and they couldnt face the snow  yes sir you will probably understand why i preferred not to mention it in captain esmonds presence  the box is proof that you were therebut how the devil you managed it is more than i know the troopers certainly couldnt  they didnt go the right way said ingleby drily  then there is another one and coulthurst flashed a sharp glance at him  as a very little reflection would show you that there must be there is no use in running away from the question besides i feel im safe in your hands and while circumstances continue as they are captain esmond couldnt profit by any conclusions you might come to shall i open the case for you sir  the major made a little sign and ingleby crossing to the hearth picked up the rockdrill which served as poker and contrived to prize up the lid with it  it was a trifling action but it was characteristic and grace noticed that he made use of the thing that was nearest without troubling anybody to find him a more suitable implement then he laid out the contents of the box upon the table and the girls face softened as she watched him the little comforts in themselves were worth a good deal to her just then but the fact that he had thought of her was worth far more the major however appeared a trifle disappointed and she fancied she knew what he was looking for ingleby seemed to know it too for there was a suggestion of a smile in his eyes leaning one elbow on the table she looked at him with her rounded chin in the palm of one hand  whichever way you went you must have crossed the range she said that box was heavy how did you carry it  on my back said ingleby that is the usual way we had sold all the horses off to the freighter for a few dollars quite a while ago of course as i hadnt asked your permission it was a liberty  grace made a little gesture what did you go down to the settlement for  provisions  but nobody could carry many of them over the mountains  i think i managed forty pounds said ingleby incautiously most of the boys had considerably more  the clear rose colour crept into graces cheeks and she did not trouble to prevent his seeing it she knew what the simple admission meant and that it must have cost him toil incredible to make that journey with a double burden it was for her he had borne it  and the box she asked  inglebys embarrassment was evident and she turned to the major with a curious little laugh and a faint ring in her voice  do you understand what mr ingleby has done she said he has carried that box besides his own load up from the settlementover the mountainsso that we should not suffer for anything  coulthurst also appeared embarrassed in fact his face was distinctly red im very much obliged to him he said its devilishly unfortunate you got drawn into that outpost business ingleby excuse me grace it isunfortunate cant you see how you have placed me as a man who has served his nation even though he has been kicked for it i cant very well  he stopped a moment still a trifle flushed and then broke into a little laugh well he said youre too strong for meill capitulate you know the ground i ought to take as well as i do but its more than could reasonably be expected of any man under the circumstances still that storekeeper fellow might have put in something a little more exhilarating than tea  ingleby opened the flourbag with something as nearly approaching a grin on his gaunt face as was compatible with the deferential attitude he had assumed  i feel a little diffident about the next proceeding sir he said in fact it is a piece of almost intolerable presumption on the part of a man setting constituted authority at defiance as im afraid i am still you see people must eat and drink in any case  he took two carefully wrapped bottles out of the bag and the majors eyes twinkled while as he spread out the rest of its contents grace felt her heart grow very soft towards him he had it seemed thought of everything that could minister to her comfort then she saw that he had guessed what she was thinking and his honesty became apparent  the storekeeper had his wife there he said i had a little talk with her  it is to be hoped she didnt drink whisky of that kind said the major with a chuckle you couldnt get anything better in a montreal club  ingleby laughed i fancy some of my comrades have belonged to associations of the kind and a good many of them have cultivated tastes he said as a matter of fact they can afford them  will you be good enough to tell me how much those things cost asked the major  if you insist in fact theres an invoice here still after the little kindnesses you have shown me i would much sooner not let you see it  coulthurst looked at him sharply and then reaching out laid his hand upon the grocery bill after that he rose and went into the adjoining room and when he came back he handed ingleby a cheque on a vancouver bank grace watched the miner curiously as he did so  now you have relieved your feelings sir i can make what use i like of what is my own he said  he crossed the room and flung the paper into the fire then turned with a little smile to the major it was a bold step and the boldness of it appealed to the girl she understood it as an assertion of equality something he owed to himself and withal it was done with deference and not aggressively for a moment coulthurst gazed at him in astonishment then he laughed and made a little sign of comprehension  im not sure ive met many young men with nerve enough to do that but i think youre right he said i was pleased to make your acquaintance mr inglebyand it is perhaps not altogether your fault that the present unfortunate circumstances must necessarily lead to a temporary break in it  ingleby made him a little grave inclination i understand sir and there is only one thing i would like to ask he said we may make some suggestions shortly for a compromise and in view of captain esmonds temperamentand our ownthey might be considered more dispassionately if passed through a third party would you be willing to receive sewell here  he was evidently about to go and coulthurst held out his hand send him as soon as you can if your ideas are reasonable ill do my utmost with esmond this state of affairs cant go on  ingleby turned towards the door but grace who was waiting opened it for him and let her hand rest in his a moment  walter she said very softly it was exactly what i would have expected from you  ingleby did not think it advisable to turn round but he gripped the little fingers hard as he passed out into the darkness     xxx  sewells downfall   sewell went to major coulthursts the following night and remained some time in conference with him he also went there a day or two later to hear esmonds answer to the suggestions he had conveyed and when it was delivered he found himself no nearer a compromise there was not a man in the valley who would agree to what the police officer demanded and though sewell went back with somewhat modified proposals from time to time affairs dragged on at a deadlock while each party hoped to starve the other into surrender  the miners could with difficulty have obtained a temporary and insufficient supply of provisions but fearing that esmond would be driven to action their leaders were dubious about sending any number of their men away again it was a game of bluff they were playing and it had dragged out much longer than any of them had anticipated while all could recognize that it was only by holding command of such a force as would render hopeless any attempt to drive them from their barricade that they could avoid an actual recourse to arms which must eventually prove disastrous to them  finally after a meeting of all concerned sewell was dispatched again with what practically amounted to an ultimatum and on the evening on which he was to deliver it he and ingleby and leger discussed the affair at the bakery hetty was not present for though they were on short rations she had gone up the valley with one or two little dainties she had contrived to make for tomlinson he had been a strong and healthy man but wounds complicated by comminuted bones give trouble in the cold of that country and the very indifferent food had further militated against his recovery sewell stood ready to set out ingleby and leger sat by the hearth and there was anxiety in the faces of all of them  im afraid its a fools errand im going on said sewell it is of course useless to threaten to seize the outpost when esmond must realize that we have no intention of doing it the things out of the question it was all very well to block the troopers out but if we shot one of them it would bring every policeman in the country and if necessary the whole canadian militia down upon our heads  its almost a pity you didnt realize that before said leger  sewell made a little gesture which might have expressed anything mutual recriminations seldom do much good and i scarcely think any one would have expected esmond to hold out as he has done i met one of the troopers the last time i went to coulthursts and he admitted that they were practically starving it was a bluff we put up but we made the mistake of assuming that the opposition had less nerve than we had after all its not a very uncommon one  are you quite sure it was only bluff when you began asked leger quietly  sewell started almost imperceptibly but leger saw it and even ingleby who would have believed in him in spite of everything fancied that there was embarrassment in his face  circumstances alter cases and ive learnt a little about british official inertia since ive been up here he said its rather a big contract to dictate terms to the dominion of canada when we have failed to make any great impression on one police officer anyway i may as well get on to the commissioners neither of us is i fancy in the most amiable temper  he went out and ingleby looked at leger who shook his head  hes quite right walter its too big a thing for us and we have failed he said if it comes to the worst and esmond goes down hell beat us still  ingleby said nothing though his face grew grim and leger continued with a little dry smile sewell will do no good its almost a pity we hadnt chosen another man his heart isnt in the thing  you can say thatwhen you know his record and there was a flash of anger in inglebys eyes  dont misunderstand me sewell will not actually play us false he is of course a much more brilliant man than either of us and hell handle our case with his usual ability still that is scarcely enough and one has to admit that its a poor one intrinsically we started with the mistake of taking it for granted that esmond could be bluffed  im not sure that we did to be correct i started the thing without thinking of anything anyway you believed as firmly as the rest of us in sewell and that the men here and at westerhouse could make a stand that would result in their getting what they wanted  leger sat silent a moment or two perhaps i did though i think i saw the weak points of the scheme clearly they however didnt count for so much then nobody you see can put a big thing through by working it all out logically beforehand it appears all difficulties if you look at it that way one has to take his chances with the faith that attempts the impossible and the fire that carries him through an obstacle before he realizes that it is one sewell had the faith and the fire and the trouble is that he hasnt now there has been a big change in the man since he came into the green river country  ingleby could not controvert this but it was evident to leger who watched him closely that he had still full confidence in sewell and was as far as ever from guessing at any reason that might account for the change in him  well he said slowly we cant back down now what are we to do  go on play the game out to the bitter end i think you know that as well as i do  the little sign ingleby made seemed to imply that there was nothing more to be said  isnt it time hetty was back he asked  he opened the door and the cold struck through him like a knife there was not a breath of wind astir and the pines cut sharp and black against the luminous blueness of the night without the faintest quiver of a spray for that afternoon an arctic frost had descended upon the valley  ill go along and meet her he said  it was ten minutes later when he did so she was plodding somewhat wearily up the climbing trail a shapeless figure in a big blanketcoat and she took his arm and leaned upon it it occurred to him that hetty had lost some of her brightness and had been looking a little worn of late but that was not astonishing since the scanty food and strain of anxiety were telling upon everybody in the green river valley it was also a long way from the bakery to the hut where tomlinson still lay helpless and ingleby felt very compassionate as the girl who said very little walked by his side when at last he opened the door for her she sank into the nearest chair and turned to him with a curiously listless gesture  keep it openwide she said  ingleby understood her for the little room was very hot and the sudden change of temperature from the frost of the northwest had once or twice painfully affected him then as he turned again he heard a faint cry and saw hetty clutch at the table in another moment her chair went over with a crash and he caught her as she fell  no said leger sharply dont try to lift her lay her flat  ingleby stupidly did as he was bidden and when hetty lay at his feet a pitiful huddled object with blanched hands and face beneath the snowsprinkled coat he felt an unnerving thrill of apprehension run through him as he looked down at her leger however kept his head  i dont think theres anything to be afraid of but we must get these things loose about her neck he said undo that hook while i lift her head a little its pressed right into her throat  ingleby dropped on one knee and with clumsy fingers loosed the blanketcloak then he stopped a moment and glanced at leger who had slipped one arm under hetty as she lay her garments were drawn tight about her neck and shoulders  go on said leger sharply get that collar undone be quick the thing is choking her  ingleby loosed the collar though the blood crept to his face as the bodice fell apart from hettys white neck leger was however not contented yet  pull those hooks out or cut the stuff he said whatareyou stopping for  ingleby got the hooks out that is one or two of them and then he stopped again while leger saw the narrow black ribbon pressed into the white flesh upon which his eyes were fixed  i dont know what that is but pull it out he said if you cant get it loose cut the thing  ingleby did as he was bidden but there was no need to use the knife for as leger moved his arm a little the ribbon slackened and a little trumpery locket which as ingleby knew was not even of highcarat gold slid out and lay on hettys breast as he saw it all the blood in his body seemed to rush into his face leger however apparently did not notice that  get me the old jacket yonder i want it under her shoulders he said  ingleby got it and then stood leaning on the table while leger still knelt by his sisters side his face was set and anxious but it was evident that he was equal to the occasion and had not let his apprehensions master him it was however different with ingleby for now there was no longer anything to do he felt that he was quivering  ill run for the american whos looking after tomlinson he said  leger made a little sign no dont go i may want you shell come round in a minute or two this room must have been seventy and outside its forty below where has your nerve gone  ingleby did not know it had however certainly deserted him and he felt for once scarcely capable of doing anything as he leaned upon the table then leger who slipped the locket back beneath the dress looked up at him  she mightnt like to think we had seen it and of course i didnt know what the thing was he said and then added without moving his eyes from ingleby i wonder where she got it  ingleby said nothing though he knew he had bought her the little trinket in england long ago but it seemed to him that hetty might not like her brother to know it apart from that he was scarcely sensible of anything clearly for he was overwhelmed by a horrible confusion and he looked down at leger vacantly until a little shiver seemed to run through the girl  now see if you can find the coffee said his comrade sharply there is a little somewhere we have nothing else to give her  ingleby waited another moment until he saw a faint tinge of colour creep into hettys face and then he moved towards the box of stores dazed from relief he was busy for a moment or two and when he turned again hetty was lying in the low hidechair with her brothers arm about her and the blanketcoat clutched closely to her neck leger flashed a swift glance at him and pointed towards the door  i think it would be better if you got out of this he said  ingleby also thought so and went forthwith he felt that he could not meet hettys eyes just then and he wanted to be alone and get rid of the almost insufferable confusion that afflicted him he had never made love to hetty they had been comrades almost as brother and sister to each other but she had worn his locket hidden on her breast which was he surmised considerably more than a sister would have done brotherly tenderness could also he realized scarcely account for the uneasiness he had felt and the relief that had replaced it but it appeared quite out of the questionin fact a thought to shrink fromthat he could be in love with two women it was as unpleasant to contemplate the probability of two women being in love with him he could find no solution of the problem as he swung along beneath the solemn pines and when he reached his black and silent shanty his brain was still in a whirl one thing alone was clear to him and that was that hetty was alive and apparently recovering  in the meanwhile sewell found that coulthurst who it seemed had gone across to the outpost had not yet come home grace told him so standing in the doorway with the sweeping lines of her figure cut in black against the light and though she could see the admiration in his face he could not see her curious little smile miss coulthurst had decided that the struggle between the miners and their rulers had continued long enough and it was time she made some attempt to put an end to it  still i really think you might come in she said he will be back before very long  sewell came in and sat down opposite her across the hearth and grace glanced covertly at her little watch which hung upon the wall major coulthurst was punctuality in itself and she realized that she had about twenty minutes in which to do a good deal inglebys devotion to herand it was perhaps significant that she felt that was the best description of itwas evident but there were points on which he was as unyielding and impervious to suggestion as a rock while sewell with his more delicately balanced nature and wider grasp of comprehension was in her hands at least as malleable clay  how long is this very unpleasant state of affairs to continue mr sewell she asked you promised me we should have quietness this winter  sewell made a little deprecatory gesture circumstances were too strong for me but i have done what i could unpleasant as things are they might be worseconsiderably  it is a little difficult to see how they could be  she had straightened herself a little and sat looking at him with a certain quiet and halfscornful imperiousness which she knew became her and yet was not altogether affected sewell the democrat understood exactly what she meant and knew that it was not the loneliness or physical discomfort the blockade entailed that she was thinking of it was the humbling of the pride of the ruling caste to which she belonged and the bold denial of its prerogative of authority that she felt the most it was curious that he could understand this and sympathize with her as ingleby who only saw and did the obvious thing could not have done  well he said i think this winter might have seen an undreamtof overturning of constituted authority and the setting up of what you were once pleased to call a visionary utopia my comrades were almost ready to undertake it a little while ago in fact they only wanted somebody to show them how  grace laughed a careless silvery laugh which would have been wasted on ingleby there was no scorn in it now only amusement but sewell nodded comprehendingly as he looked up at her  your friends would naturally never believe it but i almost think the inauguration of the utopia would have been possible he said at least we could have cleared the ground for it  there are said grace suggestively men enough in this valley to make about one company  and between here and the arctic sea enough to make such a small armycorps of marchers and marksmen as no country has ever enrolled beneath its banner a very little spark in the right place will kindle a great blaze you know but i only want to show you that the thing might have happened i scarcely think you need expect it now  grace looked at him with a curious intensity then she said you were afraid  no answered sewell slowly i was not sure i was strong enough to control the forces i could set in motion or that the result of unloosing them would beutopia it seemed too big a risk that was one reasonyou can perhaps guess the other after all one has to admit that there are certain advantages attached to the direction of affairs by the more highly trained divisions of society  to which said grace with a soft laugh you of course belong what madeyoua democrat  sewell made a little gesture ah he said that is a different story and one i hardly care to go into but perhaps the instincts one is born with cant be entirely rooted out i am at least not the iconoclast i was when i came into the valley that however really isnt very astonishing i now have a good deal to lose  he looked at her steadily with grave deference but as like to like and the girl recognized this and what his words implied she was however playing a game then and another swift glance at her watch showed her that she had little time in which to finish it  and so for fear you should lose it you did not strike the spark well i think that was wise it would certainly have cost you one thing which you seem to value she said  this was vague but it seemed to sewell that there could be only one meaning to it what he had feared to lose was not yet beyond his reach he did not know that there were in the girl qualities which would have made her a successful pompadour just then her craving for influence was irresistible but she swept away from the topic with a swift smile expressive only of the indifference which of all the feelings that she could show he most shrank from  still to be practical how could the blaze have spread she said it would have smouldered out in one snowbound valley and in the spring there would have been a very inglorious downfall to the strictly limited utopia  sewell was nettled there was though it was seldom apparent vanity in him as both hetty and grace had guessed her blame he could have borne but there was a sting in her smile that she should think him a visionary schemer led away by his imagination and without the faculty of execution hurt him  the blaze would have leapt the snowy barriers he said in fact that was all arranged then it would have flashed from range to range across to the yukon one tolerably big bonfire has been waiting some time ready for lighting i had only to send the message i think you know why i didnt  grace saw his eyes and understood the look in them it was suggestive of passionate admiration she also knew that a word would dispel it perhaps forever but she was lost in the game now and what the man might think of her afterwards did not matter  then there is a road outbeside the one you made to the settlement it must be to westerhouse she said  yes answered sewell simply i have been there  grace had just five minutes left and a task before her which under ordinary circumstances she could scarcely have expected to accomplish but she had to deal with a man who was after all of her own caste a man with a deep vein of vanity in him who was also in love with her the latter fact had been apparent for some little while and she let him see now that she recognized it while during the next few minutes she used every attribute with which nature had endowed her as well as art of a very delicate description in fact grace had never until then exactly realized her own capabilities  neither sewell nor she could afterwards remember all that she said and in fact she said very little though that little was suggestive there was no great need for a girl with her patrician beauty to waste words unduly when she had her eyes in any case sewell was as wax beneath her hands and when she had finished with him she knew that the mountain barrier between the green river country and westerhouse was not impassable and how the one gorge ran that traversed it if sewell fancied she appreciated the passion which had led him to do so much for her that was his affair there was however a curious glow in his eyes when he rose as the major came in     xxxi  broken idols   coulthurst sat with a big hand clenched on the table and a grim look in his face when sewell left him nor did he turn his head until grace who came softly out of the inner room sat down close by him  you cant come to terms father she said  we cant and there was an ominous sparkle in coulthursts eyes im not sure that i wish to now in fact ive borne quite as much as im willing to put up with from both of them and theres some reason after all in esmonds plan hell give them another week and then well cut our way in  its not your affair and grace started visibly you are the gold commissioner  coulthurst smiled i am also entitled to the rank of major and that after all means a good deal  grace mastered her apprehension for she realized the majors point of view and indeed concurred with it  there is no other way than the one you are thinking of she asked  there are two said coulthurst drily we can sit still and starve or march out and leave the valley in the possession of the miners while we try to break through the snow neither of them however commends itself to esmond or me  of course said grace with a little flush in her face which however faded suddenly but suppose one or two of the troopers were killed while you forced the barricade  then said coulthurst our friends ingleby and sewell would certainly be hung  the majors terseness was more convincing than a great deal of argument and grace saw what she must do the pride of station was strong in her so strong in fact that she would never have come down to inglebys level it was only because he had shown that he could force his way to hersat least as it was likely to be regarded in that countrythat she had listened to him when the grapple became imminent that pride alone would have driven her to take part with constituted authority instead of what she considered the democratic rabble then there was the peril to her father and to ingleby he must be savedagainst himself if it should be necessary  there are troopers at westerhouse across the mountains she asked  i believe there is a strong detachment and a very capable officer  grace sat silent a moment before she spoke again father she said i want you to make a bargain with reggie esmond for me on two conditions i am willing to tell you how he can bring those troopers in you are to be the gold commissioner and peacemaker but nothing else as there will be two police officers they will not want you as major then there must be an indemnity for mr sewell and ingleby  coulthurst gazed at her in blank astonishment you are quite serious you mean what you say  of course i can tell youon those two conditionshow to bring the westerhouse troopers in  coulthurst banged his hand down on the table then i think there will be an end of the troubleand the affair could be arranged to meet your views but however did you find the way into the westerhouse country  grace looked at him steadily though there was a little more colour than usual in her face that does not concern reggie esmond or you hadnt you better go over and see him  it was getting late but coulthurst went straightway and as the result of it esmond and two troopers set out with a handsled early next morning for a certain peak that overhung a gorge through the barrierrange that cut off the westerhouse country he could not pass up the valley but that was no great matter since the peak could be seen leagues away it was a long journey and he had intended going no farther than the gorge with the troopers but he was not destined to get even there  on the second day they came on a tree lying across their path with its branches interlocked among the shattered limbs of a neighbor so that the great trunk was sharply tilted an obstacle which is frequently to be met with in that country as the undergrowth all round was tall and thick esmond and one trooper swung themselves upon the log to see if they could find an opening and made their way along it until they came to a branch where the trunk was high above the ground the trooper crept round it and then as esmond came after him there was a crash and a shout and the trooper who had stayed below saw his officer vanish amidst the rattling twigs it was several minutes before they could reach him and then he was lying with a grey face and with one leg changed in its usual contour and significantly limp he looked up with a grin of pain when the first trooper bent over him  gone at the thighbone i felt it snap he said simpkin will get me home on the sled but youll go on grieve and tell captain slavin how we are fixed he will come in with every man available  i guess id better see you safe back sir said the trooper  esmond stared at him fiercely though his face was awry with pain  youll go on he said  then he winced and moving a little fell over with his face in the snow and because the boughs he had fallen among were thick it was two hours before the troopers got him out and on the sled it was not altogether astonishing that they managed to compound the fracture during the operation after that grieve pushed on alone and he was as it happened from the wild bush of northern ontario which though the trees and rocks are smaller is a very similar country in the meanwhile simpkin headed back for the valley with the sled and it was not his fault that three nights of bitter frost overtook him on the way indeed if he had not been an exceptionally resolute man inured to fatigue it is very probable that esmond would have frozen before they reached the outpost on the morning after they got there a trooper appeared before the miners barricade without his carbine and hailed the men on guard  have you brought along the american who fixed up jacksons foot when he smashed his toes boys he asked  the man who had nursed tomlinson climbed up on the log im here he said is anybody wanting me  i guess captain esmond does said the trooper he fell off a log two or three days ago and his legbone has come right through the corporal cant get it back inside him if you can see your way to do anything wed be much obliged to you  did captain esmond send you  no sir said the trooper he didnt hes way too sick to worry about anything  the american smiled at ingleby who stood beneath him its very probable a compound fracture of the femur is apt to prove rather serious at this temperature especially if our friend the corporal has been trying to reduce it we dont owe the man anything but i guess id better go along  of course said ingleby simply and in another minute the doctor was on his way to the outpost with the trooper  it was evening when he came back with news of esmonds condition which it appeared was serious and sewell forthwith set out for the gold commissioners dwelling he did not see grace at all and coulthurst granted him only a two minutes interview  it is quite out of the question that i should worry captain esmond now he said unless you are prepared to make an unconditional surrender which i should strongly recommend there is nothing i can do for you  that replied sewell is about the last thing we should think of doing  he came back and related what had passed to leger and ingleby the latter looked thoughtful when he heard him  one could almost fancy by the change in his attitude that the major had something up his sleeve he said  the game thing occurred to me though i dont see what it could be the accident to esmond has probably upset him anyway we have our own course to consider now  since esmonds not likely to worry us for awhile we had better send all the men we can spare down for provisions for one thing said leger  it was decided on and still ingleby looked grave  thats all right as far as it goes but its only a side issue after all he said this state of things cant continue indefinitely and tomlinson doesnt seem to be getting much better or we could have simplified the affair by getting him out of the valley the winters wearing through and if nothing is done before the thaw comes well be in the troopers hands in the meanwhile theres an unpleasant probability of the freighter or somebody else finding his way in now weve broken out a trail have you thought about asking the boys at westerhouse to join us  no said sewell with a momentary trace of embarrassment there are a good many reasons why it wouldnt be convenient  i should like to hear one or two of them said leger bluntly  sewell managed to think of several reasons but none of them appeared altogether satisfactory when his comrades considered them it was however evident that he was determined on not sending to westerhouse and they had to be content though leger looked very grave when the conference broke up  one could almost have fancied that sewell had lost his nerve and if i could send hetty out of the valley it would be a big weight off my mind he said  the same thought had occurred to ingleby and it troubled him again that night as he kept his watch behind the tree for he could not altogether understand the tense anxiety he felt about hetty she had scarcely been out of his thoughts since the night she fainted at the bakery which considering that he was in love with grace coulthurst appeared an almost unnatural thing there was no doubt that he was in love with the commissioners daughter he assured himself all his hopes and projects for the future were built upon the fact but he was commencing to realize vaguely that she appealed for the most part to his intellect while he felt for hetty a curious unreasoning tenderness which was quite apart from admiration of her or her qualities he puzzled over it that night sitting still while the men slept about him under the stars and then gave it up as beyond solution when one of them relieved him  in the meanwhile trooper grieve had found the gorge through the barrierrange and was pushing on through dim fir forests and over snowy hillsides for westerhouse esmond lay halfinsensible in the outpost for fever and dangerous inflammation had supervened but nobody told the american where the lieutenant was going when he fell from the tree or anything about trooper grieve there was thus no apparent change in the state of affairs until one night when every man who could be spared was away at the settlement a stranger worn with travel was brought in by two miners sewell was standing with the others about the fire behind the tree and ingleby saw the colour sink from his face when it was told them that the stranger was from westerhouse  you have got to do something right away said the visitor slavins coming in with every trooper he can raise he went round the way the trooper came and i pushed on by the trail sewell told us of to get in ahead of him a few of the boys are coming along behind me  there was a murmur of astonishment and consternation and then a somewhat impressive silence which leger broke  you mean that one of the green river troopers reached westerhouse he said  thats just what i do mean your man sent him  leger looked hard at sewell who stood back a little in the shadow now  it isnt quite clear how he found the way but after all we neednt worry about that in the meanwhile he said you are still our acknowledged leader mr sewell hadnt you better ask him a question or two we want to understand the thing  sewell stood still for almost a minute and the men who were tensely impatient wondered at it and the hardness of legers voice then he sat down on a branch where the woodsmoke drifted between them and him  try to tell us as clearly as you can what happened he said  well said the stranger one of the green river troopers came in badly played out and when he asked us where the outpost was we took him along after what youd told us we guessed it meant trouble for you it was dark then and one of us crawled round to the little back window but a trooper came round the house and we lit out kind of quietly for the bush then a trooper started out on the trail as hard as he could hit it and bout half an hour later slavin came out in front of the outpost im going away by and byfor my healthbut ive sent to clatterton creek for two or three more policemen and if you start any blame circus while im away ill see the boys who made it are sorry for themselves he said  the boys took it quietly asked ingleby  yes said the stranger thats what they did you see the folks in victoria had moved on eshelby and the new man was doing what he could for us within reason anyway we hadnt heard from you and the boys werent going to make trouble for nothing when slavin was there  again leger glanced at sewell who said nothing and then made a little sign to the speaker nobody would expect it of them he said get on  well said the stranger when slavin and his troopers lit out quietly bout an hour after we got our packs made and came on after them that is a few of us who hadnt struck any dirt that was worth the washing we were willing to take a hand in if we were wanted because we heard of hall sewell before he came to westerhouse if he was in a tight place we figured wed stand behind him hed often done what he could for men like us  sewell made no sign but leaned back a shadowy figure against the tree and there was something in his silence that set inglebys nerves on edge  we kept most a league behind slavin and we had to get a move on at that continued the speaker he wasnt wasting time then when wed got through the range he broke off to the north and we figured that was the way the trooper came we let him go and came right on by the trail sewell told us of  how many are there of you asked leger  eight theyre most as cleaned out of grub and money as i am wed have sent you a hundred if youd wanted them soon after sewell came  ingleby laughed harshly a jarring hopeless laugh and there was a murmur from the men  our hands played out the contract was too big for us said one of them what dyou figure on doingnowmr sewell  sewell rose slowly as though it cost him an effort and face to face with them stood where the firelight fell upon him the bronze had faded from his cheeks and his glance was vacillating  nothing in the meanwhile boys he said in fact there is nothing we can do but try to extort some trifling concession from slavin before we surrender tomorrow  he stopped a moment and looked at them with steadying eyes if we had westerhouse behind us i would have asked you to make a fight for it it would at least have been an easy way out of the tangle for one of usbut it would only mean useless bloodshed as it is i cant get you into further trouble boys  his voice had been growing hoarser and there was an uncomfortable silence when he stopped this was not what the men had expected and everybody seemed to feel that there was something wrong then ingleby looked at leger with a little bitter smile  well he said we have made our protest and as any one else would have foreseen have found it useless established order is too strong for us i never felt of quite so little account as i do tonight  leger nodded sympathetically that he said isnt after all of any particular consequenceand i scarcely think it was quite our fault why didnt sewell send over to westerhouse  i dont know said ingleby it doesnt matter now  have you asked yourself how the trooper found his way across the range  ingleby turned round on him suddenly what do you mean by that  if you cant find an answer i think you should ask sewell it seems to me you are entitled to know  ingleby met his eyes for a moment and then the blood rushed to his face as he rose he said nothing but he saw sewell leave the fire and turning abruptly he moved on behind him up the little trail to the bakery though he made no effort to overtake him it was very dark beneath the pines and he felt that he must see the man he had believed in it seemed a very long while before he reached the bakery and going in quietly saw hetty regarding sewell with a flash of scornful anger in her eyes  oh she said its perfectly plain to me the girl tricked you i knew she would  then she started as she saw ingleby in the doorway though the flush in her cheeks grew deeper and the little vindictive glow in her eyes plainer still  you heard me walter well he knows she did look at him she said  if you will go away for about five minutes hetty i shall be much obliged to you said ingleby quietly mr sewell has something to say to me  hetty swung round and swept out of the room and when the door closed behind her sewell sat down at the table and ingleby stood in front of him his face was grim and his lips were tightly set  well he said at length  sewell made a little gesture i cant admit that hetty was quite correct in one respect he said it was my mad impulsiveness misled me  i want to be quite clear said ingleby in a low even voice you told miss coulthurst the way to the westerhouse gully  i did if i were not sure that you knew it already i would never have admitted it to you  a little grey patch showed in inglebys cheek and the pain in his face was unmistakable while sewell clenched one hand on the table as he looked at him  walter he said what is miss coulthurst to you  i dont know said ingleby with a very bitter laugh i am not sure that she is anything whatever to me i however asked her to marry me not so very long ago and she led me to believe that when circumstances were more propitious she might do so  sewell seemed to gasp and his hand closed more tightly on the table but he said nothing and ingleby spoke again  i would he said have believed in you in spite of everythingbut there is nothing to be gained by reproaching you hetty was right as usual and you never belonged to us you know there is however something to be done since it seems to me that it would be better to keep out of the affair the girl who was apparently willing to look with favour on both of us you must be out of the valley before daylight tomorrow  sewell stood up slowly and took a carefully folded packet from his pocket i will be gone in half an hour he said take care of these they are the leaves that were under the bandage on probyns body and may go a little way towards clearing tomlinson i will not offer to shake hands with you walter but i would like you to believe that i was sincere enough when i came into the valley if it is any consolation to you my punishment will be heavy my name will be a byword after what i have done and the work i once believed in must be left to cleanhanded men  ingleby took the packet i could have forgiven you for stealing miss coulthursts favour from mesince i scarcely think it was ever minebut just now at least i cant forgive the rest he said  sewell made no answer and when he went out ingleby sat down limply at the table and with his chin in his hand gazed at the fire for the time even his physical strength seemed to have gone out of him all his faith had been given one man and one woman and now it was clear that both had betrayed him and through him the miners who had placed their confidence in him he did not know how long he sat there but he started suddenly as he felt a gentle touch on his shoulder and saw hetty standing beside him  i am so sorry walter is it very hard she said  ingleby took her hand and held it  i believe you are sorry he said after all old friends are best i have been a colossal idiot hetty and it does hurt a little to have the recognition of a fact of that kind suddenly forced on one still i must go back to the boys now there are several little points that must be decided before tomorrow     xxxii  his appointed station   a faint light was creeping across the snow when ingleby rose from his bed of cedar twigs behind the log and stood up shivering it was very cold and most of his companions were still sleeping though there were more of them than there had been the night before during the darkness a handful of strangers had come limping in and one of them had told him a somewhat astonishing story about trooper probyn he could grasp the significance of it but that was all for though the rapid was partly icebound now one white sluice of water still frothed about the tree and the sound it made seemed to keep his thoughts from crystallizing he was however glad of the distraction  a man who flung down an armful of fuel stopped and shook two or three of his comrades who got up and stretched themselves before they set about preparing their morning meal the pines had grown sharper in outline by the time it was finished and the snow beneath them had changed in hue and was now a flat lifeless white and though most of the men had risen the stillness was more impressive than ever ingleby had grown accustomed to the roar of the river and could have heard the slightest sound through its pulsations but there was nothing for him to hear beyond the sharp crackle of the fire and the restless movements of one or two of his companions the rest were expectantly watching the man upon the log but he stood motionless with his face turned steadfastly down the valley ingleby however felt the tension less than he might have done under different circumstances the game was up and he had no doubt that the law he had defied would crush him for his contumacy but that after all seemed of no great moment then his faith was shattered his hopes were gone and it only remained for him to exculpate his comrades as far as he could and face his downfall befittingly he took out his pipe and lighted it but the tobacco seemed tasteless and he let it go out again and sat listening until the man upon the log raised a warning hand and a faint tramp of feet came out of the silence there was a rhythm in it and he knew that slavin had come in with the troopers from westerhouse the men also heard it and ingleby stood up as they glanced at him  im afraid you have gained very little by listening to sewell or me boys but it might save confusion if you still leave me to do what i can for you he said the police will be here in two or three minutes and somebody must speak to them  there was a little murmur from the men which suggested sympathy with and confidence in him then one of them who was an american waved his hand  mr ingleby will go right ahead and hell find us behind him whatever he does he said it isnt his fault this thing didnt quite pan out as we had figured hes here just where hes wanted to see it out with us and anyway its a big cold bluff he and the rest of usa handful of placer miners of no accounthave put up on the british empire were beat but the man who wants anything has got to show he means to have it and theyll listen to the others because we shut our fist  again there was a murmur harsh but expressive and the man upon the log looked down  theyre taking front among the firs he said theres a stranger who must be slavin with them i guess theyll be wanting you  he sprang down and ingleby climbed up on the log there was a suggestive jingle and clatter among the trees where dusty shapes flitted in the shadows but two men were moving forward across the open strip of snow where the light was clearer and ingleby recognized one of them as coulthurst the other was a stranger who wore a somewhat ragged furcoat over his uniform they stopped near the barricade and coulthurst looked at ingleby the latter stood erect and very still with the smoke of the fire rising in a pale blue column behind him  i presume you are there to speak for your comrades said the major  your surmise is quite correct said ingleby  coulthurst turned towards his companion this is captain slavin in charge of the police detachment at westerhouse he has come in with enough of his men to make any attempt to oppose him likely to result in disaster to yourselves captain esmond being quite incapable of duty this affair is in his hands  ingleby raised his shapeless hat and wondered if this had been intended as a hint that he had no longer esmonds rancour to fear but the police officer who looked at him sharply made no sign of noticing the salute  well he said what does captain slavin want  in the first place the unconditional surrender of sewell leger and yourself  that can be counted on so far as leger and i are concerned sewell is no longer in the valley what comes next  the dispersing of the men you have with you  which implies the arrest of tomlinson asked ingleby  it does naturally  well said ingleby we have heard your demands and now we would like to know what you have to offer  that said coulthurst is simply answered nothing whatever i may however say that as usual in an affair of the kind proceedings will only be taken against the recognized leadersyourself sewell and legerand that captain slavin intends to hold an inquiry on the spot into the death of trooper probyn  slavin at whom he glanced made a little gesture of concurrence  major coulthurst is correct he said you have however to understand that the inquiry is in no way a concession i have as it happens some information bearing on the case which has not come into captain esmonds possession that is all now what are you going to do  ingleby spent little time in consideration the attitude of the two officers was just what he had expected it would be they could make no concession but coulthurst had nevertheless conveyed the impression that they would by no means proceed to extremities  in ten minutes leger and i will give ourselves up and you will not find a man behind the tree he said that is on condition that you wait with your men among the firs yonder until the time is up  slavin made a sign of comprehension and when he moved back with coulthurst ingleby turned to the miners  its all fixed now boys he said leger and i decided last night to give ourselves up you couldnt have prevented us and all we wanted for tomlinson was a straight inquiry on the spot now i want you to slip away quietly and hang your rifles up where you keep them you have to remember that the police dont know who held up the outpost and have nothing definite against anybody but myself and leger  the men went reluctantly and when the ten minutes had expired ingleby and leger climbed down from the log two troopers accompanied them to the outpost where when ingleby had spoken a few words to slavin they were left to their reflections for several hours then there was a tramp of feet outside and a trooper led them into the adjoining room where coulthurst and slavin sat the door was open and the corporal and a cluster of miners stood just outside a carbine lay upon the table in front of slavin who turned to the miners as ingleby came in  i want you to understand that this is not a trial boys he said its an inquiry into the death of trooper probyn and i expect the truth from you i have seen prospector tomlinson and ill now ask the corporal to give us his account of what happened the night probyn disappeared  there was a little movement among the miners and one or two of them glanced significantly at ingleby slavin it seemed had already gained their confidence and they felt that if tomlinson was sent down for trial it would be because he was guilty then the corporal told his story briefly and admitted that ingleby had differed from him concerning the locality in which one of the shots had apparently been fired after that several of the miners narrated how they had assisted to draw probyn from the river and the discovery of the bulletwound in him  slavin who listened to them quietly nodded and signed to ingleby you didnt agree with the corporal that the shots were fired in the same place  no sir said ingleby one of them i feel certain came from quite an opposite direction the corporal was busy at the time or he would have recognized it  the men who have just spoken were correct in their account of what sewell did when trooper probyn had been taken out of the water  yes sir  did sewell remove anything from the body  he did and ingleby took a little packet from his pocket and opened it these leaves they had evidently been placed upon the wound he said probyn could not have placed them there himself and they were what the indians often used to stanch a flow of blood  slavin glanced at the desiccated fragments and turned to the miners have any of you heard of the indians using a plant for that purpose  i guess i have said one one of them tried to fix up a partner of mine whod cut himself chopping with the thing it didnt seem to work on a white man  slavin nodded i believe there is such a plant he said now so far as we have gone circumstances seem to point to probyn having been shot by a man who afterwards tried to save him he used a plant that only the indians seem to believe in come right in corporal do you recognize this carbine  a trace of astonishment crept into the corporals face as he took up the weapon  yes sir he said its probyns am i quite sure i know the number and that dint under the barrel he fell and struck it on a rock one day when i was with him  well said slavin who took out a little book thats all i want from you now boys this inquiry is in my hands but i dont know of any reason i shouldnt read you a little statement that was made on oath to me by a prospector who brought this carbine into westerhouse gully  i was working on a benchclaim back under the range when an indian came along he said he had a carbine with him offered to sell it me for tea and flour as he was lighting out of the country this is just what he told me he was hired to take two troopers from green river across the range and was waiting for them just after sundown hed heard a black bear moving rounda black bear doesnt worry much about the noise he makesand when something came smashing through a thicket he loosed off at it it was getting kind of dark and when he clawed into the thicket he found hed got the trooper who as the trail was steep there had left his horse did what he could to save him but the man died and the indian got scared that the folks he pitched the tale to wouldnt believe him that was why he dragged the trooper under a big rock by the river and put some stones and branches on him somehow the horse got away from him though he fired at it he didnt want that horse walking round making trouble i gave him the flour and tea and kept the troopers carbine  slavin closed the book and looked at the men now he said who would you say killed that trooper  the indian sure said somebody and there was a murmur of concurrence from the rest  well said slavin drily i believe he did anyway no proceedings will be taken against anybody in this valley tell the boys to light out corporal  the miners went away contented they understood and appreciated men of slavins kind then the latter turned and looked reflectively at leger and ingleby  its quite a good thing you had sense enough to keep the boys off their rifles he said if there had been any shooting you would have found yourselves unpleasantly fixed  his face was quietly grave but there was the faintest suggestion of a twinkle in coulthursts eyes  i at least saw no weapons among them he said  well said slavin that simplifies the thing still you see you cant go holding up police outposts and heaving troopers about with impunity wheres the man who set you up to it  i almost think it was the drift of circumstances rather than mr sewell that was to blame said leger anyway i expect he is a considerable distance from the valley by this time in fact its scarcely likely that you could overtake him and theres nothing to show which trail he has taken  it occurred to ingleby that it was somewhat astonishing that such a capable officer as slavin appeared to be had allowed so much time to pass before he asked the question that however was slavins business  well said the latter if i had a little more to go upon i might make quite a serious thing out of this as it is all im very sure about is that you and your partner conspired to prevent the troopers getting at tomlinson but as tomlinson didnt kill probyn that doesnt count for so much after all still we have no use for you up here just now and you have two days in which to clear out of the valley tomlinson will get his ticket too when hes able to take the trail  that would mean the sequestration of our claims said ingleby  exactly youre not compelled to go stay right here if youd sooner and take your chances of any charge i may be able to work up against you  ingleby looked at leger who made a little sign  i think wed better go he said still while i have no regret for anything i have done i should like to thank major coulthurst for what is from his point of view a clemency we scarcely expected  slavin smiled somewhat drily you dont want to make any mistake the major has done what he considers most advisablejust that and nothing else now before you light out take a hint from me canadas quite a big country but the law of the empire it belongs to is even a bigger thing you have come off pretty well this timebut dont try it again  ingleby made coulthurst a little grave inclination in spite of captain slavins explanation i feel we owe you a good deal sir he said still i think hes right in one respect we attempted too big a thing henceforward well go to work little by little in a different way we have taken the wrong one but the hope that led us into it is just as strong as ever  coulthurst smiled a little  long before its realized you and i will be dead if i ever come across you again under different circumstances it will be a pleasure he said  ingleby turned and went out taking leger with him but he left the latter among the pines and swung into the trail that led past the gold commissioners dwelling he did not know whether he wished to see grace or not but as it happened she came out on the veranda as he passed and stopped him with a little sign  you are going away walter she asked  yes said ingleby in all probability i shall never come back  the girls cheeks were flushed and there was a curious strained look in her eyes  you seem she said quite willing to go  ingleby looked at her gravely it hurts me less than i expected it would have done still even if i had been permitted why should i wish to stay i am poor again and it is very likely shall always be so there are barriers between you and me which can never be got over  you didnt believe that once  no said ingleby still i am wiser now and what i may have to suffer is no more than my desert for believing that any man is warranted in trying to thrust himself above the station he was meant to occupy that however isnt after all very much to the purpose  i suppose and there was a tremor in the girls voice you blame me for all that has happened  inglebys eyes were still fixed upon her with disconcerting steadiness it is not my part to reproach you but i know what you did you have wrecked the life of my best friend and turned into a traitor a man whose work and words brought hope to thousands sewell will never lift his head again  he spoke slowly and a trifle hoarsely but there was a hardness and resolution in his voice which struck a chill through the girl  what did he tell you walter she said  very little in fact only that he had told you the way to westerhouse but that was quite enough i do not know whether you told him that you loved him or not but it is quite plain to me that you made him think so men of his kind do not betray those who believe in them without a reason  walter said the girl very softly i wonder ifyouever really loved me  ingleby winced but there was still no wavering in his eyes i do not know he said you are the most beautiful woman i ever met and i believed i did most likely your beauty and all that you stood for dazzled me and i lost my head it may have been thati do not knowfor if i had really loved you i should perhaps have forgiven you everything  and that is too much for you  ingleby stood silent a moment if you had loved me you would never have betrayed me i am afraid it is  grace looked at him steadily with the colour in her cheeks and her voice was a little tremulous  perhaps i wouldntlike you i do not know then she held out her hand dont think too hardly of me goodbye walter  ingleby touched her fingers for he dared not trust himself further and swinging his shapeless hat off abruptly turned away while grace stood very still until the shadows of the pines closed about him that was the last she ever saw of him  it was half an hour later when he walked quietly into the bakery and came upon hetty getting her few belongings together  i have come backto the people and the place i belong to you will not turn me out he said  hettys eyes shone softly we have been waiting for you walterwe knew you would come still im not sure you can ever get quite back to where you were before  ingleby saw her meaning for he remembered the locket and it seemed that hetty knew what he was thinking for a little colour crept into her face  well he said i will be patient and try very hard  then he heard footsteps and going out met leger at the door the latter turned and came down the trail with him  we are taking the trail tomorrow are you coming with us he said  of course said ingleby looking at him in blank astonishment  in that case there is something to be saidand it is difficult but hetty is my sister after all do you know who gave her that locket  i did said ingleby a long while ago but i never fancied that she had kept it tom i do not know what your sister thinks of me but she cant think more hardly of me than i do still there may be one or two other colossal idiots of my description  its quite likely said leger drily that however isnt very much to the point is it  ingleby stood silent a moment tom he said as you found out its difficultand i dont understand the thing myself perhaps miss coulthurst dazzled me and ive been off my balance ever since i came into this valley but i know now that if i ever marry anybody it will be hetty thats a very indifferent compliment to your sister she will probably be a very long while forgiving me but i may perhaps at last persuade her to believe in me again now are you going to turn me away  no said leger after that i fancy we can face together what comes  it was early next morning when they left the valley with an escort of twenty miners to help them across the divide and hetty stood by inglebys side when they turned for a moment to look back from among the climbing pines then as they turned again ingleby met the girls clear eyes  it may be a long while hetty but i think i shall get quite back after all he said it was in ever wanting to go away that i was horribly wrong   the end
