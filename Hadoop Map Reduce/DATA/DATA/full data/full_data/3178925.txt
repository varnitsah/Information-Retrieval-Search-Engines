there are many of us in england who consider the crime which has been wrought in the congo lands by king leopold of belgium and his followers to be the greatest which has ever been known in human annals personally i am strongly of that opinion there have been great expropriations like that of the normans in england or of the english in ireland there have been massacres of populations like that of the south americans by the spaniards or of subject nations by the turks but never before has there been such a mixture of wholesale expropriation and wholesale massacre all done under an odious guise of philanthropy and with the lowest commercial motives as a reason it is this sordid cause and the unctious hypocrisy which makes this crime unparalleled in its horror  the witnesses of the crime are of all nations and there is no possibility of error concerning facts there are british consuls like casement thesiger mitchell and armstrong all writing in their official capacity with every detail of fact and date there are frenchmen like pierre mille and f√©licien challaye both of whom have written books upon the subject there are missionaries of many racesharris weeks and stannard british morrison clarke and shepherd american sjoblom swedish and father vermeersch the jesuit there is the eloquent action of the italian government who refused to allow italian officers to be employed any longer in such hangmans work and there is the report of the belgian commission the evidence before which was suppressed because it was too dreadful for publication finally there is the incorruptible evidence of the kodak any american citizen who will glance at mark twains king leopolds soliloquy will see some samples of that a perusal of all of these sources of information will show that there is not a grotesque obscene or ferocious torture which human ingenuity could invent which has not been used against these harmless and helpless people  this would to my mind warrant our intervention in any case turkey has several times been interfered with simply on the general ground of humanity there is in this instance a very special reason why america and england should not stand by and see these people done to death they are in a sense their wards america was the first to give official recognition to king leopolds enterprise in 1884 and so has the responsibility of having actually put him into that position which he has so dreadfully abused she has been the indirect and innocent cause of the whole tragedy surely some reparation is due on the other hand england has with the other european powers signed the treaty of 1885 by which each and all of them make it responsible for the condition of the native races the other powers have so far shown no desire to live up to this pledge but the conscience of england is uneasy and she is slowly rousing herself to act will america be behind  at this moment two american citizens shepherd and that noble virginian morrison are about to be tried at boma for telling the truth about the scoundrels morrison in the dock makes a finer statue of liberty than bartholdis in new york harbour  attempts will be made in america for the congo has its paid apologists everywhere to pretend that england wants to oust belgium from her colony and take it herself such accusations are folly to run a tropical colony honestly without enslaving the natives is an expensive process for example nigeria the nearest english colony has to be subsidized to the extent of 2000000 a year whoever takes over the congo will considering its present demoralized condition have a certain expense of 10000000 a year for twenty years belgium has not run the colony it has simply sacked it forcing the inhabitants without pay to ship everything of value to antwerp no decent european power could do this for many years to come the congo will be a heavy expense and it will truly be a philanthropic call upon the next owner i trust it will not fall to england  attempts have been made too for there is considerable ingenuity and unlimited money on the other side to pretend that it is a question of protestant missions against catholic any one who thinks this should read the book la question kongolaise of the eloquent and holy jesuit father vermeersch he lived in the country and as he says it was the sight of the immeasurable misery which drove him to write  we english who are earnest over this matter look eagerly to the westward to see some sign of moral support of material leading it would be a grand sight to see the banner of humanity and civilization carried forward in such a cause by the two great englishspeaking nations  arthur conan doyle     introduction   i am convinced that the reason why public opinion has not been more sensitive upon the question of the congo free state is that the terrible story has not been brought thoroughly home to the people mr e d morel has done the work of ten men and the congo reform association has struggled hard with very scanty means but their time and energies have for the most part been absorbed in dealing with each fresh phase of the situation as it arose there is room therefore as it seemed to me for a general account which would cover the whole field and bring the matter up to date this account must necessarily be a superficial one if it is to be produced at such a size and such a price as will ensure its getting at that general public for which it has been prepared yet it contains the essential facts and will enable the reader to form his own opinion upon the situation  should he after reading it desire to help in the work of forcing this question to the front he can do so in several ways he can join the congo reform association granville house arundel street w c he can write to his local member and aid in getting up local meetings to ventilate the question finally he can pass this book on and purchase other copies for any profits will be used in setting the facts before the french and german public  it may be objected that this is ancient history and that the greater part of it refers to a period before the congo state was annexed to belgium on august 10th 1908 but responsibility cannot be so easily shaken off the congo state was founded by the belgian king and exploited by belgian capital belgian soldiers and belgian concessionnaires it was defended and upheld by successive belgian governments who did all they could to discourage the reformers in spite of legal quibbles it is an insult to common sense to suppose that the responsibility for the congo has not always rested with belgium the belgian machinery was always ready to help and defend the state but never to hold it in control and restrain it from crime  one chance belgium had if immediately upon taking over the state they had formed a judicial commission for the rigid inspection of the whole matter with power to punish for all past offences and to examine all the scandals of recent years then they would have done something to clear the past if on the top of that they had freed the land given up the system of forced labour entirely and cancelled the charters of all the concessionnaire companies for the obvious reason that they have notoriously abused their powers then belgium could go forward in its colonizing enterprise on the same terms as other states with her sins expiated so far as expiation is now possible  she did none of these things for a year now she has herself persevered in the evil ways of her predecessor her colony is a scandal before the whole world the era of murders and mutilations has as we hope passed by but the country is sunk into a state of cowed and hopeless slavery it is not a new story but merely another stage of the same story when belgium took over the congo state she took over its history and its responsibilities also what a load that was is indicated in these pages  the record of the dates is the measure of our patience can any one say that we are precipitate if we now brush aside vain words and say definitely that the matter has to be set right by a certain near date or that we will appeal to each and all of the powers with the evidence before them to assist us in setting it right if the powers refuse to do so then it is our duty to honour the guarantees which we made as to the safety of these poor people and to turn to the task of setting it right ourselves if the powers join in or give us a mandate all the better but we have a mandate from something higher than the powers which obliges us to act  sir edward grey has told us in his speech of july 22nd 1909 that a danger to european peace lies in the matter let us look this danger squarely in the face whence does it come is it from germany with her traditions of kindly home lifeis this the power which would raise a hand to help the butchers of the mongalla and of the domaine de la couronne is it likely that those who so justly admire the splendid private and public example of william ii would draw the sword for leopold both in the name of trade rights and in that of humanity germany has a long score to settle on the congo or is it the united states which would stand in the way when her citizens have vied with our own in withstanding and exposing these iniquities or lastly is france the danger there are those who think that because france has capital invested in these enterprises because the french congo has itself degenerated under the influence and example of its neighbour and because france holds a right of preemption that therefore our trouble lies across the channel for my own part i cannot believe it i know too well the generous chivalrous instincts of the french people i know also that their colonial record during centuries has been hardly inferior to our own such traditions are not lightly set aside and all will soon be right again when a strong colonial minister turns his attention to the concessionnaires in the french congo they will remember de brazzas dying words our congo must not be turned into a mongalla it is an impossibility that france could ally herself with king leopold and certainly if such were indeed the case the entente cordiale would be strained to breaking surely then if these three powers the ones most directly involved have such obvious reasons for helping rather than hindering we may go forward without fear but if it were not so if all europe frowned upon our enterprise we would not be worthy to be the sons of our fathers if we did not go forward on the plain path of national duty  arthur conan doyle    windlesham crowborough       september 1909     contents                                                     page    preface

earlier years of his reign king leopold of belgium began to display that interest in central africa which for a long time was ascribed to nobility and philanthropy until the contrast between such motives and the actual unscrupulous commercialism became too glaring to be sustained as far back as the year 1876 he called a conference of humanitarians and travellers who met at brussels for the purpose of debating various plans by which the dark continent might be opened up from this conference sprang the socalled international african association which in spite of its name was almost entirely a belgian body with the belgian king as president its professed object was the exploration of the country and the founding of stations which should be resthouses for travellers and centres of civilization  on the return of stanley from his great journey in 1878 he was met at marseilles by a representative from the king of belgium who enrolled the famous traveller as an agent for his association the immediate task given to stanley was to open up the congo for trade and to make such terms with the natives as would enable stations to be built and dep√¥ts established in 1879 stanley was at work with characteristic energy his own intentions were admirable we shall require but mere contact he wrote to satisfy the natives that our intentions are pure and honourable seeking their own good materially and socially more than our own interests we go to spread what blessings arise from amiable and just intercourse with people who have been strangers to them stanley was a hard man but he was no hypocrite what he said he undoubtedly meant it is worth remarking in view of the accounts of the laziness or stupidity of the natives given by king leopolds apologists in order to justify their conduct toward them that stanley had the very highest opinion of their industry and commercial ability the following extracts from his writings set this matter beyond all doubt      bolobo is a great centre for the ivory and camwood powder trade     principally because its people are so enterprising  of irebua venice of the congohe says      these people were really acquainted with many lands and tribes on the     upper congo from stanley pool to upoto a distance of 6000 miles     they knew every landingplace on the river banks all the ups and     downs of savage life all the profits and losses derived from barter     all the diplomatic arts used by tactful savages were as well known to     them as the roman alphabet to us no wonder that all this     commercial knowledge had left its traces on their faces indeed it is     the same as in your own cities in europe know you not the military     man among you the lawyer and the merchant the banker the artist or     the poet it is the same in africa more especially on the congo     where the people are so devoted to trade      during the few days of our mutual intercourse they gave us a high     idea of their qualitiesindustry after their own style not being     the least conspicuous      as in the old time umangi from the right bank and mpa from the     left bank despatched their representatives with ivory tusks large     and small goats and sheep and vegetable food clamorously demanding     that we should buy from them such urgent entreaties accompanied with     blandishments to purchase their stock were difficult to resist      i speak of eager native traders following us for miles for the     smallest piece of cloth i mention that after travelling many miles to     obtain cloth for ivory and redwood powder the despairing natives     asked well what is it you do want tell us and we will get it for     you  speaking of english scepticism as to king leopolds intentions he says      though they understand the satisfaction of a sentiment when applied     to england they are slow to understand that it may be a sentiment     that induced king leopold ii to father this international     association he is a dreamer like his confr√®res in the work     because the sentiment is applied to the neglected millions of the dark     continent they cannot appreciate rightly because there are no     dividends attaching to it this ardent vivifying and expansive     sentiment which seeks to extend civilizing influences among the dark     races and to brighten up with the glow of civilization the dark     places of sadbrowed africa  one cannot let these extracts pass without noting that bolobo the first place named by stanley has sunk in population from 40000 to 7000 that irebu called by stanley the populous venice of the congo had in 1903 a population of fifty that the natives who used to follow stanley beseeching him to trade now according to consul casement fly into the bush at the approach of a steamer and that the unselfish sentiment of king leopold ii has developed into dividends of 300 per cent per annum such is the difference between stanleys anticipation and the actual fulfilment  untroubled however with any vision as to the destructive effects of his own work stanley laboured hard among the native chiefs and returned to his employer with no less than 450 alleged treaties which transferred land to the association we have no record of the exact payment made in order to obtain these treaties but we have the terms of a similar transaction carried out by a belgian officer in 1883 at palabala in this case the payment made to the chief consisted of one coat of red cloth with gold facings one red cap one white tunic one piece of white baft one piece of red points one box of liqueurs four demijohns of rum two boxes of gin 128 bottles of gin twenty red handkerchiefs forty singlets and forty old cotton caps it is clear that in making such treaties the chief thought that he was giving permission for the establishment of a station the idea that he was actually bartering away the land was never even in his mind for it was held by a communal tenure for the whole tribe and it was not his to barter and yet it is on the strength of such treaties as these that twenty millions of people have been expropriated and the whole wealth and land of the country proclaimed to belong not to the inhabitants but to the statethat is to king leopold  with this sheaf of treaties in his portfolio the king of the belgians now approached the powers with high sentiments of humanitarianism and with a definite request that the state which he was forming should receive some recognized status among the nations was he at that time consciously hypocritical did he already foresee how widely his future actions would differ from his present professions it is a problem which will interest the historian of the future who may have more materials than we upon which to form a judgment on the one hand there was a furtive secrecy about the evolution of his plans and the despatch of his expeditions which should have no place in a philanthropic enterprise on the other hand there are limits to human powers of deception and it is almost inconceivable that a man who was acting a part could so completely deceive the whole civilized world it is more probable as it seems to me that his ambitious mind discerned that it was possible for him to acquire a field of action which his small kingdom could not give in mixing himself with the affairs of africa he chose the obvious path that of a civilizing and elevating mission taking the line of least resistance without any definite idea whither it might lead him once faced with the facts his astute brain perceived the great material possibilities of the country his early dreams faded away to be replaced by unscrupulous cupidity and step by step he was led downward until he the man of holy aspirations in 1885 stands now in 1909 with such a cloud of terrible direct personal responsibility resting upon him as no man in modern european history has had to bear  it is indeed ludicrous with our knowledge of the outcome to read the declarations of the king and of his representatives at that time they were actually forming the strictest of commercial monopoliesan organization which was destined to crush out all general private trade in a country as large as the whole of europe with russia omitted that was the admitted outcome of their enterprise now listen to m beernaert the belgian premier speaking in the year 1885      the state of which our king will be the sovereign will be a sort of     international colony there will be no monopolies no privileges     quite the contrary absolute freedom of commerce freedom of property     freedom of navigation  here too are the words of baron lambermont the belgian plenipotentiary at the berlin conference      the temptation to impose abusive taxes will find its corrective if     need be in the freedom of commerce no doubt exists as to the     strict and literal meaning of the term in commercial matters it     means  the unlimited right for every one to buy and to sell  the question of humanity is so pressing that it obscures that of the broken pledges about trade but on the latter alone there is ample reason to say that every condition upon which this state was founded has been openly and notoriously violated and that therefore its titledeeds are vitiated from the beginning  at the time the professions of the king made the whole world his enthusiastic allies the united states was the first to hasten to give formal recognition to the new state may it be the first also to realize the truth and to take public steps to retract what it has done the churches and the chambers of commerce of great britain were all for leopold the one attracted by the prospect of pushing their missions into the heart of africa the others delighted at the offer of an open market for their produce at the congress of berlin which was called to regulate the situation the nations vied with each other in furthering the plans of the king of the belgians and in extolling his high aims the congo free state was created amid general rejoicings the veteran bismarck as credulous as the others pronounced its baptismal blessing the new congo state is called upon said he to become one of the chief promoters of the work of civilization which we have in view and i pray for its prosperous development and for the fulfilment of the noble aspirations of its illustrious founder such was the birth of the congo free state had the nations gathered round been able to perceive its future the betrayal of religion and civilization of which it would be guilty the immense series of crimes which it would perpetrate throughout central africa the lowering of the prestige of all the white races they would surely have strangled the monster in its cradle  it is not necessary to record in this statement the whole of the provisions of the berlin congress two only will suffice as they are at the same time the most important and the most flagrantly abused the first of these which forms the fifth article of the agreement proclaims that no power which exercises sovereign rights in the said regions shall be allowed to grant therein either monopoly or privilege of any kind in commercial matters no words could be clearer than that but the belgian representatives conscious that such a clause must disarm all opposition went out of their way to accentuate it no privileged situation can be created in this respect they said the way remains open without any restriction to free competition in the sphere of commerce it would be interesting now to send a british or german trading expedition up the congo in search of that free competition which has been so explicitly promised and to see how it would fare between the monopolist government and the monopolist companies who have divided the land between them we have travelled some distance since prince bismarck at the last sitting of the conference declared that the result was to secure to the commerce of all nations free access to the centre of the african continent  more important however is article vi both on account of the issues at stake and because the signatories of the treaty bound themselves solemnly in the name of almighty god to watch over its enforcement it ran all the powers exercising sovereign rights or influence in these territories pledge themselves to watch over the preservation of the native populations and the improvement of their moral and material conditions of existence and to work together for the suppression of slavery and of the slave trade that was the pledge of the united nations of europe it is a disgrace to each of them including ourselves the way in which they have fulfilled that oath before their eyes as i shall show in the sequel they have had enacted one long horrible tragedy vouched for by priests and missionaries traders travellers and consuls all corroborated but in no way reformed by a belgium commission of inquiry they have seen these unhappy people who were their wards robbed of all they possessed debauched degraded mutilated tortured murdered all on such a scale as has never to my knowledge occurred before in the whole course of history and now after all these years with all the facts notorious we are still at the stage of polite diplomatic expostulations it is no answer to say that france and germany have shown even less regard for the pledge they took at berlin an individual does not condone the fact that he has broken his word by pointing out that his neighbour has done the same     ii  the development of the congo state   having received his mandate from the civilized world king leopold proceeded to organize the government of the new state which was in theory to be independent of belgium although ruled by the same individual in europe king leopold was a constitutional monarch in africa an absolute autocrat there were chosen three ministers for the new statefor foreign affairs for finances and for internal affairs but it cannot be too clearly understood that they and their successors up to 1908 were nominated by the king paid by the king answerable only to the king and in all ways simply so many upper clerks in his employ the workings of one policy and of one brain as capable as it is sinister are to be traced in every fresh development if the ministers were ever meant to be a screen it is a screen which is absolutely transparent the origin of everything is the kingalways the king m van ectvelde one of the three head agents put the matter into a single sentence cest √† votre majest√© quappartient l√âtat they were simply stewards who managed the estate with a very alert and observant owner at their back  one of the early acts was enough to make observers a little thoughtful it was the announcement of the right to issue laws by arbitrary decrees without publishing them in europe there should be secret laws which could at any instant be altered the bulletin officiel announced that tous les actes du gouvernement quil y a int√©r√™t √† rendre publics seront ins√©r√©s au bulletin officiel already it is clear that something was in the wind which might shock the rather leathery conscience of a european concert meanwhile the organization of the state went forward a governorgeneral was elected who should live at boma which was made the capital under him were fifteen district commissaries who should govern so many districts into which the whole country was divided the only portion which was at that time at all developed was the semicivilized lower congo at the mouth of the river there lay the white population the upper reaches of the stream and of its great tributaries were known only to a few devoted missionaries and enterprising explorers grenfell and bentley of the missions with von wissman the german and the everenergetic stanley were the pioneers who during the few years which followed opened up the great hinterland which was to be the scene of such atrocious events  but the work of the explorer had soon to be supplemented and extended by the soldier whilst the belgians had been entering the congo land from the west the slavedealing arabs had penetrated from the east passing down the river as far as stanley falls there could be no compromise between such opposite forces though some attempt was made to find one by electing the arab leader as free state governor there followed a long scrambling campaign carried on for many years between the arab slavers on the one side and the congo forces upon the otherthe latter consisting largely of cannibal tribesmen of the stone age armed with the weapons of the nineteenth century the suppression of the slave trade is a good cause but the means by which it was effected and the use of barbarians who ate in the evening those whom they had slain during the day are as bad as the evil itself yet there is no denying the energy and ability of the congo leaders especially of baron dhanis by the year 1894 the belgian expeditions had been pushed as far as lake tanganyika the arab strongholds had fallen and dhanis was able to report to brussels that the campaign was at an end and that slaveraiding was no more the new state could claim that they had saved a part of the natives from slavery how they proceeded to impose upon all of them a yoke compared to which the old slavery was merciful will be shown in these pages from the time of the fall of the arab power the congo free state was only called upon to use military force in the case of mutinies of its own black troops and of occasional risings of its own tormented citizens master of its own house it could settle down to exploit the country which it had won  in the meantime the internal policy of the state showed a tendency to take an unusual and sinister course i have already expressed my opinion that king leopold was not guilty of conscious hypocrisy in the beginning that his intentions were vaguely philanthropic and that it was only by degrees that he sank to the depths which will be shown this view is borne out by some of the earlier edicts of the state in 1886 a long pronouncement upon native lands ended by the words all acts or agreements are forbidden which tend to the expulsion of natives from the territory they occupy or to deprive them directly or indirectly of their liberty or their means of existence such are the words of 1886 before the end of 1887 an act had been published though not immediately put into force which had the exactly opposite effect by this act all lands which were not actually occupied by natives were proclaimed to be the property of the state consider for a moment what this meant no land in such a country is actually occupied by natives save the actual site of their villages and the scanty fields of grain or manioc which surround them everywhere beyond these tiny patches extend the plains and forests which have been the ancestral wandering places of the natives and which contain the rubber the camwood the copal the ivory and the skins which are the sole objects of their commerce at a single stroke of a pen in brussels everything was taken from them not only the country but the produce of the country how could they trade when the state had taken from them everything which they had to offer how could the foreign merchant do business when the state had seized everything and could sell it for itself direct in europe thus within two years of the establishment of the state by the treaty of berlin it had with one hand seized the whole patrimony of those natives for whose moral and material advantage it had been so solicitous and with the other hand it had torn up that clause in the treaty by which monopolies were forbidden and equal trade rights guaranteed to all how blind were the powers not to see what sort of a creature they had made and how shortsighted not to take urgent steps in those early days to make it retrace its steps and find once more the path of loyalty and justice a firm word a stern act at that time in the presence of this flagrant breach of international agreement would have saved all central africa from the horror which has come upon it would have screened belgium from a lasting disgrace and would have spared europe a question which has already as it seems to me lowered the moral standing of all the nations and the end of which is not yet  having obtained possession of the land and its products the next step was to obtain labour by which these products could be safely garnered the first definite move in this direction was taken in the year 1888 when with that odious hypocrisy which has been the last touch in so many of these transactions an act was produced which was described in the bulletin officiel as being for the special protection of the black it is evident that the real protection of the black in matters of trade was to offer him such pay as would induce him to do a days work and to let him choose his own employment as is done with the kaffirs of south africa or any other native population this act had a very different end it allowed blacks to be bound over in terms of seven years service to their masters in a manner which was in truth indistinguishable from slavery as the negotiations were usually carried on with the capita or headman the unfortunate servant was transferred with small profit to himself and little knowledge of the conditions of his servitude under the same system the state also enlisted its employees including the recruits for its small army this army was supplemented by a wild militia consisting of various barbarous tribes many of them cannibals and all of them capable of any excess of cruelty or outrage a german august boshart in his zehn jahre afrikanischen lebens has given us a clear idea of how these tribes are recruited and of the precise meaning of the attractive word lib√©r√© when applied to a state servant some district commissary he says receives instructions to furnish a certain number of men in a given time he puts himself in communication with the chiefs and invites them to a palaver at his residence these chiefs as a rule already have an inkling of what is coming and if made wise by experience make a virtue of necessity and present themselves in that case the negotiations run their course easily enough each chief promises to supply a certain number of slaves and receives presents in return it may happen however that one or another pays no heed to the friendly invitation in which case war is declared his villages are burned down perhaps some of his people are shot and his stores or gardens are plundered in this way the wild king is soon tamed and he sues for peace which of course is granted on condition of his supplying double the number of slaves these men are entered in the state books as lib√©r√©s to prevent their running away they are put in irons and sent on the first opportunity to one of the military camps where their irons are taken off and they are drafted into the army the district commissary is paid ¬£2 sterling for every serviceable recruit  having taken the country and secured labour for exploiting it in the way described king leopold proceeded to take further steps for its development all of them exceedingly well devised for the object in view the great impediment to the navigation of the congo had lain in the continuous rapids which made the river impassable from stanley pool for three hundred miles down to boma at the mouth a company was now formed to find the capital by which a railway should be built between these two points the construction was begun in 1888 and was completed in 1898 after many financial vicissitudes forming a work which deserves high credit as a piece of ingenious engineering and of sustained energy other commercial companies of which more will be said hereafter were formed in order to exploit large districts of the country which the state was not yet strong enough to handle by this arrangement the companies found the capital for exploring station building etc while the statethat is the kingretained a certain portion usually half of the companys shares the plan itself is not necessarily a vicious one indeed it closely resembles that under which the chartered company of rhodesia grants mining and other leases the scandal arose from the methods by which these companies proceeded to carry out their endsthose methods being the same as were used by the state on whose pattern these smaller organizations were moulded  in the meantime king leopold feeling the weakness of his personal position in face of the great enterprise which lay before him in africa endeavoured more and more to draw belgium as a state into the matter already the congo state was largely the outcome of belgian work and of belgian money but theoretically there was no connection between the two countries now the belgian parliament was won over to advancing ten million francs for the use of the congo and thus a direct connection sprang up which has eventually led to annexation at the time of this loan king leopold let it be known that he had left the congo free state in his will to belgium in this document appear the words a young and spacious state directed from brussels has pacifically appeared in the sunlight thanks to the benevolent support of the powers that have welcomed its appearance some belgians administer it while others each day more numerous there increase their wealth so he flashed the gold before the eyes of his european subjects verily if king leopold deceived other powers he reserved the most dangerous of all his deceits for his own country the day on which they turned from their own honest healthy development to follow the congo lure and to administer without any previous colonial experience a country more than sixty times their own size will prove to have been a dark day in belgian history  the berlin conference of 1885 marks the first international session upon the affairs of the congo the second was the brussels conference of 188990 it is amazing to find that after these years of experience the powers were still ready to accept king leopolds professions at their face value it is true that none of the more sinister developments had been conspicuous but the legislation of the state with regard to labour and trade was already such as to suggest the turn which affairs would take in future if not curbed by a strong hand one power and one only holland had the sagacity to appreciate the true situation and the independence to show its dissatisfaction the outcome of the sittings was various philanthropic resolutions intended to strengthen the new state in dealing with that slave trade it was destined to reintroduce in its most odious form we are too near to these events and they are too painfully intimate to permit us to see humour in them but the historian of the future when he reads that the object of the european concert was to protect effectually the aboriginal inhabitants of africa may find it difficult to suppress a smile this was the last european assembly to deal with the affairs of the congo may the next be for the purpose of taking steps to truly carry out those high ends which have been forever spoken of and never reduced to practice  the most important practical outcome of the brussels conference was that the powers united to free the new state from those free port promises which it had made in 1885 and to permit it in future to levy ten per cent upon imports the act was hung up for two years owing to the opposition of holland but the fact of its adoption by the other powers and the renewed mandate given to king leopold strengthened the position of the new state to such an extent that it found no difficulty in securing a further loan from belgium of twentyfive millions of francs upon condition that after ten years belgium should have the option of taking over the congo lands as a colony  if in the years which immediately succeeded the brussels conferencefrom 1890 to 1894a birdseye view could be taken of the enormous river which with its tributaries forms a great twisted fan radiating over the whole centre of africa one would mark in all directions symptoms of european activity at the lower congo one would see crowds of natives impressed for the service and guarded by black soldiers working at the railway at boma and at leopoldsville the two termini of the projected line cities are rising with stations wharves and public buildings in the extreme southeast one would see an expedition under stairs exploring and annexing the great district of katanga which abuts upon northern rhodesia in the furthest northeast and along the whole eastern border small military expeditions would be disclosed fighting against rebellious blacks or arab raiders then along all the lines of the rivers posts were being formed and stations establishedsome by the state and some by the various concessionnaire companies for the development of their commerce  in the meantime the state was tightening its grip upon the land with its products and was working up the system which was destined to produce such grim results in the near future the independent traders were discouraged and stamped out belgium as well as dutch english and french some of the loudest protests against the new order may be taken from belgian sources everywhere in flagrant disregard of the treaty of berlin the state proclaimed itself to be the sole landlord and the sole trader in some cases it worked its own socalled property in other cases it leased it even those who had striven to help king leopold in the earlier stages of his enterprise were thrown overboard major parminter himself engaged in trade upon the congo sums up the situation in 1902 as follows to sum up the application of the new decrees of the government signifies this that the state considers as its private property the whole of the congo basin excepting the sites of the natives villages and gardens it decrees that all the products of this immense region are its private property and it monopolizes the trade in them as regards the primitive proprietors the native tribes they are dispossessed by a simple circular permission is graciously granted to them to collect such products but only on condition that they bring them for sale to the state for whatever the latter may be pleased to give them as regards alien traders they are prohibited in all this territory from trading with the natives  everywhere there were stern ordersto the natives on the one hand that they had no right to gather the products of their own forests to independent traders on the other hand that they were liable to punishment if they bought anything from the natives in january 1892 district commissary baert wrote the native of the district of ubangiwelle are not authorized to gather rubber it has been notified to them that they can only receive permission to do so on condition that they gather the produce for the exclusive benefit of the state captain le marinel a little later is even more explicit i have decided he says to enforce rigorously the rights of the state over its domain and in consequence cannot allow the natives to convert to their own profit or to sell to others any part of the rubber or ivory forming the fruits of the domain traders who purchase or attempt to purchase such fruits of this domain from the nativeswhich fruits the state only authorizes the natives to gather subject to the condition that they are brought to itrender themselves in my opinion guilty of receiving stolen goods and i shall denounce them to the judicial authorities so that proceedings may be taken against them this last edict was in the bangala district but it was followed at once by another from the more settled equateur district which shows that the strict adoption of the system was universal in may 1892 lieutenant lemaire proclaims considering that no concession has been granted to gather rubber in the domains of the state within this district 1 natives can only gather rubber on condition of selling the same to the state 2 any person or persons or vessels having in his or their possession or on board more than one kilogramme of rubber will have a proc√®sverbal drawn up against him or them or it and the ship can be confiscated without prejudice to any subsequent proceedings  the sight of these insignificant lieutenants and captains who are often noncommissioned officers of the belgian army issuing proclamations which were in distinct contradiction to the expressed will of all the great powers of the world might at the time have seemed ludicrous but the history of the next seventeen years was to prove that a small malignant force driven on by greed may prove to be more powerful than a vague general philanthropy strong only in good intentions and platitudes during these yearsfrom 1890 to 1895whatever indignation might be felt among traders over the restrictions placed upon them the only news received by the general public from the congo free state concerned the founding of new stations and the idea prevailed that king leopolds enterprise was indeed working out upon the humanitarian lines which had been originally planned then for the first time incidents occurred which gave some glimpse of the violence and anarchy which really prevailed  the first of these so far as great britain is concerned lay in the treatment of natives from sierra leone lagos and other british settlements who had been engaged by the belgians to come to congoland and help in railway construction and other work coming from the settled order of such a colony as sierra leone or lagos these natives complained loudly when they found themselves working side by side with impressed congolese and under the discipline of the armed sentinels of the force publique they were discontented and the discontent was met by corporal punishment the matter grew to the dimensions of a scandal  in answer to a question asked in the house of commons on march 12th 1896 mr chamberlain as secretary of state for the colonies stated that complaints had been received of these british subjects having been employed without their consent as soldiers and of their having been cruelly flogged and in some cases shot and he added they were engaged with the knowledge of her majestys representatives and every possible precaution was taken in their interests but in consequence of the complaints received the recruitment of labourers for the congo has been prohibited  this refusal of the recruitment of labourers by great britain was the first public and national sign of disapproval of congolese methods a few years later a more pointed one was given when the italian war ministry refused to allow their officers to serve with the congo forces  early in 1895 occurred the stokes affair which moved public opinion deeply both in this country and in germany charles henry stokes was an englishman by birth but he resided in german east africa was the recipient of a german decoration for his services on behalf of german colonization and formed his trading caravans from a german base with east african natives as his porters he had led such a caravan over the congo state border when he was arrested by captain lothaire an officer in command of some congolese troops the unfortunate stokes may well have thought himself safe as the subject of one great power and the agent of another but he was tried instantly in a most informal manner upon a charge of selling guns to the natives was condemned and was hanged on the following morning when captain lothaire reported his proceedings to his superiors they signified their approbation by promoting him to the high rank of commissaireg√©n√©ral  the news of this tragedy excited as much indignation in berlin as in london faced with the facts the representatives of the free state in brusselsthat is the agents of the kingwere compelled to admit the complete illegality of the whole incident and could only fall back upon the excuse that lothaires action was bonafide and free from personal motive this is by no means certain for as baron von marschall pointed out to the acting british ambassador at berlin stokes was known to be a successful trader in ivory exporting it by the east route and so depriving the officers of the congo government of a ten per cent commission which would be received by them if it were exported by the west route this was the reason the report continued quoting the german statesmans words that he had been done away with and not on account of an alleged sale of arms to arabs his death being in fact not an act of justice but one of commercial protection neither more nor less  this was one reading of the situation whether it was a true one or not there could be no two opinions as to the illegality of the proceedings under pressure from england lothaire was tried at boma and acquitted he was again under the same pressure tried at brussels when the prosecuting counsel thought it consistent with his duty to plead for an acquittal and the proceedings became a fiasco there the matter was allowed to remain a blue book of 188 pages is the last monument to charles henry stokes and his executioner returned to high office in the congo free state where his name soon recurred in the accounts of the violent and highhanded proceedings which make up the history of that country he was appointed director of the antwerp society for the commerce of the congoan appointment for which king leopold must have been responsibleand he managed the affairs of that company until he was implicated in the mongalla massacres of which more will be said hereafter  it has been necessary to describe the case of stokes because it is historical but nothing is further from my intention than to address national amour propre in the matter it was a mere accident that stokes was an englishman and the outrage remains the same had he been a citizen of any state the cause i plead is too broad and also too lofty to be supported by any narrower appeals than those which may be addressed to all humanity i will proceed to describe a case which occurred a few years later to show that men of other nationalities suffered as well as the english stokes the englishman was killed and his death it was said by some congolese apologists was due to his not having after his summary trial announced that he would lodge an immediate appeal to the higher court at boma rabinck the austrian the victim of similar proceedings did appeal to the higher court at boma and it is interesting to see what advantage he gained by doing so  rabinck was as i have said an austrian from olmutz a man of a gentle and lovable nature popular with all who knew him and remarkable as several have testified for his just and kindly treatment of the natives he had for some years traded with the people of katanga which is the southeastern portion of the congo state where it abuts upon british central africa the natives were at the time in arms against the belgians but rabinck had acquired such influence among them that he was still able to carry on his trade in ivory and rubber for which he held a permit from the katanga company  shortly after receiving this permit for which he had paid a considerable sum certain changes were made in the company by which the state secured a controlling influence in it a new manager major weyns appeared who represented the new r√©gime superseding m l√©v√™que who had sold the permits in the name of the original company major weyns was zealous that the whole trade of the country should belong to the concessionnaire company which was practically the government according to the usual but internationally illegal habit of the state to secure this trade the first step was evidently to destroy so wellknown and successful a private trader as m rabinck in spite of his permits therefore a charge was trumped up against him of having traded illegally in rubberan offence which even if he had no permit was an impossibility in the face of that complete freedom of trade which was guaranteed by the treaty of berlin the young austrian could not bring himself to believe that the matter was serious his letters are extant showing that he regarded the matter as so preposterous that he could not feel any fears upon the subject he was soon to be undeceived and his eyes were opened too late to the character of the men and the organization with which he was dealing major weyns sat in courtmartial upon him the offence with which he was charged dealing illegally in rubber was one which could only be punished by a maximum imprisonment of a month this would not serve the purpose in view major weyns within forty minutes tried the case condemned the prisoner and sentenced him to a years imprisonment there was an attempt to excuse this monstrous sentence afterward by the assertion that the crime punished was that of selling guns to the natives but as a matter of fact there was at the time no mention of anything of the sort as is proved by the existing minutes of the trial rabinck naturally appealed against such a sentence he would have been wiser had he submitted to it in the nearest guardhouse in that case he might possibly have escaped with his life in the other he was doomed he will go said major weyns on such a nice little voyage that he will act like this no more and others will take example from it the voyage in question was the two thousand miles which separated katanga from the appeal court at boma he was to travel all this way under the sole escort of black soldiers who had their own instructions the unfortunate man felt that he could never reach his destination alive rumours have it he wrote to his relatives that europeans who have been taken are poisoned so if i disappear without further news you may guess what has become of me nothing more was heard from him save two agonized letters begging officials to speed him on his way he died as he had foreseen on the trip down the congo and was hurriedly buried in a wayside station when two hours more would have brought the body to leopoldville if it is possible to add a darker shadow to the black business it lies in the fact that the apologists of the state endeavoured to make the world believe that their victims death was due to his own habit of taking morphia the fact is denied by four creditable witnesses who knew him well but most of all is it denied by the activity and energy which had made him one of the leading traders of central africatoo good a trader to be allowed open competition with king leopolds huge commercial monopoly as a last and almost inconceivable touch the whole of the dead mans caravans and outfits amounting to some ¬£15000 were seized by those who had driven him to his death and by the last reports neither his relatives nor his creditors have received any portion of this large sum consider the whole story and say if it is exaggeration to state that gustav maria rabinck was robbed and murdered by the congo free state  having shown in these two examples the way in which the congo free state has dared to treat the citizens of european states who have traded within her borders i will now proceed to detail in chronological order some account of the dark story of that states relations to the subject races for whose moral and material advantage we and other european powers have answered for every case i chronicle there are a hundred which are known but which cannot here be dealt with for every one known there are ten thousand the story of which never came to europe consider how vast is the country and how few the missionaries or consuls who alone would report such matters consider also that every official of the congo state is sworn neither at the time nor afterward to reveal any matter that may have come to his knowledge consider lastly that the missionary or consul acts as a deterrent and that it is in the huge stretch of country where neither are to be found that the agent has his own unfettered way with all these considerations is it not clear that all the terrible facts which we know are but the mere margin of that welter of violence and injustice which the jesuit father vermeersch has summed up in the two words immeasurable misery     iii  the working of the system   having claimed as i have shown the whole of the land and therefore the whole of its products the statethat is the kingproceeded to construct a system by which these products could be gathered most rapidly and at least cost the essence of this system was that the people who had been dispossessed ironically called citizens were to be forced to gather for the profit of the state those very products which had been taken from them this was to be effected by two means the one taxation by which an arbitrary amount ever growing larger until it consumed almost their whole lives in the gathering should be claimed for nothing the other socalled barter by which the natives were paid for the stuff exactly what the state chose to give and in the form the state chose to give it there being no competition allowed from any other purchaser this remuneration ridiculous in value took the most absurd shape the natives being compelled to take it whatever the amount and however little they might desire it consul thesiger in 1908 describing their socalled barter says the goods he proceeds to distribute giving a hat to one man or an iron hoehead to another and so on each recipient is then at the end of a month responsible for so many balls of rubber no choice of the objects is given no refusal is allowed if any one makes any objection the stuff is thrown down at his door and whether it is taken or left the man is responsible for so many balls at the end of the month the total amounts are fixed by the agents at the maximum which the inhabitants are capable of producing  but is it not clear that no natives especially tribes who as stanley has recorded had remarkable aptitude for trade would do business at all upon such terms that is just where the system came in  by this system some two thousand white agents were scattered over the free state to collect the produce these whites were placed in ones and twos in the more central points and each was given a tract of country containing a certain number of villages by the help of the inmates he was to gather the rubber which was the most valuable asset these whites many of whom were men of low morale before they left europe were wretchedly paid the scale running from 150 to 300 francs a month this pay they might supplement by a commission or bonus on the amount of rubber collected if their returns were large it meant increased pay official praise a more speedy return to europe and a better chance of promotion if on the other hand the returns were small it meant poverty harsh reproof and degradation no system could be devised by which a body of men could be so driven to attain results at any cost it is not to the absolute discredit of belgians that such an existence should have demoralized them and indeed there were other nationalities besides belgians in the ranks of the agents i doubt if englishmen americans or germans could have escaped the same result had they been exposed in a tropical country to similar temptations  and now the two thousand agents being in place and eager to enforce the collection of rubber upon very unwilling natives how did the system intend that they should set about it the method was as efficient as it was absolutely diabolical each agent was given control over a certain number of savages drawn from the wild tribes but armed with firearms one or more of these was placed in each village to ensure that the villagers should do their task these are the men who are called capitas or headmen in the accounts and who are the actual though not the moral perpetrators of so many horrible deeds imagine the nightmare which lay upon each village while this barbarian squatted in the midst of it day or night they could never get away from him he called for palm wine he called for women he beat them mutilated them and shot them down at his pleasure he enforced public incest in order to amuse himself by the sight sometimes they plucked up spirit and killed him the belgian commission records that 142 capitas had been killed in seven months in a single district then came the punitive expedition and the destruction of the whole community the more terror the capita inspired the more useful he was the more eagerly the villagers obeyed him and the more rubber yielded its commission to the agent when the amount fell off then the capita was himself made to feel some of those physical pains which he had inflicted upon others often the white agent far exceeded in cruelty the barbarian who carried out his commissions often too the white man pushed the black aside and acted himself as torturer and executioner as a rule however the relationship was as i have stated the outrages being actually committed by the capitas but with the approval of and often in the presence of their white employers  it would be absurd to suppose that the agents were all equally merciless and that there were not some who were torn in two by the desire for wealth and promotion on the one side and the horror of their daily task upon the other here are two illustrative extracts from the letters of lieutenant tilkens as quoted by mr vandervelde in the debate in the belgian chamber the steamer v d kerkhove is coming up the nile it will require the colossal number of fifteen hundred portersunhappy blacks i cannot think of them i ask myself how i shall find such a number if the roads were passable it would make some difference but they are hardly cleared of morasses where many will meet their death hunger and weariness will make an end of many more in the eight days march how much blood will the transport make to flow already i have had to make war three times against the chieftains who will not take part in this work the people prefer to die in the forest instead of doing this work if a chieftain refuses it is war and this horrible warperfect firearms against spear and lance a chieftain has just left me with the complaint my village is in ruins my women are killed but what can i do i am often compelled to put these unhappy chieftains into chains until they collect one or two hundred porters very often my soldiers find the villages empty then they seize the women and children  to his mother he writes      com verstraeten visited my station and highly congratulated me he     said the attitude of his report hung upon the quantity of rubber i     would bring my quantity rose from 360 kilos in september to 1500 in     october and from january it will be 4000 per month which gives me     500 francs over my pay am i not a lucky fellow and if i continue in     two years i shall have reached an additional 12000 francs  but a year later he writes in a different tone to major leussens      i look forward to a general rising i warned you before i think     already in my last letter the cause is always the same the natives     are weary of the hitherto r√©gimetransport labour collection of     rubber preparation of food stores for blacks and whites again for     three months i have had to fight with only ten days rest i have 152     prisoners for two years now i have been carrying on war in this     neighbourhood but i cannot say i have subjected the people they     prefer to die what can i do i am paid to do my work i am a tool in     the hands of my superiors and i follow orders as discipline     requires  let us consider now for an instant the chain of events which render such a situation not only possible but inevitable the state is run with the one object of producing revenue for this end all land and its produce are appropriated how then is this produce to be gathered it can only be by the natives but if the natives gather it they must be paid their price which will diminish profits or else they will refuse to work then they must be made to work but the agents are too few to make them work then they must employ such subagents as will strike most terror into the people but if these subagents are to make the people work all the time then they must themselves reside in the villages so a capita must be sent as a constant terror to each village is it not clear that these steps are not accidental but are absolutely essential to the original idea given the confiscation of the land all the rest must logically follow it is utterly futile therefore to imagine that any reform can set matters right such a thing is impossible until unfettered trade is unconditionally restored as it now exists in every german and english colony it is absolutely out of the question that any specious promises or written decrees can modify the situation but on the other hand if trade be put upon this natural basis then for many years the present owners of the congo land instead of sharing dividends must pay out at least a million a year to administer the country exactly as england pays half a million a year to administer the neighbouring land of nigeria to grasp that fact is to understand the root of the whole question  and one more point before we proceed to the dark catalogue of the facts where did the responsibility for these deeds of blood these thousands of coldblooded murders lie was it with the capita  he was a cannibal and a ruffian but if he did not inspire terror in the village he was himself punished by the agent was it then with the agent he was a degraded man and yet as i have already said no men could serve on such terms in a tropical country without degradation he was goaded and driven to crime by the constant clamour from those above him was it then with the district commissary he had reached a responsible and wellpaid post which he would lose if his particular district fell behind in the race of production was it then with the governorgeneral at boma he was a man of a hardened conscience but for him also there was mitigation he was there for a purpose with definite orders from home which it was his duty to carry through it would take a man of exceptional character to throw up his high position sacrifice his career and refuse to carry out the evil system which had been planned before he was allotted a place in it where then was the guilt there were half a dozen officials in brussels who were as shown already so many bailiffs paid to manage a property upon lines laid down for them trace back the chain from the redhanded savage through the worried bilious agent the pompous commissary the dignified governorgeneral the smooth diplomatist and you come finally without a break and without a possibility of mitigation or excuse up the cold scheming brain which framed and drove the whole machine it is upon the king always the king that the guilt must lie he planned it knowing the results which must follow they did follow he was well informed of it again and again and yet again his attention was drawn to it a word from him would have altered the system the word was never said there is no possible subterfuge by which the moral guilt can be deflected from the head of the state the man who went to africa for the freedom of commerce and the regeneration of the native     iv  first fruits of the system   the first testimony which i shall cite is that of mr glave which covers the years 1893 up to his death in 1895 mr glave was a young englishman who had been for six years in the employ of the state and whose character and work were highly commended by stanley four years after the expiration of his engagement he travelled as an independent man right across the whole country from tanganyika in the east to matadi near the mouth of the river a distance of 2000 miles the agent and rubber systems were still in their infancy but already he remarked on every side that violence and disregard of human life which were so soon to grow to such proportions remember that he was himself a stanleyman a pioneer and a native trader by no means easy to shock here are some of his remarks as taken from his diary  dealing with the release of slaves by the belgians for which so much credit has been claimed he says cent mag vol 53      they are supposed to be taken out of slavery and freed but i fail to     see how this can be argued out they are taken from their villages and     shipped south to be soldiers workers etc on the state stations     and what were peaceful families have been broken up and the different     members spread about the place they have to be made fast and guarded     for transportation or they would all run away this does not look as     though the freedom promised had any seductive prospects the young     children thus liberated are handed over to the french mission     stations where they receive the kindest care but nothing justifies     this form of serfdom i can understand the state compelling natives to     do a certain amount of work for a certain time but to take people     forcibly from their homes and despatch them here and there breaking     up families is not right i shall learn more about this on the way     and at kabambare if these conditions are to exist i fail to see how     the antislavery movement is to benefit the native  with regard to the use of barbarous soldiers he says      state soldiers are also employed without white officers this should     not be allowed for the black soldiers do not understand the reason of     the fighting and instead of submission being sought often the     natives are massacred or driven away into the hill but the black     soldiers are bent on fighting and raiding they want no peaceful     settlement they have good rifles and ammunition realize their     superiority over the natives with their bows and arrows and they want     to shoot and kill and rob black delights to kill black whether the     victim be man woman or child and no matter how defenceless this is     no reasonable way of settling the land it is merely persecution     blacks cannot be employed on such an errand unless under the     leadership of whites  he met and describes one lieutenant hambursin who seems to have been a capable officer      yesterday the natives in a neighbouring village came to complain that     one of hambursins soldiers had killed a villager they brought in the     offenders gun today at rollcall the soldier appeared without his     gun his guilt was proved and without more to do he was hanged on a     tree hambursin has hanged several for the crime of murder  had there been more hambursins there might have been fewer scandals glave proceeds to comment on treatment of prisoners      in stations in charge of white men government officers one sees     strings of poor emaciated old women some of them mere skeletons     working from six in the morning till noon and from halfpast two till     six carrying clay waterjars tramping about in gangs with a rope     round the neck and connected by a rope one and a half yards apart     they are prisoners of war in war the old women are always caught but     should receive a little humanity they are naked except for a     miserable patch of cloth of several parts held in place by a string     round the waist they are not loosened from the rope for any purpose     they live in the guardhouse under the charge of black native     sentries who delight in slapping and illusing them for pity is not     in the heart of the native some of the women have babies but they go     to work just the same they form indeed a miserable spectacle and     one wonders that old women although prisoners of war should not     receive a little more consideration at least their nakedness might     be hidden the men prisoners are treated in a far better way  describing the natives he says      the natives are not lazy goodfornothing fellows their fine powers     are obtained by hard work sobriety and frugal living  he gives a glimpse of what the chicotte is like the favourite and universal instrument of torture used by the agents and officers of the free state      the chicotte of raw hippo hide especially a new one trimmed like     a corkscrew with edges like knifeblades and as hard as wood is a     terrible weapon and a few blows bring blood not more than     twentyfive blows should be given unless the offence is very serious     though we persuaded ourselves that the africans skin is very tough it     needs an extraordinary constitution to withstand the terrible     punishment of one hundred blows generally the victim is in a state of     insensibility after twentyfive or thirty blows at the first blow he     yells abominably then he quiets down and is a mere groaning     quivering body till the operation is over when the culprit stumbles     away often with gashes which will endure a lifetime it is bad enough     the flogging of men but far worse is this punishment when inflicted     on women and children small boys of ten or twelve with excitable     hottempered masters often are most harshly treated at kasnogo there     is a great deal of cruelty displayed i saw two boys very badly cut i     conscientiously believe that a man who receives one hundred blows is     often nearly killed and has his spirit broken for life  he has a glimpse of the treatment of the subjects of other nations      two days before my arrival at wabundu two sierra leoneans were     hanged by laschet they were sentries on guard and while they were     asleep allowed a native chief who was a prisoner and in chains to     escape next morning laschet in a fit of rage hanged the two men     they were british subjects engaged by the congo free state as     soldiers in time of war i suppose they could be executed after     courtmartial by being shot but to hang a subject of any other     country without trial seems to me outrageous  talking of the general unrest he says      it is the natural outcome of the harsh cruel policy of the state in     wringing rubber from these people without paying for it the     revolution will extend he adds the post isangi is close to the     large settlement of an important coast man kayamba who now is     devoted to the interests of the state catching slaves for them and     stealing ivory from the natives of the interior does the     philanthropic king of the belgians know about this if not he ought     to  as he gets away from the zone of war and into that which should represent peace his comments become more bitter the nascent rubber trade began to intrude its methods upon his notice      formerly the natives were well treated but now expeditions have been     sent in every direction forcing natives to make rubber and to bring     it to the stations up the ikelemba we are taking down one hundred     slaves mere children all taken in unholy wars against the     natives it was not necessary in the olden times when we white men     had no force at all this forced commerce is depopulating the     country left equateur at eleven oclock this morning after taking     on a cargo of one hundred small slaves principally boys seven or     eight years old with a few girls among the batch all stolen from the     natives the commissary of the district is a violenttempered fellow     while arranging to take on the hundred small slaves a woman who had     charge of the youngsters was rather slow in understanding his order     delivered in very poor kabanji he sprang at her slapped her in the     face and as she ran away kicked her they talk of philanthropy and     civilization where it is i do not know  and again      most white officers out on the congo are averse to the indiarubber     policy of the state but the laws command it therefore at each post     one finds the natives deserting their homes and escaping to the     french side of the river when possible  as he goes on his convictions grow stronger      everywhere he said i hear the same news of the doings of the     congo free staterubber and murder slavery in its worst form it is     said that half the lib√©r√©s sent down die on the road in europe we     understand from the word lib√©r√©s slaves saved from their cruel     masters not at all most of them result from wars made against the     natives because of ivory or rubber  on all sides he sees evidence of the utter disregard of humanity      today i saw the dead body of a carrier lying on the trail there     could have been no mistake about his being a sick man he was nothing     but skin and bones these posts ought to give some care to the     porters the heartless disregard for life is abominable native     life is considered of no value by the belgians no wonder the state is     hated  finally a little before his death he heard of that practice of mutilation which was one of the most marked fruits of the policy of moral and material advantage of the native races promised at the berlin conference      mr harvey heard from clarke who is at lake mantumba that the state     soldiers have been in the vicinity of his station recently fighting     and taking prisoners and he himself had seen several men with bunches     of hands signifying their individual skill these i presume they     must produce to prove their success among the hands were those of men     and women and also those of little children the missionaries are so     much at the mercy of the state that they do not report these barbaric     happenings to the people at home i have previously heard of hands     among them childrens being brought to the stations but i was not so     satisfied of the truth of the former information as of the reports     received just now by mr harvey from clarke much of this sort of     thing is going on at the equateur station the methods employed are     not necessary years ago when i was on duty at the equateur without     soldiers i never had any difficulty in getting what men i needed nor     did any other station in the old humane days the stations and the     boats then had no difficulty in finding men or labour nor will the     belgians if they introduce more reasonable methods  a sentence which is worth noting is that the missionaries are so much at the mercy of the state that they do not report these barbaric happenings to the people at home far from the question being one which as the apologists for king leopold have contended has been fomented by the missionaries it has actually been held back by them and it is only the courage and truthfulness of a handful of englishmen and americans which have finally brought it to the front   so much for mr glaves testimony he was an english traveller mr murphy an american missionary was working in another part of the country the region where the ubangi joins the congo during the same years let us see how far his account written entirely independently times november 18 1895 agrees with the other      i have seen these things done he said and have remonstrated with     the state in the years 1888 1889 and 1894 but never got     satisfaction i have been in the interior and have seen the ravages     made by the state in pursuit of this iniquitous trade let me give an     incident to show how this unrighteous trade affects the people one     day a state corporal who was in charge of the post of solifa was     going round the town collecting rubber meeting a poor woman whose     husband was away fishing he asked where is your husband she     answered by pointing to the river he then asked where is his     rubber she answered it is ready for you whereupon he said you     lie and lifting up his gun shot her dead shortly afterward the     husband returned and was told of the murder of his wife he went     straight to the corporal taking with him his rubber and asked why he     had shot his wife the wretched man then raised his gun and killed the     corporal the soldiers ran away to the headquarters of the state and     made representations of the case with the result that the commissary     sent a large force to support the authority of the soldiers the town     was looted burned and many people were killed and wounded  again      in november last 1894 there was heavy fighting on the bosira     because the people refused to give rubber and i was told upon the     authority of a state officer that no less than eighteen hundred people     were killed upon another occasion in the same month some soldiers ran     away from a state steamer and it was said went to the town of     bombumba the officer sent a message telling the chief of the town to     give them up he answered that he could not as the fugitives had not     been in his town the officer sent the messenger a second time with     the order come to me at once or war in the morning the next     morning the old chief went to meet the belgians and was attacked     without provocation he himself was wounded his wife was killed     before his eyes and her head cut off in order that they might possess     the brass necklet that she wore twentyfour of the chiefs people     were also killed and all for the paltry reason given above again the     people of lake mantumba ran away on account of the cruelty of the     state and the latter sent some soldiers in charge of a coloured     corporal to treat with them and induce them to return on the way the     troops met a canoe containing seven of the fugitives under some     paltry pretext they made the people land shot them cut off their     hands and took them to the commissary the mantumba people complained     to the missionary at irebu and he went down to see if the story was     true he ascertained the case to be just as they had narrated and     found that one of the seven was a little girl who was not quite dead     the child recovered and she lives today the stump of the handless     arm witnessing against this horrible practice these are only a few     things of many that have taken place in one district  it was not merely for rubber that these horrors were done much of the country is unsuited to rubber and in those parts there were other imposts which were collected with equal brutality one village had to send food and was remiss one day in supplying it      the people were quietly sleeping in their beds when they heard a shot     fired and ran out to see what was the matter finding the soldiers     had surrounded the town their only thought was escape as they raced     out of their homes men women and children they were ruthlessly shot     down their town was utterly destroyed and is a ruin to this day the     only reason for this fight was that the people had failed to bring     kwanga food to the state upon that one day  finally mr murphy says the rubber question is accountable for most of the horrors perpetrated in the congo it has reduced the people to a state of utter despair each town in the district is forced to bring a certain quantity to the headquarters of the commissary every sunday it is collected by force the soldiers drive the people into the bush if they will not go they are shot down their left hands being cut off and taken as trophies to the commissary the soldiers do not care whom they shoot down and they most often shoot poor helpless women and harmless children these handsthe hands of men women and childrenare placed in rows before the commissary who counts them to see the soldiers have not wasted the cartridges the commissary is paid a commission of about a penny per pound upon all the rubber he gets it is therefore to his interest to get as much as he can  here is corroboration and amplification of all that mr glaves had put forward the system had not been long established and was more efficient ten or twelve years later but already it was bearing some notable first fruits of civilization king leopolds rule cannot be said to have left the country unchanged there is ample evidence that mutilations of this sort were unknown among the native savages knowledge was spreading under european rule  having heard the testimony of an english traveller and of an american missionary let us now hear that of a swedish clergyman mr sjoblom as detailed in the aborigines friend july 1897 it covers much the same time as the other two and is drawn from the equateur district here is the system in full swing      they refuse to bring the rubber then war is declared the soldiers     are sent in different directions the people in the towns are     attacked and when they are running away into the forest and try to     hide themselves and save their lives they are found out by the     soldiers then their gardens of rice are destroyed and their supplies     taken their plantains are cut down while they are young and not in     fruit and often their huts are burned and of course everything of     value is taken within my own knowledge fortyfive villages were     altogether burned down i say altogether because there were many     others partly burned down i passed through twentyeight abandoned     villages the natives had left their places to go further inland in     order to separate themselves from the white men they go part of the     way down the river or else they cross the river into french     territory sometimes the natives are obliged to pay a large     indemnity the chiefs often have to pay with brass wire and slaves     and if the slaves do not make up the amount their wives are sold to     pay i was told that by a belgian officer i will give you mr     sjoblom continues an instance of a man i saw shot right before my     eyes in one of my inland journeys when i had gone a little farther     perhaps than the commissary expected me to go i saw something that     perhaps he would not have liked me to see it was at a town called     ibera one of the cannibal towns to which no white man had ever been     before i reached it at sunset after the natives had returned from     the various places in which they had been looking for indiarubber     they gathered together in a great crowd being curious to see a white     man besides they had heard i had some good news to tell them which     came through the gospel when that large crowd gathered and i was     just ready to preach the sentinels rushed in among them to seize an     old man they dragged him aside a little from the crowd and the     sentinel in charge came to me and said i want to shoot this man     because he has been in the river fishing today he has not been on     the river for indiarubber i told him i have not authority to stop     you because i have nothing to do with these palavers but the people     are here to hear what i have to say to them and i dont want you to     do it before my eyes he said all right i will keep him in bonds     then until tomorrow morning when you have gone then i will kill     him but a few minutes afterward the sentinel came in a rage to the     man and shot him right before my eyes then he charged his rifle again     and pointed it at the others who all rushed away like chaff before     the wind he told a little boy eight or nine years of age to go and     cut off the right hand of the man who had been shot the man was not     quite dead and when he felt the knife he tried to drag his hand away     the boy after some labour cut the hand off and laid it by a fallen     tree a little later this hand was put on a fire to smoke before being     sent to the commissary  here we get the system at its highest i think that picture of the child hacking off the hand of the dying man at the order of the monster who would have assuredly murdered him also had he hesitated to obey is as diabolical a one as even the congo could show a pretty commentary upon the doctrine of christ which the missionary was there to preach  mr sjoblom seems to have been unable to believe at first that such deeds were done with the knowledge and approval of the whites he ventured to appeal to the commissary he turned in anger on me he adds and in the presence of the soldiers said that he would expel me from the town if i meddled with matters of that kind any more  it would indeed have been rather absurd for the commissary to interfere when the severed hand had actually been cut off in order to be presented to him the whole procedure is explained in the following paragraph      if the rubber does not reach the full amount required the sentinels     attack the natives they kill some and bring the hands to the     commissary others are brought to the commissary as prisoners at the     beginning they came with their smoked hands the sentinels or else     the boys in attendance on them put these hands on a little kiln and     after they had been smoked they by and by put them on the top of the     rubber baskets i have on many occasions seen this done  then we read in the latest state papers of the belgian diplomatists that they propose to continue the beneficent and civilizing work which they have inherited  yet another paragraph from mr sjoblom showing the complicity of the belgian authorities and showing also that the presence of the missionaries was some deterrent against open brutality if then they saw as much as they did what must have been the condition of those huge tracts of country where no missions existed      at the end of 1895 the commissaryall the people were gathering the     rubbersaid he had often told the sentinels not to kill the people     but on the 14th of december a sentinel passed our mission station and     a woman accompanied him carrying a basket of hands mr and mrs     banks besides myself went down the road and they told the sentinel     to put the hands on the road that they might count them we counted     eighteen right hands smoked and from the size of the hands we could     judge that they belonged to men women and children we could not     understand why these hands had been collected as the commissary had     given orders that no more natives were to be killed for their hands     on my last journey i discovered the secret one monday night a     sentinel who had just returned from the commissary said to me what     are the sentinels to do when all the people are gathered together     the commissary openly tells us not to kill any more people but when     the people have gone he tells us privately that if they do not bring     plenty of indiarubber we must kill some but not bring the hands to     him some sentinels he told me had been put in chains because they     killed some natives who happened to be near a mission station but it     was only because he thought it might become known that the commissary     to justify himself had put the men in chains i said to the sentinel     you should obey the first command never to kill any more the     people he answered unless they are frightened do not bring in the     rubber and then the commissary flogs us with the hippopotamus hide     or else he puts us in chains or sends us to boma the sentinel     added that the commissary induced him to hide cruelty while letting it     go on and to do this in such a way that he might be justified in     case it should become known and an investigation should be made in     such a case the commissary could say why i told him openly not to     kill any more and he might put the blame on the soldier to justify     himself though the blame and the punishment in all its force ought to     have been put on himself after he had done such a terrible act in     order to disguise or mislead justice if the sentinels were puzzled     about this message what would the natives be  i have said that there was more to be said for the cannibal murderers than for those who worked the system the capitas pleaded the same excuse dont take this to heart so much said one of them to the missionary they kill us if we do not bring rubber the commissary has promised us if we bring plenty of hands he will shorten our service i have brought plenty already and i expect my time will soon be finished  that the commissaries are steeped to the lips in this horrible business has been amply shown in these paragraphs but mr sjoblom was able to go one stage further along the line which leads to the palace at brussels m wahis the governorgeneral a man who has played a sinister part in the country came up the river and endeavoured to get the outspoken swede to contradict himself or failing that to intimidate him to get at the truth or to right the wrong seems to have been the last thing in his mind for he knew well that the wrong was essential to the system and that without it the wheels would move more slowly and the head engineer in europe would soon wish to know what was amiss with his rubberproducing machine you may have seen all these things that you have stated said he but nothing is proved the commissary meanwhile had been holding a rifle to the head of witnesses so as to make sure that nothing would be proved in spite of this mr sjoblom managed to collect his evidence and going to the governor asked him when he could listen to it i dont want to hear any witnesses said he and then if you continue to demand investigation in these matters we will make a charge against you that means five years imprisonment  such is mr sjobloms narrative involving governor wahis in the general infamy it is not true cries the congolese apologist strange how swedes americans and british laymen and clergy all unite in defaming this innocent state no doubt the wicked children lop off their own hands in order to cast a slur upon the benevolent and philanthropic enterprise of the congo tartuffe and jack the ripperwas ever such a combination in the history of the world  one more anecdote of mr wahis for it is not often that we can get a governor of the congo in person face to face with the results of his own work as he passed down the river mr sjoblom was able to report another outrage to him      mr banks told the governor that he had seen it himself whereupon m     wahis summoned the commandant in chargethe officer who had ordered     the raid had already gone elsewhereand asked him in french if the     story were true the belgian officer assured m wahis that it was but     the latter thinking mr banks did not understand french said after     all you may have seen this but you have no witnesses oh said     mr banks i can call the commandant who has just told you that it     is true m wahis then tried to minimize the matter when to his     great surprise mr banks added in any case i have at his own     request furnished to the british consul who passed through here     lately a signed statement concerning it m wahis rose from his     chair saying oh then it is all over europe then for the first     time he said that the responsible commissary must be punished  it need not be added that the punishment was the merest farce  these successive reports each amplifying the other coming on the top of the killing of mr stokes and the action of the british colonial office in prohibiting recruiting for congoland had the effect of calling strong attention to the condition of that country the charges were met partly by denial partly by general phrases about morality and partly by bogus reform m van eetvelde in brussels and m jules houdret in london denied things which have since been proved up to the hilt the reform took the shape of a socalled natives protection commission like all these socalled reforms it was utterly ineffectual and was only meant for european consumption no one knew so well as the men at brussels that no possible reform could have any effect whatever unless the system was itself abolished for that system produced outrages as logically and certainly as frost produces ice the sequel will show the results of the natives protection commission     v  further fruits of the system   for a moment i must interrupt the narrative of the long dismal succession of atrocities in order to explain certain new factors in the situation  it has already been shown that the congo state unable to handle the whole of its vast domain had sublet large tracts of it to monopolist companies in absolute contradiction to article v of the berlin treaty up to the year 1897 these companies were registered in belgium and had some pretence to being international in scope the state had no open or direct control over them this was now altered the state drew closer the bonds which united it to these commercial undertakings they were for the most part dissolved and then reconstructed under congo law in most cases in return for the monopoly the state was given control sometimes to the extent of appointing all managers and agents half the shares of the company or half the profits were usually made over to the state thus one must bear in mind in future that whether one talks of the abir company of the kasai the katanga the anversoise or any other it is really with the statethat is with king leopoldthat one has to do he owned the companies but paid them fifty per cent commission for doing all the work as their profits were such as might be expected where nothing was paid either for produce or for labour varying from fifty to seven hundred per cent per annum all parties to the bargain were the gainers  another new factor in the situation was the completion in 1898 of the lower congo railway which connects boma with stanley pool and so outflanks the cataracts the enterprise itself was beneficent and splendid the means by which it was carried out were unscrupulous and inhuman had civilization no complaint against the congo state save the history of its railway construction with its forced labour so different to the tradition of the tropical procedure of other european colonies it would be a heavy indictment now it sinks to insignificance when compared with the enslavement of a whole people and the twenty years of uninterrupted massacre as a sketch of the condition of the railway district here is a little pen picture by m edouard picard of the belgian senate who saw it in the building      the cruel impression conveyed by the mutilated forests he wrote     is heightened in the places where till lately native villages     nestled hidden and protected by thick and lofty foliage the     inhabitants have fled they have fled in spite of encouraging palavers     and promises of peace and kind treatment they have burnt their huts     and great heaps of cinders mark the sites amid deserted palmgroves     and trampleddown banana fields the terrors caused by the memory of     inhuman floggings of massacres of rapes and abductions haunt their     poor brains and they go as fugitives to seek shelter in the recesses     of the hospitable bush or across the frontiers to find it in french     or portuguese congo not yet afflicted with so many labours and     alarms far from the roads traversed by white men those baneful     intruders and their train of strange and disquieting habits the     outlook was as gloomy when he wandered along the path trodden by the     caravans to the pool and back again we are constantly meeting these     carriers either isolated or in indian file blacks blacks miserable     blacks with horribly filthy loinclothes for their only garments     their bare and frizzled heads supporting their loadschest bale     ivorytusk hamper of rubber or barrel for the most part broken     down sinking under the burdens made heavier by their weariness and     insufficiency of food consisting of a handful of rice and tainted     dried fish pitiful walking caryatids beasts of burden with the lank     limbs of monkeys pinchedup features eyes fixed and round with the     strain of keeping their balance and the dulness of exhaustion thus     they come and go by thousands organized in a system of human     transport requisitioned by the state armed with its irresistible     force publique supplied by the chiefs whose slaves they are and who     pounce on their wages jogging on with knees bent and stomach     protruding one arm raised up and the other resting on a long stick     dusty and malodorous covered with insects as their huge procession     passes over mountains and through valleys dying on the tramp or     when the tramp is over going to their villages to die of exhaustion  it will be remembered that captain lothaire having been acquitted of the murder of mr stokes was sent out by king leopold to act as managingdirector of the anversoise trust in 1898 he arrived in the mongalla district and from then onward there came to europe vague rumours of native attacks and bloody reprisals with those other symptoms of violence and unrest which might be expected where a large population accustomed to freedom is suddenly reduced to slavery how huge were the rubber operations which were carried through under the ferocious rule of captain lothaire may be guessed from the fact that the profits of the company which had been 120000 francs in 1897 rose to 3968000 in 1899a sum which is considerably more than twice the total capital m mille tells of a belgian agent who showed 25000 cartridges and remarked i can turn those into 25000 pounds of rubber captain lothaire believed in the same trade methods for his fighting and his output increased together it is worth while to slaughter onefourth of the population if the effect is to drive the others to frenzied and unceasing work  no definite details might ever have reached europe of those doings had not lothaire made the capital mistake of quarrelling with his subordinates one of these named lacroix sent a communication to the nieuw gazet of antwerp which with the petit bleu acted an honourable and independent part at this epoch the congo press bureau which has stifled the voice of the more venal portion of the belgian and parisian press had not at that time attained the efficiency which it afterward reached this letter from lacroix was published on april 10th 1900 and shed a lurid light upon what had been going on in the mongalla district it was a confession but a confession which involved his superiors as well as himself he told how he had been instructed by his chief to massacre all the natives of a certain village which had been slow in bringing its rubber he had carried out the order later his chief had put sixty women in irons and allowed nearly all of them to die of hunger because the villagemummumbulahad not brought enough rubber i am going to be tried he wrote for having murdered one hundred and fifty men for having crucified women and children and for having mutilated many men and hung the remains on the village fence at the same moment as this confession of lacroix le petit bleu published sworn affidavits of soldiers employed by the trust telling how they had put to death whole villages for being short with their rubber moray another agent published a confession in le petit bleu from which this is an extract      at ambas we were a party of thirty under van eycken who sent us     into a village to ascertain if the natives were collecting rubber and     in the contrary case to murder all including men women and children     we found the natives sitting peaceably we asked them what they were     doing they were unable to reply thereupon we fell upon them all and     killed them without mercy an hour later we were joined by van eycken     and told him what had been done he answered it is well but you     have not done enough thereupon he ordered us to cut off the heads of     the men and hang them on the village palisades also their sexual     members and to hang the women and children on the palisades in the     form of a cross  in the face of these fresh revelations there was an outburst of feeling in belgium showing that it is only their ignorance of the true facts which prevents the inhabitants of that country from showing the same humanity as any other civilized nation would do they have not yet realized the foul things which have been done in their name surely when they do realize it there will be a terrible reckoning some were already very alive to the question mm vandervelde and lorand fought bravely in the chamber the officials with mm liebrichts and de cuvelier at their head made the usual vague professions and general denials ah you can rest assured light will be forthcoming complete striking cried the former light was indeed forthcoming though not so complete as might be wished for some at least of the scoundrels implicated were tried and condemned in any other european colony they would have been hanged offhand as the villainous murderers that they were but they do not hang white men in the congoland even with the blood of a hundred murders on their hands the only white man ever hanged there was the englishman stokes for competing in trade  what is to be remarked however is that only subordinates were punished van eycken was acquitted lacroix had imprisonment mattheys another agent accused of horrible practices got twelve yearswhich sounded well at the time but he was liberated at the end of three in the sentence upon this man the judge used the words seeing that it is just to take into account the example which his superiors gave him in showing no respect for the lives or rights of the natives brave words but how helpless is justice when such words can be said and no result follow they referred of course to captain lothaire who had in the meanwhile fled aboard a steamer at matadi and made his escape to europe his flight was common knowledge but who would dare to lay his hand upon the favourite of the king lothaire has had occasion several times since to visit the congo but justice has indeed sat with bandaged eyes where that man was concerned  there is one incident which should be marked in the story of this trial moray whose testimony would have been of great importance was found dead in his bed just before the proceedings there have been several such happenings in congo history commandant dooms having threatened to expose the misdeeds of lieutenant massard before europe was shortly afterward declared to have been mysteriously drowned by a hippopotamus dr barotti returning hot with anger after an inspection of the state declares vehemently that he was poisoned there is much that is of the sixteenth century in this state besides its views of its duties to the natives  before passing these revelations with the attendant burst of candour in the belgian press it may be well to transcribe the following remark in an interview from a returned congo official which appeared in the antwerp nieuw gazet april 10th 1900 he says      when first commissioned to establish a fort i was given some native     soldiers and a prodigious stock of ammunition my chief gave me the     following instructions crush every obstacle i obeyed and cut     through my district by fire and sword i had left antwerp thinking i     was simply to gather rubber great was my stupefaction when the truth     dawned on me  this with the letter of lieutenant tilken as quoted before gives some insight into the position of the agent  indeed there is something to be said for these unfortunate men for it is a more awful thing to be driven to crime than to endure it consider the sequence of events the man sees an advertisement offering a commercial situation in the tropics he applies to a bureau he is told that the salary is some seventyfive pounds a year with a bonus on results he knows nothing of the country or conditions he accepts he is then asked if he has any money he has not one hundred pounds is advanced to him for expenses and outfit and he is pledged to work it off he goes out and finds the terrible nature of the task before him he must condone crime to get his results suppose he resigns certainly say the authorities but you must remain there until you have worked off your debt he cannot possibly get down the river for the steamers are all under government control what can he do then there is one thing which he very frequently does and that is to blow out his brains the statistics of suicide are higher than in any service in the world but suppose he takes the line very well i will stay if you make me do so but i will expose these misdeeds to europe what then the routine is a simple one an official charge is preferred against him of illtreating the natives illtreating of some sort is always going forward and there is no difficulty with the help of the sentries in proving that something for which the agent is responsible does not tally with the written law however much it might be the recognized custom he is taken to boma tried and condemned thus it comes about that the prison of boma may at the same time contain the best men and the worstthe men whose ideas were too humane for the authorities as well as those whose crimes could not be overlooked even by a congolese administration take warning you who seek service in this dark country for suicide the boma prison or such deeds as will poison your memory forever are the only choice which will lie before you  here is the sort of official circular which descends in its thousands upon the agent this particular one was from the commissioner in the wille district      i give you carte blanche to procure 4000 kilos of rubber a month     you have two months in which to work your people employ gentleness at     first and if they persist in resisting the demands of the state     employ force of arms  and this state was formed for the moral and material advantage of the native  while dealing with trials of boma i will give some short account of the caudron case which occurred in 1904 this case was remarkable as establishing judicially what was always clear enough the complicity between the state and the criminal caudron was a man against whom 120 coldblooded murders were charged he was in fact a zealous and efficient agent of the anversoise society that same company whose rededged securities rose to such a height when manager lothaire taught the natives what a minister in the belgian house described as the christian law of work he did his best for the company and he did his best for himself for he had a three per cent commission upon the rubber why he should be chosen among all his fellowmurderers is hard to explain but it was so and he found himself at boma with a sentence of twenty years on appealing this was reduced to fifteen years which experience has shown to mean in practice two or three the interesting point of his trial however is that his appeal and the consequent decrease of sentence which justified that appeal were based upon the claim that the government was cognisant of the murderous raids and that the government soldiers were used to effect them the points brought out by the trial were      1 the existence of a system of organized oppression plunder and     massacre in order to increase the output of indiarubber for the     benefit of a company which is only a covering name for the     government itself      2 that the local authorities of the government are cognisant and     participatory in this system      3 that local officials of the government engage in these rubber     raids and that government troops are regularly employed there on      4 that the judicature is powerless to place the real responsibility     on the proper shoulders      5 that consequently these atrocities will continue until the system     itself is extirpated  caudrons counsel called for the production of official documents to show how the chain of responsibility went but the president of the appeal court refused it knowing as clearly as we do that it could only conduct to the throne itself  one might ask how the details of this trial came to europe when it is so seldom that anything leaks out from the courts of boma the reason was that there lived in boma a british coloured subject named shanir who was at the pains to attend the court day by day in order to preserve some record of the procedure this he dispatched to europe the sequel is interesting the mans trade which was a very large one was boycotted he lost his all brooded over his misfortunes and finally took his own lifeanother martyr in the cause of the congo     vi  voices from the darkness   i will now return to the witnesses of the shocking treatment of the natives rev joseph clark was an american missionary living at ikoko in the crown domain which is king leopolds own special private preserve these letters cover the space between 1893 and 1899  this is ikoko as he found it in 1893      irebo contains say 2000 people ikoko has at least 4000 and there     are other towns within easy reach several as large as irebo and two     probably as large as ikoko the people are finelooking bold and     active  in 1903 there were 600 people surviving  in 1894 ikoko in the crown domain began to feel the effects of moral and material regeneration on may 30th of that year mr clark writes      owing to trouble with the state the irebo people fled and left their     homes yesterday the state soldiers shot a sick man who had not     attempted to run away and others have been killed by the state     native soldiers who in the absence of a white man do as they     please  in november 1894      at ikoko quite a number of people have been killed by the soldiers     and most of the others are living in the bush  in the same month he complained officially to commissaire fievez      if you do not come soon and stop the present trouble the towns will     be empty i entreat you to help us to have peace on the lake it     seems so hard to see the dead bodies in the creek and on the beach     and to know why they are killed people are living in the bush like     wild beasts without shelter or proper food and afraid to make fires     many died in this way one woman ran away with three childrenthey     all died in the forest and the woman herself came back a wreck and     died before longruined by exposure and starvation we knew her well     my hope in 1894 was to get the facts put before king leopold as i was     sure he knew nothing of the awful conditions of the collection of the     socalled rubber tax  on november 28th he writes      the state soldiers brought in seven hands and reported having shot     the people in the act of running away to the french side etc                                               we found all that the soldiers had reported was untrue and that the     statements made by the natives to me were true we saw only six     bodies a seventh had evidently fallen into the water and we learned     in a day or two that an eighth body had floated into the landingplace     above usa woman that had either been thrown or had fallen into the     water after being shot  on december 5th he says      a year ago we passed or visited between here and ikoko the following     villages                                      probable population           lobwaka                          250           boboko                           250           bosungu                          100

found ten ikoko did not contain over twelve people other than     those employed by frank beyond ikoko the case is the same  april 12th 1895 he writes      i am sorry that rubber palavers continue every week we hear of some     fighting and there are frequent rows even in our village with     the armed and unruly soldiers during the past twelve months it has     cost more lives than native wars and superstition would have     sacrificed in three to five years the people make this comparison     among themselves it seems incredible and awful to think of these     savage men armed with rifles and let loose to hunt and kill people     because they do not get rubber to sell at a mere nothing to the state     and it is bloodcurdling to see them returning with hands of the     slain and to find the hands of young children amongst bigger ones     evidencing their bravery  the following was written on may 3rd 1895      the war on account of rubber the state demands that the natives     shall make rubber and sell same to its agents at a very low price the     natives do not like it it is hard work and very poor pay and takes     them away from their homes into the forest where they feel very     unsafe as there are always feuds among them the rubber from this     district has cost hundreds of lives and the scenes i have witnessed     while unable to help the oppressed have been almost enough to make me     wish i were dead the soldiers are themselves savages some even     cannibals trained to use rifles and in many cases they are sent away     without supervision and they do as they please when they come to any     town no mans property or wife is safe and when they are at war they     are like devils      imagine them returning from fighting some rebels see on the bow     of the canoe is a pole and a bundle of something on it these are     the hands right hands of sixteen warriors they have slain     warriors dont you see among them the hands of little children and     girls young girls or boys i have seen them i have seen where even     the trophy has been cut off while yet the poor heart beat strongly     enough to shoot the blood from the cut arteries to a distance of fully     four feet      a young baby was brought here one time its mother was taken     prisoner and before her eyes they threw the infant in the water to     drown it the soldiers coolly told me and my wife that their white man     did not want them to bring infants to their place they dragged the     women off and left the infant beside us but we sent the child to its     mother and said we would report the matter to the chief of the post     we did so but the men were not punished the principal offender was     told before me he would get fifty lashes but i heard the same mouth     send a message to say he would not be flogged  compare with this the following extracts from king leopolds officiel bulletin referring to this very tract of country      the exploitation of the rubber vines of this district was undertaken     barely three years ago by m fievez the results he obtained have been     unequalled the district produced in 1895 more than 650 tons of     rubber bought sic for 212d european price and sold at     antwerp for 5s 5d per kilo 2 lbs  a later bulletin adds      with this development of general order is combined an inevitable     amelioration in the natives condition of existence wherever he comes     into contact with the european element      such is in fact one of the ends of the general policy of the state     to promote the regeneration of the race by instilling into him a     higher idea of the necessity of labour  truly i know nothing in history to match such documents as thesepirates and bandits have never descended to that last odious abyss of hypocrisy it stands alone colossal in its horror colossal too in its effrontery  a few more anecdotes from the worthy mr clark this is an extract from a letter to the chief of the district mueller      there is a matter i want to report to you regarding the nkake     sentries you remember some time ago they took eleven canoes and shot     some ikoko people as a proof they went to you with some hands of     which three were the hands of little children we heard from one of     their paddlers that one child was not dead when its hand was cut off     but did not believe the story three days after we were told the child     was still alive in the bush i sent four of my men to see and they     brought back a little girl whose right hand had been cut off and she     left to die from the wound the child had no other wound as i was     going to see dr reusens about my own sickness i took the child to     him and he has cut the arm and made it right and i think she will     live but i think such awful cruelty should be punished  mr clark still clung to the hope that king leopold did not know of the results of his own system on march 25th 1896 he writes      this rubber traffic is steeped in blood and if the natives were to     rise and sweep every white person on the upper congo into eternity     there would still be left a fearful balance to their credit is it     not possible for some american of influence to see the king of the     belgians and let him know what is being done in his name the lake     is reserved for the kingno traders allowedand to collect rubber     for him hundreds of men women and children have been shot  at last the natives goaded beyond endurance rose against their oppressors who can help rejoicing that they seem to have had some success  extracts from letterbook commencing january 29th 1897      the native uprising this was brought about at last by sentries     robbing and badly treating an important chief in my presence he     laid his complaint before m mueller reporting the seizure of his     wives and goods and the personal violence he had suffered at the hands     of m muellers soldiers stationed in his town i saw m mueller kick     him off his veranda within fortyeight hours there were no     sentries or their followers left in that chiefs townthey were     killed and mutilatedand soon after m mueller with another white     officer and many soldiers were killed and the revolt began  such is some of the evidence a very small portion of the whole narrative furnished by mr clark remember that it is extracted from a long series of letters written to various people during a succession of years one could conceive a single statement being a concoction but the most ingenious apologist for the congo methods could not explain how such a document as this could be other than true  so much for mr clark the american the evidence of mr scrivener the englishman covering roughly the same place and date will follow but lest the view should seem too anglosaxon let me interpolate a paragraph from the travels of a frenchman m leon berthier whose diary was published by the colonial institute of marseilles in 1902      belgian post of imesse well constructed the chef de poste is absent     he has gone to punish the village of mbatchi guilty of being a     little late in paying the rubber tax a canoe full of congo state     soldiers returns from the pillage of mbatchi thirty killed fifty     wounded at three oclock arrive at mbatchi the scene of the     bloody punishment of the chef de poste at imesse poor village the     d√©bris of miserable huts one goes away humiliated and saddened     from these scenes of desolation filled with indescribable feelings  in showing the continuity of the congo horror and the extent of its duration an extent which is the shame of the great powers who acquiesced in it by their silence i have marshalled witnesses in their successive order messrs glave murphy and sjoblom have covered the time from 1894 to 1897 mr clark has carried it on to 1900 we have had the deeds of 19014 as revealed in the boma law courts i shall now give the experience of rev mr scrivener an english missionary who in july august and september 1903 traversed a section of the crown domain that same region specially assigned to king leopold in person in which mr clark had spent so many nightmare years we shall see how far the independent testimony of the englishman and the american the one extracted from a diary the other from a succession of letters corroborate each other      at six in the morning woke up to find it still raining it kept on     till nine and we managed to get off by eleven all the cassava bread     was finished the day previous so a little rice was cooked but it was     a hungry crowd that left the little village i tried to find out     something about them they said they were runaways from a district a     little distance away where rubber was being collected they told us     some horrible tales of murder and starvation and when we heard all we     wondered that men so maltreated should be able to live without     retaliation the boys and girls were naked and i gave them each a     strip of calico much to their wonderment      four hours and a half brought us to a place called sa on the way     we passed two villages with more people than we had seen for days     there may have been 120 close to the post was another small village     we decided to stay there the rest of the day three chiefs came in     with all the adult members of their people and altogether there were     not 300 and this where not more than six or seven years ago there     were at least 3000 it made ones heart heavy to listen to the tales     of bloodshed and cruelty and it all seemed so foolish to kill the     people off in the wholesale way in which it has been done in this lake     district because they would not bring in a sufficient quantity of     rubber to satisfy the white manand now here is an empty country and     a very much diminished output of rubber as the inevitable     consequence  finally mr scrivener emerged in the neighbourhood of a big state station he was hospitably received and had many chats with his host who seems to have been a very decent sort of man doing his best under very trying circumstances his predecessor had worked incalculable havoc in the country and the present occupant of the post was endeavouring to carry out the duties assigned to him those duties consisting as usual of orders to get all the rubber possible out of the people with as much humanity as the nature of the task permitted in this he no doubt did what was possible as one whom the system had not yet degraded to its levelone of the rare few and one cannot wonder that they should be rare seeing the nature of the bonds and the helplessness in which an official is placed who does not carry out the full desires of his superiors but he had only succeeded in getting himself into trouble with the district commander in consequence he showed mr scrivener a letter from the latter upbraiding him for not using more vigorous means telling him to talk less and shoot more and reprimanding him for not killing more than one man in a district under his care where there was a little trouble  mr scrivener had the opportunity while at this state post under the r√©gime of a man who was endeavouring to be as humane as his instructions allowed to actually see the process whereby the secret revenues of the crown domain are obtained he says      everything was on a military basis but so far as i could see the     one and only reason for it all was rubber it was the theme of every     conversation and it was evident that the only way to please ones     superiors was to increase the output somehow i saw a few men come in     and the frightened look even now on their faces tells only too     eloquently of the awful time they have passed through as i saw it     brought in each man had a little basket containing say four or     five pounds of rubber this was emptied into a larger basket and     weighed and being found sufficient each man was given a cupful of     coarse salt and to some of the headmen a fathom of calico i     heard from the white men and some of the soldiers some most gruesome     stories the former white man i feel ashamed of my colour every time     i think of him would stand at the door of the store to receive the     rubber from the poor trembling wretches who after in some cases     weeks of privation in the forest had ventured in with what they had     been able to collect a man bringing rather under the proper amount     the white man flies into a rage and seizing a rifle from one of the     guards shoots him dead on the spot very rarely did rubber come in     but one or more were shot in that way at the door of the storeto     make the survivors bring more next time men who had tried to run     from the country and had been caught were brought to the station and     made to stand one behind the other and an albini bullet sent through     them a pity to waste cartridges on such wretches only the roads to     and fro from the various posts are kept open and large tracts of     country are abandoned to the wild beasts the white man himself told     me that you could walk on for five days in one direction and not see     a single village or a single human being and this where formerly     there was a big tribe      as one by one the surviving relatives of my men arrived some     affecting scenes were enacted there was no falling on necks and     weeping but very genuine joy was shown and tears were shed as the     losses death had made were told how they shook hands and snapped     their fingers what expressions of surprisethe wideopened mouth     covered with the open hand to make its evidence of wonder the more     apparent so far as the state post was concerned it was in a very     dilapidated condition on three sides of the usual huge quadrangle     there were abundant signs of a former population but we only found     three villagesbigger indeed than any we had seen before but sadly     diminished from what had been but recently the condition of the     place soon we began talking and without any encouragement on my     part they began the tales i had become so accustomed to they were     living in peace and quietness when the white men came in from the lake     with all sorts of requests to do this and to do that and they thought     it meant slavery so they attempted to keep the white men out of their     country but without avail the rifles were too much for them so they     submitted and made up their minds to do the best they could under the     altered circumstances first came the command to build houses for the     soldiers and this was done without a murmur then they had to feed     the soldiers and all the men and womenhangersonwho accompanied     them      then they were told to bring in rubber this was quite a new thing     for them to do there was rubber in the forest several days away from     their home but that it was worth anything was news to them a small     reward was offered and a rush was made for the rubber what strange     white men to give us cloth and beads for the sap of a wild vine     they rejoiced in what they thought was their good fortune but soon     the reward was reduced until they were told to bring in the rubber for     nothing to this they tried to demur but to their great surprise     several were shot by the soldiers and the rest were told with many     curses and blows to go at once or more would be killed terrified     they began to prepare their food for the fortnights absence from the     village which the collection of the rubber entailed the soldiers     discovered them sitting about what not gone yet bang bang bang     bang and down fell one and another dead in the midst of wives and     companions there is a terrible wail and an attempt made to prepare     the dead for burial but this is not allowed all must go at once to     the forest and off the poor wretches had to go without even their     tinderboxes to make fires many died in the forests from exposure and     hunger and still more from the rifles of the ferocious soldiers in     charge of the post in spite of all their efforts the amount fell     off and more and more were killed      i was shown around the place and the sites of former big chiefs     settlements were pointed out a careful estimate made the population     of say seven years ago to be 2000 people in and about the post     within a radius of say a quarter of a mile all told they would not     muster 200 now and there is so much sadness and gloom that they are     fast decreasing lying about in the grass within a few yards of     the house i was occupying were numbers of human bones in some cases     complete skeletons i counted thirtysix skulls and saw many sets of     bones from which the skulls were missing i called one of the men and     asked the meaning of it when the rubber palaver began said he     the soldiers shot so many we grew tired of burying and very often we     were not allowed to bury and so just dragged the bodies out into the     grass and left them there are hundreds all round if you would like to     see them but i had seen more than enough and was sickened by the     stories that came from men and women alike of the awful time they had     passed through the bulgarian atrocities might be considered as     mildness itself when compared with what has been done here      in due course we reached ibali there was hardly a sound building in     the place why such dilapidation the commandant away for a trip     likely to extend into three months the sublieutenant away in another     direction on a punitive expedition in other words the station must     be neglected and rubberhunting carried out with all vigour i stayed     here two days and the one thing that impressed itself upon me was the     collection of rubber i saw long files of men come as at mbongo with     their little baskets under their arms saw them paid their milktin     full of salt and the two yards of calico flung to the headmen saw     their trembling timidity and in fact a great deal more to prove     the state of terrorism that exists and the virtual slavery in which     the people are held      so much for the journey to the lake it has enlarged my knowledge of     the country and also alas my knowledge of the awful deeds enacted     in the mad haste of men to get rich so far as i know i am the first     white man to go into the domaine priv√© of the king other than the     employees of the state i expect there will be wrath in some quarters     but that cannot be helped  so far mr scrivener but perhaps the reader may think that there really was a missionary plot to decry the free state let us have some travellers then here is mr grogan from his cape to cairo      the people were terrorized and were living in marshes this was on     the british frontier the belgians have crossed the frontier     descended into the valley shot down large numbers of natives british     subjects driven off the young women and cattle and actually tied up     and burned the old women i do not make these statements without     having gone into the matter i remarked on the absence of women and     the reason was given it was on further inquiry that i was assured by     the natives that white men had been present when the old women had     been burned they even described to me the personal appearance of     the white officers with the troops the wretched people came to me     and asked me why the british had deserted them  further on he says      every village had been burned to the ground and as i fled from the     country i saw skeletons skeletons everywhere and such postures what     tales of horror they told  just a word in conclusion from another witness mr herbert frost      the power of an armed soldier among enslaved people is absolutely     paramount by chief or child every command wish or whim of the     soldier must be obeyed or gratified at his command with rifle ready a     man will  outrage his own sister give to his persecutor the wife     he loves most of all say or do anything indeed to save his life     the woes and sorrows of the race whom king leopold has enslaved have     not decreased for his commissaire officers and agents have introduced     and maintain a system of deviltry hitherto undreamed of by his     victims  does this all seem horrible but in the face of it is there not something more horrible in a sentence of this kind      our only programme i am anxious to repeat is the work of moral and     material regeneration and we must do this among a population whose     degeneration in its inherited conditions it is difficult to measure     the many horrors and atrocities which disgrace humanity give way     little by little before our intervention  it is king leopold who speaks     vii  consul roger casements report   up to this time the published reports as to the black doings of king leopold and his men were with the exception of a guarded document from consul pickersgill in 1898 entirely from private individuals no doubt there were official reports but the government withheld them in 1904 this policy of reticence was abandoned and the historic report of consul roger casement confirmed and in some ways amplified all that had reached europe from other sources  a word or two as to mr casements own personality and qualifications may not be amiss since both were attacked by his belgian detractors he is a tried and experienced public servant who has had exceptional opportunities of knowing africa and the natives he entered the consular service in 1892 served on the niger till 1895 was consul at delagoa bay to 1898 and was finally transferred to the congo personally he is a man of the highest character truthful unselfishone who is deeply respected by all who know him his experience which deals with the crown domain districts in the year 1903 covers some sixtytwo pages to be read in full in white book africa no 1 1904 i will not apologize for the length of the extracts as this the first official exposure was an historical document and from its publication we mark the first step in that train of events which is surely destined to remove the congo state from hands which have proved so unworthy and to place it in conditions which shall no longer be a disgrace to european civilization it may be remarked before beginning that at some of these conversations with the natives mr scrivener was present and that he corroborates the account given by the consul  the beginning of mr casements report shows how willing he was to give praise where praise was possible and to say all that could be said for the administration he talks of energetic european intervention and adds that very much of this intervention has been called for no one who formerly knew the upper congo could doubt admirably built and admirably kept stations greet the traveller at many points today the railway works most efficiently he attributes sleeping sickness as one cause of the seemingly wholesale diminution of human life which i everywhere observed in the regions revisited a prominent place must be assigned to this malady the natives certainly attribute their alarming deathrate to this as one of the inducing causes although they attribute and i think principally their rapid decrease in numbers to other causes as well  the government work shop was brightness care order and activity and it was impossible not to admire and commend the industry which had created and maintained in constant working order this useful establishment  these are not the words of a critic who has started with a prejudiced mind or the desire to make out a case  in the lower reaches of the river above stanley pool casement found no gross illusage the natives were hopeless and listless being debarred from trade and heavily taxed in food fish and other produce it was not until he began to approach the cursed rubber zones that terrible things began to dawn upon him casement had travelled in 1887 in the congo and was surprised to note the timidity of the natives soon he had his explanation      at one of these village s after confidence had been restored     and the fugitives had been induced to come in from the surrounding     forest where they had hidden themselves i saw women coming back     carrying their babies their household utensils and even the food     they had hastily snatched up up to a late hour of the evening     meeting some of these returning women in one of the fields i asked     them why they had run away at my approach and they said smiling we     thought you were bula matadi i e men of the government fear     of this kind was formerly unknown on the upper congo and in much more     outoftheway places visited many years ago the people flocked from     all sides to greet a white stranger but today the apparition of a     white mans steamer evidently gave the signal for instant flight       men he said still came to him whose hands had been cut off by     the government soldiers during those evil days and he said there were     still many victims of this species of mutilation in the surrounding     country two cases of the kind came to my actual notice while i was in     the lake one a young man both of whose hands had been beaten off     with the buttends of rifles against a tree the other a young lad of     eleven or twelve years of age whose right hand was cut off at the     wrist this boy described the circumstances of his mutilation and in     answer to my inquiry said that although wounded at the time he was     perfectly sensible of the severing of his wrist but lay still fearing     that if he moved he would be killed in both these cases the     government soldiers had been accompanied by white officers whose names     were given to me of six natives one a girl three little boys one     youth and one old woman who had been mutilated in this way during     the rubber r√©gime all except one were dead at the date of my visit     the old woman had died at the beginning of this year and her niece     described to me how the act of mutilation in her case had been     accomplished  the fines inflicted upon villages for trifling offences were such as to produce the results here described      the officer had then imposed as further punishment a fine of 55000     brass rods 2750 fr¬£110 this sum they had been forced to pay     and as they had no other means of raising so large a sum they had     many of them been compelled to sell their children and their wives i     saw no livestock of any kind in w save a very few fowlspossibly     under a dozenand it seemed indeed not unlikely that as these     people asserted they had great difficulty in always getting their     supplies ready a father and mother stepped out and said that they had     been forced to sell their son a little boy called f for 1000 rods     to meet their share of the fine a widow came and declared that she     had been forced in order to meet her share of the fine to sell her     daughter g a little girl whom i judged from her description to be     about ten years of age she had been sold to a man in y who was     named for 1000 rods which had then gone to make up the fine  the natives were broken in spirit by the treatment      one of thema strong indeed a splendidlooking manbroke down and     wept saying that their lives were useless to them and that they knew     of no means of escape from the troubles which were gathering around     them i could only assure these people that their obvious course to     obtain relief was by appeal to their own constituted authorities and     that if their circumstances were clearly understood by those     responsible for these fines i trusted and believed some satisfaction     would be forthcoming  these fines it may be added were absolutely illegal it was the officer not the poor harried natives who had broken the law      these fines it should be borne in mind are illegally imposed they     are not fines of court are not pronounced after any judicial     hearing or for any proved offence against the law but are quite     arbitrarily levied according to the whim or illwill of the executive     officers of the district and their collection as well as their     imposition involves continuous breaches of the congolese laws they     do not moreover figure in the account of public revenues in the     congo budgets they are not paid into the public purse of the     country but are spent on the needs of the station or military camp of     the officer imposing them just as seems good to this official  here is an illustrative anecdote      one of the largest congo concession companies had when i was on the     upper river addressed a request to its directors in europe for a     further supply of ballcartridge the directors had met this demand by     asking what had become of the 72000 cartridges shipped some three     years ago to which a reply was sent to the effect that these had all     been used in the production of indiarubber i did not see this     correspondence and cannot vouch for the truth of the statement but     the officer who informed me that it had passed before his own eyes was     one of the highest standing in the interior  another witness showed the exact ratio between cartridges and rubber      the s a b on the bussira with 150 guns get only ten tons     rubber a month we the state at momboyo with 130 guns get     thirteen tons per month so you count by guns i asked him     partout m p said each time the corporal goes out to get rubber     cartridges are given to him he must bring back all not used and for     every one used he must bring back a right hand m p told me that     sometimes they shot a cartridge at an animal in hunting they then cut     off a hand from a living man as to the extent to which this is     carried on he informed me that in six months they the state on the     momboyo river had used 6000 cartridges which means that 6000     people are killed or mutilated it means more than 6000 for the     people have told me repeatedly that the soldiers kill children with     the butt of their guns  that the statement about the cutting off of living hands is correct is amply proved by the kodak i have photographs of at least twenty such mutilated negroes in my own possession  here is a copy of a dispatch from an official quoted in its naked frankness      le chef ngulu de wangata est envoy√© dans la maringa pour my acheter     des esclaves pri√®re a mm les agents de labir de bien vouloir me     signaler les m√©faits que celuici pourrait commettre en route          le capitainecommandant             sign√© sarrazzyn      colquilhatville le 1er mai 1896  pretty good for the state which boasts that it has put down the slave trade  there is a passage showing the working of the rubber system which is so clear and authoritative that i transcribe it in full      i went to the homes of these men some miles away and found out their     circumstances to get the rubber they had first to go fully a two     days journey from their homes leaving their wives and being absent     for from five to six days they were seen to the forest limits under     guard and if not back by the sixth day trouble was likely to ensue     to get the rubber in the forestswhich generally speaking are very     swampyinvolves much fatigue and often fruitless searching for a     wellflowing vine as the area of supply diminishes moreover the     demand for rubber constantly increases some little time back i     learned the bongandanga district supplied seven tons of rubber a     month a quantity which it was hoped would shortly be increased to ten     tons the quantity of rubber brought by the three men in question     would have represented probably for the three of them certainly not     less than seven kilog of pure rubber that would be a very safe     estimate and at an average of 7fr per kilog they might be said to     have brought in ¬£2 worth of rubber in return for this labour or     imposition they had received goods which cost certainly under 1s     and whose local valuation came to 45 rods 1s 10d as this     process repeats itself twentysix times a year it will be seen that     they would have yielded ¬£52 in kind at the end of the year to the     local factory and would have received in return some 24s or 25s     worth of goods which had a market value on the spot of ¬£2 7s 8d     in addition to these formal payments they were liable at times to be     dealt with in another manner for should their work which might have     been just as hard have proved less profitable in its yield of rubber     the local prison would have seen them the people everywhere assured     me that they were not happy under this system and it was apparent to     a callous eye that in this they spoke the strict truth  again i insert a passage to show that casement was by no means an illnatured critic      it is only right to say that the present agent of the abir     society i met at bongandanga seemed to me to try in very difficult     and embarrassing circumstances to minimize as far as possible and     within the limits of his duties the evils of the system i there     observed at work  speaking of the mongalla massacresthose in which lothaire was implicatedhe quotes from the judgment of the court of appeal      that it is just to take into account that by the correspondence     produced in the case the chiefs of the concession company have if     not by formal orders at least by their example and their tolerance     induced their agents to take no account whatever of the rights     property and lives of the natives to use the arms and the soldiers     which should have served for their defence and the maintenance of     order to force the natives to furnish them with produce and to work     for the company as also to pursue as rebels and outlaws those who     sought to escape from the requisitions imposed upon them that     above all the fact that the arrest of women and their detention to     compel the villages to furnish both produce and workmen was tolerated     and admitted even by certain of the administrative authorities of the     region  yet another example of the workings of the system      in the morning when about to start for k many people from the     surrounding country came in to see me they brought with them three     individuals who had been shockingly wounded by gun fire two men and a     very small boy not more than six years of age and a fourtha boy     child of six or sevenwhose right hand was cut off at the wrist one     of the men who had been shot through the arm declared that he was y     of l a village situated some miles away he declared that he had     been shot as i saw under the following circumstances the soldiers had     entered his town he alleged to enforce the due fulfilment of the     rubber tax due by the community these men had tied him up and said     that unless he paid 1000 brass rods to them they would shoot him     having no rods to give them they had shot him through the arm and had     left him  i may say that among my photographs are several with shattered arms who have been treated in this fashion  this is how the natives were treated when they complained to the white man      in addition fifty women are required each morning to go to the     factory and work there all day they complained that the remuneration     given for these services was most inadequate and that they were     continually beaten when i asked the chief w why he had not gone to d     f to complain if the sentries beat him or his people opening his     mouth he pointed to one of the teeth which was just dropping out and     said that is what i got from the d f four days ago when i went to     tell him what i now say to you he added that he was frequently     beaten along with others of his people by the white man  one sentry was taken almost redhanded by mr casement      after some little delay a boy of about fifteen years of age appeared     whose left arm was wrapped up in a dirty rag removing this i found     the left hand had been hacked off by the wrist and that a shot hole     appeared in the fleshy part of the forearm the boy who gave his name     as i i in answer to my inquiry said that a sentry of the la lulanga     company now in the town had cut off his hand i proceeded to look for     this man who at first could not be found the natives to a     considerable number gathering behind me as i walked through the town     after some delay the sentry appeared carrying a capgun the boy     whom i placed before him then accused him to his face of having     mutilated him the men of the town who were questioned in     succession corroborated the boys statement the sentry who gave his     name as k k could make no answer to the charge he met it by vaguely     saying some other sentry of the company had mutilated i i his     predecessor he said had cut off several hands and probably this was     one of the victims the natives around said that there were two other     sentries at present in the town who were not so bad as k k but that     he was a villain as the evidence against him was perfectly clear man     after man standing out and declaring he had seen the act committed i     informed him and the people present that i should appeal to the local     authorities for his immediate arrest and trial  the following extract must be my final quotation from consul casements report      i asked then how this tax was imposed one of them who had been     hammering out an iron neckcollar on my arrival spoke first he said      i am n n these other two beside me are o o and p p all of us     y from our country each village had to take twenty loads of     rubber these loads were big they were as big as this producing     an empty basket which came nearly up to the handle of my     walkingstick that was the first size we had to fill that up but     as rubber got scarcer the white man reduced the amount we had to take     these loads in four times a month      q how much pay did you get for this      a entire audience we got no pay we got nothing      and then n n whom i asked again said      our village got cloth and a little salt but not the people who did     the work our chiefs eat up the cloth the workers got nothing the     pay was a fathom of cloth and a little salt for every big basketful     but it was given to the chief never to the men it used to take ten     days to get the twenty baskets of rubberwe were always in the forest     and then when we were late we were killed we had to go further and     further into the forest to find the rubber vines to go without food     and our women had to give up cultivating the fields and gardens then     we starved wild beaststhe leopardskilled some of us when we were     working away in the forest and others got lost or died from exposure     and starvation and we begged the white man to leave us alone saying     we could get no more rubber but the white men and their soldiers     said go you are only beasts yourselves you are nyama meat we     tried always going further into the forest and when we failed and     our rubber was short the soldiers came to our towns and killed us     many were shot some had their ears cut off others were tied up with     ropes around their necks and bodies and taken away the white men     sometimes at the posts did not know of the bad things the soldiers did     to us but it was the white men who sent the soldiers to punish us for     not bringing in enough rubber      here p p took up the tale from n n      we said to the white men we are not enough people now to do what     you want us our country has not many people in it and we are dying     fast we are killed by the work you make us do by the stoppage of our     plantations and the breaking up of our homes the white man looked     at us and said there are lots of people in mputu europe the     white mans country if there are lots of people in the white mans     country there must be many people in the black mans country the     white man who said this was the chief white man at f f his name     was a b he was a very bad man other white men of bula matadi who had     been bad and wicked were b c c d and d e these had killed us     often and killed us by their own hands as well as by their soldiers     some white men were good these were e f f g g h h i i k k l      these ones told them to stay in their homes and did not hunt and     chase them as the others had done but after what they had suffered     they did not trust more any ones word and they had fled from their     country and were now going to stay here far from their homes in this     country where there was no rubber      q how long is it since you left your homes since the big trouble     you speak of      a it lasted for three full seasons and it is now four seasons     since we fled and came into the k country      q how many days is it from n to your own country      a six days of quick marching we fled because we could not endure     the things done to us our chiefs were hanged and we were killed and     starved and worked beyond endurance to get rubber      q how do you know it was the white men themselves who ordered     these cruel things to be done to you these things must have been done     without the white mans knowledge by the black soldiers      a p p the white men told their soldiers you kill only women     you cannot kill men you must prove that you kill men so then the     soldiers when they killed us here he stopped and hesitated and then     pointing to the private parts of my bulldogit was lying asleep at my     feet he said then they cut off those things and took them to the     white men who said it is true you have killed men      q you mean to tell me that any white man ordered your bodies to     be mutilated like that and those parts of you carried to him      p p o o and all shouting yes many white men d e did it      q you say this is true were many of you so treated after being     shot      all shouting out nkoto nkoto very many very many      there was no doubt that these people were not inventing their     vehemence their flashing eyes their excitement was not simulated     doubtless they exaggerated the numbers but they were clearly telling     what they knew and loathed i was told that they often became so     furious at the recollection of what had been done to them that they     lost control over themselves one of the men before me was getting     into this state now  such is the storyor a very small portion of itwhich his majestys consul conveyed to his majestys government as to the condition of those natives who in the name of almighty god we had pledged ourselves to defend  the same damning white book contained a brief account of lord cromers experience upon the upper nile in the lado district he notes that for eighty miles the side of the river which is british territory was crowded with native villages the inhabitants of which ran along the bank calling to the steamer the other bank congolese territory was a deserted wilderness the tuquoque argument which king leopolds henchmen are so fond of advancing will find it hard to reconcile the difference lord cromer ends his report      it appears to me that the facts which i have stated above afford     amply sufficient evidence of the spirit which animates the belgian     administration if indeed administration it can be called the     government so far as i could judge is conducted almost exclusively     on commercial principles and even judged by that standard it would     appear that those principles are somewhat shortsighted  in the same white book which contains these documents there is printed the congolese defence drawn up by m de cuvelier the defence consists in simply ignoring all the definite facts laid before the public and in making such statements as that the british have themselves made war upon natives as if there were no distinction between war and massacre and that the british have put a polltax upon natives which if it be reasonable in amount is a perfectly just proceeding adopted by all colonial nations let the possessors of the free state use this system and at the same time restore the freedom of trade by throwing open the country to all and returning to the natives that land and produce which has been taken from them when they have done thisand punished the guiltythere will be an end of anticongo agitation beyond this a large part nearly half of the congo reply notes sur le rapport de mr casement de dec 11 1903 is taken up by trying to show that in one case of mutilation the injuries were in truth inflicted by a wild boar there must be many wild boars in congo land and their habits are of a singular nature it is not in the congo that these boars are bred     viii  king leopolds commission and its report   the immediate effect of the publication as a state paper of the general comment of lord cromer and of the definite accusations of consul casement was a demand both in belgium and in england for an official inquiry lord landsdowne stipulated that this inquiry should be impartial and thorough it was also suggested by the british government that it should be international in character and separated from the local administration very grudgingly and under constant pressure the king appointed a commission but whittled down its powers to such a point that its proceedings must lose all utility such were the terms that they provoked remonstrance from men like m a j wauters the belgian historian of the congo free state who protested in the mouvement g√©ographique august 7th 1904 that such a body could serve no useful end finally their functions were slightly increased but they possessed no punitive powers and were hampered in every direction by the terms of their reference  the personnel of the commission was worthy of the importance of the inquiry m janssens a wellknown jurist of belgium was the president he impressed all who came in contact with him as a man of upright and sympathetic character baron niscos appointment was open to criticism as he was himself a congo functionary but save for that fact there was no complaint to make against him dr schumacher a distinguished swiss lawyer was the third commissioner the english government applied to have a representative upon the tribunal and with true congo subtlety the request was granted after the three judges had reached the congo the englishman mr mackie hurried out but was only in time to attend the last three sittings which were held in the lower part of the river far from the notorious rubber agents it is worth noting that on his arrival he applied for the minutes of the previous meetings and that his application was refused in belgium the evidence of the commission has never been published and it is safe to say that it never will be fortunately the congo missionaries took copious notes of the proceedings and of the testimony which came immediately under their own notice it is from their evidence that i draw these accounts if the congo authorities contest the accuracy of those accounts then let them confute them forever and put their accusers to confusion by producing the actual minutes which they hold  the first sitting of any length of which there are records is that at bolobo and extended from november 5th to 12th 1904 the veteran mr grenfell gave evidence at this sitting and it is useful to summarize his views as he was one of the men who held out longest against the condemnation of king leopold and because his early utterances have been quoted as if he were a supporter of the system he expressed to the commissioners his disappointment at the failure of the congo government to realize the promises with which it inaugurated its career he declared he could no longer wear the decorations which he had received from the sovereign of the congo state he gave it as his opinion that the ills the country was suffering from were due to the haste of a few men to get rich and to the absence of anything like a serious attempt to properly police the country in the interests of the people he instanced the few judicial officers and the virtual impossibility of a native obtaining justice owing to witnesses being compelled to travel long distances either to leopoldville or boma mr grenfell spoke out emphatically against the administrative r√©gime on the upper river so far as it had been brought under his notice  mr scrivener a gentleman who had been twentythree years on the congo was the next witness his evidence was largely the same as the diary from which i have already quoted concerning the condition of the crown domain many witnesses were examined how do you know the names of the men murdered a lad was asked one of them was my father was the dramatic reply men of stone wrote mr scrivener would be moved by the stories that are unfolded as the commission probes this awful history of rubber collection  mr gilchrist another missionary was a new witness his testimony was concerned with the state domain and the concessionnaire area principally on the lulanga river he said      i also told them what we had seen on the ikelemba of the signs of     desolation in all the districts of the heartrending stories the     people told us of the butcheries wrought by the various white men of     the state and companies who had from time to time been stationed     there among whom a few names were notorious i pointed out to them the     fact that the basin of the ikelemba was supposed to be freetrade     territory also but that everywhere the people of the various     districts were compelled to serve the companies of these respective     districts in rubber gum copal or food at one outoftheway place     where we were on the south bank two men arrived just as we were     leaving with their bodies covered with marks of the chicotte which     they had just received from the trader of bosci because their quantity     had been short i said to the commissaire given favourable     conditions particularly freedom there would soon be a large     population in these interior towns the ngombe and mongo  in answer to questions the following facts were solicited      unsettled condition of the people the older people never seem to     have confidence to build their houses substantially if they have any     suspicion of the approach of a canoe or steamer with soldiers they     flee      chest disease pneumonia etc these carry off very many the     people flee to the islands live in the open air expose themselves to     all kinds of weather contract chills which are followed by serious     lung troubles and die for years we never saw a new house because of     the drifting population they have a great fear of soldiers in the     case of many the absence from the villages is temporary in the case     of a few they permanently settle on the north bank of the river      want of proper nourishment i have witnessed the collecting of the     state imposition and after this was set aside the natives had nothing     but leaves to eat  also that fines which the commission at once declared to be illegal were constantly levied on the people and that these fines had continued after the matter had been reported to the governorgeneral in spite of this declaration of illegality no steps were taken in the matter and m de bauw the chief offender was by last accounts the supreme executive official of the district at every turn one finds that there is no relation at all between law and practice in the congo law is habitually broken by every official from the governorgeneral downward if the profits of the state can be increased thereby the only stern enforcement of the laws is toward the foreigner the austrian rubinck or the englishman stokes who is foolish enough to think that an international agreement is of more weight than the edicts of boma these men believed it and met their death through their belief without redress and even in the case of the austrian without public remonstrance  the next considerable session of the commission was at baringa mr harris and mr stannard the missionaries at this station had played a noble part throughout in endeavouring within their very limited powers to shield the natives from their tormentors in both cases and also in that of mrs harris this had been done at the repeated risk of their lives their white neighbours of the rubber factories made their lives miserable also by preventing their receipt of food from the natives and harassing them in various ways on one occasion a chief and his son were both murdered by the order of the white agent because they had supplied the harris household with the forequarter of an antelope before giving the terrible testimony of the missionariesa testimony which was admitted to be true by the chief agent of the abir company on the spot it would be well to show the exact standing of this corporation and its relation to the state these relations are so close that they become to all intents and purposes the same the state holds fifty per cent of the shares it places the government soldiers at the companys disposal it carries up in the government steamers and supplies licenses for the great number of rifles and the quantity of cartridges which the company needs for its murderous work whatever crimes are done by the company the state is a close accomplice finally the european directors of this bloodstained company are or were at the time the senator van der nest who acted as president and as council count john doultremont grand marshal of the belgian court baron dhanis of congo fame and m van eetevelde the creature of the king and the writer of so many smug despatches to the british government about the mission of civilization and the high purpose of the congo state now listen to some of the testimony as condensed by mr harris      first the specific atrocities during 1904 were dealt with including     men women and children then murders and outrages including     cannibalism from this i passed on to the imprisonment of men women     and children following this i called attention to the destruction of     the baringa towns and the partial famine among the people in     consequence also the large gangs of prisonersmen women and     childrenimprisoned to carry out this work the murder of two men     whilst it was being done next followed the irregularities during     1903 the expedition conducted by an abir agent against     sambekota and the arming continually of abir sentries with     albini rifles following this i drew attention to the administration     of mons forcie whose r√©gime was a terrible one including the     murder of isekifasu the principal chief of bolima the killing     cutting up and eating of his wives son and children the decorating     of the chief houses with the intestines liver and heart of some of     the killed as stated by veritas in the west african mail      i confirmed in general the letter published in the west african     mail by veritas      following this i came to mons tagners time and stated that no     village in this district had escaped murders under this mans     r√©gime      next we dealt with irregularities common to all agents calling     attention to and proving by specific instances the public floggings of     practically any and every one quoting for instance seeing with my     own eyes six ngombe men receive one hundred strokes each delivered     simultaneously by two sentries      next the normal condition has always been the imprisoning of men     women and children all herded together in one shed with no     arrangement for the demands of nature further that very many     including even chiefs had died either in prison or immediately on     their release      next the mutilation of the woman boaji because she wished to remain     faithful to her husband and refused to subject herself to the     passions of the sentries the womans footless leg and hernia testify     to the truth of her statement she appeared before the commission and     doctor      next the fact that natives are imprisoned for visiting friends and     relatives in other villages and the refusal to allow native canoes to     pass up and down river without carrying a permit signed by the rubber     agent pointing out that even missionaries are subject to these     restrictions and publicly insulted in an unprintable manner when     they do so      next point dealt with was responsibilitymaintaining that     responsibility lay not so much in the individual as in the system the     sentry blames the agent he in turn the director and so on      i next called attention to the difficulties to be faced by natives in     reporting irregularities the number of civil officials is too small     the practical impossibility of reaching those that do existthe     native having first to ask permission of the rubber agent      the relations that are at present necessary between the abir and     the state render it highly improbable that the natives will ever     report irregularities i then pointed out that we firmly believe that     but for us these irregularities would never have come to light      following on this the difficulties to be faced by missionaries were     dealt with pointing out that the abir can and do impose on us all     sorts of restrictions if we dare to speak a word about their     irregularities i then quoted a few of the many instances which found     their climax in mrs harris and i almost losing our lives for daring     to oppose the massacres by van caelcken it was also stated that we     could not disconnect the attitude of the state in refusing us fresh     sites with our action in condemning the administration i then     mentioned that the forests are exhausted of rubber pointing out that     during a five days tour through the forests i did not see a single     vine of any size this is solely because the vines have been worked in     such a manner that all the rubber roots need many years rest whereas     the natives now are actually reduced to digging up those roots in     order to get rubber      the next subject dealt with was the clear violation both of the     spirit and letter of the berlin act in the first place we are not     allowed to extend the mission and further we are forbidden to trade     even for food      next the statement was made that so far as we are aware no single     sentry had ever been punished by the state till 1904 for the many     murders committed in this district      i next pointed out that one reason why the natives object to paddle     for the abir is because of the sentries who travel in the abir     canoes and whose only business is to flog the paddlers in order to     keep them going      after mr stannard had been heard sixteen esanga witnesses were     questioned one by one they gave clearly the details of how father     mother brother sister son or daughter were killed in cold blood for     rubber these sixteen represented over twenty murders in esanga alone     then followed the big chief of all bolima who succeeded isekifasu     murdered by the abir what a sight for those who prate about     lying missionaries he stood boldly before all pointed to his twenty     witnesses placed on the table his one hundred and ten twigs each     twig representing a life for rubber these are chiefs twigs these     are mens these shorter are womens these smaller still are     childrens he gives the names of scores but begs for permission to     call his son as a reminder the commission though is satisfied with     him that he is telling the truth and therefore say that it is     unnecessary he tells how his beard of many years growth and which     nearly reached his feet was cut off by a rubber agent merely because     he visited a friend in another town asked if he had not killed     abir sentries he denied it but owned to his people spearing     three of the sentrys boys he tells how the white man fought him and     when the fight was over handed him his corpses and said now you     will bring rubber wont you to which he replied yes the corpses     were cut up and eaten by mons forcies fighters he also told how he     had been chicotted and imprisoned by the abir agent and further     put to the most menial labour by the agent      here bonkoko came forward and told how he accompanied the abir     sentries when they went to murder isekifasu and his wives and little     ones of finding them peacefully sitting at their evening meal of the     killing as many as they could also the cutting up and eating of the     bodies of isekifasus son and his fathers wives of how they dashed     the babys brains out cut the body in half and impaled the halves      again he tells how on their return mons forcie had the sentries     chicotted because they had not killed enough of the bolima people      next came bongwalanga and confirmed bonkokos story this youth went     to look on after this the mutilated wife of lomboto of ekerongo     was carried by a chief who showed her footless leg and hernia this     was the price she had to pay for remaining faithful to her husband     the husband told how he was chicotted because he was angry about his     wifes mutilation      then longoi of lotoko placed eighteen twigs on the table     representing eighteen men women and children murdered for rubber     next inunga laid thirtyfour twigs on the table and told how     thirtyfour of his men women and children had been murdered at     ekerongo he admits that they had speared one sentry iloko but that     as in every other such instance was because iloko had first killed     their people lomboto shows his mutilated wrist and useless hand     done by the sentry isekansu shows his stump of a forearm telling the     same pitiful story every witness tells of floggings rape     mutilations murders and of imprisonments of men women and children     and of illegal fines and irregular taxes etc etc the commission     endeavours to get through this slough of iniquity and river of blood     but finding it hopeless asks how much longer i can go on i tell them     i can go on until they are satisfied that hundreds of murders have     been committed by the abir in this district alone murders of     chiefs men women and little children and that multitudes of     witnesses only await my signal to appear by the thousand      i further point out that we have only considered about two hundred     murders from the villages of bolima esanga ekerongo lotoko that by     far the greater majority still remain the following districts are as     yet untouched bokri nsongo boruga ekala baringa linza     lifindu nsongomboyo livoku boendo the lomako river the ngombe     country and many others all of whom have the same tale to tell     every one saw the hopelessness of trying to investigate things fully     to do so the commission would have to stay here for months  what comment can be added to such evidence as this it stands in its naked horror and it is futile to try to make it more vivid what can any of those english apologists of the congo who have thrown a doubt upon the accounts of outrages because in passing through a section of this huge country upon a flying visit they had not happened to see themwhat can lord mountmorris captain boyd alexander or mrs french sheldon say in the face of a mass of evidence with the actual mutilated limbs and excoriated backs to enforce it can they say more than the man actually incriminated m le jeune the chief agent at the spot what have you to say asked the president m le jeune shrugged his shoulders he had nothing to say the president who had listened to his honour be it spoken with tears running down his cheeks to some of the evidence cried out in amazement and disgust there is one document i would put in said the agent it is to show that 142 of my sentinels were slain by the villagers in the course of seven months surely that makes the matter worse cried the sagacious judge if these wellarmed men were slain by the defenceless villagers how terrible must the wrongs have been which called for such desperate reprisals  you will ask what was done with this criminal agent a man whose deeds merited the heaviest punishment that human law could bestow nothing whatever was done to him he was allowed to slip out of the country exactly as captain lothaire in similar circumstances was allowed to slip from the country an insignificant agent may be occasionally made an example of but to punish the local manager of a great company would be to lessen the output of rubber and what are morality and justice compared to that  why should one continue with the testimony given before the commission their wanderings covered a little space of the country and were confined to the main river but everywhere they elicited the same tale of slavery mutilation and murder what scrivener and grenfell said at bolobo was what harris and stannard said at baringa what gilchrist said at lulanga what rushin and gamman said at bongadanga what mr and mrs lower said at ikan what padfield said at bonginda what weeks said at monscombe the place varied but the results of the system were ever the same here and there were human touches which lingered in the memory here and there also episodes of horror which stood out even in that universal golgotha one lad testified that he had lost every relative in the world male or female all murdered for rubber as his father lay dying he had given him the charge of two infant brothers and enjoined him to guard them tenderly he had cared for them until he had been compelled at last to go himself into the forest to gather the rubber one week their quantity had been short when he returned from the wood the village had been raided in his absence and he found his two little brothers lying disembowelled across a log the company however paid 200 per cent  four natives had been tortured until they cried out for some one to bring a gun and shoot them  the chiefs died because their hearts were broken  mr gamman knew no village where it took them less than ten days out of fifteen to satisfy the demands of the abir as a rule the people had four days in a month to themselves by law the maximum of forced labour was forty hours in a month but as i have said there is no relation at all between law and practice in the congo  one witness appeared with a string knotted in fortytwo places and with a packet of fifty leaves each knot represented a murder and each leaf a rope in his native village  the son of a murdered chief took the body of his father all names dates and place specified to show it to the white agent in the hope of justice the agent called his dog and set it on him the dog biting the son on the leg as he carried the corpse of his father  the villagers brought their murdered men to m spelier director of the la lulanga company he accused them of lying and ordered them off  one chief was seized by two white agents one of whom held him while the other beat him when they had finished they kicked him to make him get up but the man was dead the commission examined ten witnesses in their investigation of this story the chief was jonghi the village bogeka the date october 1904  such is a fractional sample of the evidence which was laid before the commission corroborated by every detail of name place and date which could enforce conviction there is no doubt that it did enforce thorough conviction the judges travelled down the river sadder and wiser men when they reached boma they had an interview with governorgeneral constermann what passed at that interview has not been published but the governorgeneral went forth from it and cut his own throat the fact may perhaps give some indication of how the judges felt when the stories were still fresh in their minds and their nerves wincing under the horror of the evidence  a whole year elapsed between the starting of the commission and the presentation of their report which was published upon october 31st 1905 the evidence which would have stirred europe to its foundations was never published at all in spite of an informal assurance to lord lansdowne that nothing would be held back only the conclusions saw the light without the document upon which they were founded  the effect of that report when stripped of its courtly phrases was an absolute confirmation of all that had been said by so many witnesses during so many years it is easy to blame the commissioners for not having the full courage of their convictions but their position was full of difficulty the report was really a personal one the state was as no one knew better than themselves a fiction it was the king who had sent them and it was to the king himself that they were reporting upon a matter which deeply affected his personal honour as well as his material interests had they been as had been suggested an international body the matter would have been simple but of the three good care had been taken that two should be men who would have to answer for what was said mr janssens was a more or less independent man but a belgian and a subject all the same baron nisco was in the actual employ of the king and his future was at stake on the whole i think that the commissioners acted like brave and honest men  naturally they laid all stress upon what could be said in favour of the king and his creation they would have been more than human had they not done so they enlarged upon the size and the traffic of the cities at the mouth of the congoas if the whole loot of a nation could pass down a river without causing commerce and riches at its mouth very early in the report they indicated that the question of the state appropriation of the land had forced itself upon their notice if the state wishes to avoid the principle of the state appropriation of vacant lands resulting in abuse says the report it should place its agents and officials on their guard against too restrictive interpretation and too rigorous applications weak and trimming it is true but it was the cornerstone of all that the king had built and how were they to knock it rudely out their attitude was not heroic but it was natural they go on      as the greater portion of the land in the congo is not under     cultivation this interpretation concedes to the state a right of     absolute and exclusive ownership over virtually the whole of the land     with this consequence that it can disposeitself and solelyof all     the products of the soil prosecute as a poacher any one who takes     from that land the least of its fruits or as a receiver of stolen     goods any one who receives such fruit forbid any one to establish     himself on the greater part of the territory the activity of the     natives is thus limited to very restricted areas and their economic     condition is immobilized thus abusively applied such legislation     would prevent any development of native life in this manner not only     has the native been often forbidden to shift his village but he has     even been forbidden to visit even temporarily a neighbouring village     without special permit a native displacing himself without being the     bearer of such an authorization would leave himself open to arrest     to be taken back and even punished  who could possibly deny after reading this passage that the congo native has been reduced from freedom into slavery there follows a curious sentence      let us hasten says the report to say that in actual fact so great     a rigour has not been shown almost everywhere certain products of the     domain have been abandoned to the natives notably palm kernels which     form the object of an important export trade in the lower congo  this palm kernel trade is an oldestablished one affecting only the mouth of the river which could not be disturbed without obvious international complications and which bears no relation to the great upper congo populations whose inhuman treatment was the question at issue  the report then proceeds to point out very clearly the allimportant fact which arises from the expropriation of the native from the land apart from the rough plantations it says which barely suffice to feed the natives themselves and to supply the stations all the fruits of the soil are considered as the property of the state or of the concessionnaire societies this being so there is an end forever of free trade or indeed of any trade save an export by the government itself or by a handful of companies which really represent the government of the whole wealth of the country to europe for the benefit of a ring of millionaires  having dealt with the taking of the land and the taking of its products the commission handles with kid gloves the third great root proposition the forcing of the natives for nothing under the name of taxes for trifles under the absurd name of trade to work for the sake of their oppressors it expends many words in showing that natives do not like work and that therefore compulsion is necessary it is sad to see just and learned men driven to such straits in defending what is indefensible do the blacks of the rand gold mines like work do the kimberley diamond hunters like work do the carriers of an east german caravan like work no more than the congolese why then do they work because they are paid a fair wage to do so because the money earned by their work can bring them more pleasure than the work does pain that is the law of work the whole world over notably it is the law on the congo itself where the missionaries who pay honestly for work have no difficulty in getting it of course the congolese like the englishman or the belgian does not like work when it is work which brings a benefit to others and none to himself  but in spite of this preamble the commission cannot escape the actual facts      numbers of agents only thought of one thing to obtain as much as     possible in the shortest possible time and their demands were often     excessive this is not at all astonishing at any rate as regards the     gathering of the produce of the domain      that is to say the revenues for government      for the agents themselves who regulated the tax and saw to its     collection had a direct interest in increasing its amount since they     received proportional bonuses on the produce thus collected  no more definite statement could be made of the system which had been attacked by the reformers and denied by the congo officials for so many years the report then goes on to tell that when the state in one of those pretended reforms which were meant for european not for congolese use allotted forty hours of forced labour per month as the amount which the native owed the state the announcement was accompanied by a private intimation from the governorgeneral to the district commissioners dated february 23rd 1904 that this new law must have the effect not of lessening but of bringing about a constant increase in the resources of the treasury could they be told in plainer terms that they were to disregard it  the land is taken the produce is taken the labour is taken in old days the african slave was exported but we progress with the ages and now a higher intelligence has shown the folly of the oldfashioned methods when it is to easy to enslave him in his own home  we may pass the report of the commission in so far as it deals with the taxation of the natives food taxes porterage taxes and other imposts it brings out very clearly the curse of the parasitic army with their families which have to be fed by the natives and the difficulty which it causes them with their limited plantations to find the means for feeding themselves even the wood to the state steamers is not paid for but is taken as a tax such demands force the natives in the neighbourhood of the stations in certain cases to an almost continuous laboura fresh admission of slave conditions the report describes the result of the rubber tax in the following terms      this circumstance exhaustion of the rubber explains the repugnance     of the native for rubber work which in itself is not particularly     painful in the majority of cases the native must go one or two days     march every fortnight until he arrives at that part of the forest     where the rubber vines can be met with in a certain degree of     abundance there the collector passes a number of days in a miserable     existence he has to build himself an improvised shelter which     cannot obviously replace his hut he has not the food to which he is     accustomed he is deprived of his wife exposed to the inclemencies of     the weather and the attacks of wild beasts when once he has collected     the rubber he must bring it to the state station or to that of the     company and only then can he return to his village where he can     sojourn for barely more than two or three days because the next     demand is upon him it is hardly necessary to add that this state     of affairs is a flagrant violation of the forty hours law  the report deals finally with the question of the punishments meted out by the state these it enumerates as the taking of hostages the imprisonment of the chiefs the institution of sentries or capitas fines and military expeditions the latter being a euphemism for coldblooded massacres it continues      whatever one may think of native ideas acts such as taking women as     hostages outrage too much our ideas of justice to be tolerated the     state has prohibited this practice long ago but without being able to     suppress it  the state prohibits but the state not only condones but actually commands it by private circular again the gap which lies betwixt law and fact where the interest of gain is concerned      it was barely denied the report continues that in the various     posts of the abir which we visited the imprisonment of women     hostages the subjection of the chiefs to servile labour the     humiliations meted out to them the flogging of rubber collectors the     brutality of the black employ√©s set over the prisoners were the rule     commonly followed  then follows an illuminative passage about the sentries capitas or forest guards or messengers as they are alternatively called it is a wonder that they were not called hospital orderlies in the efforts to make them seem inoffensive what they actually were was as we have seen some twenty thousand cannibals armed with albini repeating rifles the report says      this system of native supervisors surveillants has given rise to     numerous criticisms even on the part of state officials the     protestant missionaries heard at bolobo ikoko lake mantumba     lulonga bonginda ikau baringa and bongandanga drew up formidable     accusations against the acts of these intermediaries they brought     before the commission a multitude of native witnesses who revealed a     large number of crimes and excesses alleged to have been committed by     the sentinels according to the witnesses these auxiliaries     especially those stationed in the villages abuse the authority     conferred upon them convert themselves into despots claiming the     women and the food not only for themselves but for the body of     parasites and creatures without any calling which a love of rapine     causes to become associated with them and with whom they surround     themselves as with a veritable bodyguard they kill without pity all     those who attempt to resist their exigencies and whims the commission     was obviously unable in all cases to verify the exactitude of the     allegations made before it the more so that the facts were often     several years old however truth of the charges is borne out by a     mass of evidence and official reports  it adds      of how many abuses have these native sentinels been guilty it would     be impossible to say even approximately several chiefs of baringa     brought us according to the native custom bundles of sticks each of     which was meant to show one of their subjects killed by the capitas     one of them showed 120 murders in his village committed during the     last few years whatever one may think of the confidence with which     this native form of bookkeeping may inspire one a document handed to     the commission by the director of the abir does not allow any     doubt to remain as to the sinister character of the system it     consisted of a list showing that from 1st january to 1st august     1905that is to say within a space of seven months142 sentries of     the society had been killed or wounded by the natives now it is to     be assumed that in many cases these sentries had been attacked by the     natives by way of revenge one may judge by this of the number of     bloody affrays to which their presence had given rise on the other     hand the agents interrogated by the commission or who were present     at the audiences did not even attempt to deny the charges brought     against the sentinels  that last sentence seems the crown of the arch if the agents on the spot did not attempt before the commission to deny the outrages who shall venture to do it in their name  the remainder of the report though stuffed with courtly platitudes and with vague recommendations of reform which are absolutely unpractical so long as the root causes of all the trouble remain undisturbed contains a few positive passages which are worth preserving talking of the want of definite instructions to military expeditions it says      the consequences are often very murderous and one must not be     astonished if in the course of these delicate operations whose     object it is to seize hostages and to intimidate the natives constant     watch cannot be exercised over the sanguinary instincts of the     soldiers when orders to punish are given by superior authority it is     difficult that the expedition should not degenerate into massacres     accompanied by pillage and incendiarism  again      the responsibility for these abuses must not however always be     placed upon the commanders of military expeditions in considering     these facts one must bear in mind the deplorable confusion still     existing in the upper congo between a state of war and a state of     peace between administration and repression between those who may be     regarded as enemies and those who have the right to be regarded as     citizens of the state and treated in accordance with its laws the     commission was struck with the general tone of the reports relating to     operations described above often while admitting that the expedition     had been sent out solely for shortage in taxation and without making     allusion to an attack or resistance on the part of the natives which     alone would justify the use of arms the authors of these reports     speak of surprising villages energetic pursuit numerous enemies     killed and wounded loot prisoners of war conditions of     peace evidently these officers thought themselves at war acted as     though at war  again      the course of such expeditions grave abuses have occurred men women     and children have been killed even at the very time they sought safety     in flight others have been imprisoned women have been taken as     hostages  there is an interesting passage about the missionaries      often also in the regions where evangelical stations are     established the native instead of going to the magistrate his     natural protector adopts the habit when he thinks he has a grievance     against an agent or an executive officer to confide in the     missionary the latter listens to him helps him according to his     means and makes himself the echo of all the complaints of a region     hence the astounding influence which the missionaries possess in some     parts of the territory it exercises itself not only among the natives     within the purview of their religious propaganda but over all the     villages whose troubles they have listened to the missionary becomes     for the native of the region the only representative of equity and     justice he adds to the ascendancy acquired from his religious zeal     the prestige which in the interest of the state itself should be     invested in the magistrates  i will now turn for a moment to contemplate the document as a whole  with the characteristic policy of the congo authorities it was originally given to the world as being a triumphant vindication of king leopolds administration which would certainly have been the greatest whitewashing contract ever yet carried through upon this planet looked at more closely it is clearly seen that behind the veil of courtly phrase and complimentary forms every single thing that the reformers have been claiming has been absolutely established that the land has been taken that the produce has been taken that the people are enslaved that they are reduced to misery that the white agents have given the capitas a free hand against them that there have been illegal holdings of hostages predatory expeditions murders and mutilations all these things are absolutely admitted i do not know that anything more has ever been claimed save that the commission talks coldly of what a private man must talk of hotly and that the commission might give the impression that they were isolated acts whereas the evidence here given and the general depopulation of the country show that they are general universal and parts of a single system extending from leopoldville to the great lakes and from the french border to katanga be it private domain crown domain or concessionnaire territory be it land of the kasai the anversoise the abir or the katanga companies the tale still tells of bloodshed and horror  where the commission differs from the reformers is in their estimate of the gravity of this situation and of the need of absolute radical reforms it is to be borne in mind that of the three judges two had never been in africa before while the third was a direct servant of the attacked institution they seem to have vaguely felt that these terrible facts were necessary phases of colonial expansion had they travelled as i have done in british west africa and had it been brought home to them that a blow to a black man sierra leone for example would mean that one would be taken by a black policeman before a black judge to be handed over to a black gaoler they would understand that there are other methods of administration had they ever read of that british governor of jamaica who having in the face of dangerous revolt executed a negro without due forms of law was recalled to london tried and barely escaped with his life it is by such tension as this that europeans in the tropics whatever be their nation must be braced up to maintain their civilized morale human nature is weak the influence of environment is strong germans or english would yield and in isolated cases have yielded to their surroundings no nation can claim much individual superiority in such a matter but for both germany and england i would add france were it not for the french congo can claim that their system works as strongly against outrage as the belgian one does in favour of it these things are not as the commissioners seemed to think necessary evils which are tolerated elsewhere how can their raw opinion weigh for a moment upon such a point when it is counterbalanced by the words of such reformers as sir harry johnston or lord cromer the fact is that the running of a tropical colony is of all tests the most searching as to the development of the nation which attempts it to see helpless people and not to oppress them to see great wealth and not to confiscate it to have absolute power and not to abuse it to raise the native instead of sinking yourselfthese are the supreme trials of a nations spirit we have all failed at times but never has there been failure so hopeless so shocking bearing such consequences to the world such degradation to the good name of christianity and civilization as the failure of the belgians in the congo  and all this has happened and all this has been tolerated in an age of progress the greatest deepest most widereaching crime of which there is any record has been reserved for these latter years some excuse there is for racial extermination where as with saxons and celts two peoples contend for the same land which will but hold one some excuse too for religious massacre when like mahomet the second at constantinople or alva in the lowlands the bigoted murderers honestly conceived that their brutal work was in the interest of god but here the real doers have sat remote with cold blood in their veins knowing well from day to day what they were doing and with the sole object of adding more to wealth which was already enormous consider this circumstance and consider also the professions of philanthropy with which the huge massacre was inaugurated the cloud of lies with which it has been screened the persecution and calumny of the few honest men who uncovered it the turning of religion against religion and of nation against nation in the attempt to perpetuate it and having weighed all this tell me where in the course of history there is any such story what is progress is it to run a little faster in a motorcar to listen to gabble in a gramophonethese are the toys of life but if progress is a spiritual thing then we do not progress such a horror as this of belgium and the congo would not have been possible fifty years ago no european nation would have done it and if it had no other one would have failed to raise its voice in protest there was more decorum and principle in life in those slower days we live in a time of rush but do not call it progress the story of the congo has made the idea a little absurd     ix  the congo after the commission   the high hopes which the advent of the commission raised among the natives and the few europeans who had acted as their champions were soon turned to bitter disappointment the indefatigable mr harris had sent on after the commission a number of fresh cases which had come to his notice in one of these a chief deposed that he had been held back in his village boendo in order to prevent him from reaching the commission he succeeded in breaking away from his guards but was punished for his enterprise by having his wife clubbed to death by a sentry he brought with him in the hope that he might lay them before the judges one hundred and eightytwo long twigs and seventysix smaller ones to represent so many adults and children who had been murdered by the abir company in his district during the last few years his account of the methods by which these unfortunate people met their deaths will not bear printing the wildest dreams of the inquisition were outdone women had been killed by thrusting stakes into them from below when the horrified missionary asked the chief if this was personally known to him his answer was they killed my daughter nsinga in this manner i found the stake in her and a reputable belgian statesman can write in this year of grace that they are carrying on the beneficent and philanthropic mission which has been handed down to them  in a later communication mr harris gives the names of men women and children killed by the sentries of a m pilaet      last year he says or the year before the young woman imenega     was tied to a forked tree and chopped in half with a hatchet     beginning at the left shoulder chopping down through the chest and     abdomen and out at the side again with every detail of name and     place he dwelt upon the horrible fact that public incest had been     enforced by the sentriesbrother with sister and father with     daughter oh inglesia cried the chief in conclusion dont stay     away long if you do they will come i am sure they will come and     then these enfeebled legs will not support me i cannot run away i am     near my end try and see to it that they let me die in peace dont     stay away      i was so moved your excellency at these peoples story that i took     the liberty of promising them in the name of the congo free state     that you will only kill them in future for crimes i told them the     inspector royal was i hoped on his way and that i was sure he would     listen to their story and give them time to recover themselves  it is terrible to think that such a promise through no fault of mr harris has not been fulfilled are the dreams of the commissioners never haunted by the thought of those who put such trust in them but whose only reward has been that they have been punished for the evidence they gave and that their condition has been more miserable than ever the final practical result of the commission was that upon the natives and not upon their murderers came the punishment  m malfeyt a royal high commissioner had been sent out on pretence of reform how hollow was this pretence may be seen from the fact that at the same time m wahis had been despatched as governorgeneral in place of that constermann who had committed suicide after his interview with the judges of the commission wahis had already served two terms as governor and it was under his administration that all the abuses the commission had condemned had actually grown up could king leopold have shown more clearly how far any real reform was from his mind  m malfeyts visit had been held up as a step toward improvement the british government had been assured that his visit would be of a nature to effect all necessary reforms on arriving in the country however he announced that he had no power to act and only came to see and hear thus a few more months were gained before any change could be effected the only small consolation which we can draw from all this succession of impotent ambassadors and reforming committees which do not and were never intended to reform is that the game has been played and exposed and surely cannot be played again a government would deservedly be the laughingstock of the world which again accepted assurances from the same source  what in the meanwhile was the attitude of that abir company whose iniquities had been thoroughly exposed before the commission and whose manager m le jeune had fled to europe was it ashamed of its bloodthirsty deeds was it prepared in any way to modify its policy after the revelations which its representatives had admitted to be true read the following interview which mr stannard had with m delvaux who had visited the stations of his disgraced colleague      he spoke of the commission of inquiry in a contemptuous manner and     showed considerable annoyance about the things we had said to the     commission he declared the abir had full authority and power to     send out armed sentries and force the people to bring in rubber and     to imprison those who did not a short time ago the natives of a town     brought in some rubber to the agent here but he refused it because it     was not enough and the men were thrashed by the abir employees     and driven away the director justified the agent in refusing the     rubber because the quantity was too small the commissioners had     declared that the abir had no power to send armed sentries into     the towns in order to flog the people and drive them into the forests     to seek rubber they were guards of the forest and that was their     work when we pointed this out to m delvaux he poohpoohed the idea     and said the name had no significance some called the sentries by one     name some by another we pointed out that the people were not     compelled to pay their taxes in rubber only but could bring in other     things or even currency he denied this and said that the     alternative tax only meant that an agent could impose whatever tax he     thought fit it had no reference whatever to the natives the abir     preferred the taxes to be paid in rubber this is what the abir     says in spite of the interpretation by baron nisco the highest     judicial authority in the state that the natives could pay their     taxes in what they were best able all these things were said in the     presence of the royal high commissioner who whether he approved or     not certainly did not contradict or protest against them  within a week or two of the departure of the commission the state of the country was as bad as ever it cannot be too often repeated that it was not local in its origin but that it occurred there as elsewhere on account of pressure from the central officials if further proof were needed of this it is to be found in the van caelchen trial this agent having been arrested succeeded in showing as was done in the caudron case that the real guilt lay with his superior officers in his defence he      bases his power on a letter of the commissaireg√©n√©ral de bauw the     supreme executive officer in the district and in a circular     transmitted to him by his director and signed constermann     governorgeneral which he read to the court deploring the     diminished output in rubber and saying that the agents of the     abir should not forget that they had the same powers of     contrainte par corps bodily detention as were delegated to the     agent of the soci√©t√© commerciale anversoise au congo for the increase     of rubber production that if the governorgeneral or his     commissaireg√©n√©ral did not know what they were writing and what they     signed he knows what orders he had to obey it was not for him to     question the legality or illegality of these orders his superiors     ought to have known and have weighed what they wrote before giving him     orders to execute that bodily detention of natives for rubber was no     secret seeing that at the end of every month a statement of     contrainte par corps bodily detention during the month has to be     furnished in duplicate the book signed and one of the copies     transmitted to the government  whilst these organized outrages were continuing in the congo king leopold at belgium had taken a fresh step which in its cynical disregard for any attempt at consistency surpassed any of his previous performances feeling that something must be done in the face of the finding of his own delegates he appointed a fresh commission whose terms of reference were to study the conclusions of the commission of inquiry to formulate the proposals they call for and to seek for practical means for realizing them it is worth while to enumerate the names of the men chosen for this work had a european areopagus called before it the head criminals of this terrible business all of these men with the exception of two or three would have been standing in the dock take their names in turn van maldeghem the presidenta jurist who had written on congo law but had no direct complicity in the crimes janssens the president of the former commission a man of integrity m davignon a belgian politicianso far the selection is a possible onenow listen to the others de cuvelier creature of the king and responsible for the congo horrors droogmans creature of the king administrator of the secret funds derived from his african estates and himself president of a rubber trust arnold creature of the king liebrechts the same gohr the same chenot a congo commissioner tombeur the same fiv√© a congo inspector nys the chief legal upholder of the kings system de hemptinne president of the kasai rubber trust mobs an administrator of the abir is it not evident that save the first three these were the very men who were on their trial the whole appointment is an example of that cynical humour which gives a grotesque touch to this inconceivable story it need not be added that no result making for reform ever came from such an assembly one can but rejoice that the presence of the small humane minority may have prevented the others from devising some fresh methods of oppression  it cannot be said however that no judicial proceedings and no condemnation arose from the actions of the congo commission but who could ever guess who the man was who was dragged to the bar on the evidence of natives and missionaries the whole white hierarchy from governorgeneral to subsidized cannibal had been shown to be bloodguilty which of them was punished none of them but mr stannard one of the accusing witnesses he had shown that the soldiers of a certain m hagstrom had behaved brutally to the natives this was the account of lontulu the chief      lontulu the senior chief of bolima came with twenty witnesses     which was all the canoe would hold he brought with him one hundred     and ten twigs each of which represented a life sacrificed for rubber     the twigs were of different lengths and represented chiefs men women     and children according to their length it was a horrible story of     massacre mutilation and cannibalism that he had to tell and it was     perfectly clear that he was telling the truth he was further     supported by other eyewitnesses these crimes were committed by those     who were acting under the instructions and with the knowledge of white     men on one occasion the sentries were flogged because they had not     killed enough people at one time after they had killed a number of     people including isekifasu the principal chief his wives and     children the bodies except that of isekifasu were cut up and the     cannibalistic fighters attached to the abir force were rationed on     the meat thus supplied the intestines etc were hung up in and     about the house and a little child who had been cut in halves was     impaled after one attack lontulu the chief was shown the dead     bodies of his people and asked by the rubber agent if he would bring     in rubber now he replied that he would although a chief of     considerable standing he has been flogged imprisoned tied by the     neck with men who were regarded as slaves made to do the most menial     work and his beard which was of many years growth and reached     almost to the ground was cut off by the rubber agent because he     visited another town  lontulu was crossexamined by the commission and his evidence was not shaken here are some of the questions and answers      president janssens m hagstrom leur a fait la guerre il a tu√©     beaucoup dhommes avec ses soldats      to lontulu were the people of monji etc given the corpses to     eat      lontulu yes they cut them up and ate them      baron nisco did they flog you      lontulu repeatedly      baron nisco who cut your beard off      lontulu m hannotte      president janssens did you see sentries kill your people did they     kill many      lontulu yes all my family is finished      president give us names      lontulu chiefs bokomo isekifasu botamba longeva bosangi     booifa eongo lomboto loma bayolo      then followed names of women and children and ordinary men not     chiefs      lontulu may i call my son lest i make a mistake      president it is unnecessary go on      lontulu bomposa beanda ekila      president are you sure that each of your twigs 110 represents one     person killed      lontulu yes      president was isekifasu killed at this time      reply not recorded      president did you see his entrails hanging on his house      lontulu yes      question were the sentries and people who helped given the dead     bodies to eat      answer yes they ate them those who took part in the fight cut     them up and ate them he was chicotted flogged and said why     do you do this is it right to flog a chief gave a very full     account of his harsh treatment and sufferings  the action was taken for criminal libel by m hagstrom against mr stannard for saying that this evidence had been given before the commission of course the only way to establish the fact was a reference to the evidence itself which lay at brussels but as hagstrom was only a puppet of the higher government of the congo which means the king himself in their attempt to revenge themselves upon the missionaries it was not very likely that official documents would be produced for the mere purpose of serving the end of justice the minutes then were not forthcoming how then was mr stannard to produce evidence that his account was correct obviously by producing lontulu the chief but the wretched lontulu beaten and tortured with his beard plucked off and his spirit broken had been cast into gaol before the trial and knew well what would be his fate if he testified against his masters he withdrew all that he had said at the commissionand who can blame him so m hagstrom obtained his verdict and the belgian reptile press proclaimed that mr stannard had been proved to be a liar he was sentenced to three months imprisonment with the alternative of a ¬£40 fine even as i write two more of these lionhearted missionaries americans this timemr morrison and mr shepherdare undergoing a similar prosecution on the congo this time it is the kasai company which is the injured innocent but the eyes of europe and america are on the transaction and m vandervelde the fearless belgian advocate of liberty has set forth to act for the accused what m labori was to dreyfus m vandervelde has been to the congo save that it is a whole nation who are his clients he and his noble comrade mr lorand are the two men who redeem the record of infamy which must long darken the good name of belgium  i will now deal swiftly with the records of evil deeds which have occurred since the time which i have already treated i say swiftly not because there is not much material from which to choose but because i feel that my reader must be as sated with horrors as i who have to write them here are some notes of a journey undertaken by w cassie murdoch as recently as july and september 1907 this time we are concerned with the crown domain king leopolds private estate of which we have such accounts from mr clark and mr scrivener dating as far back as 1894 thirteen years had elapsed and no change what do these thirteen represent in torture and murder could all these screams be united what a vast cry would have reached the heavens in the congo hell the most lurid glow is to be found in the royal domain and the money dragged from these tortured people is used in turn to corrupt newspapers and public menthat it may be possible to continue the system so the devils wheel goes round and round here are some extracts from mr murdochs report      i remarked to the old chief of the largest town i came across that     his people seemed to be numerous ah said he my people are all     dead these you see are only a very few of what i once had and     indeed it was evident enough that his town had once been a place of     great size and importance there cannot be the least doubt that this     depopulation is directly due to the state everywhere i went i heard     stories of the raids made by the state soldiers the number of people     they shot or otherwise tortured to death must have been enormous     perhaps as many more of those who escaped the rifle died from     starvation and exposure more than one of my carriers could tell of     how their villages had been raided and of their own narrow escapes     they are not a warlike people and i could hear of no single attempt     at resistance they are the kind of people the state soldiers are most     successful with they would rather any day run away than fight and in     fact they have nothing to fight with except a few bows and arrows i     have been trying to reckon the probable number of people i met with i     should say that five thousand is if anything beyond the mark a few     years ago the population of the district i passed through must have     been four times that number on my return march i was desirous of     visiting mbelo the place where lieutenant massard had been stationed     and in which he committed his unspeakable outrages on making     inquiries however i was told that there were no people there now     and that the roads were all dead on reaching one of the roads that     led there it was evident enough that it had not been used for a long     time later on i was able to confirm the statement that what had once     been a district with numerous large towns was now completely     empty      with the exception of a few people living near the one state post now     existing on this side of the lake who supply the state with kwanga     and large mats all the people i saw are taxed with rubber the rubber     tax is an intolerable burdenhow intolerable i should have found it     almost impossible to believe had i not seen it it is difficult to     describe it calmly what i found was simply this the tax demands     from twenty to twentyfive days labour every month there never was     a forty hours per month labour law in the crown domain and so long     as the tax is demanded in rubber there never will beat least in the     section of it i visited if that law were applied no rubber would or     could possibly be produced for the simple reason that there is no     rubber left in this section of the domain      it was some time before i made the discovery that in the domaine de     la couronne west of lake leopold there is no rubber on my way through     i was continually meeting numbers of men going out on the hunt for     rubber and heard with amazement the distance they had to walk it     seemed so impossible that i was somewhat sceptical of the truth of     what i was told but i heard the same story so often and in so many     different places that i was at last obliged to accept it on my     return i followed up this track and found that it was all true and i     found also that the rubber is collected from the domaine priv√© in     forests from ten to forty miles beyond the boundary of the crown     domain      once the vines had been found the working of the rubber is a small     part of the labour i have made a careful calculation of the distance     the people i met have to walk and i find that the average cannot be     less than 300 miles there and back but walking to the forest and     back does not occupy from twenty to twentyfive days per month they     will cover the 300 miles in ten or twelve days the rest of the time     is used in hunting for the vines and in tapping them when found i     met a party returning with their rubber who had been six nights in the     forest this was the lowest number most of them have to spend ten     some as many as fifteen nights in the forest two days after i left     the domain on my way back i saw some men returning emptyhanded they     had been hunting for over eight days and had found nothing what the     poor wretches would do i cannot imagine if they failed to produce the     usual amount of rubber on the appointed day they would be put in     bloc imprisoned      the workmen of the chef de poste at mbongo described a concoction     which is sometimes administered to capitas when their tale of rubber     is short the white man chops up green tobacco leaves and soaks them     in water red peppers are added and a dose of the liquid is     administered to defaulting capitas this wily official manages to get     thirteen monthly taxes in the year at one village i bought a     contrivance by which the natives reckon when the tax falls due pieces     of wood are strung on a piece of cane one piece is moved up every     day on counting them i found there were only twentyeight i asked     why and was told that originally there were thirty pieces but the     white man had so often sent on the twentyeighth day to say the time     was up that at last they took off two      individual acts of atrocity here have for the most part ceased the     state agents seem to have come to the conclusion that it is a waste of     cartridges to shoot down these people but the whole system is a vast     atrocity involving the people in a state of unimaginable misery one     man said to me slaves are happy compared with us slaves are     protected by their masters they are fed and clothed as for usthe     capitas do with us what they like our wives have to plant the cassava     gardens and fish in the stream to feed us while we spend our days     working for bula matadi no we are not even slaves and he is right     it is not slavery as slavery was generally understood it is not even     the uncivilized africans idea of slavery there never was a slavery     more absolute in its despotism or more fiendish in its tyranny  it will be seen that so far as the people are concerned the problem is largely solved the bitterness of death is past no european intervention can save them in many places they have been utterly destroyed but they were the wards of europe and surely europe if she is not utterly lost to shame will have something to say to their fate     x  some catholic testimony as to the congo   it must be admitted that the roman catholic church as an organized body has not raised her voice as she should in the matter of the congo never was there such a field for a las casas it was the proudest boast of that church that in the dark days of mans history she was the one power which stood with her spiritual terrors between the oppressor and the oppressed this noble tradition has been sadly forgotten in the congo where the missions have themselves as i understand done most excellent work but where the power of the church has never been invoked against the constant barbarities of the state in extenuation it may be stated that the chief catholic establishments are down the river and far from the rubber zones it is important however to collect under a separate heading such testimony as exists for an unworthy attempt has been made to represent the matter as a contest between rival creeds whereas it is really a contest between humanity and civilization on one side and cruel greed upon the other  the organization of the catholic church is more disciplined and admits of less individualism than that of those religious bodies which supplied the valiant champions of right in the congo the simple priests were doubtless as horrified as others within the limit of their knowledge but the means of expression were denied them m colfs himself a catholic said in the belgian chamber our missionaries have less liberty than foreign missionaries they are expected to keep silence there is a gag this gag is placed in the mouth of belgian missionaries  signor santini the catholic and royalist deputy for rome has been one of the leaders in the anticongo movement and has done excellent work in italy from his own sources of information he confirms and amplifies all that the english and americans have asserted speaking in the italian parliament on february 4th 1907 signor santini said      i am proud to have been the first to bring the question of the congo     before this house if at the present day we are spared the shame of     seeing again officers of our army valorous and perfectly stainless     serving under and at the orders of an association of sweaters     slaveholders and barbarians it is legitimate for me to declare that     i have if only modestly at least efficaciously cooperated in this     result  there is no conflict of creeds in such an utterance as that  catholic papers have occasionally spoken out bravely upon the subject  le patriote of brussels royalist and catholic in its issue of february 28th 1907 has an indignant editorial      the rebellion in the abir territory extends the government     itself forces the rubber and delivers it on the antwerp quay to the     brokers of the abir nothing is altered on the congo the same     abominable measures are adopted the same outrages take place the     government is adopting the same measures as in the mongalla flooding     the abir territory with soldiers to utterly smash the people whom     it thinks will then work and the rubber output be increased the     memory of these deeds will remain graven in the memory of men and in     the memory of divine vengeance sooner or later the executioners will     have to render an account to god and to history  there is one order of the catholic church which has always had a most noble record in its treatment of native races these are the jesuits no one who has read the history of paraguay or studied the records of the missions to the red indians of the eighteenth century can forget the picture of unselfish devotion which they exhibit father vermeersch a worthy successor of such predecessors has published a book la question congolaise in which he finds nothing incompatible between his position as a catholic and his exposure of the abuses of the congo  in all points the position of father vermeersch and of the english reformers appears to be identical  on the rightful possession of the land by the natives he writes in terms which might be a paragraph from mr morel      on the congo the land cannot be supposedly vacant presumption is in     favour of occupation of a full occupation by this is meant that it     is not sufficient to recognize to the natives rights of tenure over     the land they actually cultivate or certain rights of     usagewoodcutting hunting fishingon the remainder of the     territory but these rights of usage which are much more important     than with us appear to imply a full animus domini and to signify a     complete appropriation which is carried out amongst us in different     fashion it is not in effect indispensable in natural law that i     should exhaust the utility of an article or of land in order to be     able to claim it as my own it suffices that i should make use of it     in a positive manner but of my own will personally and that i     should have the will to forbid any stranger to use it without my     consent hence effective occupation is joined to intention and all     the constituent elements to a valid title of property exist let us     suppose moreover that some great belgian landowner wishes to convert     portions of his property into sporting landthat land nevertheless     remains in his entire possession amongst the congo natives no doubt     occupation is usually collective but such occupation is as worthy of     respect as no matter what individual appropriation  he continues      to whom does the rubber belong which grows upon the land occupied by     the congo natives to the natives and to no one else without their     consent and just compensation  again      to sum up we recognize it with much regret the states     appropriation of socalled vacant land on the congo confronts us with     an immense expropriation  he makes a bold attack upon king leopolds own preserve      humanity whose cause we plead christian rights whose principles we     endeavour to inculcate compel us to touch briefly upon a curious and     mysterious creation which is peculiar to the congo statethe domaine     de la couronne      what are the revenues of this mysterious civil personality     estimates more or less conjectural in nature elaborated by m     cattier appear to establish the profits from the exploitation of     rubber alone at eight to nine millions of francs per annum m le     comte de smet de naeyer reduces this figure to four or five millions     short of positive data one can only deal in conjectures but we regret     still more that an impenetrable veil hides from sight all that takes     place in the territory of this domaine it is eight or ten times the     size of belgium and throughout this vast extent of territory there is     neither missionary nor magistrate  only one missionary at that date had entered this dark land and his exclamation was the bulgarian atrocities are childs play to what has taken place here  father vermeersch then proceeds to deal with the congo balancesheets his criticism is most destructive he shows at considerable length and with a fine grasp of his subject that there is really no connection at all between the socalled estimate and the actual budget in the course of the states development there is an excess running to millions of pounds which has never been accounted for in this father vermeersch is in agreement with the equally elaborate calculations of professor cattier of brussels  he puts the economical case in a nutshell thus      x district commissioner commits every day dozens of offences     against individual liberty what can be done these violations of the     law are necessitated by a great enterprise which must have workmen in     such cases the intervention of the magistrate would be a ruinous     imprudence calculated to bring trouble into the region      but the law      oh law in the congo is not applicable      but if you offered a decent remuneration would you not get free     labour      that is precisely what the state will not listen to it maintains     that the enterprise must be carried out for nothing  and disposes once again of the forty hours a month fiction      it is impossible for the state to obtain the amount of rubber it     sells annually by labour limited to forty hours a month especially     when it is borne in mind that a number of these hours are absorbed in     other corv√©es of two things one therefore either the surplus is     furnished freely and if so how can coercion be logically argued or     this supplementary labour is forced and if so the law of forty hours     is shown to be merely a fraud  he shows the root causes of the evil      so long as an inflexible will fixes in advance the quantity of rubber     to be obtained so long as instructions are given in this form     increase by five tons your rubber output per month instance given     by father cus and van hencxthoven in their report we cannot await     with confidence a serious improvement which is the desire of all      the governorgeneral dismisses and appoints magistrates at his will     suspends the execution of penalties even sends back if need be     gentlemen of the gown to europe who does not realize the grave     inconvenience of this dependence that is not all no proceedings can     be attempted against a european without the authority of the     governorgeneral  and finally his reasons for writing his book      the contemplation of an immeasurable misery has caused us to publish     this book the gravity of the evil its roots causes had long escaped     us when we knew them we could not retain within ourselves the     compassion with which we were imbued and we resolved to tell the     citizens of a generous country appealing to their religion to their     patriotism to their hearts  surely after such evidence from such a source there must be some heartsearchings among those higher members of the catholic hierarchy including both cardinals and bishops who have done what they could to cripple the efforts of the reformers misinformed through their own want of care in searching for the truth they have stood before the whole world as the defenders of that which will be described by the historian as the greatest crime in history     xi  the evidence up to date   i shall now append some extracts from the reports of several british viceconsuls and consuls sent in during the last few years these bear less upon outrages which have admittedly greatly decreased but mainly upon the general condition of the people which is one of deplorable poverty and miserya slavery without that care which the owner was bound to exercise over the health and strength of the slave i shall give without comment some extracts from the reports of viceconsul mitchell which date from july 1906      most of the primitive bridges over the numerous creeks and marshes     had rotted away and we had some difficulty in crossing on fallen     trees or a few thin sticks this was the case all the way to banalya     and i may here state that this condition of the roads even of the     most frequented is universal in this province the reason is that the     local authorities have neither men means nor time at their disposal     for the making of decent roads the parsimony of the state in this     respect is the more remarkable in the domaine priv√© whence large     amounts are derived and where next to nothing is expended      so long as the policy of the state government is to extract all it     can from the country while using only local materials and spending     the least possible amount on development and improvements no increase     in the general wellbeing can be expected       at all the posts on the north right bank between yambuya and     basoko i found the european agents absent in the interior and at     basoko itself only the doctor was left in charge all the rest of the     staff being away en exp√©dition that is on punitive     expeditions      i stayed at basoko for five days partly at dr grossules request     and partly in the endeavour to learn something of the operations     going on in the interior three canoeloads of prisoners arrived all     heavily loaded with chains but all i could learn was that they were     sent in by lieutenant baron von otter who had been sent to the     promontory lying between the mouth of the aruwimi and the congo to     enforce the labour ordinances      in all the basenji villages through which i have passed on my two     journeys the natives assert that it takes them three weeks every     month to find and make their tale of rubber besides taking it once     every three months to the state post from four to six days distant      this country is taxed to the utmost not one penny of the proceeds of     which is spent on the roads this condition of the most important     highway in the province is nothing less than disgraceful and yet this     is the road of which the authorities are really proud      thus with the exception of a trivial payment for some things the     government carries on the work of the country at no expense beyond the     wages and the european rations of the white agents and these are     excessively few in number it is true there are the force publique     and some travailleurs these are recruited by conscription and     receive pay and rations but it is at the lowest possible rate      coming to the basenji the following particulars of a village in the     forest will show their liabilities this village has fourteen adult     males its neighbour which works with it the chiefs being brothers     has nine each man has to take to the state post a large basket     holding about twentyfive pounds of rubber once every month and a     half to get this rubber though they find it only one days journey     distant takes them thirty days it then takes them five days to carry     it to the state post and three days to return thus they spend     thirtyeight days out of fortyfive in the compulsory service of the     state for the basket of rubber they receive 1 kilog of salt     nominally worth 1 fr the chief receives 1 kilog of salt for the     whole if the rubber is deficient in quality or quantity the man is     liable to be whipped and imprisoned without trial as it is supposed     to be the equivalent of the forty hours monthly labour i fail to see     by what right the man can be held responsible for the quality even if     he wilfully adulterates it with other substances      the people are all disheartened and are unanimously of the opinion     that they were better off under the arabs whose rule was     intermittent and from whom they could run away      i must say that during more than nineteen years experience in     northern and central africa i have never seen such a miserably poor     lot as the basenji in this state      it is perfectly clear that the inspectors however conscientious     hardworking and faithful they may be cannot remedy the excessive     impositions on the natives under the present system      the grant of land and seed to the natives is of absolutely no use     to them till they are left time to use them      to say that the state cannot afford the expense is absurd the congo     is taxed unmercifully and i do not suppose any country has less money     spent upon it the taxpayer gets literally nothing in return for the     life of practical slavery he has to spend in the support of the     government      if trade and navigation were really free and guarded by proper     police german trade through ujiji which already exists to some     extent might be greatly developed as well as that with the british     colonies and zanzibar      the operations of the dutch traders who up to a few months ago had     quite a considerable fleet of steamers on the upper congo and its     affluents and of the french at brazzaville and of the portuguese     would also benefit greatly      all these have practically disappeared from the upper congo      here as elsewhere the natives appeared to me to be so heavily taxed     as to be depressed and to regard themselves as practically enslaved by     the bula matadi the incessant call for rubber food and labour     leaves them no respite nor peace of mind  the following are extracts from viceconsul armstrongs report dated october 1906      as the result of my journey through this portion of the country i am     forced to the conclusion that the condition of the people in the     abir territory is deplorable and although those living in the     vicinity of the mission stations are comparatively speaking safe     from illtreatment by the rubber agents and their armed sentries     those in other parts are subjected to the gravest abuses      there is no free labour the natives being forced to work at a     totally inadequate wage in visiting the various rubberworking towns     one would expect to see some signs of european commodities that had     been given in exchange for the millions of pounds worth of rubber     that has been extracted from them but the native residents possess     actually nothing at all      their conditions of living are deplorable and the filth and     squalor of their villages is only too apparent the people live in a     state of uncertainty as to the advent of police officers and soldiers     who invariably chase them from their abodes and destroy their huts     and for this reason it is impossible for them to better their     condition of living by the construction of suitable dwellings          no change of system to be looked for      no change in the existing system can be looked for until a more     reasonable method of taxation is adopted the present system permits     the rubber agents to extract the largest possible quantity of rubber     from the native at the lowest possible wage and allows the employment     of armed sentries to enforce this deplorable system  in these despatches viceconsul armstrong gives evidence of a plot against the sturdy mr stannard upon the part of the infamous abir company their idea no doubt was to break down his health and embitter his existence by successive lawsuits in may of 1906 the natives of a village called lokongi rose up against his murderous sentries and burned their houses a charge was at once made against mr stannard of having instigated them to this very natural and commendable action natives had been suborned or terrified into giving evidence against him and it might have gone ill with him had it not been for the prompt action of the consul he set off for the village accompanied by mr stannard and the abir director the natives were assembled and asked to speak the truth they said without hesitation that mr stannard had had nothing to do with the matter but that the representatives of the company had threatened to torture them unless they said that he had the abir director held his peace before these revelations and had no explanation to offer consul armstrong then pointed out to the public prosecutor in good straight terms which his official superiors might well imitate that the matter had gone far enough that english patience was almost exhausted and that mr stannard should be baited no longer the case was dropped  i shall pass straight on now to the most recent reports received from the congo to show that there is no difference at all in the general condition so far as it is reported by the impartial men at the spot save that the actual killings and maimings have decreased the great oppression and misery of the people seem to grow rather than abate the following extracts are from consul thesigers report of his experiences in the kasai companys district this company it may be worth remarking has paid the enormous dividend of seven hundred per cent the first paragraph may be commended to the consideration of those british or american travellers who on the strength of a flying visit venture to contradict the experience of those white men who spend their lives in the country      although from the evidence of state officials it has been proved that     individual cases of abuses are not infrequent even at these posts the     chance traveller will certainly see nothing of them and when he     judges of the condition of the country by what he actually sees at     these stations his opinions may be perfectly honest but they are     absolutely worthless it is as though some wellmeaning person who     had heard that a certain fashionable firm was making a fortune by     sweated labour were to venture to deny the facts because a cursory     visit to the west end establishment showed that the salesmen behind     the counter were welldressed and wellnourished ignoring altogether     the festering misery of the sweaters dens in which every article sold     over that counter was made up  after showing that the kasai company in their haste for wealth and perhaps in their foresight as knowing that their occupancy may be brought to an end are cutting down the rubber vines instead of tapping them illegal of course but what does that matter where belgian concessionnaires are in question goes on to show the pressure on the people      the work is compulsory it is also incessant the vines have to be     sought out in the forest cut down and disentangled from the     highgrowing branches divided into lengths and carried home this     operation has to be continually repeated as no man can carry a larger     quantity of the heavy vine lengths than will keep him occupied for two     or three days accidents are frequent especially among the bakuba     who are largebuilt men hunters and agriculturists by nature and     unaccustomed to tree climbing large as the bakuba villages still are     the population is diminishing here there is no sleeping sickness to     account for the decrease there have been no epidemics of late years     exposure overwork and shortage of proper food alone are responsible     for it the bakuba district was formerly one of the richest     foodproducing regions in the country maize and millet being the     staple crops together with manioc and other plants so much so was     this the case that the mission at luebo used to send there to buy     maize under the present r√©gime the villagers are not allowed to     waste in cultivating hunting or fishingtime which should be     occupied in making rubber      in a few villages they were cultivating by stealth small patches in     the forest where they were supposed to be out cutting the rubber     vines but everywhere else it was the same story the capitas would     not allow them time to clear new ground for cultivation or permit     them to hunt or fish if they tried to do so their nets and implements     were destroyed the majority of the capitas when questioned     acknowledged quite frankly that they had orders to that effect these     villages are living on the produce of the old manioc fields and are     buying food from the bakette under these circumstances it is not     surprising that the population is diminishing as one woman expressed     it the men go out hungry into the forest when they come back they     get sick and die the village of ibunge where formerly the largest     market of the district was held weekly now consists of a collection     of hovels eight of which are habitable and the market is all but     dead  so the capitas are at their old work the same as ever the congo idea of reforming them has always been to change their nameso by calling a burglar a policeman a great reformation is effected  read however the following passage which shows that if the capita is the same so also is the agent the white race is certainly superior for when the savage sentrys heart relented the white man was able to scourge him back to his inhuman task      once i had got outside the zone surrounding ibanj where the villages     are not taxed in rubber i found the capitas with very few     exceptions were all armed with capguns i met them frequently     escorting the rubber caravans to the company post or going from     village to village collecting the rubber from the centres under their     charge and distributing the trade goods for the coming month i     noticed that they invariably carried their guns and in fact i have     seldom seen a capita stir outside his own home without his gun these     are the men who are appointed by the kasai company agents to enforce     the rubber tax chosen always from a different race they have no     sympathy with the natives placed under them and having the authority     of the agent behind them they can do as they please so long as they     insure the rubber being brought at the proper times and in sufficient     quantities in the villages they are absolute masters and the     villagers have to supply them gratis with a house food palm wine     and a woman they exercise freely the right of beating or imprisoning     the villagers for any imaginary offences or for neglecting their work     in any way and even go as far as imposing fines in cowries on their     own account and confiscating for their own use the cowries paid over     by the plaintiff or defendants family in the case of trial by poison     which in spite of statements to the contrary recently made in the     belgian chamber are of frequent occurrence in this country the     native cannot complain or obtain satisfaction in any way as the     capita acts in the name of the company and the companys agent is     always threatening them in the name of bulamatadi if the     authorities wish to act in the matter they might profitably make     inquiry into the doings of the capitas at bungueh bolong and into     those of the zappo zap capita who appears to exercise the chief     control over the villages near ibunge though he does not live in the     latter town these appear to me to be among the worst where most are     bad the capitas however are scarcely to be blamed as if they do     not extort enough rubber they are liable in their turn to suffer at     the hands of the agent witness a case at sangela when it was     reported that the capita had some time back been chicotted in the     village itself by the agent for not bringing in rubber sufficient     endless cases could be quoted but these will probably be sufficient     to show the methods pursued under the auspices of the kasai company     yet in a letter dated the eighth of march 1908 we find dr dreypondt     writing reproachfully          you know we have no armed sentries but only tradesmen going         with goods of every kind and unarmed through the villages for         the purchasing of rubber we use only one trading         principleloffre et la demande  the laws at all points are completely ignored and many of the agents not only punish the natives in these ways themselves but allow their capitas the same privileges it is only by these means that the natives can be kept at their incessant work  suicide is not natural with african as it is with some oriental races but it has come in with the other blessings of king leopold      at ibanj for instance only a days march from a state post two     bakette from the village of bakatomba were not long ago imprisoned     for shortage of rubber and were daily taken out under the charge of     an armed native to work in the fields with ropes round their necks     one of them tired of captivity pretended one day that he saw some     animal in a tree and obtained leave from the guard to try and get it     he climbed the tree tied the rope which was round his neck to a     branch and hung himself he was cut down and after a considerable     time was resuscitated thanks to the medical experience of one of the     missionaries i was able to question the man myself at his village     and the story was also confirmed by the capita  the american flag presents no refuge for the persecuted      about the same time this same man had the effrontery to take some     seven armed natives on to the station of the american mission during     the absence of the missionaries and demand from the native who was     left in charge that he should hand over to him a native not in his     own employ who had run away in consequence of some dispute and who     he declared was hiding at the mission the overseer a sierra leone     man very rightly declared his inability to do so and said he must     await the return of the missionaries an altercation followed and the     agent struck him twice in the face the man being a british subject i     told him if he chose to prosecute i would support him or else i would     insist on the agent paying him an indemnity in cloth as a prosecution     would have entailed his going to lusambo a fifteen days journey     with every prospect of being kept there some four to six months with     all the witnesses while awaiting the hearing of his case he chose the     latter method the cloth was paid  he continues      these cases can all be substantiated and are typical of a certain     class of agent which is unfortunately although not general far too     common numerous complaints were also made to me in different villages     against an agent not only that he beat and imprisoned the natives for     shortage of rubber but also that he obliged them to supply him with     alcohol distilled from palm wine and was in the habit of taking any     of the village women that struck his fancy at the weekly market held     on or near his own post the company i believe promised the american     mission last may that this man should be removed but when i passed     through he was still there placed in the power of men like these the     natives dare not complain to the authorities and are entirely     helpless  nominally the company makes no punitive expeditions as a matter of fact they have engaged lukenga a warlike chief of the neighbourhood to do it for them nominally the capitas are not supplied with guns as a matter of fact they all carry guns which are declared to be their personal property at every corner one meets hypocrisy and evasion of law  speaking of the bakuba the consul says      although not wanting in physical courage or strength they are rather     an agricultural than a warlike race and their villages were formerly     noted for their wellbuilt and artistically decorated houses and their     wellcultivated fields      it is however their misfortune to live in a forest country rich in     rubber vines and they have consequently come under the curse of the     concessionary company in the shape of the kasai trust as a result     their native industries are dying out their houses and fields are     neglected and the population is not only decreasing but also sinking     to the deadlevel of the less advanced and less capable races      there is no doubt that the bakuba are the most oppressed race today     in the kasai harassed by their own king in the interest of the rubber     company driven by the agents and their capitas disarmed and deprived     even of the most ordinary rights they will if nothing is done to     help them sink to the level of the vicious and degraded bakette      one asks oneself in vain what benefits these people have gained from     the boasted civilization of the free state one looks in vain for any     attempt to benefit them or to recompense them in any way for the     enormous wealth which they are helping to pour into the treasury of     the state their native industries are being destroyed their freedom     has been taken from them and their numbers are decreasing      the only efforts made to civilize them have been made by the     missionaries who are hampered at every turn  consul thesiger winds up with the remark that as the company has behaved illegally at every turn it has forfeited all claims to consideration and that there is no hope for the country so long as it exists straight wordsbut how much more forcibly do they apply to that congo state of which these particular companies are merely an outcome until it is swept from the map there is no hope for the country you cannot avoid the rank products while the putridity remains  the next document bearing upon the question is from the rev h m whiteside from the notorious abir district i give it in full that the reader may judge for himself how far the direct belgian rule has altered the situation      i should like to bring to your notice a few facts regarding the     condition of this abir district      after this extensive journey made through the district recently and     particularly the bompona neighbourhood i found the people working     rubber in all the towns visited with the exception of those taxed in     provisions      it is difficult to know which tax rubber or provisions is     hardest the rubber workers implored us to free them from rubber and     at one village upon our departure they followed us a considerable     distance and it was difficult to get away from them the amount of     rubber collected is small compared with what was formerly demanded     but i have no doubt it requires onethird of the time of the people to     collect it many of the people of the villages behind bompona were     away collecting rubber we met many of the ionji people in the forest     either actually engaged in their work or hunting for a district where     the vines might have escaped other collectors we also met other     villagers in the bush in quest of rubber almost all the village     migrates to the forestmen many women and childrenwhen rubber is     required      in the light of these facts how worthless are the assertions that     rubber tax has been stopped in the abir territory      with regard to the provision tax it was difficult to get any data     but it is easy for one to see the oppressed condition of the people     when one comes into contact with them between the provision tax     porterage and paddlers i believe that the people of bompona have got     very little time to themselves there is one thing that one cannot     help seeing viz the mean miserable appearance of the people     residing around the state post of bompona the houses or huts are in     keeping with the owners of them a very small bale of cloth could take     the place of all i saw worn in all the district i never saw a single     brass rod nor any domestic animals except a few miserable chickens     the extreme poverty of the people is most remarkable there is no     doubt as to their desire to possess european goods but they have     nothing with which to buy except rubber and ivory which is claimed by     the state      it may be thought that i am painting their condition in too dark     colours but i feel it requires strong words to give a fair idea of     the utter hopelessness and abject appearance of the people of bompona     of the people of the villages behind the state post some twentyfive     miles away and in a lesser degree of the rubber workers opposite     bompona          h m whiteside      ikau         june 15th 1909  finally there is the following report from the extreme other end of the country it is dated june 1st 1909 the name of the sender though not published was sent to the foreign office he is an american citizen      i am sorry to say there is need for agitation for the reform of the     belgian kwango territory along this frontier robbing and murder are     still being carried on under the rule of the belgian official from     popocabacca last month he came with an armed force to the district of     mpangala nlele two days west of here to decorate with the congo     medal a new chief in the stead of our old friend nlekani nlekani left     a number of sons but none of them were willing to take the     responsibility of the medal chieftainship they therefore placed     their villages under the authority of a powerful chief living to the     north of them      the official of the congo government had been insisting for a year     that a younger son of the old chief should consent to be the medal     chief this young man named kingeleza was a fine bright fellow but     thinking that as a younger son he would lack the necessary authority     over the people and would get into trouble with the government if he     could not satisfy its requirements he declined the belgian official     was however so insistent that kingeleza had finally agreed in order     to avoid a clash with the government      on his way to make the investiture the belgian official robbed     some villages and killed two men kingelezas people who had gathered     together to witness the investiture hearing of the treatment meted     out to the other villages took fright and fled from their own     villages which the belgians upon arriving found deserted whereupon     the soldiers proceeded to ferret the fugitives out of the woods where     they were hiding twenty were seized among whom was one of     kingelezas sisters a young and attractive looking girl four of the     villagers were subsequently released and the balance marched off with     other spoils to popocabacca the evangelist attached to the american     mission who was absent in the lower congo had his house broken open     and a tent and school materials carried off      as for kingeleza some of the belgian soldiers met him in the path     and shot him they did not know that he was kingeleza and kingeleza     is still being sought for by the belgian official      this same chief of brigands as i prefer to call him has just been     on another raid for which he even entered portuguese territory within     a few hours of where i am writing wantonly destroying all that he     could not carry off the people had happily all escaped before he     arrived the portuguese are reporting this outrage to the     governorgeneral at loanda     xii  the political situation   i have not in this statement touched upon the financial side of the congo state a huge scandal lies thereso huge that the limits of it have not yet been defined i will not go into that morass if belgians wish to be hoodwinked in the matter and to have their good name compromised in finance as well as in morality it is they who in the end will suffer one may merely indicate the main points that during the independent life of the congo state all accounts have been kept secret that no budgets of the last year but only estimates of the coming one have ever been published that the state has made huge gains in spite of which it has borrowed money and that the great sums resulting have been laid out in speculations in china and elsewhere that sums amounting in the aggregate to at least ¬£7000000 of money have been traced to the king and that this money has been spent partly in buildings in belgium partly in land in the same country partly in building on the riviera partly in the corruption of public men and of the european and american press our own being not entirely untarnished i fear and finally in the expenses of such a private life as has made king leopolds name notorious throughout europe of the guilty companies the poorest seem to pay fifty and the richest seven hundred per cent per annum there i will leave this unsavoury side of the matter it is to humanity that i appeal and that is concerned with higher things  before ending my task however i would give a short account of the evolution of the political situation as it affected first great britain and the congo state secondly great britain and belgium in each case great britain was indeed the spokesman of the civilized world  so far as one can trace no strong protest was raised by the british government at the time when the congo state took the fatal step the direct cause of everything which has followed of leaving the honest path trodden up to that time by all european colonies and seizing the land of the country as their own only in 1896 do we find protests against the illusage of british coloured subjects ending in a statement in parliament from mr chamberlain that no further recruiting would be allowed for the first time we had shown ourselves in sharp disagreement with the policy of the congo state in april 1897 a debate was raised on congo affairs by sir charles dilke without any definite result  our own troubles in south africa troubles which called forth in belgium a burst of indignation against wholly imaginary british outrages during the war left us little time to fulfil our treaty obligations toward the natives on the congo in 1903 the matter forced itself to the front again and a considerable debate took place in the house of commons which ended by passing a resolution with almost complete unanimity to the following effect      that the government of the congo free state having at its     inception guaranteed to the powers that its native subjects should be     governed with humanity and that no trading monopoly or privilege     should be permitted within its dominions this house requests his     majestys government to confer with the other powers signatories of     the berlin general act by virtue of which the congo free state     exists in order that measures may be adopted to abate the evils     prevalent in that state  in july of the same year there occurred the famous three days debate in the belgian house which was really inaugurated by the british resolution in this debate the two brave reformers vandervelde and lorand though crushed by the voting power of their opponents bore off all the honours of war m de favereau the minister of foreign affairs alternately explained that there was no connection at all between belgium and the congo state and that it was a breach of belgian patriotism to attack the latter the policy of the congo state was upheld and defended by the belgian government in a way which must forever identify them with all the crimes which i have recounted no member of the congo administration could ever have expressed the intimate spirit of congo administration so concisely as m de smet de naeyer when he said speaking of the natives they are not entitled to anything what is given them is a pure gratuity was there ever in the world such an utterance as that from a responsible statesman in 1885 a state is formed for the moral and material improvement of the native races in 1903 the native is not entitled to anything the two phrases mark the beginning and the end of king leopolds journey  in 1904 the british government showed its continued uneasiness and disgust at the state of affairs on the congo by publishing the truly awful report of consul casement this document circulated officially all over the globe must have opened the eyes of the nations if any were still shut to the true object and development of king leopolds enterprise it was hoped that this action upon the part of great britain would be the first step toward intervention and indeed lord lansdowne made it clear in so many words that our hand was outstretched and that if any other nation chose to grasp it we would proceed together to the task of compulsory reform it is not to the credit of the civilized nations that not one was ready to answer the appeal if finally we are forced to move alone they cannot say that we did not ask and desire their cooperation  from this date remonstrances were frequent from the british government though they inadequately represented the anger and impatience of those british subjects who were aware of the true state of affairs the british government refrained from going to extremes because it was understood that there would shortly be a belgian annexation and it was hoped that this would mark the beginning of better things without the necessity for our intervention delay followed delay and nothing was done a liberal government was as earnest upon the matter as its unionist predecessor but still the diplomatic etiquette delayed them from coming to a definite conclusion note followed note while a great population was sinking into slavery and despair in august 1906 sir edward grey declared that we could not wait forever and yet we see that he is waiting still in 1908 the long lookedfor annexation came at last and the congo state exchanged the blue flag with the golden star for the tricolour of belgium immediate and radical reforms were promised but the matter ended as all previous promises have done in 1909 m renkin the belgian colonial minister went out to inspect the congo state and had the frankness before going to say that nothing would be changed there this assurance he repeated at boma with a flourish about the genial monarch who presided over their destinies by the time this pamphlet is printed m renkin will be back no doubt with the usual talk of minor reforms which will take another year to produce and will be utterly futile when reduced to practice but the world has seen this game too often surely it will not be made a fool of again there is some limit to european patience  meanwhile in this very month of august 1909 a full year after the annexation by belgium an annexation be it mentioned which will not be officially recognized by great britain until she is satisfied in the matter of reforms prince albert the heir to the throne has returned from the congo he says      the congo is a marvellous country which offers unlimited resources     to men of enterprise in my opinion our colony will be an important     factor in the welfare of our country whatever sacrifices we will have     to make for its development what we must do is to work for the moral     regeneration of the natives ameliorate their material situation     suppress the scourge of sleeping sickness and build new railways  moral regeneration of the natives moral regeneration of his own family and of his own countrythat is what the situation demands     xiii  some congolese apologies   it only remains to examine some of the congolese attempts to answer the unanswerable it is but fair to hear the other side and i will set down such points as they advance as clearly as i can  1that the congo state is independent and that it is no one elses business what occurs within its borders  i have i trust clearly shown that by the berlin treaty of 1885 the state was formed on certain conditions and that these conditions as affecting both trade and the natives have not been fulfilled therefore we have the right to interfere apart from the treaty this right might be claimed on the general grounds of humanity as has been done more than once with turkey  2that the french congo is as bad and that we do not interfere  the french colonial system has usually been excellent and there is therefore every reason to believe that this one result of evil example will soon be amended there at least we have no treaty obligation to interfere  3that the english agitation is due to jealousy of belgian success  we do not look upon it as success but the most stupendous failure in history what is there to be jealous of is it the making of money but we could do the same at once in any tropical colony if we stooped to the same methods  4that it is a plot of the liverpool merchants  this legend had its origin in the fact that mr morel the leader and hero of the cause was in business in liverpool and was afterward elected to be a member of the liverpool chamber of commerce there is indeed a connection between liverpool and the movement because it was while engaged in the shipping trade there that mr morel was brought into connection with the persons and the facts which moved him to generous indignation and started him upon the long struggle which he has so splendidly and unselfishly maintained as a matter of fact all business men in england have very good reason to take action against a system which has kept their commerce out of a country which was declared to be open to international trade but of all towns liverpool has the least reason to complain as it is the centre of that shipping line which alas that any english line should do so conveys the congo rubber from boma to antwerp  5that it is a protestant scheme in order to gain an advantage over the catholic missions  in all british colonies catholic missions may be founded and developed without any hindrance if the congo were british tomorrow no catholic church or school would be disturbed what advantage then would the protestants gain by any change these charges are as a matter of fact borne out by catholics as well as by protestants father vermeersch is as fervid as any english or american pastor  6that travellers who have passed through the country and others who reside in the country have seen no trace of outrages  such a defence reminds one of the ancient pleasantry of the man who being accused on the word of three men who were present and saw him do the crime declared that the balance of evidence was in his favour since he was prepared to produce ten men who were not present and did not see it of the white people who live in the country the great majority are in the lower congo which is not affected by the murderous rubber traffic their evidence is beside the question when a traveller passes up the main river his advent is known and all is ready for him captain boyd alexander passed as i understand along the frontier where naturally one would expect the best conditions since a discontented tribe has only to cross the line to show the fallacy of such reasoning i would instance the case of the reverend john howell who for many years travelled on one of the mission boats upon the main river and during that time never saw an outrage no doubt he had formed the opinion that his brethren had been exaggerating then one day he heard an outburst of firing and turned his little steamer to the spot this is what he saw they were horrified to find the native soldiers of the government under the eyes of their white officers engaged in mutilating the dead bodies of the natives who had just been killed three native bodies were lying near the rivers edge and human limbs were lying within a few yards from the steamer a state soldier was seen drawing away the legs and other portions of a human body another soldier was seen standing by a large basket in which were the viscera of a human body the missionaries were promptly ordered off the beach by the two officers presiding over this human shambles and this was on the main river twenty years after the european occupation  7that land has been claimed by government in uganda and other british colonies  where land has been so claimed it has been worked by free labour for the benefit of the african community itself and not for the purpose of sending the proceeds to europe this is a vital distinction  8that odious incidents occur in all colonies  it is true that no colonial system is always free from such reproach  but the object of the normal european system is to discourage and to punish such abuses especially if they occur in high places i have already given the instance of eyre governor of jamaica who was tried for his life in england because he had executed a halfcaste at a time when there was actual revolt among the black population of which he was the leader germany also has not hesitated to bring to the bar of justice any of her officers who have lowered her prestige by their conduct in the tropics but in the congo after twenty years of unexampled horror and brutality not one single officer above the rank of a simple clerk has ever been condemned or even so far as i can learn tried for conduct which had they been british would assuredly have earned them the gallows what chance would lothaire or le jeune have before a middlesex jury there lies the difference between the systems  9that the british charges did not begin until the congo became a flourishing state  since the congos wealth sprang from this barbarous system it is natural that they both attracted attention at the same time rising wealth meant a more rigidly enforced system  10that the congo state deserves great credit for having prohibited the sale of alcohol to the natives  it is true that the sale of alcohol to natives should be forbidden in all parts of africa it is caused by the competition of trade if a chief desires gin for his ivory it is clear that the nation which supplies that gin will get the trade and that which refuses will lose it this by way of explanation not of apology but as there is no trade competition in the congo they have no reason to introduce alcohol which would simply detract front the quality and value of their slave population when compared with the absolute immorality of other congo proceedings it is clear that the prohibition of alcohol springs from no high motive but is purely dictated by selfinterest  11that the depopulation is due to sleeping sickness  sleeping sickness is one of the contributory causes but all the evidence in this book will tend to show that the great wastage of the people has occurred where the congo rule has pressed heavily upon them  so i bring my task to an end  i look at my statement of the facts and i wince at its many faults of omission how many specific examples have i left out how many deductions have i missed how many fresh sides to the matter have i neglected it is hurried and broken as a mans speech may be hurried and broken when he is driven to it by a sense of burning injustice and intolerable wrong but it is trueand i defy any man to read it without rising with the conviction of its truth consider the cloud of witnesses consider the minute and specific detail in the evidence consider the undenied system which must prima facie produce such results consider the admissions of the belgian commission not one shadow of doubt can remain in the most sceptical mind that the accusations of the reformers have been absolutely proved it is not a thing of the past it is going on at this hour the belgian annexation has made no difference the machinery and the men who work it are the same there are fewer outrages it is true the spirit of the unhappy people is so broken that it is a waste of labour to destroy them further that their conditions have not improved is shown by the unanswerable fact that the export of rubber has not decreased that export is the exact measure of the terrorism employed many of the old districts are worked out but the new ones must be exploited with greater energy to atone the problem i say remains as ever but surely the answer is at hand surely there is some limit to the silent complicity of the civilized world     xiv  solutions   but what can be done what course should we pursue let us consider a few possible solutions and the reasons which bear upon them  there is one cardinal fact which dominates everything it is that any change must be for the better under their old savage r√©gime as stanley found them the tribes were infinitely happier richer and more advanced than they are today if they should return undisturbed to such an existence the situation would at least be free from all that lowering of the ideals of the white race which is implied by a belgian occupation we may start with a good heart therefore since whatever happens must be for the better  can a solution be found through belgium  no it is impossible and that should be recognized from the outset the belgians have been given their chance they have had nearly twentyfive years of undisturbed possession and they have made it a hell upon earth they cannot disassociate themselves from this work or pretend that it was done by a separate state it was done by a belgian king belgian soldiers belgian financiers belgian lawyers belgian capital and was endorsed and defended by belgian governments it is out of the question that belgium should remain on the congo  nor in face of reform would belgium wish to be there she could not carry the burden when the country is restored to its inhabitants together with their freedom it will be in the same position as those german and english colonies which entail heavy annual expenditure from the mother country it is a proof of the honesty of german colonial policy and the fitness of germany to be a great landowning power that nearly all her tropical colonies like our own show or have shown a deficit it is easy to show a profit if a land be exploited as spain exploited central america or belgium the congo it would always be more profitable to sack a business than to run it now if the forced revenue of the congo state disappeared it would at a moderate estimate take a minimum of a million a year for twenty years to bring the demoralized state back to the normal condition of a tropical colony would belgium pay this ¬£20000000 it is certain that she would not reform then is an absolute impossibility so long as belgium holds the congo  what then should be done  that is for the statesmen of europe and america to determine america hastened before all the rest of the world in 1884 to recognize this new state and her recognition caused the rest of the world to follow suit but since then she has done nothing to control what she created american citizens have suffered as much as british and american commerce has met with the same impediments in spite of the shrewd attempt of king leopold to bribe american complicity by allowing some of her citizens to form a concessionnaire company and so to share in the unholy spoils but america has a high moral sense and when the true facts are known to her and when she learns to distinguish the outcome of king leopolds dollars from the work of honest publicists she will surely be ready to move in the matter it was in crushing pirates that america made her first international appearance upon the worlds stage may it be a precedent  but to bring the matter to a head the british government should surely act with no further delay the obvious course would appear to be that having prepared the ground by sounding each of the great powers they should then lay before each of them the whole evidence and ask that a european congress should meet to discuss the situation such a congress would surely result in the partition of the congo landsa partition in which great britain whose responsibilities of empire are already too vast might well play the most selfdenying part if france having given a pledge to rule her congo lands in the same excellent fashion as she does the rest of her african empire were to extend her borders to the northern bank of the river along its whole course until it turns to the south then an orderly government might be hoped for in those regions germany too might well extend her east african protectorate so as to bring it up to the eastern bank of the congo where it runs to the south with these large sections removed it would not be difficult to arrange some great native reservation in the centre which should be under some international guarantee which would be less of a fiasco than the last one the lower congo and the boma railway would no doubt present difficulties but surely they are not above solution and always one may repeat that any change is a change for good  such a partition would form one solution another less permanent and stableand to that extent as it seems to me less goodis that which is advanced by mr morel and others it is an international control of the river some provision for which is as i understand already in existence the trouble is that what belongs to all nations belongs to no nation and that when the native risings and general turmoil come which will surely succeed the withdrawal of belgian pressure something stronger and richer than an international riverine board will be needed to meet them i am convinced that partition affords the only chance of solid lasting amendment  let us suppose however that the powers refuse to convene a meeting and that we are deserted even by america then it is our duty as it has often been in the worlds history to grapple singlehanded with that which should be a common task we have often done so before and if we are worthy of our fathers we will do it again a warning and a date must be fixed and then we must decide our course of action  and what shall that action be war with belgium on them must rest the responsibility for that our measures must be directed against the congo state which has not yet been recognized by us as being a possession of belgium if belgium take up the quarrel then so be it there are many ways in which we can bring the congo state to her knees a blockade of the congo is one but it has the objection of the international complications which might ensue an easier way would be to proclaim this guilty land as an outlaw state such a proclamation means that to no british subject does the law of that land apply if british traders enter it they shall be stopped at the peril of those who stop them if british subjects are indicted they shall be tried in our own consular courts if complications ensue as is likely then boma shall be occupied this would surely lead to that european conference which we are supposing to have been denied us  yet another solution let a large trading caravan start into the congoland from northern rhodesia we claim that we have a right to free trade by the berlin treaty we will enforce our claim to do so would cut at the very roots of the congo system if the caravan be opposed then again boma and a conference  many solutions could be devised but there is one which will come of itself and may bring about a very sudden end of the congo power northern rhodesia is slowly filling up the railhead is advancing the nomad south african population half boers half english adventurers and lion hunters are trekking toward the katanga border they are not men who will take less than those rights of free entry and free commerce which are in fact guaranteed them only last year twelve boer wagons appeared upon the katanga border and were contrary to all international law warned off they are the pioneers of many more no one has the right and no one save their own government has the force to keep them out let the powers of europe hasten to regulate the situation or some day they may find themselves in the presence of a fait accompli better an orderly partition conducted from paris or berlin than the intrusion of some piet joubert with his swarthy followers who will see no favour in taking that which they believe to be their right  but whichever solution is adopted the conscience of europe should not be content merely with the safeguarding of the future surely there should be some punishment for those who by their injustice and violence have dragged christianity and civilization in the dirt surely also there should be compulsory compensation out of the swollen moneybags of the three hundred per cent concessionnaires for the widows and the orphans the maimed and the incapacitated justice cannot be satisfied with less an international commission with punitive powers may be exceptional but the whole circumstances are exceptional and europe must rise to them the fear is however that it is the wretched agents on the spot the poor driven bonushunters who will be offered up as victims whereas the real criminals will escape the curse of blood and the scorn of every honest man rest upon them already would that they were within the reach of human justice also they have been guilty of the sack of a country the spoliation of a nation the greatest crime in all history the greater for having been carried out under an odious pretence of philanthropy surely somehow somewhere they will have their reward     appendix   note ithe chicotte  chicotting is alluded to in congo annals as a minor punishment freely inflicted upon women and children it is really a terrible torture which leaves the victim flayed and fainting there is a science in the administration of it f√©licien challaye tells of a belgian officer who became communicative upon the subject one can hardly believe said the brute how difficult it is to administer the chicotte properly one should spread out the blows so that each shall give a fresh pang then we have a law which forbids us to give more than twentyfive blows in one day and to stop when the blood flows one should therefore give twentyfour of the blows vigorously but without risking to stop then at the twentyfifth with a dexterous twist one should make the blood spurt le congo fran√ßais challaye the twentyfive lash law like all other laws has no relation at all to the proceedings in the upper congo  monsieur stanislas lefranc judge on the congo and one of the few men whose humanity seems to have survived such an experience says  every day at six in the morning and two in the afternoon at each state post can be seen today as five or even ten years ago the savoury sight which i am going to try to depict and to which new recruits are specially invited  the chief of the post points out the victims they leave the ranks and come forward for at the least attempt at flight they would be brutally seized by the soldiers struck in the face by the representative of the free state and the punishment would be doubled trembling and terrified they stretch themselves face down before the captain and his colleagues two of their companions sometimes four seize them by their hands and feet and take off their waistcloth then armed with a lash of hippopotamus hide similar to what we call a cowhide but more flexible a black soldier who is only required to be energetic and pitiless flogs the victims  every time the executioner draws away the chicotte a reddish streak appears upon the skin of the wretched victims who although strongly built gasp in terrible contortions  often the blood trickles more rarely fainting ensues regularly and without cessation the chicotte winds round the flesh of these martyrs of the most relentless and loathsome tyrants who have ever disgraced humanity at the first blows the unhappy victims utter terrible shrieks which soon die down to low groans in addition when the officer who orders the punishment is in a bad humour he kicks those who cry or struggle some i have witnessed the thing by a refinement of brutality require that at the moment when they get up gasping the slaves should graciously give the military salute this formality not required by the regulations is really a part of the design of the vile institution which aims at debasing the black in order to be able to use him and abuse him without fearle r√©gime congolais li√©ge lefranc
