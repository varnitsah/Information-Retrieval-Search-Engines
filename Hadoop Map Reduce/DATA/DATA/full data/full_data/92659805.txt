their names were                flopsy           mopsy      cottontail and peter  they lived with their mother in a sandbank underneath the root of a very big fir tree  now my dears said old mrs rabbit one morning you may go into the fields or down the lane but dont go into mr mcgregors garden your father had an accident there he was put in a pie by mrs mcgregor  now run along and dont get into mischief i am going out  then old mrs rabbit took a basket and her umbrella to the bakers she bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns  flopsy mopsy and cottontail who were good little bunnies went down the lane to gather blackberries  but peter who was very naughty ran straight away to mr mcgregors garden and squeezed under the gate  first he ate some lettuces and some french beans and then he ate some radishes  and then feeling rather sick he went to look for some parsley  but round the end of a cucumber frame whom should he meet but mr mcgregor  mr mcgregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages but he jumped up and ran after peter waving a rake and calling out stop thief  peter was most dreadfully frightened he rushed all over the garden for he had forgotten the way back to the gate  he lost one of his shoes among the cabbages and the other shoe amongst the potatoes  after losing them he ran on four legs and went faster so that i think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket it was a blue jacket with brass buttons quite new  peter gave himself up for lost and shed big tears but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows who flew to him in great excitement and implored him to exert himself  mr mcgregor came up with a sieve which he intended to pop upon the top of peter but peter wriggled out just in time leaving his jacket behind him  and rushed into the toolshed and jumped into a can it would have been a beautiful thing to hide in if it had not had so much water in it  mr mcgregor was quite sure that peter was somewhere in the toolshed perhaps hidden underneath a flowerpot he began to turn them over carefully looking under each  presently peter sneezed kertyschoo mr mcgregor was after him in no time  and tried to put his foot upon peter who jumped out of a window upsetting three plants the window was too small for mr mcgregor and he was tired of running after peter he went back to his work  peter sat down to rest he was out of breath and trembling with fright and he had not the least idea which way to go also he was very damp with sitting in that can  after a time he began to wander about going lippity lippitynot very fast and looking all around  he found a door in a wall but it was locked and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath  an old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood peter asked her the way to the gate but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer she only shook her head at him peter began to cry  then he tried to find his way straight across the garden but he became more and more puzzled presently he came to a pond where mr mcgregor filled his watercans a white cat was staring at some goldfish she sat very very still but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her he had heard about cats from his cousin little benjamin bunny  he went back towards the toolshed but suddenly quite close to him he heard the noise of a hoescrrritch scratch scratch scritch peter  scuttered underneath the bushes but presently as nothing happened he came out and climbed upon a wheelbarrow and peeped over the first thing he saw was mr mcgregor hoeing onions his back was turned towards peter and beyond him was the gate  peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow and started running as fast as he could go along a straight walk behind some blackcurrant bushes  mr mcgregor caught sight of him at the corner but peter did not care he slipped underneath the gate and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden  mr mcgregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scarecrow to frighten the blackbirds  peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big firtree  he was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbithole and shut his eyes his mother was busy cooking she wondered what he had done with his clothes it was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that peter had lost in a fortnight  i am sorry to say that peter was not very well during the evening  his mother put him to bed and made some camomile tea and she gave a dose of it to peter  one tablespoonful to be taken at bedtime  but flopsy mopsy and cottontail had bread and milk and blackberries for supper  the end     the tale of benjamin bunny  for the children of sawrey from old mr bunny   one morning a little rabbit sat on a bank  he pricked his ears and listened to the trittrot trittrot of a pony  a gig was coming along the road it was driven by mr mcgregor and beside him sat mrs mcgregor in her best bonnet  as soon as they had passed little benjamin bunny slid down into the road and set offwith a hop skip and a jumpto call upon his relations who lived in the wood at the back of mr mcgregors garden  that wood was full of rabbit holes and in the neatest sandiest hole of all cousinsflopsy mopsy cottontail and peter  old mrs rabbit was a widow she earned her living by knitting rabbitwool mittens and muffetees i once bought a pair at a bazaar she also sold herbs and rosemary tea and rabbittobacco which is what we call lavender  little benjamin did not very much want to see his aunt  he came round the back of the firtree and nearly tumbled upon the top of his cousin peter  peter was sitting by himself he looked poorly and was dressed in a red cotton pockethandkerchief  petersaid little benjamin in a whisperwho has got your clothes  peter repliedthe scarecrow in mr mcgregors garden and described how he had been chased about the garden and had dropped his shoes and coat  little benjamin sat down beside his cousin and assured him that mr mcgregor had gone out in a gig and mrs mcgregor also and certainly for the day because she was wearing her best bonnet  peter said he hoped that it would rain  at this point old mrs rabbits voice was heard inside the rabbit hole calling cottontail cottontail fetch some more camomile  peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk  they went away hand in hand and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood from here they looked down into mr mcgregors garden peters coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow topped with an old tamo shanter of mr mcgregors  little benjamin said it spoils peoples clothes to squeeze under a gate the proper way to get in is to climb down a pear tree  peter fell down head first but it was of no consequence as the bed below was newly raked and quite soft  it had been sown with lettuces  they left a great many odd little footmarks all over the bed especially little benjamin who was wearing clogs  little benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back peters clothes in order that they might be able to use the pocket handkerchief  they took them off the scarecrow there had been rain during the night there was water in the shoes and the coat was somewhat shrunk  benjamin tried on the tam oshanter but it was too big for him  then he suggested that they should fill the pocket handkerchief with onions as a little present for his aunt  peter did not seem to be enjoying himself he kept hearing noises  benjamin on the contrary was perfectly at home and ate a lettuce leaf he said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father to get lettuces for their sunday dinner  the name of little benjamins papa was old mr benjamin bunny  the lettuces certainly were very fine  peter did not eat anything he said he should like to go home presently he dropped half the onions  little benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the peartree with a load of vegetables he led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden they went along a little walk on planks under a sunny red brick wall  the mice sat on their door steps cracking cherrystones they winked at peter rabbit and little benjamin bunny  presently peter let the pockethandkerchief go again  they got amongst flower pots and frames and tubs peter heard noises worse than ever his eyes were as big as lollypops  he was a step or two in front of his cousin when he suddenly stopped  this is what those little rabbits saw round that corner  little benjamin took one look and then in half a minute less than no time he hid himself and peter and the onions underneath a large basket     the cat got up and stretched herself and came and sniffed at the basket  perhaps she liked the smell of onions  anyway she sat down upon the top of the basket  she sat there for five hours                i cannot draw you a picture of peter and benjamin underneath the basket because it was quite dark and because the smell of onions was fearful it made peter rabbit and little benjamin cry  the sun got round behind the wood and it was quite late in the afternoon but still the cat sat upon the basket  at length there was a pitter patter pitterpatter and some bits of mortar fell from the wall above  the cat looked up and saw old mr benjamin bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace  he was smoking a pipe of rabbittobacco and had a little switch in his hand  he was looking for his son  old mr bunny had no opinion whatever of cats  he took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the cat and cuffed it off the basket and kicked it into the gardenhouse scratching off a handful of fur  the cat was too much surprised to scratch back  when old mr bunny had driven the cat into the greenhouse he locked the door  then he came back to the basket and took out his son benjamin by the ears and whipped him with the little switch  then he took out his nephew peter  then he took out the handkerchief of onions and marched out of the garden  when mr mcgregor returned about half an hour later he observed several things which perplexed him  it looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a pair of clogsonly the footmarks were too ridiculously little  also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut herself up inside the greenhouse locking the door upon the outside  when peter got home his mother forgave him because she was so glad to see that he had found his shoes and coat cottontail and peter folded up the pocket handkerchief and old mrs rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling with the rabbittobacco  the end       the tale of the flopsy bunnies   for all little friends of mr mcgregor  peter  benjamin   it is said that the effect of eating too much lettuce is soporific  i have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces but then i am not a rabbit  they certainly had a very soporific effect upon the flopsy bunnies  when benjamin bunny grew up he married his cousin flopsy they had a large family and they were very improvident and cheerful  i do not remember the separate names of their children they were generally called the flopsy bunnies  as there was not always quite enough to eat benjamin used to borrow cabbages from flopsys brother peter rabbit who kept a nursery garden  sometimes peter rabbit had no cabbages to spare  when this happened the flopsy bunnies went across the field to a rubbish heap in the ditch outside mr mcgregors garden  mr mcgregors rubbish heap was a mixture there were jam pots and paper bags and mountains of chopped grass from the mowing machine which always tasted oily and some rotten vegetable marrows and an old boot or two one dayoh joythere were a quantity of overgrown lettuces which had shot into flower  the flopsy bunnies simply stuffed lettuces by degrees one after another they were overcome with slumber and lay down in the mown grass  benjamin was not so much overcome as his children before going to sleep he was sufficiently wide awake to put a paper bag over his head to keep off the flies  the little flopsy bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun from the lawn beyond the garden came the distant clacketty sound of the mowing machine the blue bottles buzzed about the wall and a little old mouse picked over the rubbish among the jam pots  i can tell you her name she was called thomasina tittlemouse a woodmouse with a long tail  she rustled across the paper bag and awakened benjamin bunny  the mouse apologized profusely and said that she knew peter rabbit  while she and benjamin were talking close under the wall they heard a heavy tread above their heads and suddenly mr mcgregor emptied out a sackful of lawn mowings right upon the top of the sleeping flopsy bunnies benjamin shrank down under his paper bag the mouse hid in a jam pot  the little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of grass they did not awake because the lettuces had been so soporific  they dreamt that their mother flopsy was tucking them up in a hay bed  mr mcgregor looked down after emptying his sack he saw some funny little brown tips of ears sticking up through the lawn mowings he stared at them for some time  presently a fly settled on one of them and it moved  mr mcgregor climbed down on to the rubbish heap  one two three four five six leetle rabbits said he as he dropped them into his sack the flopsy bunnies dreamt that their mother was turning them over in bed they stirred a little in their sleep but still they did not wake up  mr mcgregor tied up the sack and left it on the wall  he went to put away the mowing machine  while he was gone mrs flopsy bunny who had remained at home came across the field  she looked suspiciously at the sack and wondered where everybody was  then the mouse came out of her jam pot and benjamin took the paper bag off his head and they told the doleful tale  benjamin and flopsy were in despair they could not undo the string  but mrs tittlemouse was a resourceful person she nibbled a hole in the bottom corner of the sack  the little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them  their parents stuffed the empty sack with three rotten vegetable marrows an old blackingbrush and two decayed turnips  then they all hid under a bush and watched for mr mcgregor  mr mcgregor came back and picked up the sack and carried it off  he carried it hanging down as if it were rather heavy  the flopsy bunnies followed at a safe distance  they watched him go into his house  and then they crept up to the window to listen  mr mcgregor threw down the sack on the stone floor in a way that would have been extremely painful to the flopsy bunnies if they had happened to have been inside it  they could hear him drag his chair on the flags and chuckle  one two three four five six leetle rabbits said mr mcgregor  eh whats that what have they been spoiling now enquired mrs mcgregor  one two three four five six leetle fat rabbits repeated mr mcgregor counting on his fingersone two three  dont you be silly what do you mean you silly old man  in the sack one two three four five six replied mr mcgregor  the youngest flopsy bunny got upon the windowsill  mrs mcgregor took hold of the sack and felt it she said she could feel six but they must be old rabbits because they were so hard and all different shapes  not fit to eat but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak  line your old cloak shouted mr mcgregori shall sell them and buy myself baccy  rabbit tobacco i shall skin them and cut off their heads  mrs mcgregor untied the sack and put her hand inside  when she felt the vegetables she became very very angry she said that mr mcgregor had done it a purpose  and mr mcgregor was very angry too one of the rotten marrows came flying through the kitchen window and hit the youngest flopsy bunny  it was rather hurt  then benjamin and flopsy thought that it was time to go home  so mr mcgregor did not get his tobacco and mrs mcgregor did not get her rabbit skins  but next christmas thomasina tittlemouse got a present of enough rabbitwool to make herself a cloak and a hood and a handsome muff and a pair of warm mittens   the end      in remembrance of sammy the intelligent pinkeyed representative of a persecuted but irrepressible race an affectionate little friend and most accomplished thief  the rolypoly pudding    once upon a time there was an old cat called mrs tabitha twitchit who was an anxious parent she used to lose her kittens continually and whenever they were lost they were always in mischief  on baking day she determined to shut them up in a cupboard  she caught moppet and mittens but she could not find tom   mrs tabitha went up and down all over the house mewing for tom kitten she looked in the pantry under the staircase and she searched the best spare bedroom that was all covered up with dust sheets she went right upstairs and looked into the attics but she could not find him anywhere  it was an old old house full of cupboards and passages some of the walls were four feet thick and there used to be queer noises inside them as if there might be a little secret staircase certainly there were odd little jagged doorways in the wainscot and things disappeared at night especially cheese and bacon  mrs tabitha became more and more distracted and mewed dreadfully   while their mother was searching the house moppet and mittens had got into mischief  the cupboard door was not locked so they pushed it open and came out   they went straight to the dough which was set to rise in a pan before the fire  they patted it with their little soft paws shall we make dear little muffins said mittens to moppet   but just at that moment somebody knocked at the front door and moppet jumped into the flour barrel in a fright   mittens ran away to the dairy and hid in an empty jar on the stone shelf where the milk pans stand   the visitor was a neighbor mrs ribby she had called to borrow some yeast  mrs tabitha came downstairs mewing dreadfullycome in cousin ribby come in and sit ye down im in sad trouble cousin ribby said tabitha shedding tears ive lost my dear son thomas im afraid the rats have got him she wiped her eyes with an apron  hes a bad kitten cousin tabitha he made a cats cradle of my best bonnet last time i came to tea where have you looked for him  all over the house the rats are too many for me what a thing it is to have an unruly family said mrs tabitha twitchit   im not afraid of rats i will help you to find him and whip him too what is all that soot in the fender  the chimney wants sweepingoh dear me cousin ribbynow moppet and mittens are gone  they have both got out of the cup board   ribby and tabitha set to work to search the house thoroughly again they poked under the beds with ribbys umbrella and they rummaged in cupboards they even fetched a candle and looked inside a clothes chest in one of the attics they could not find anything but once they heard a door bang and somebody scuttered downstairs  yes it is infested with rats said tabitha tearfully i caught seven young ones out of one hole in the back kitchen and we had them for dinner last saturday and once i saw the old father ratan enormous old rat cousin ribby i was just going to jump upon him when he showed his yellow teeth at me and whisked down the hole  the rats get upon my nerves cousin ribby said tabitha   ribby and tabitha searched and searched they both heard a curious rolypoly noise under the attic floor but there was nothing to be seen   they returned to the kitchen heres one of your kittens at least said ribby dragging moppet out of the flour barrel   they shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor she seemed to be in a terrible fright  oh mother mother said moppet theres been an old woman rat in the kitchen and shes stolen some of the dough  the two cats ran to look at the dough pan sure enough there were marks of little scratching fingers and a lump of dough was gone  which way did she go moppet  but moppet had been too much frightened to peep out of the barrel again  ribby and tabitha took her with them to keep her safely in sight while they went on with their search   they went into the dairy  the first thing they found was mittens hiding in an empty jar   they tipped up the jar and she scrambled out  oh mother mother said mittens   oh mother mother there has been an old man rat in the dairya dreadful normous big rat mother and hes stolen a pat of butter and the rollingpin  ribby and tabitha looked at one another  a rollingpin and butter oh my poor son thomas exclaimed tabitha wringing her paws  a rollingpin said ribby did we not hear a rolypoly noise in the attic when we were looking into that chest  ribby and tabitha rushed upstairs again sure enough the rolypoly noise was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor   this is serious cousin tabitha said ribby we must send for john joiner at once with a saw   now this is what had been happening to tom kitten and it shows how very unwise it is to go up a chimney in a very old house where a person does not know his way and where there are enormous rats   tom kitten did not want to be shut up in a cupboard when he saw that his mother was going to bake he determined to hide  he looked about for a nice convenient place and he fixed upon the chimney  the fire had only just been lighted and it was not hot but there was a white choky smoke from the green sticks tom kitten got upon the fender and looked up it was a big oldfashioned fireplace  the chimney itself was wide enough inside for a man to stand up and walk about so there was plenty of room for a little tom cat   he jumped right up into the fireplace balancing himself upon the iron bar where the kettle hangs   tom kitten took another big jump off the bar and landed on a ledge high up inside the chimney knocking down some soot into the fender   tom kitten coughed and choked with the smoke he could hear the sticks beginning to crackle and burn in the fireplace down below he made up his mind to climb right to the top and get out on the slates and try to catch sparrows  i cannot go back if i slipped i might fall in the fire and singe my beautiful tail and my little blue jacket  the chimney was a very big oldfashioned one it was built in the days when people burnt logs of wood upon the hearth  the chimney stack stood up above the roof like a little stone tower and the daylight shone down from the top under the slanting slates that kept out the rain   tom kitten was getting very frightened he climbed up and up and up   then he waded sideways through inches of soot he was like a little sweep himself   it was most confusing in the dark one flue seemed to lead into another  there was less smoke but tom kitten felt quite lost  he scrambled up and up but before he reached the chimney top he came to a place where somebody had loosened a stone in the wall there were some mutton bones lying about  this seems funny said tom kitten who has been gnawing bones up here in the chimney i wish i had never come and what a funny smell it is something like mouse only dreadfully strong it makes me sneeze said tom kitten   he squeezed through the hole in the wall and dragged himself along a most uncomfortably tight passage where there was scarcely any light   he groped his way carefully for several yards he was at the back of the skirting board in the attic where there is a little mark  in the picture   all at once he fell head over heels in the dark down a hole and landed on a heap of very dirty rags  when tom kitten picked himself up and looked about himhe found himself in a place that he had never seen before although he had lived all his life in the house  it was a very small stuffy fusty room with boards and rafters and cobwebs and lath and plaster  opposite to himas far away as he could sitwas an enormous rat  what do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts said the rat chattering his teeth   please sir the chimney wants sweeping said poor tom kitten   anna maria anna maria squeaked the rat there was a pattering noise and an old woman rat poked her head round a rafter   all in a minute she rushed upon tom kitten and before he knew what was happening  his coat was pulled off and he was rolled up in a bundle and tied with string in very hard knots  anna maria did the tying the old rat watched her and took snuff when she had finished they both sat staring at him with their mouths open  anna maria said the old man rat whose name was samuel whiskers anna maria make me a kitten dumpling rolypoly pudding for my dinner  it requires dough and a pat of butter and a rollingpin said anna maria considering tom kitten with her head on one side   no said samuel whiskers make it properly anna maria with breadcrumbs   nonsense butter and dough replied anna maria   the two rats consulted together for a few minutes and then went away  samuel whiskers got through a hole in the wainscot and went boldly down the front staircase to the dairy to get the butter he did not meet anybody  he made a second journey for the rolling pin he pushed it in front of him with his paws like a brewers man trundling a barrel  he could hear ribby and tabitha talking but they were busy lighting the candle to look into the chest  they did not see him   anna maria went down by way of the skirtingboard and a window shutter to the kitchen to steal the dough   she borrowed a small saucer and scooped up the dough with her paws  she did not observe moppet   while tom kitten was left alone under the floor of the attic he wriggled about and tried to mew for help  but his mouth was full of soot and cob webs and he was tied up in such very tight knots he could not make anybody hear him  except a spider which came out of a crack in the ceiling and examined the knots critically from a safe distance  it was a judge of knots because it had a habit of tying up unfortunate bluebottles it did not offer to assist him  tom kitten wriggled and squirmed until he was quite exhausted   presently the rats came back and set to work to make him into a dumpling first they smeared him with butter and then they rolled him in the dough  will not the string be very indigestible anna maria inquired samuel whiskers   anna maria said she thought that it was of no consequence but she wished that tom kitten would hold his head still as it disarranged the pastry she laid hold of his ears   tom kitten bit and spat and mewed and wriggled and the rollingpin went roly poly roly roly poly roly the rats each held an end  his tail is sticking out you did not fetch enough dough anna maria  i fetched as much as i could carry replied anna maria  i do not thinksaid samuel whiskers pausing to take a look at tom kitteni do not think it will be a good pudding it smells sooty  anna maria was about to argue the point when all at once there began to be other sounds up abovethe rasping noise of a saw and the noise of a little dog scratching and yelping   the rats dropped the rollingpin and listened attentively  we are discovered and interrupted anna maria let us collect our property and other peoplesand depart at once  i fear that we shall be obliged to leave this pudding   but i am persuaded that the knots would have proved indigestible whatever you may urge to the contrary  come away at once and help me to tie up some mutton bones in a counterpane said anna maria i have got half a smoked ham hidden in the chimney   so it happened that by the time john joiner had got the plank upthere was nobody under the floor except the rollingpin and tom kitten in a very dirty dumpling   but there was a strong smell of rats and john joiner spent the rest of the morning sniffing and whining and wagging his tail and going round and round with his head in the hole like a gimlet   then he nailed the plank down again and put his tools in his bag and came downstairs  the cat family had quite recovered they invited him to stay to dinner  the dumpling had been peeled off tom kitten and made separately into a bag pudding with currants in it to hide the smuts  they had been obliged to put tom kitten into a hot bath to get the butter off  john joiner smelt the pudding but he regretted that he had not time to stay to dinner because he had just finished making a wheelbarrow for miss potter and she had ordered two hencoops   and when i was going to the post late in the afternooni looked up the lane from the corner and i saw mr samuel whiskers and his wife on the run with big bundles on a little wheelbarrow which looked very like mine  they were just turning in at the gate to the barn of farmer potatoes  samuel whiskers was puffing and out of breath anna maria was still arguing in shrill tones  she seemed to know her way and she seemed to have a quantity of luggage  i am sure i never gave her leave to borrow my wheelbarrow   they went into the barn and hauled their parcels with a bit of string to the top of the haymow   after that there were no more rats for a long time at tabitha twitchits   as for farmer potatoes he has been driven nearly distracted there are rats and rats and rats in his barn they eat up the chicken food and steal the oats and bran and make holes in the meal bags  and they are all descended from mr and mrs samuel whiskerschildren and grandchildren and great great grandchildren  there is no end to them   moppet and mittens have grown up into very good ratcatchers  they go out ratcatching in the village and they find plenty of employment they charge so much a dozen and earn their living very comfortably   they hang up the rats tails in a row or the barn door to show how many they have caughtdozens and dozens of them   but tom kitten has always been afraid of a rat he never durst face anything that is bigger than            a mouse    the end      the tale of mr tod  i have made many books about wellbehaved people now for a change i am going to make a story about two disagreeable people called tommy brock and mr tod nobody could call mr tod nice the rabbits could not bear him they could smell him half a mile off he was of a wandering habit and he had foxey whiskers they never knew where he would be next   one day he was living in a stick house in the coppice causing terror to the family of old mr benjamin bouncer next day he moved into a pollard willow near the lake frightening the wild ducks and the water rats  in winter and early spring he might generally be found in an earth amongst the rocks at the top of bull banks under oatmeal crag  he had half a dozen houses but he was seldom at home   the houses were not always empty when mr tod moved out because sometimes tommy brock moved in without asking leave  tommy brock was a short bristly fat waddling person with a grin he grinned all over his face he was not nice in his habits he ate wasp nests and frogs and worms and he waddled about by moonlight digging things up   his clothes were very dirty and as he slept in the daytime he always went to bed in his boots and the bed which he went to bed in was generally mr tods  now tommy brock did occasionally eat rabbitpie but it was only very little young ones occasionally when other food was really scarce he was friendly with old mr bouncer they agreed in disliking the wicked otters and mr tod they often talked over that painful subject  old mr bouncer was stricken in years he sat in the spring sunshine outside the burrow in a muffler smoking a pipe of rabbit tobacco  he lived with his son benjamin bunny and his daughterinlaw flopsy who had a young family old mr bouncer was in charge of the family that afternoon because benjamin and flopsy had gone out  the little rabbitbabies were just old enough to open their blue eyes and kick they lay in a fluffy bed of rabbit wool and hay in a shallow burrow separate from the main rabbit hole to tell the truthold mr bouncer had forgotten them  he sat in the sun and conversed cordially with tommy brock who was passing through the wood with a sack and a little spud which he used for digging and some mole traps he complained bitterly about the scarcity of pheasants eggs and accused mr tod of poaching them and the otters had cleared off all the frogs while he was asleep in winteri have not had a good square meal for a fortnight i am living on pignuts i shall have to turn vegetarian and eat my own tail said tommy brock  it was not much of a joke but it tickled old mr bouncer because tommy brock was so fat and stumpy and grinning  so old mr bouncer laughed and pressed tommy brock to come inside to taste a slice of seedcake and a glass of my daughter flopsys cowslip wine tommy brock squeezed himself into the rabbit hole with alacrity   then old mr bouncer smoked another pipe and gave tommy brock a cabbage leaf cigar which was so very strong that it made tommy brock grin more than ever and the smoke filled the burrow old mr bouncer coughed and laughed and tommy brock puffed and grinned  and mr bouncer laughed and coughed and shut his eyes because of the cabbage smoke             when flopsy and benjamin came backold mr bouncer woke up tommy brock and all the young rabbitbabies had disappeared  mr bouncer would not confess that he had admitted anybody into the rabbit hole but the smell of badger was undeniable and there were round heavy footmarks in the sand he was in disgrace flopsy wrung her ears and slapped him   benjamin bunny set off at once after tommy brock  there was not much difficulty in tracking him he had left his foot mark and gone slowly up the winding footpath through the wood here he had rooted up the moss and wood sorrel there he had dug quite a deep hole for dog darnel and had set a mole trap a little stream crossed the way benjamin skipped lightly over dryfoot the badgers heavy steps showed plainly in the mud  the path led to a part of the thicket where the trees had been cleared there were leafy oak stumps and a sea of blue hyacinthsbut the smell that made benjamin stop was not the smell of flowers   mr tods stick house was before him and for once mr tod was at home there was not only a foxey flavour in proof of itthere was smoke coming out of the broken pail that served as a chimney  benjamin bunny sat up staring his whiskers twitched inside the stick house somebody dropped a plate and said something benjamin stamped his foot and bolted   he never stopped till he came to the other side of the wood apparently tommy brock had turned the same way upon the top of the wall there were again the marks of badger and some ravellings of a sack had caught on a briar  benjamin climbed over the wall into a meadow he found another mole trap newly set he was still upon the track of tommy brock it was getting late in the afternoon other rabbits were coming out to enjoy the evening air one of them in a blue coat by himself was busily hunting for dandelionscousin peter peter rabbit peter rabbit shouted benjamin bunny  the blue coated rabbit sat up with pricked ears   whatever is the matter cousin benjamin is it a cat or john stoat ferret  no no no hes bagged my familytommy brockin a sack have you seen him  tommy brock how many cousin benjamin  seven cousin peter and all of them twins did he come this way please tell me quick   yes yes not ten minutes since     he said they were caterpillars i did think they were kicking rather hard for caterpillars  which way which way has he gone cousin peter  he had a sack with something live in it i watched him set a mole trap let me use my mind cousin benjamin tell me from the beginning benjamin did so   my uncle bouncer has displayed a lamentable want of discretion for his years said peter reflectively but there are two hopeful circumstances your family is alive and kicking and tommy brock has had refreshment he will probably go to sleep and keep them for breakfast which way cousin benjamin compose yourself i know very well which way because mr tod was at home in the stickhouse he has gone to mr tods other house at the top of bull banks i partly know because he offered to leave any message at sister cottontails he said he would be passing cottontail had married a black rabbit and gone to live on the hill   peter hid his dandelions and accompanied the afflicted parent who was all of a twitter they crossed several fields and began to climb the hill the tracks of tommy brock were plainly to be seen he seemed to have put down the sack every dozen yards to rest  he must be very puffed we are close behind him by the scent what a nasty person said peter   the sunshine was still warm and slanting on the hill pastures half way up cottontail was sitting in her doorway with four or five half grown little rabbits playing about her one black and the others brown  cottontail had seen tommy brock passing in the distance asked whether her husband was at home she replied that tommy brock had rested twice while she watched him   he had nodded and pointed to the sack and seemed doubled up with laughingcome away peter he will be cooking them come quicker said benjamin bunny  they climbed up and uphe was at home i saw his black ears peeping out of the hole they live too near the rocks to quarrel with their neighbours come on cousin benjamin  when they came near the wood at the top of bull banks they went cautiously the trees grew amongst heaped up rocks and there beneath a cragmr tod had made one of his homes it was at the top of a steep bank the rocks and bushes overhung it the rabbits crept up carefully listening and peeping   this house was something between a cave a prison and a tumble down pigstye there was a strong door which was shut and locked  the setting sun made the window panes glow like red flame but the kitchen fire was not alight it was neatly laid with dry sticks as the rabbits could see when they peeped through the window  benjamin sighed with relief   but there were preparations upon the kitchen table which made him shudder there was an immense empty piedish of blue willow pattern and a large carving knife and fork and a chopper  at the other end of the table was a partly unfolded tablecloth a plate a tumbler a knife and fork salt cellar mustard and a chairin short preparations for one persons supper   no person was to be seen and no young rabbits the kitchen was empty and silent the clock had run down peter and benjamin flattened their noses against the window and stared into the dusk  then they scrambled round the rocks to the other side of the house it was damp and smelly and over grown with thorns and briars  the rabbits shivered in their shoes   oh my poor rabbit babies what a dreadful place i shall never see them again sighed benjamin  they crept up to the bedroom window it was closed and bolted like the kitchen but there were signs that this window had been recently open the cobwebs were disturbed and there were fresh dirty footmarks upon the windowsill  the room inside was so dark that at first they could make out nothing but they could hear a noise a slow deep regular snoring grunt and as their eyes became accustomed to the darkness they perceived that somebody was asleep on mr tods bed curled up under the blankethe has gone to bed in his boots whispered peter   benjamin who was all of a twitter pulled peter off the windowsill  tommy brocks snores continued grunty and regular from mr tods bed nothing could be seen of the young family  the sun had set an owl began to hoot in the wood there were many unpleasant things lying about that had much better have been buried rabbit bones and skulls and chickens legs and other horrors it was a shocking place and very dark  they went back to the front of the house and tried in every way to move the bolt of the kitchen window they tried to push up a rusty nail between the window sashes but it was of no use especially without a light   they sat side by side outside the window whispering and listening  in half an hour the moon rose over the wood it shone full and clear and cold upon the house amongst the rocks and in at the kitchen window but alas no little rabbit babies were to be seen  the moonbeams twinkled on the carving knife and the pie dish and made a path of brightness across the dirty floor  the light showed a little door in a wall beside the kitchen fireplace a little iron door belonging to a brick oven of that oldfashioned sort that used to be heated with faggots of wood  and presently at the same moment peter and benjamin noticed that whenever they shook the window the little door opposite shook in answer the young family were alive shut up in the oven   benjamin was so excited that it was a mercy he did not awake tommy brock whose snores continued solemnly in mr tods bed  but there really was not very much comfort in the discovery they could not open the window and although the young family was alivethe little rabbits were quite incapable of letting themselves out they were not old enough to crawl  after much whispering peter and benjamin decided to dig a tunnel they began to burrow a yard or two lower down the bank they hoped that they might be able to work between the large stones under the house the kitchen floor was so dirty that it was impossible to say whether it was made of earth or flags   they dug and dug for hours they could not tunnel straight on account of stones but by the end of the night they were under the kitchen floor benjamin was on his back scratching upwards peters claws were worn down he was outside the tunnel shuffling sand away he called out that it was morningsunrise and that the jays were making a noise down below in the woods  benjamin bunny came out of the dark tunnel shaking the sand from his ears he cleaned his face with his paws every minute the sun shone warmer on the top of the hill in the valley there was a sea of white mist with golden tops of trees showing through   again from the fields down below in the mist there came the angry cry of a jayfollowed by the sharp yelping bark of a fox  then those two rabbits lost their heads completely they did the most foolish thing that they could have done they rushed into their short new tunnel and hid themselves at the top end of it under mr tods kitchen floor   mr tod was coming up bull banks and he was in the very worst of tempers first he had been upset by breaking the plate it was his own fault but it was a china plate the last of the dinner service that had belonged to his grandmother old vixen tod then the midges had been very bad and he had failed to catch a hen pheasant on her nest and it had contained only five eggs two of them addled mr tod had had an unsatisfactory night   as usual when out of humour he determined to move house first he tried the pollard willow but it was damp and the otters had left a dead fish near it mr tod likes nobodys leavings but his own  he made his way up the hill his temper was not improved by noticing unmistakable marks of badger no one else grubs up the moss so wantonly as tommy brock   mr tod slapped his stick upon the earth and fumed he guessed where tommy brock had gone to he was further annoyed by the jay bird which followed him persistently it flew from tree to tree and scolded warning every rabbit within hearing that either a cat or a fox was coming up the plantation once when it flew screaming over his head mr tod snapped at it and barked  he approached his house very carefully with a large rusty key he sniffed and his whiskers bristled the house was locked up but mr tod had his doubts whether it was empty he turned the rusty key in the lock the rabbits below could hear it mr tod opened the door cautiously and went in   the sight that met mr tods eyes in mr tods kitchen made mr tod furious there was mr tods chair and mr tods pie dish and his knife and fork and mustard and salt cellar and his tablecloth that he had left folded up in the dresserall set out for supper or breakfastwithout doubt for that odious tommy brock  there was a smell of fresh earth and dirty badger which fortunately overpowered all smell of rabbit  but what absorbed mr tods attention was a noisea deep slow regular snoring grunting noise coming from his own bed  he peeped through the hinges of the halfopen bedroom door then he turned and came out of the house in a hurry his whiskers bristled and his coatcollar stood on end with rage   for the next twenty minutes mr tod kept creeping cautiously into the house and retreating hurriedly out again by degrees he ventured further inright into the bedroom when he was outside the house he scratched up the earth with fury but when he was insidehe did not like the look of tommy brocks teeth  he was lying on his back with his mouth open grinning from ear to ear he snored peacefully and regularly but one eye was not perfectly shut  mr tod came in and out of the bedroom twice he brought in his walkingstick and once he brought in the coalscuttle but he thought better of it and took them away   when he came back after removing the coalscuttle tommy brock was lying a little more sideways but he seemed even sounder asleep he was an incurably indolent person he was not in the least afraid of mr tod he was simply too lazy and comfortable to move  mr tod came back yet again into the bedroom with a clothes line he stood a minute watching tommy brock and listening attentively to the snores they were very loud indeed but seemed quite natural  mr tod turned his back towards the bed and undid the window it creaked he turned round with a jump tommy brock who had opened one eyeshut it hastily the snores continued   mr tods proceedings were peculiar and rather uneasy because the bed was between the window and the door of the bedroom he opened the window a little way and pushed out the greater part of the clothes line on to the window sill the rest of the line with a hook at the end remained in his hand  tommy brock snored conscientiously mr tod stood and looked at him for a minute then he left the room again   tommy brock opened both eyes and looked at the rope and grinned there was a noise outside the window tommy brock shut his eyes in a hurry  mr tod had gone out at the front door and round to the back of the house on the way he stumbled over the rabbit burrow if he had had any idea who was inside it he would have pulled them out quickly   his foot went through the tunnel nearly upon the top of peter rabbit and benjamin but fortunately he thought that it was some more of tommy brocks work  he took up the coil of line from the sill listened for a moment and then tied the rope to a tree  tommy brock watched him with one eye through the window he was puzzled   mr tod fetched a large heavy pailful of water from the spring and staggered with it through the kitchen into his bedroom  tommy brock snored industriously with rather a snort  mr tod put down the pail beside the bed took up the end of rope with the hookhesitated and looked at tommy brock the snores were almost apoplectic but the grin was not quite so big  mr tod gingerly mounted a chair by the head of the bedstead his legs were dangerously near to tommy brocks teeth  he reached up and put the end of rope with the hook over the head of the tester bed where the curtains ought to hang   mr tods curtains were folded up and put away owing to the house being unoccupied so was the counterpane tommy brock was covered with a blanket only mr tod standing on the unsteady chair looked down upon him attentively he really was a first prize sound sleeper  it seemed as though nothing would waken himnot even the flapping rope across the bed  mr tod descended safely from the chair and endeavoured to get up again with the pail of water he intended to hang it from the hook dangling over the head of tommy brock in order to make a sort of showerbath worked by a string through the window   but naturally being a thinlegged person though vindictive and sandy whiskeredhe was quite unable to lift the heavy weight to the level of the hook and rope he very nearly overbalanced himself  the snores became more and more apoplectic one of tommy brocks hind legs twitched under the blanket but still he slept on peacefully   mr tod and the pail descended from the chair without accident after considerable thought he emptied the water into a washbasin and jug the empty pail was not too heavy for him he slung it up wobbling over the head of tommy brock  surely there never was such a sleeper mr tod got up and down down and up on the chair  as he could not lift the whole pailful of water at once he fetched a milk jug and ladled quarts of water into the pail by degrees the pail got fuller and fuller and swung like a pendulum occasionally a drop splashed over but still tommy brock snored regularly and never movedexcept one eye   at last mr tods preparations were complete the pail was full of water the rope was tightly strained over the top of the bed and across the window sill to the tree outside  it will make a great mess in my bedroom but i could never sleep in that bed again without a spring cleaning of some sort said mr tod   mr tod took a last look at the badger and softly left the room he went out of the house shutting the front door the rabbits heard his footsteps over the tunnel  he ran round behind the house intending to undo the rope in order to let fall the pailful of water upon tommy brock  i will wake him up with an unpleasant surprise said mr tod   the moment he had gone tommy brock got up in a hurry he rolled mr tods dressinggown into a bundle put it into the bed beneath the pail of water instead of himself and left the room alsogrinning immensely  he went into the kitchen lighted the fire and boiled the kettle for the moment he did not trouble himself to cook the baby rabbits   when mr tod got to the tree he found that the weight and strain had dragged the knot so tight that it was past untying he was obliged to gnaw it with his teeth he chewed and gnawed for more than twenty minutes at last the rope gave way with such a sudden jerk that it nearly pulled his teeth out and quite knocked him over backwards   inside the house there was a great crash and splash and the noise of a pail rolling over and over  but no screams mr tod was mystified he sat quite still and listened attentively then he peeped in at the window the water was dripping from the bed the pail had rolled into a corner  in the middle of the bed under the blanket was a wet flattened somethingmuch dinged in in the middle where the pail had caught it as it were across the tummy its head was covered by the wet blanket and it was not snoring any longer  there was nothing stirring and no sound except the drip drop drop drip of water trickling from the mattress   mr tod watched it for half an hour his eyes glistened  then he cut a caper and became so bold that he even tapped at the window but the bundle never moved  yesthere was no doubt about itit had turned out even better than he had planned the pail had hit poor old tommy brock and killed him dead   i will bury that nasty person in the hole which he has dug i will bring my bedding out and dry it in the sun said mr tod  i will wash the tablecloth and spread it on the grass in the sun to bleach and the blanket must be hung up in the wind and the bed must be thoroughly disinfected and aired with a warmingpan and warmed with a hotwater bottle   i will get soft soap and monkey soap and all sorts of soap and soda and scrubbing brushes and persian powder and carbolic to remove the smell i must have a disinfecting perhaps i may have to burn sulphur  he hurried round the house to get a shovel from the kitchen first i will arrange the hole then i will drag out that person in the blanket     he opened the door     tommy brock was sitting at mr tods kitchen table pouring out tea from mr tods teapot into mr tods teacup he was quite dry himself and grinning and he threw the cup of scalding tea all over mr tod   then mr tod rushed upon tommy brock and tommy brock grappled with mr tod amongst the broken crockery and there was a terrific battle all over the kitchen to the rabbits underneath it sounded as if the floor would give way at each crash of falling furniture  they crept out of their tunnel and hung about amongst the rocks and bushes listening anxiously   inside the house the racket was fearful the rabbit babies in the oven woke up trembling perhaps it was fortunate they were shut up inside  everything was upset except the kitchen table  and everything was broken except the mantelpiece and the kitchen fender the crockery was smashed to atoms   the chairs were broken and the window and the clock fell with a crash and there were handfuls of mr tods sandy whiskers  the vases fell off the mantelpiece the canisters fell off the shelf the kettle fell off the hob tommy brock put his foot in a jar of raspberry jam  and the boiling water out of the kettle fell upon the tail of mr tod   when the kettle fell tommy brock who was still grinning happened to be uppermost and he rolled mr tod over and over like a log out at the door  then the snarling and worrying went on outside and they rolled over the bank and down hill bumping over the rocks there will never be any love lost between tommy brock and mr tod   as soon as the coast was clear peter rabbit and benjamin bunny came out of the bushes  now for it run in cousin benjamin run in and get them while i watch at the door  but benjamin was frightened  oh oh they are coming back  no they are not  yes they are  what dreadful bad language i think they have fallen down the stone quarry  still benjamin hesitated and peter kept pushing him  be quick its all right shut the oven door cousin benjamin so that he wont miss them  decidedly there were lively doings in mr tods kitchen   at home in the rabbit hole things had not been quite comfortable  after quarrelling at supper flopsy and old mr bouncer had passed a sleepless night and quarrelled again at breakfast old mr bouncer could no longer deny that he had invited company into the rabbit hole but he refused to reply to the questions and reproaches of flopsy the day passed heavily   old mr bouncer very sulky was huddled up in a corner barricaded with a chair flopsy had taken away his pipe and hidden the tobacco she had been having a complete turn out and spring cleaning to relieve her feelings she had just finished old mr bouncer behind his chair was wondering anxiously what she would do next   in mr tods kitchen amongst the wreckage benjamin bunny picked his way to the oven nervously through a thick cloud of dust he opened the oven door felt inside and found something warm and wriggling he lifted it out carefully and rejoined peter rabbit  ive got them can we get away shall we hide cousin peter  peter pricked his ears distant sounds of fighting still echoed in the wood  five minutes afterwards two breathless rabbits came scuttering away down bull banks half carrying half dragging a sack between them bumpetty bump over the grass they reached home safely and burst into the rabbit hole   great was old mr bouncers relief and flopsys joy when peter and benjamin arrived in triumph with the young family the rabbit babies were rather tumbled and very hungry they were fed and put to bed they soon recovered  a long new pipe and a fresh supply of rabbit tobacco was presented to mr bouncer he was rather upon his dignity but he accepted   old mr bouncer was forgiven and they all had dinner then peter and benjamin told their storybut they had not waited long enough to be able to tell the end of the battle between tommy brock and mr tod  the end      the tale of mrs tiggywinkle   for the real little lucie of newlands   once upon a time there was a little girl called lucie who lived at a farm called littletown she was a good little girlonly she was always losing her pocket handkerchiefs  one day little lucie came into the farmyard crying oh she did cry so ive lost my pockethandkin three handkins and a pinny have you seen them tabby kitten  the kitten went on washing her white paws so lucie asked a speckled hen  sally hennypenny has you found three pockethandkins  but the speckled hen ran into a barn clucking  i go barefoot barefoot barefoot  and then lucie asked cock robin sitting on a twig  cock robin looked sideways at lucie with his bright black eye and he flew over a stile and away  lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind littletowna hill that goes upupinto the clouds as though it had no top  and a great way up the hillside she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass  lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her she ran along a steep pathwayup and upuntil littletown was right away down belowshe could have dropped a pebble down the chimney  presently she came to a spring bubbling out from the hillside  some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the waterbut the water was already running over for the can was no bigger than an eggcup and where the sand upon the path was wetthere were footmarks of a very small person  lucie ran on and on  the path ended under a big rock the grass was short and green and there were clothesprops cut from bracken stems with lines of plaited rushes and a heap of tiny clothes pinsbut no pockethandkerchiefs  but there was something elsea door straight into the hill and inside it some one was singing       lilywhite and clean oh      with little frills between oh      smooth and hotred rusty spot      never here be seen oh   lucie knockedonce twice and interrupted the song a little frightened voice called out whos that  lucie opened the door and what do you think there was inside the hilla nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beamsjust like any other farm kitchen only the ceiling was so low that lucies head nearly touched it and the pots and pans were small and so was everything there  there was a nice hot singey smell and at the table with an iron in her hand stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at lucie  her print gown was tucked up and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat her little black nose went sniffle sniffle snuffle and her eyes went twinkle twinkle and underneath her capwhere lucie had yellow curlsthat little person had prickles  who are you said lucie have you seen my pockethandkins  the little person made a bobcurtseyoh yes if you pleasem my name is mrs tiggywinkle oh yes if you pleasem im an excellent clear starcher and she took something out of a clothes basket and spread it on the ironingblanket   whats that thing said luciethats not my pockethandkin  oh no if you pleasem thats a little scarlet waistcoat belonging to cock robin  and she ironed it and folded it and put it on one side  then she took something else off a clotheshorse that isnt my pinny said lucie  oh no if you pleasem thats a damask tablecloth belonging to jenny wren look how its stained with currant wine its very bad to wash said mrs tiggy winkle  mrs tiggywinkles nose went sniffle sniffle snuffle and her eyes went twinkle twinkle and she fetched another hot iron from the fire  theres one of my pockethandkins cried lucieand theres my pinny  mrs tiggywinkle ironed it and goffered it and shook out the frills  oh that is lovely said lucie  and what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves  oh thats a pair of stockings belonging to sally henny pennylook how shes worn the heels out with scratching in the yard shell very soon go barefoot said mrs tiggy winkle  why theres another handkersniffbut it isnt mine its red  oh no if you pleasem that one belongs to old mrs rabbit and it did so smell of onions ive had to wash it separately i cant get out the smell  theres another one of mine said lucie  what are those funny little white things  thats a pair of mittens belonging to tabby kitten i only have to iron them she washes them herself  theres my last pocket handkin said lucie  and what are you dipping into the basin of starch  theyre little dicky shirt fronts belonging to tom titmouse most terrible particular said mrs tiggywinkle now ive finished my ironing im going to air some clothes  what are these dear soft fluffy things said lucie  oh those are wooly coats belonging to the little lambs at skelghyl  will their jackets take off asked lucy  oh yes if you pleasem look at the sheepmark on the shoulder and heres one marked for gatesgarth and three that come from littletown theyre always marked at washing said mrs tiggy winkle  and she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes small brown coats of mice and one velvety black mole skin waistcoat and a red tail coat with no tail belonging to squirrel nutkin and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to peter rabbit and a petticoat not marked that had gone lost in the washing and at last the basket was empty  then mrs tiggywinkle made teaa cup for herself and a cup for lucie they sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another mrs tiggywinkles hand holding the teacup was very very brown and very very wrinkly with the soapsuds and all through her gown and her cap there were hairpins sticking wrong end out so that lucie didnt like to sit too near her  when they had finished tea they tied up the clothes in bundles and lucies pockethandkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny and fastened with a silver safetypin  and then they made up the fire with turf and came out and locked the door and hid the key under the doorsill  then away down the hill trotted lucie and mrs tiggywinkle with the bundles of clothes  all the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them the very first that they met were peter rabbit and benjamin bunny  and she gave them their nice clean clothes and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear mrs tiggywinkle  so that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile there was nothing left to carry except lucies one little bundle  lucie scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand and then she turned to say goodnight and to thank the washerwoman but what a very odd thing mrs tiggywinkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill  she was running running running up the hilland where was her white frilled cap and her shawl and her gownand her petticoat  and how small she had grownand how brown and covered with prickles  why mrs tiggywinkle was nothing but a hedgehog                 now some people say that little lucie had been asleep upon the stile but then how could she have found three clean pockethandkins and a pinny pinned with a silver safetypin  and besidesi have seen that door into the back of the hill called cat bellsand besides i am very well acquainted with dear mrs tiggywinkle    the tale of ginger  pickles   once upon a time there was a village shop the name over the window was ginger and pickles  it was a little small shop just the right size for dollslucinda and jane dollcook always bought their groceries at ginger and pickles  the counter inside was a convenient height for rabbits ginger and pickles sold red spotty pocket handkerchiefs at a penny three farthings  they also sold sugar and snuff and galoshes  in fact although it was such a small shop it sold nearly everything except a few things that you want in a hurrylike bootlaces hairpins and mutton chops   ginger and pickles were the people who kept the shop ginger was a yellow tomcat and pickles was a terrier  the rabbits were always a little bit afraid of pickles   the shop was also patronized by miceonly the mice were rather afraid of ginger  ginger usually requested pickles to serve them because he said it made his mouth water  i cannot bear said he to see them going out at the door carrying their little parcels   i have the same feeling about rats replied pickles but it would never do to eat our own customers they would leave us and go to tabitha twitchits  on the contrary they would go nowhere replied ginger gloomily   tabitha twitchit kept the only other shop in the village she did not give credit   ginger and pickles gave unlimited credit  now the meaning of credit is thiswhen a customer buys a bar of soap instead of the customer pulling out a purse and paying for itshe says she will pay another time  and pickles makes a low bow and says with pleasure madam and it is written down in a book   the customers come again and again and buy quantities in spite of being afraid of ginger and pickles   but there is no money in what is called the till   the customers came in crowds every day and bought quantities especially the toffee customers but there was always no money they never paid for as much as a pennyworth of peppermints   but the sales were enormous ten times as large as tabitha twitchits   as there was always no money ginger and pickles were obliged to eat their own goods  pickles ate biscuits and ginger ate a dried haddock  they ate them by candlelight after the shop was closed   when it came to jan 1st there was still no money and pickles was unable to buy a dog licence  it is very unpleasant i am afraid of the police said pickles  it is your own fault for being a terrier i do not require a licence and neither does kep the collie dog   it is very uncomfortable i am afraid i shall be summoned i have tried in vain to get a licence upon credit at the post office said pickles the place is full of policemen i met one as i was coming home   let us send in the bill again to samuel whiskers ginger he owes 229 for bacon  i do not believe that he intends to pay at all replied ginger   and i feel sure that anna maria pockets things where are all the cream crackers you have eaten them yourself replied ginger   ginger and pickles retired into the back parlour  they did accounts they added up sums and sums and sums  samuel whiskers has run up a bill as long as his tail he has had an ounce and threequarters of snuff since october   what is seven pounds of butter at 13 and a stick of sealing wax and four matches  send in all the bills again to everybody with compts replied ginger   after a time they heard a noise in the shop as if something had been pushed in at the door they came out of the back parlour there was an envelope lying on the counter and a policeman writing in a notebook   pickles nearly had a fit he barked and he barked and made little rushes  bite him pickles bite him spluttered ginger behind a sugar barrel hes only a german doll  the policeman went on writing in his notebook twice he put his pencil in his mouth and once he dipped it in the treacle   pickles barked till he was hoarse but still the policeman took no notice he had bead eyes and his helmet was sewed on with stitches   at length on his last little rush pickles found that the shop was empty the policeman had disappeared  but the envelope remained   do you think that he has gone to fetch a real live policeman i am afraid it is a summons said pickles  no replied ginger who had opened the envelope it is the rates and taxes l 3 19 11 34    this is the last straw said pickles let us close the shop  they put up the shutters and left but they have not removed from the neighbourhood in fact some people wish they had gone further   ginger is living in the warren i do not know what occupation he pursues he looks stout and comfortable  pickles is at present a gamekeeper   the closing of the shop caused great inconvenience tabitha twitchit immediately raised the price of everything a halfpenny and she continued to refuse to give credit   of course there are the trades mens cartsthe butcher the fishman and timothy baker  but a person cannot live on seed wigs and spongecake and butter bunsnot even when the sponge cake is as good as timothys   after a time mr john dormouse and his daughter began to sell peppermints and candles   but they did not keep selffitting sixes and it takes five mice to carry one seven inch candle   besidesthe candles which they sell behave very strangely in warm weather   and miss dormouse refused to take back the ends when they were brought back to her with complaints   and when mr john dormouse was complained to he stayed in bed and would say nothing but very snug which is not the way to carry on a retail business   so everybody was pleased when sally henny penny sent out a printed poster to say that she was going to reopen the shop hennys opening sale grand cooperative jumble pennys penny prices come buy come try come buy  the poster really was most ticing  there was a rush upon the opening day the shop was crammed with customers and there were crowds of mice upon the biscuit canisters  sally henny penny gets rather flustered when she tries to count out change and she insists on being paid cash but she is quite harmless   and she has laid in a remarkable assortment of bargains  there is something to please everybody   the end      the story of miss moppet    this is a pussy called miss moppet she thinks she has heard a mouse  this is the mouse peeping out behind the cupboard and making fun of miss moppet he is not afraid of a kitten  this is miss moppet jumping just too late she misses the mouse and hits her own head  she thinks it is a very hard cupboard  the mouse watches miss moppet from the top of the cupboard  miss moppet ties up her head in a duster and sits before the fire  the mouse thinks she is looking very ill he comes sliding down the bell pull  miss moppet looks worse and worse the mouse comes a little nearer  miss moppet holds her poor head in her paws and looks at him through a hole in the duster the mouse comes very close  and then all of a sudden miss moppet jumps upon the mouse  and because the mouse has teased miss moppet miss moppet thinks she will tease the mouse which is not at all nice of miss moppet  she ties him up in the duster and tosses it about like a ball  but she forgot about that hole in the duster and when she untied itthere was no mouse  he has wriggled out and run away and he is dancing a jig on the top of the cupboard   the end     the tale of mr jeremy fisher  for stephanie from cousin b   once upon a time there was a frog called mr jeremy fisher he lived in a little damp house amongst the buttercups at the edge of a pond  the water was all slippy sloppy in the larder and in the back passage  but mr jeremy liked getting his feet wet nobody ever scolded him and he never caught a cold  he was quite pleased when he looked out and saw large drops of rain splashing in the pond  i will get some worms and go fishing and catch a dish of minnows for my dinner said mr jeremy fisher if i catch more than five fish i will invite my friends mr alderman ptolemy tortoise and sir isaac newton the alderman however eats salad  mr jeremy put on a macintosh and a pair of shiny goloshes he took his rod and basket and set off with enormous hops to the place where he kept his boat  the boat was round and green and very like the other lilyleaves it was tied to a waterplant in the middle of the pond  mr jeremy took a reed pole and pushed the boat out into open water i know a good place for minnows said mr jeremy fisher  mr jeremy stuck his pole into the mud and fastened his boat to it  then he settled himself crosslegged and arranged his fishing tackle he had the dearest little red float his rod was a tough stalk of grass his line was a fine long white horsehair and he tied a little wriggling worm at the end  the rain trickled down his back and for nearly an hour he stared at the float  this is getting tiresome i think i should like some lunch said mr jeremy fisher  he punted back again amongst the water plants and took some lunch out of his basket  i will eat a butterfly sandwich and wait till the shower is over said mr jeremy fisher  a great big waterbeetle came up underneath the lily leaf and tweaked the toe of one of his goloshes  mr jeremy crossed his legs up shorter out of reach and went on eating his sandwich  once or twice something moved about with a rustle and a splash amongst the rushes at the side of the pond  i trust that is not a rat said mr jeremy fisher i think i had better get away from here  mr jeremy shoved the boat out again a little way and dropped in the bait there was a bite almost directly the float gave a tremendous bobbit  a minnow a minnow i have him by the nose cried mr jeremy fisher jerking up his rod  but what a horrible surprise instead of a smooth fat minnow mr jeremy landed little jack sharp the stickleback covered with spines  the stickleback floundered about the boat pricking and snapping until he was quite out of breath then he jumped back into the water  and a shoal of other little fishes put their heads out and laughed at mr jeremy fisher  and while mr jeremy sat disconsolately on the edge of his boatsucking his sore fingers and peering down into the watera much worse thing happened a really frightful thing it would have been if mr jeremy had not been wearing a macintosh  a great big enormous trout came upker pflopppp with a splash and it seized mr jeremy with a snap ow ow ow and then it turned and dived down to the bottom of the pond  but the trout was so displeased with the taste of the macintosh that in less than half a minute it spat him out again and the only thing it swallowed was mr jeremys goloshes  mr jeremy bounced up to the surface of the water like a cork and the bubbles out of a soda water bottle and he swam with all his might to the edge of the pond  he scrambled out on the first bank he came to and he hopped home across the meadow with his macintosh all in tatters  what a mercy that was not a pike said mr jeremy fisher i have lost my rod and basket but it does not much matter for i am sure i should never have dared to go fishing again  he put some sticking plaster on his fingers and his friends both came to dinner he could not offer them fish but he had something else in his larder  sir isaac newton wore his black and gold waistcoat  and mr alderman ptolemy tortoise brought a salad with him in a string bag  and instead of a nice dish of minnowsthey had a roasted grasshopper with ladybird sauce which frogs consider a beautiful treat but i think it must have been nasty   the end      the tale of timmy tiptoes   for many unknown little friends including monica    once upon a time there was a little fat comfortable grey squirrel called timmy tiptoes he had a nest thatched with leaves in the top of a tall tree and he had a little squirrel wife called goody  timmy tiptoes sat out enjoying the breeze he whisked his tail and chuckled little wife goody the nuts are ripe we must lay up a store for winter and spring goody tiptoes was busy pushing moss under the thatchthe nest is so snug we shall be sound asleep all winter then we shall wake up all the thinner when there is nothing to eat in springtime replied prudent timothy  when timmy and goody tiptoes came to the nut thicket they found other squirrels were there already  timmy took off his jacket and hung it on a twig they worked away quietly by themselves  every day they made several journeys and picked quantities of nuts they carried them away in bags and stored them in several hollow stumps near the tree where they had built their nest  when these stumps were full they began to empty the bags into a hole high up a tree that had belonged to a woodpecker the nuts rattled downdown down inside  how shall you ever get them out again it is like a moneybox said goody  i shall be much thinner before springtime my love said timmy tiptoes peeping into the hole  they did collect quantities because they did not lose them squirrels who bury their nuts in the ground lose more than half because they cannot remember the place  the most forgetful squirrel in the wood was called silvertail he began to dig and he could not remember and then he dug again and found some nuts that did not belong to him and there was a fight and other squirrels began to digthe whole wood was in commotion  unfortunately just at this time a flock of little birds flew by from bush to bush searching for green caterpillars and spiders there were several sorts of little birds twittering different songs  the first one sang whos bin diggingup my nuts whosbeendigging up my nuts  and another sanglittle bita bread andnocheese little bitabread anno cheese  the squirrels followed and listened the first little bird flew into the bush where timmy and goody tiptoes were quietly tying up their bags and it sangwhos bin diggingup my nuts whos been diggingup my nuts  timmy tiptoes went on with his work without replying indeed the little bird did not expect an answer it was only singing its natural song and it meant nothing at all  but when the other squirrels heard that song they rushed upon timmy tiptoes and cuffed and scratched him and upset his bag of nuts the innocent little bird which had caused all the mischief flew away in a fright  timmy rolled over and over and then turned tail and fled towards his nest followed by a crowd of squirrels shouting whosbeen diggingup mynuts  they caught him and dragged him up the very same tree where there was the little round hole and they pushed him in the hole was much too small for timmy tiptoes figure they squeezed him dreadfully it was a wonder they did not break his ribs we will leave him here till he confesses said silvertail squirrel and he shouted into the hole  whosbeendiggingup mynuts  timmy tiptoes made no reply he had tumbled down inside the tree upon half a peck of nuts belonging to himself he lay quite stunned and still  goody tiptoes picked up the nut bags and went home she made a cup of tea for timmy but he didnt come and didnt come  goody tiptoes passed a lonely and unhappy night next morning she ventured back to the nutbushes to look for him but the other unkind squirrels drove her away  she wandered all over the wood calling  timmy tiptoes timmy tiptoes oh where is timmy tiptoes  in the meantime timmy tiptoes came to his senses he found himself tucked up in a little moss bed very much in the dark feeling sore it seemed to be under ground timmy coughed and groaned because his ribs hurted him there was a chirpy noise and a small striped chipmunk appeared with a night light and hoped he felt better  it was most kind to timmy tiptoes it lent him its nightcap and the house was full of provisions  the chipmunk explained that it had rained nuts through the top of the tree besides i found a few buried it laughed and chuckled when it heard timmys story while timmy was confined to bed it ticed him to eat quantitiesbut how shall i ever get out through that hole unless i thin myself my wife will be anxious just another nut or two nuts let me crack them for you said the chipmunk timmy tiptoes grew fatter and fatter  now goody tiptoes had set to work again by herself she did not put any more nuts into the woodpeckers hole because she had always doubted how they could be got out again she hid them under a tree root they rattled down down down once when goody emptied an extra big bagful there was a decided squeak and next time goody brought another bagful a little striped chipmunk scrambled out in a hurry  it is getting perfectly full up downstairs the sittingroom is full and they are rolling along the passage and my husband chippy hackee has run away and left me what is the explanation of these showers of nuts  i am sure i beg your pardon i did not not know that anybody lived here said mrs goody tiptoes but where is chippy hackee my husband timmy tiptoes has run away too i know where chippy is a little bird told me said mrs chippy hackee  she led the way to the woodpeckers tree and they listened at the hole  down below there was a noise of nut crackers and a fat squirrel voice and a thin squirrel voice were singing together       my little old man and i fell out      how shall we bring this matter about      bring it about as well as you can      and get you gone you little old man   you could squeeze in through that little round hole said goody tiptoes yes i could said the chipmunk but my husband chippy hackee bites  down below there was a noise of cracking nuts and nibbling and then the fat squirrel voice and the thin squirrel voice sang       for the diddlum day      day diddle dum di      day diddle diddle dum day   then goody peeped in at the hole and called downtimmy tiptoes oh fie timmy tiptoes and timmy replied is that you goody tiptoes why certainly  he came up and kissed goody through the hole but he was so fat that he could not get out  chippy hackee was not too fat but he did not want to come he stayed down below and chuckled  and so it went on for a fortnight till a big wind blew off the top of the tree and opened up the hole and let in the rain  then timmy tiptoes came out and went home with an umbrella  but chippy hackee continued to camp out for another week although it was uncomfortable  at last a large bear came walking through the wood perhaps he also was looking for nuts he seemed to be sniffing around  chippy hackee went home in a hurry  and when chippy hackee got home he found he had caught a cold in his head and he was more uncomfortable still  and now timmy and goody tiptoes keep their nutstore fastened up with a little padlock  and whenever that little bird sees the chipmunks he singswhosbeen diggingup mynuts whos been diggingup mynuts but nobody ever answers   the end     the pie and the pattypan   pussycat sits by the firehow should she be fair in walks the little dogsays pussy are you there how do you do mistress pussy mistress pussy how do you do i thank you kindly little dog i fare as well as you                                    old rhyme      once upon a time there was a pussycat called ribby who invited a little dog called duchess to tea  come in good time my dear duchess said ribbys letter and we will have something so very nice i am baking it in a piedisha pie dish with a pink rim you never tasted anything so good and you shall eat it all i will eat muffins my dear duchess wrote ribby  duchess read the letter and wrote an answeri will come with much pleasure at a quarter past four but it is very strange i was just going to invite you to come here to supper my dear ribby to eat something most delicious  i will come very punctually my dear ribby wrote duchess and then at the end she addedi hope it isnt mouse   and then she thought that did not look quite polite so she scratched out isnt mouse and changed it to i hope it will be fine and she gave her letter to the postman  but she thought a great deal about ribbys pie and she read ribbys letter over and over again  i am dreadfully afraid it will be mouse said duchess to herself i really couldnt couldnt eat mouse pie and i shall have to eat it because it is a party and my pie was going to be veal and ham a pink and white piedish and so is mine just like ribbys dishes they were both bought at tabitha twitchits  duchess went into her larder and took the pie off a shelf and looked at it  it is all ready to put into the oven such lovely piecrust and i put in a little tin pattypan to hold up the crust and i made a hole in the middle with a fork to let out the steamoh i do wish i could eat my own pie instead of a pie made of mouse   duchess considered and considered and read ribby s letter again  a pink and white piedishand you shall eat it all you means methen ribby is not going to even taste the pie herself a pink and white piedish ribby is sure to go out to buy the muffins     oh what a good idea why shouldnt i rush along and put my pie into ribbys oven when ribby isnt there  duchess was quite delighted with her own cleverness   ribby in the meantime had received duchesss answer and as soon as she was sure that the little dog would comeshe popped her pie into the oven there were two ovens one above the other some other knobs and handles were only ornamental and not intended to open ribby put the pie into the lower oven the door was very stiff  the top oven bakes too quickly said ribby to herself it is a pie of the most delicate and tender mouse minced up with bacon and i have taken out all the bones because duchess did nearly choke herself with a fishbone last time i gave a party she eats a little fast rather big mouthfuls but a most genteel and elegant little dog infinitely superior company to cousin tabitha twitchit  ribby put on some coal and swept up the hearth then she went out with a can to the well for water to fill up the kettle   then she began to set the room in order for it was the sittingroom as well as the kitchen she shook the mats out at the frontdoor and put them straight the hearthrug was a rabbitskin she dusted the clock and the ornaments on the mantelpiece and she polished and rubbed the tables and chairs   then she spread a very clean white tablecloth and set out her best china teaset which she took out of a wallcupboard near the fireplace the teacups were white with a pattern of pink roses and the dinnerplates were white and blue  when ribby had laid the table she took a jug and a blue and white dish and went out down the field to the farm to fetch milk and butter   when she came back she peeped into the bottom oven the pie looked very comfortable  ribby put on her shawl and bonnet and went out again with a basket to the village shop to buy a packet of tea a pound of lump sugar and a pot of marmalade  and just at the same time duchess came out of her house at the other end of the village   ribby met duchess halfway own the street also carrying a basket covered with a cloth they only bowed to one another they did not speak because they were going to have a party  as soon as duchess had got round the corner out of sightshe simply ran straight away to ribbys house   ribby went into the shop and bought what she required and came out after a pleasant gossip with cousin tabitha twitchit  cousin tabitha was disdainful afterwards in conversation  a little dog indeed just as if there were no cats in sawrey and a pie for afternoon tea the very idea said cousin tabitha twitchit  ribby went on to timothy bakers and bought the muffins then she went home   there seemed to be a sort of scuffling noise in the back passage as she was coming in at the front door  i trust that is not that pie the spoons are locked up however said ribby  but there was nobody there ribby opened the bottom oven door with some difficulty and turned the pie there began to be a pleasing smell of baked mouse  duchess in the meantime had slipped out at the back door   it is a very odd thing that ribbys pie was not in the oven when i put mine in and i can t find it anywhere i have looked all over the house i put my pie into a nice hot oven at the top i could not turn any of the other handles i think that they are all shams said duchess but i wish i could have removed the pie made of mouse i cannot think what she has done with it i heard ribby coming and i had to run out by the back door   duchess went home and brushed her beautiful black coat and then she picked a bunch of flowers in her garden as a present for ribby and passed the time until the clock struck four  ribbyhaving assured herself by careful search that there was really no one hiding in the cupboard or in the larderwent upstairs to change her dress   she put on a lilac silk gown for the party and an embroidered muslin apron and tippet  it is very strange said ribby i did not think i left that drawer pulled out has somebody been trying on my mittens  she came downstairs again and made the tea and put the teapot on the hob she peeped again into the bottom oven the pie had become a lovely brown and it was steaming hot   she sat down before the fire to wait for the little dog i am glad i used the bottom oven said ribby the top one would certainly have been very much too hot i wonder why that cupboard door was open can there really have been some one in the house   very punctually at four oclock duchess started to go to the party she ran so fast through the village that she was too early and she had to wait a little while in the lane that leads down to ribbys house  i wonder if ribby has taken my pie out of the oven yet said duchess and whatever can have become of the other pie made of mouse   at a quarter past four to the minute there came a most genteel little taptappity is mrs ribston at home inquired duchess in the porch  come in and how do you do my dear duchess cried ribby i hope i see you well  quite well i thank you and how do you do my dear ribby said duchess ive brought you some flowers what a delicious smell of pie   oh what lovely flowers yes it is mouse and bacon  do not talk about food my dear ribby said duchess what a lovely white teacloth     is it done to a turn is it still in the oven  i think it wants another five minutes said ribby just a shade longer i will pour out the tea while we wait do you take sugar my dear duchess   oh yes please my dear ribby and may i have a lump upon my nose  with pleasure my dear duchess how beautifully you beg oh how sweetly pretty  duchess sat up with the sugar on her nose and sniffed  how good that pie smells i do love veal and hami mean to say mouse and bacon  she dropped the sugar in confusion and had to go hunting under the teatable so did not see which oven ribby opened in order to get out the pie  ribby set the pie upon the table there was a very savoury smell  duchess came out from under the tablecloth munching sugar and sat up on a chair  i will first cut the pie for you i am going to have muffin and marmalade said ribby  do you really prefer muffin mind the pattypan  i beg your pardon said ribby   may i pass you the marmalade said duchess hurriedly  the pie proved extremely toothsome and the muffins light and hot they disappeared rapidly especially the pie  i thinkthought the duchess to herselfi think it would be wiser if i helped myself to pie though ribby did not seem to notice anything when she was cutting it what very small fine pieces it has cooked into i did not remember that i had minced it up so fine i suppose this is a quicker oven than my own   how fast duchess is eating thought ribby to herself as she buttered her fifth muffin  the piedish was emptying rapidly duchess had had four helps already and was fumbling with the spoon   a little more bacon my dear duchess said ribby  thank you my dear ribby i was only feeling for the pattypan  the pattypan my dear duchess  the pattypan that held up the piecrust said duchess blushing under her black coat  oh i didnt put one in my dear duchess said ribby i dont think that it is necessary in pies made of mouse   duchess fumbled with the spoon i cant find it she said anxiously  there isnt a pattypan said ribby looking perplexed  yes indeed my dear ribby where can it have gone to said duchess  there most certainly is not one my dear duchess i disapprove of tin articles in puddings and pies it is most undesirableespecially when people swallow in lumps she added in a lower voice   duchess looked very much alarmed and continued to scoop the inside of the piedish  my greataunt squintina grandmother of cousin tabitha twitchitdied of a thimble in a christmas plumpudding i never put any article of metal in my puddings or pies   duchess looked aghast and tilted up the piedish  i have only four pattypans and they are all in the cupboard  duchess set up a howl  i shall die i shall die i have swallowed a pattypan oh my dear ribby i do feel so ill  it is impossible my dear duchess there was not a pattypan  duchess moaned and whined and rocked herself about  oh i feel so dreadful i have swallowed a pattypan   there was nothing in the pie said ribby severely  yes there was my dear ribby i am sure i have swallowed it  let me prop you up with a pillow my dear duchess where do you think you feel it  oh i do feel so ill all over me my dear ribby i have swallowed a large tin pattypan with a sharp scalloped edge  shall i run for the doctor i will just lock up the spoons  oh yes yes fetch dr maggotty my dear ribby he is a pie himself he will certainly understand  ribby settled duchess in an armchair before the fire and went out and hurried to the village to look for the doctor  she found him at the smithy  he was occupied in putting rusty nails into a bottle of ink which he had obtained at the post office  gammon ha ha said he with his head on one side  ribby explained that her guest had swallowed a pattypan  spinach ha ha said he and accompanied her with alacrity  he hopped so fast that ribby had to run it was most conspicuous all the village could see that ribby was fetching the doctor   i knew they would overeat themselves said cousin tabitha twitchit  but while ribby had been hunting for the doctora curious thing had happened to duchess who had been left by herself sitting before the fire sighing and groaning and feeling very unhappy  how could i have swallowed it such a large thing as a pattypan  she got up and went to the table and felt inside the piedish again with a spoon   no there is no pattypan and i put one in and nobody has eaten pie except me so i must have swallowed it  she sat down again and stared mournfully at the grate the fire crackled and danced and something sizzzzled   duchess started she opened the door of the top ovenout came a rich steamy flavour of veal and ham and there stood a fine brown pieand through a hole in the top of the piecrust there was a glimpse of a little tin pattypan  duchess drew a long breath  then i must have been eating mouse    no wonder i feel ill    but perhaps i should feel worse if i had really swallowed a patty pan duchess reflectedwhat a very awkward thing to have to explain to ribby i think i will put my pie in the backyard and say nothing about it when i go home i will run round and take it away she put it outside the backdoor and sat down again by the fire and shut her eyes when ribby arrived with the doctor she seemed fast asleep   gammon ha ha said the doctor  i am feeling very much better said duchess waking up with a jump  i am truly glad to hear it he has brought you a pill my dear duchess  i think i should feel quite well if he only felt my pulse said duchess backing away from the magpie who sidled up with something in his beak  it is only a bread pill you had much better take it drink a little milk my dear duchess  gammon gammon said the doctor while duchess coughed and choked  dont say that again said ribby losing her temperhere take this bread and jam and get out into the yard  gammon and spinach ha ha ha shouted dr maggotty triumphantly outside the back door   i am feeling very much better my dear ribby said duchess do you not think that i had better go home before it gets dark  perhaps it might be wise my dear duchess i will lend you a nice warm shawl and you shall take my arm  i would not trouble you for worlds i feel wonderfully better one pill of dr maggotty  indeed it is most admirable if it has cured you of a pattypan i will call directly after breakfast to ask how you have slept   ribby and duchess said good bye affectionately and duchess started home halfway up the lane she stopped and looked back ribby had gone in and shut her door duchess slipped through the fence and ran round to the back of ribbys house and peeped into the yard  upon the roof of the pigstye sat dr maggotty and three jackdaws the jackdaws were eating pie crust and the magpie was drinking gravy out of a pattypan  gammon ha ha he shouted when he saw duchesss little black nose peeping round the corner   duchess ran home feeling uncommonly silly  when ribby came out for a pailful of water to wash up the tea things she found a pink and white piedish lying smashed in the middle of the yard the pattypan was under the pump where dr maggotty had considerately left it  ribby stared with amazement did you ever see the like so there really was a pattypan     but my pattypans are all in the kitchen cupboard well i never did     next time i want to give a party i will invite cousin tabitha twitchit    the end      the tale of jemima puddleduck a farmyard tale for ralph and betsy    what a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen listen to the story of jemima puddleduck who was annoyed because the farmers wife would not let her hatch her own eggs  her sisterinlaw mrs rebeccah puddleduck was perfectly willing to leave the hatching to some one else i have not the patience to sit on a nest for twentyeight days and no more have you jemima you would let them go cold you know you would  i wish to hatch my own eggs i will hatch them all by myself quacked jemima puddleduck  she tried to hide her eggs but they were always found and carried off  jemima puddleduck became quite desperate she determined to make a nest right away from the farm  she set off on a fine spring afternoon along the cart road that leads over the hill  she was wearing a shawl and a poke bonnet  when she reached the top of the hill she saw a wood in the distance  she thought that it looked a safe quiet spot  jemima puddleduck was not much in the habit of flying she ran downhill a few yards flapping her shawl and then she jumped off into the air  she flew beautifully when she had got a good start  she skimmed along over the treetops until she saw an open place in the middle of the wood where the trees and brushwood had been cleared  jemima alighted rather heavily and began to waddle about in search of a convenient dry nestingplace she rather fancied a treestump amongst some tall foxgloves  butseated upon the stump she was startled to find an elegantly dressed gentleman reading a newspaper  he had black prick ears and sandy coloured whiskers  quack said jemima puddleduck with her head and her bonnet on one side quack  the gentleman raised his eyes above his newspaper and looked curiously at jemima  madam have you lost your way said he he had a long bushy tail which he was sitting upon as the stump was somewhat damp  jemima thought him mighty civil and handsome she explained that she had not lost her way but that she was trying to find a convenient dry nestingplace  ah is that so indeed said the gentleman with sandy whiskers looking curiously at jemima he folded up the newspaper and put it in his coattail pocket  jemima complained of the superfluous hen  indeed how interesting i wish i could meet with that fowl i would teach it to mind its own business  but as to a nestthere is no difficulty i have a sackful of feathers in my wood shed no my dear madam you will be in nobodys way you may sit there as long as you like said the bushy long tailed gentleman  he led the way to a very retired dismallooking house amongst the foxgloves  it was built of faggots and turf and there were two broken pails one on top of another by way of a chimney  this is my summer residence you would not find my earthmy winter houseso convenient said the hospitable gentleman  there was a tumbledown shed at the back of the house made of old soapboxes the gentleman opened the door and showed jemima in  the shed was almost quite full of feathersit was almost suffocating but it was comfortable and very soft  jemima puddleduck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of feathers but it was very comfortable and she made a nest without any trouble at all  when she came out the sandy whiskered gentleman was sitting on a log reading the newspaperat least he had it spread out but he was looking over the top of it  he was so polite that he seemed almost sorry to let jemima go home for the night he promised to take great care of her nest until she came back again next day  he said he loved eggs and ducklings he should be proud to see a fine nestful in his woodshed  jemima puddleduck came every afternoon she laid nine eggs in the nest they were greeny white and very large the foxy gentleman admired them immensely he used to turn them over and count them when jemima was not there  at last jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit next dayand i will bring a bag of corn with me so that i need never leave my nest until the eggs are hatched they might catch cold said the conscientious jemima  madam i beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag i will provide oats but before you commence your tedious sitting i intend to give you a treat let us have a dinnerparty all to ourselves  may i ask you to bring up some herbs from the farm garden to make a savoury omelette sage and thyme and mint and two onions and some parsley i will provide lard for the stufflard for the omelette said the hospitable gentleman with sandy whiskers  jemima puddleduck was a simpleton not even the mention of sage and onions made her suspicious  she went round the farm garden nibbling off snippets of all the different sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck  and she waddled into the kitchen and got two onions out of a basket  the colliedog kep met her coming out what are you doing with those onions where do you go every afternoon by yourself jemima puddleduck  jemima was rather in awe of the collie she told him the whole story  the collie listened with his wise head on one side he grinned when she described the polite gentleman with sandy whiskers  he asked several questions about the wood and about the exact position of the house and shed  then he went out and trotted down the village he went to look for two foxhound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher  jemima puddleduck went up the cartroad for the last time on a sunny afternoon she was rather burdened with bunches of herbs and two onions in a bag  she flew over the wood and alighted opposite the house of the bushy longtailed gentleman  he was sitting on a log he sniffed the air and kept glancing uneasily round the wood when jemima alighted he quite jumped  come into the house as soon as you have looked at your eggs give me the herbs for the omelette be sharp  he was rather abrupt jemima puddleduck had never heard him speak like that  she felt surprised and uncomfortable  while she was inside she heard pattering feet round the back of the shed some one with a black nose sniffed at the bottom of the door and then locked it  jemima became much alarmed  a moment afterwards there were most awful noisesbarking baying growls and howls squealing and groans  and nothing more was ever seen of that foxywhiskered gentleman  presently kep opened the door of the shed and let out jemima puddleduck  unfortunately the puppies rushed in and gobbled up all the eggs before he could stop them  he had a bite on his ear and both the puppies were limping  jemima puddleduck was escorted home in tears on account of those eggs  she laid some more in june and she was permitted to keep them herself but only four of them hatched  jemima puddleduck said that it was because of her nerves but she had always been a bad sitter   the end      the tale of pigling bland   for cecily and charlie a tale of the christmas pig   the tale of pigling bland  once upon a time there was an old pig called aunt pettitoes she had eight of a family four little girl pigs called crosspatch sucksuck yockyock and spot  and four little boy pigs called alexander pigling bland chin chin and stumpy stumpy had had an accident to his tail  the eight little pigs had very fine appetites yus yus yus they eat and indeed they do eat said aunt pettitoes looking at her family with pride suddenly there were fearful squeals alexander had squeezed inside the hoops of the pig trough and stuck  aunt pettitoes and i dragged him out by the hind legs   chinchin was already in disgrace it was washing day and he had eaten a piece of soap and presently in a basket of clean clothes we found another dirty little pig tchut tut tut whichever is this grunted aunt pettitoes  now all the pig family are pink or pink with black spots but this pig child was smutty black all over when it had been popped into a tub it proved to be yockyock   i went into the garden there i found crosspatch and sucksuck rooting up carrots i whipped them myself and led them out by the ears crosspatch tried to bite me   aunt pettitoes aunt pettitoes you are a worthy person but your family is not well brought up every one of them has been in mischief except spot and pigling bland  yus yus sighed aunt pettitoes and they drink bucketfuls of milk i shall have to get another cow good little spot shall stay at home to do the housework but the others must go four little boy pigs and four little girl pigs are too many altogether yus yus yus said aunt pettitoes there will be more to eat without them   so chinchin and sucksuck went away in a wheelbarrow and stumpy yockyock and cross patch rode away in a cart  and the other two little boy pigs pigling bland and alexander went to market we brushed their coats we curled their tails and washed their little faces and wished them goodbye in the yard  aunt pettitoes wiped her eyes with a large pocket handkerchief then she wiped pigling blands nose and shed tears then she wiped alexanders nose and shed tears then she passed the handkerchief to spot aunt pettitoes sighed and grunted and addressed those little pigs as follows  now pigling bland son pigling bland you must go to market take your brother alexander by the hand mind your sunday clothes and remember to blow your nose  aunt pettitoes passed round the handkerchief againbeware of traps hen roosts bacon and eggs always walk upon your hind legs pigling bland who was a sedate little pig looked solemnly at his mother a tear trickled down his cheek  aunt pettitoes turned to the othernow son alexander take the handwee wee wee giggled alexandertake the hand of your brother pigling bland you must go to market mind wee wee wee interrupted alexander again you put me out said aunt pettitoes  observe signposts and milestones do not gobble herring bones and remember said i impressively if you once cross the county boundary you cannot come back  alexander you are not attending here are two licences permitting two pigs to go to market in lancashire attend alexander i have had no end of trouble in getting these papers from the policeman  pigling bland listened gravely alexander was hopelessly volatile  i pinned the papers for safety inside their waistcoat pockets  aunt pettitoes gave to each a little bundle and eight conversation peppermints with appropriate moral sentiments in screws of paper then they started   pigling bland and alexander trotted along steadily for a mile at least pigling bland did alexander made the road half as long again by skipping from side to side he danced about and pinched his brother singing            this pig went to market this pig                stayed at home           this pig had a bit of meat  lets see what they have given us for dinner pigling  pigling bland and alexander sat down and untied their bundles alexander gobbled up his dinner in no time he had already eaten all his own peppermints give me one of yours please pigling   but i wish to preserve them for emergencies said pigling bland doubtfully alexander went into squeals of laughter then he pricked pigling with the pin that had fastened his pig paper and when pigling slapped him he dropped the pin and tried to take piglings pin and the papers got mixed up pigling bland reproved alexander  but presently they made it up again and trotted away together singing            tom tom the pipers son stole a pig                and away he ran           but all the tune that he could play                was over the hills and far away    whats that young sirs stole a pig where are your licences said the policeman they had nearly run against him round a corner pigling bland pulled out his paper alexander after fumbling handed over something scrumply   to 2 12 oz conversation sweeties at three farthingswhats this this aint a licence alexanders nose lengthened visibly he had lost it i had one indeed i had mr policeman  its not likely they let you start without i am passing the farm you may walk with me can i come back too inquired pigling bland i see no reason young sir your paper is all right pigling bland did not like going on alone and it was beginning to rain but it is unwise to argue with the police he gave his brother a peppermint and watched him out of sight   to conclude the adventures of alexanderthe policeman sauntered up to the house about tea time followed by a damp subdued little pig i disposed of alexander in the neighbourhood he did fairly well when he had settled down   pigling bland went on alone dejectedly he came to crossroads and a signpostto market town 5 miles over the hills 4 miles to pettitoes farm 3 miles  pigling bland was shocked there was little hope of sleeping in market town and tomorrow was the hiring fair it was deplorable to think how much time had been wasted by the frivolity of alexander  he glanced wistfully along the road towards the hills and then set off walking obediently the other way buttoning up his coat against the rain he had never wanted to go and the idea of standing all by himself in a crowded market to be stared at pushed and hired by some big strange farmer was very disagreeable  i wish i could have a little garden and grow potatoes said pigling bland   he put his cold hand in his pocket and felt his paper he put his other hand in his other pocket and felt another paperalexanders pigling squealed then ran back frantically hoping to overtake alexander and the policeman   he took a wrong turnseveral wrong turns and was quite lost  it grew dark the wind whistled the trees creaked and groaned  pigling bland became frightened and cried wee wee wee i cant find my way home  after an hours wandering he got out of the wood the moon shone through the clouds and pigling bland saw a country that was new to him  the road crossed a moor below was a wide valley with a river twinkling in the moonlight and beyond in misty distance lay the hills   he saw a small wooden hut made his way to it and crept insidei am afraid it is a hen house but what can i do said pigling bland wet and cold and quite tired out   bacon and eggs bacon and eggs clucked a hen on a perch  trap trap trap cackle cackle cackle scolded the disturbed cockerel to market to market jiggetty jig clucked a broody white hen roosting next to him pigling bland much alarmed determined to leave at daybreak in the meantime he and the hens fell asleep  in less than an hour they were all awakened the owner mr peter thomas piperson came with a lantern and a hamper to catch six fowls to take to market in the morning   he grabbed the white hen roosting next to the cock then his eye fell upon pigling bland squeezed up in a corner he made a singular remarkhallo heres anotherseized pigling by the scruff of the neck and dropped him into the hamper then he dropped in five more dirty kicking cackling hens upon the top of pigling bland  the hamper containing six fowls and a young pig was no light weight it was taken down hill unsteadily with jerks pigling although nearly scratched to pieces contrived to hide the papers and peppermints inside his clothes   at last the hamper was bumped down upon a kitchen floor the lid was opened and pigling was lifted out he looked up blinking and saw an offensively ugly elderly man grinning from ear to ear   this ones come of himself whatever said mr piperson turning piglings pockets inside out he pushed the hamper into a corner threw a sack over it to keep the hens quiet put a pot on the fire and unlaced his boots  pigling bland drew forward a coppy stool and sat on the edge of it shyly warming his hands mr piperson pulled off a boot and threw it against the wainscot at the further end of the kitchen there was a smothered noise shut up said mr piperson pigling bland warmed his hands and eyed him   mr piperson pulled off the other boot and flung it after the first there was again a curious noise be quiet will ye said mr piperson pigling bland sat on the very edge of the coppy stool   mr piperson fetched meal from a chest and made porridge it seemed to pigling that something at the further end of the kitchen was taking a suppressed interest in the cooking but he was too hungry to be troubled by noises   mr piperson poured out three platefuls for himself for pigling and a thirdafter glaring at pigling he put away with much scuffling and locked up pigling bland ate his supper discreetly  after supper mr piperson consulted an almanac and felt piglings ribs it was too late in the season for curing bacon and he grudged his meal besides the hens had seen this pig  he looked at the small remains of a flitch and then looked undecidedly at pigling you may sleep on the rug said mr peter thomas piperson   pigling bland slept like a top in the morning mr piperson made more porridge the weather was warmer he looked to see how much meal was left in the chest and seemed dissatisfiedyoull likely be moving on again said he to pigling bland  before pigling could reply a neighbour who was giving mr piperson and the hens a lift whistled from the gate mr piperson hurried out with the hamper enjoining pigling to shut the door behind him and not meddle with nought or ill come back and skin ye said mr piperson   it crossed piglings mind that if he had asked for a lift too he might still have been in time for market  but he distrusted peter thomas   after finishing breakfast at his leisure pigling had a look round the cottage everything was locked up he found some potato peelings in a bucket in the back kitchen pigling ate the peel and washed up the porridge plates in the bucket he sang while he worked            tom with his pipe made such a noise                he called up all the girls and boys           and they all ran to hear him play                over the hills and far away   suddenly a little smothered voice chimed in            over the hills and a great way off                the wind shall blow my top knot off   pigling bland put down a plate which he was wiping and listened   after a long pause pigling went on tiptoe and peeped round the door into the front kitchen there was nobody there   after another pause pigling approached the door of the locked cupboard and snuffed at the key hole it was quite quiet  after another long pause pigling pushed a peppermint under the door it was sucked in immediately   in the course of the day pigling pushed in all the remaining six peppermints  when mr piperson returned he found pigling sitting before the fire he had brushed up the hearth and put on the pot to boil the meal was not getatable  mr piperson was very affable he slapped pigling on the back made lots of porridge and forgot to lock the meal chest he did lock the cupboard door but without properly shutting it he went to bed early and told pigling upon no account to disturb him next day before twelve oclock  pigling bland sat by the fire eating his supper  all at once at his elbow a little voice spokemy name is pig wig make me more porridge please pigling bland jumped and looked round   a perfectly lovely little black berkshire pig stood smiling beside him she had twinkly little screwed up eyes a double chin and a short turned up nose  she pointed at piglings plate he hastily gave it to her and fled to the meal chest how did you come here asked pigling bland  stolen replied pigwig with her mouth full pigling helped himself to meal without scruple what for bacon hams replied pigwig cheerfully why on earth dont you run away exclaimed the horrified pigling  i shall after supper said pig wig decidedly  pigling bland made more porridge and watched her shyly  she finished a second plate got up and looked about her as though she were going to start   you cant go in the dark said pigling bland  pigwig looked anxious  do you know your way by daylight  i know we can see this little white house from the hills across the river which way are you going mr pig  to marketi have two pig papers i might take you to the bridge if you have no objection said pigling much confused and sitting on the edge of his coppy stool pigwigs gratitude was such and she asked so many questions that it became embarrassing to pigling bland   he was obliged to shut his eyes and pretend to sleep she became quiet and there was a smell of peppermint  i thought you had eaten them said pigling waking suddenly  only the corners replied pig wig studying the sentiments with much interest by the firelight  i wish you wouldnt he might smell them through the ceiling said the alarmed pigling  pigwig put back the sticky peppermints into her pocket sing something she demanded  i am sorry    i have tooth ache said pigling much dismayed  then i will sing replied pigwig you will not mind if i say iddy tidditty i have forgotten some of the words  pigling bland made no objection he sat with his eyes half shut and watched her   she wagged her head and rocked about clapping time and singing in a sweet little grunty voice            a funny old mother pig lived in a                stye and three little piggies had she           ti idditty idditty umph umph                umph and the little pigs said wee wee    she sang successfully through three or four verses only at every verse her head nodded a little lower and her little twinkly eyes closed up            those three little piggies grew peaky                and lean and lean they might very                well be           for somehow they couldnt say umph                umph umph and they wouldnt                say wee wee wee           for somehow they couldnt say   pigwigs head bobbed lower and lower until she rolled over a little round ball fast asleep on the hearthrug  pigling bland on tiptoe covered her up with an antimacassar   he was afraid to go to sleep himself for the rest of the night he sat listening to the chirping of the crickets and to the snores of mr piperson overhead   early in the morning between dark and daylight pigling tied up his little bundle and woke up pig wig she was excited and half frightened but its dark how can we find our way  the cock has crowed we must start before the hens come out they might shout to mr piperson  pigwig sat down again and commenced to cry  come away pigwig we can see when we get used to it come i can hear them clucking  pigling had never said shuh to a hen in his life being peaceable also he remembered the hamper   he opened the house door quietly and shut it after them there was no garden the neighbourhood of mr pipersons was all scratched up by fowls they slipped away hand in hand across an untidy field to the road   the sun rose while they were crossing the moor a dazzle of light over the tops of the hills the sunshine crept down the slopes into the peaceful green valleys where little white cottages nestled in gardens and orchards   thats westmorland said pigwig she dropped piglings hand and commenced to dance singing            tom tom the pipers son stole a pig                and away he ran       but all the tune that he could play                was over the hills and far away   come pigwig we must get to the bridge before folks are stirring why do you want to go to market pigling inquired pigwig presently i dont want i want to grow potatoes have a peppermint said pigwig pigling bland refused quite crossly does your poor toothy hurt inquired pigwig pigling bland grunted   pigwig ate the peppermint herself and followed the opposite side of the road pigwig keep under the wall theres a man ploughing pigwig crossed over they hurried down hill towards the county boundary   suddenly pigling stopped he heard wheels  slowly jogging up the road below them came a tradesmans cart the reins flapped on the horses back the grocer was reading a newspaper   take that peppermint out of your mouth pigwig we may have to run dont say one word leave it to me and in sight of the bridge said poor pigling nearly crying he began to walk frightfully lame holding pigwigs arm   the grocer intent upon his news paper might have passed them if his horse had not shied and snorted he pulled the cart crossways and held down his whip hallo where are you going topigling bland stared at him vacantly   are you deaf are you going to market pigling nodded slowly  i thought as much it was yesterday show me your licence  pigling stared at the off hind shoe of the grocers horse which had picked up a stone  the grocer flicked his whip papers pig licence pigling fumbled in all his pockets and handed up the papers the grocer read them but still seemed dissatisfied this here pig is a young lady is her name alexander pigwig opened her mouth and shut it again pigling coughed asthmatically   the grocer ran his finger down the advertisement column of his newspaperlost stolen or strayed 10s reward he looked suspiciously at pigwig then he stood up in the trap and whistled for the ploughman   you wait here while i drive on and speak to him said the grocer gathering up the reins he knew that pigs are slippery but surely such a very lame pig could never run   not yet pigwig he will look back the grocer did so he saw the two pigs stockstill in the middle of the road then he looked over at his horses heels it was lame also the stone took some time to knock out after he got to the ploughman  now pigwig now said pigling bland  never did any pigs run as these pigs ran they raced and squealed and pelted down the long white hill towards the bridge little fat pig wigs petticoats fluttered and her feet went pitter patter pitter as she bounded and jumped   they ran and they ran and they ran down the hill and across a short cut on level green turf at the bottom between pebble beds and rushes  they came to the river they came to the bridgethey crossed it hand in hand then over the hills and far away she danced with pigling bland   the end      the tale of two bad mice   for w m l w the little girl who had the doll house    once upon a time there was a very beautiful dolls house it was red brick with white windows and it had real muslin curtains and a front door and a chimney  it belonged to two dolls called lucinda and jane at least it belonged to lucinda but she never ordered meals  jane was the cook but she never did any cooking because the dinner had been bought readymade in a box full of shavings  there were two red lobsters and a ham a fish a pudding and some pears and oranges  they would not come off the plates but they were extremely beautiful  one morning lucinda and jane had gone out for a drive in the dolls perambulator there was no one in the nursery and it was very quiet presently there was a little scuffling scratching noise in a corner near the fireplace where there was a hole under the skirtingboard  tom thumb put out his head for a moment and then popped it in again  tom thumb was a mouse  a minute afterwards hunca munca his wife put her head out too and when she saw that there was no one in the nursery she ventured out on the oilcloth under the coalbox  the dolls house stood at the other side of the fireplace tom thumb and hunca munca went cautiously across the hearthrug they pushed the front doorit was not fast  tom thumb and hunca munca went upstairs and peeped into the dining room then they squeaked with joy  such a lovely dinner was laid out upon the table there were tin spoons and lead knives and forks and two dollychairs all so convenient  tom thumb set to work at once to carve the ham it was a beautiful shiny yellow streaked with red  the knife crumpled up and hurt him he put his finger in his mouth  it is not boiled enough it is hard you have a try hunca munca  hunca munca stood up in her chair and chopped at the ham with another lead knife  its as hard as the hams at the cheesemongers said hunca munca  the ham broke off the plate with a jerk and rolled under the table  let it alone said tom thumb give me some fish hunca munca  hunca munca tried every tin spoon in turn the fish was glued to the dish  then tom thumb lost his temper he put the ham in the middle of the floor and hit it with the tongs and with the shovelbang bang smash smash  the ham flew all into pieces for underneath the shiny paint it was made of nothing but plaster  then there was no end to the rage and disappointment of tom thumb and hunca munca they broke up the pudding the lobsters the pears and the oranges  as the fish would not come off the plate they put it into the redhot crinkly paper fire in the kitchen but it would not burn either  tom thumb went up the kitchen chimney and looked out at the topthere was no soot  while tom thumb was up the chimney hunca munca had another disappointment she found some tiny canisters upon the dresser labeled rice coffee sago but when she turned them upside down there was nothing inside except red and blue beads  then those mice set to work to do all the mischief they couldespecially tom thumb he took janes clothes out of the chest of drawers in her bedroom and he threw them out of the top floor window  but hunca munca had a frugal mind after pulling half the feathers out of lucindas bolster she remembered that she herself was in want of a featherbed  with tom thumbs assistance she carried the bolster downstairs and across the hearthrug it was difficult to squeeze the bolster into the mousehole but they managed it somehow  then hunca munca went back and fetched a chair a bookcase a birdcage and several small odds and ends the bookcase and the birdcage refused to go into the mousehole  hunca munca left them behind the coal box and went to fetch a cradle  hunca munca was just returning with another chair when suddenly there was a noise of talking outside upon the landing the mice rushed back to their hole and the dolls came into the nursery  what a sight met the eyes of jane and lucinda  lucinda sat upon the upset kitchen stove and stared and jane leaned against the kitchen dresser and smiled but neither of them made any remark  the bookcase and the bird cage were rescued from under the coalbox but hunca munca has got the cradle and some of lucindas clothes  she also has some useful pots and pans and several other things  the little girl that the dolls house belonged to said i will get a doll dressed like a policeman  but the nurse said i will set a mousetrap  so that is the story of the two bad mice but they were not so very very naughty after all because tom thumb paid for everything he broke  he found a crooked sixpence under the hearthrug and upon christmas eve he and hunca munca stuffed it into one of the stockings of lucinda and jane  and very early every morning before anybody is awakehunca munca comes with her dustpan and her broom to sweep the dollies house   the end
