91752785	a protegee of jack hamlins  by bret harte     contents   a protegee of jack hamlins  an ingenue of the sierras  the reformation of james reddy  the heir of the mchulishes  an episode of west woodlands  the homecoming of jim wilkes     a protegee of jack hamlins   i  the steamer silveropolis was sharply and steadily cleaving the broad placid shallows of the sacramento river a large wave like an eagre diverging from its bow was extending to either bank swamping the tules and threatening to submerge the lower levees the great boat itselfa vast but delicate structure of airy stories hanging galleries fragile colonnades gilded cornices and resplendent frescoeswas throbbing throughout its whole perilous length with the pulse of high pressure and the strong monotonous beat of a powerful piston floods of foam pouring from the high paddleboxes on either side and reuniting in the wake of the boat left behind a track of dazzling whiteness over which trailed two dense black banners flung from its lofty smokestacks  mr jack hamlin had quietly emerged from his stateroom on deck and was looking over the guards his hands were resting lightly on his hips over the delicate curves of his white waistcoat and he was whistling softly possibly some air to which he had made certain cardplaying passengers dance the night before he was in comfortable case and his soft brown eyes under their long lashes were veiled with gentle tolerance of all things he glanced lazily along the empty hurricane deck forward he glanced lazily down to the saloon deck below him far out against the guards below him leaned a young girl mr hamlin knitted his brows slightly  he remembered her at once she had come on board that morning with one ned stratton a brother gambler but neither a favorite nor intimate of jacks from certain indications in the pair jack had inferred that she was some foolish or reckless creature whom ed had got on a string and was spiriting away from her friends and family with the abstract morality of this situation jack was not in the least concerned for himself he did not indulge in that sort of game the inexperience and vacillations of innocence were apt to be bothersome and besides a certain modest doubt of his own competency to make an original selection had always made him prefer to confine his gallantries to the wives of men of greater judgment than himself who had but it suddenly occurred to him that he had seen stratton quickly slip off the boat at the last landing stage ah that was it he had cast away and deserted her it was an old story jack smiled but he was not greatly amused with stratton  she was very pale and seemed to be clinging to the network railing as if to support herself although she was gazing fixedly at the yellow glancing current below which seemed to be sucked down and swallowed in the paddlebox as the boat swept on it certainly was a fascinating sightthis sloping rapid hurrying on to bury itself under the crushing wheels for a brief moment jack saw how they would seize anything floating on that ghastly incline whirl it round in one awful revolution of the beating paddles and then bury it broken and shattered out of all recognition deep in the muddy undercurrent of the stream behind them  she moved away presently with an odd stiff step chafing her gloved hands together as if they had become stiffened too in her rigid grasp of the railing jack leisurely watched her as she moved along the narrow strip of deck she was not at all to his tastea rather plump girl with a rustic manner and a great deal of brown hair under her straw hat she might have looked better had she not been so haggard when she reached the door of the saloon she paused and then turning suddenly began to walk quickly back again as she neared the spot where she had been standing her pace slackened and when she reached the railing she seemed to relapse against it in her former helpless fashion jack became lazily interested suddenly she lifted her head and cast a quick glance around and above her in that momentary lifting of her face jack saw her expression whatever it was his own changed instantly the next moment there was a crash on the lower deck it was jack who had swung himself over the rail and dropped ten feet to her side but not before she had placed one foot in the meshes of the netting and had gripped the railing for a spring  the noise of jacks fall might have seemed to her bewildered fancy as a part of her frantic act for she fell forward vacantly on the railing but by this time jack had grasped her arm as if to help himself to his feet  i might have killed myself by that foolin mightnt i he said cheerfully  the sound of a voice so near her seemed to recall to her dazed sense the uncompleted action his fall had arrested she made a convulsive bound towards the railing but jack held her fast  dont he said in a low voice dont it wont pay its the sickest game that ever was played by man or woman come here  he drew her towards an empty stateroom whose door was swinging on its hinges a few feet from them she was trembling violently he half led half pushed her into the room closed the door and stood with his back against it as she dropped into a chair she looked at him vacantly the agitation she was undergoing inwardly had left her no sense of outward perception  you know stratton would be awfully riled continued jack easily hes just stepped out to see a friend and got left by the fool boat hell be along by the next steamer and youre bound to meet him in sacramento  her staring eyes seemed suddenly to grasp his meaning but to his surprise she burst out with a certain hysterical desperation no no never never again let me pass i must go and struggled to regain the door jack albeit singularly relieved to know that she shared his private sentiments regarding stratton nevertheless resisted her whereat she suddenly turned white reeled back and sank in a dead faint in the chair  the gambler turned drew the key from the inside of the door passed out locking it behind him and walked leisurely into the main saloon mrs johnson he said gravely addressing the stewardess a tall mulatto with his usual winsome supremacy over dependents and children youll oblige me if youll corral a few smelling salts vinaigrettes hairpins and violet powder and unload them in deck stateroom no 257 theres a lady  a lady marse hamlin interrupted the mulatto with an archly significant flash of her white teeth  a lady continued jack with unabashed gravity in a sort of conniption fit a relative of mine in fact a niece my only sisters child hadnt seen each other for ten years and it was too much for her  the woman glanced at him with a mingling of incredulous belief but delighted obedience hurriedly gathered a few articles from her cabin and followed him to no 257 the young girl was still unconscious the stewardess applied a few restoratives with the skill of long experience and the young girl opened her eyes they turned vacantly from the stewardess to jack with a look of half recognition and half frightened inquiry yes said jack addressing the eyes although ostentatiously speaking to mrs johnson shed only just come by steamer to frisco and wasnt expecting to see me and we dropped right into each other here on the boat and i havent seen her since she was so high sister mary ought to have warned me by letter but she was always a slouch at letter writing there thatll do mrs johnson shes coming round i reckon i can manage the rest but you go now and tell the purser i want one of those inside staterooms for my niecemy niece you hearso that you can be near her and look after her  as the stewardess turned obediently away the young girl attempted to rise but jack checked her no he said almost brusquely you and i have some talking to do before she gets back and weve no time for foolin you heard what i told her just now well its got to be as i said you sabe as long as youre on this boat youre my niece and my sister marys child as i havent got any sister mary you dont run any risk of falling foul of her and you aint taking any ones place that settles that now do you or do you not want to see that man again say yes and if hes anywhere above ground ill yank him over to you as soon as we touch shore he had no idea of interfering with his colleagues amours but he had determined to make stratton pay for the bother their slovenly sequence had caused him yet he was relieved and astonished by her frantic gesture of indignation and abhorrence no he repeated grimly well that settles that now look here quick before she comesdo you want to go back home to your friends  but here occurred what he had dreaded most and probably thought he had escaped she had stared at him at the stewardess at the walls with abstracted vacant and bewildered but always undimmed and unmoistened eyes a sudden convulsion shook her whole frame her blank expression broke like a shattered mirror she threw her hands over her eyes and fell forward with her face to the back of her chair in an outburst of tears  alas for jack with the breaking up of those sealed fountains came her speech also at first disconnected and incoherent and then despairing and passionate no she had no longer friends or home she had lost and disgraced them she had disgraced herself there was no home for her but the grave why had jack snatched her from it then bit by bit she yielded up her storya story decidedly commonplace to jack uninteresting and even irritating to his fastidiousness she was a schoolgirl not even a convent girl but the inmate of a presbyterian female academy at napa jack shuddered as he remembered to have once seen certain of the pupils walking with a teacher and she lived with her married sister she had seen stratton while going to and fro on the san francisco boat she had exchanged notes with him had met him secretly and finally consented to elope with him to sacramento only to discover when the boat had left the wharf the real nature of his intentions jack listened with infinite weariness and inward chafing he had read all this before in cheap novelettes in the police reports in the sunday papers he had heard a street preacher declaim against it and warn young women of the serpentlike wiles of tempters of the stratton variety but even now jack failed to recognize stratton as a serpent or indeed anything but a blundering cheat and clown who had left his dirty prentice work on his jacks hands but the girl was helpless and it seemed homeless all through a certain desperation of feeling which in spite of her tears he could not but respect that momentary shadow of death had exalted her he stroked his mustache pulled down his white waistcoat and her cry without saying anything he did not know that this most objectionable phase of her misery was her salvation and his own  but the stewardess would return in a moment youd better tell me what to call you he said quietly i ought to know my nieces first name  the girl caught her breath and between two sobs said sophonisba  jack winced it seemed only to need this last sentimental touch to complete the idiotic situation ill call you sophy he said hurriedly and with an effort  and now look here you are going in that cabin with mrs johnson where she can look after you but i cant so ill have to take your word for im not going to give you away before mrs johnson that you wont try that foolishnessyou know what i meanbefore i see you again can i trust you  with her head still bowed over the chair back she murmured slowly somewhere from under her disheveled hair  yes  honest injin adjured jack gravely  yes  the shuffling step of the stewardess was heard slowly approaching yes continued jack abruptly lightly lifting his voice as mrs johnson opened the dooryes if youd only had some of those spearmint drops of your aunt rachels that she always gave you when these fits came on youd have been all right inside of five minutes aunty was no slouch of a doctor was she dear me it only seems yesterday since i saw her you were just playing round her knee like a kitten on the back porch how time does fly but heres mrs johnson coming to take you in now rouse up sophy and just hook yourself on to mrs johnson on that side and well toddle along  the young girl put back her heavy hair and with her face still averted submitted to be helped to her feet by the kindly stewardess perhaps something homely sympathetic and nurselike in the touch of the mulatto gave her assurance and confidence for her head lapsed quite naturally against the womans shoulder and her face was partly hidden as she moved slowly along the deck jack accompanied them to the saloon and the inner stateroom door a few passengers gathered curiously near as much attracted by the unusual presence of jack hamlin in such a procession as by the girl herself youll look after her specially mrs johnson said jack in unusually deliberate terms shes been a good deal petted at home and my sister perhaps has rather spoilt her shes pretty much of a child still and youll have to humor her sophy he continued with ostentatious playfulness directing his voice into the dim recesses of the stateroom youll just think mrs johnsons your old nurse wont you think its old katy hey  to his great consternation the girl approached tremblingly from the inner shadow the faintest and saddest of smiles for a moment played around the corners of her drawn mouth and teardimmed eyes as she held out her hand and said  god bless you for being so kind  jack shuddered and glanced quickly round but luckily no one heard this crushing sentimentalism and the next moment the door closed upon her and mrs johnson  it was past midnight and the moon was riding high over the narrowing yellow river when jack again stepped out on deck he had just left the captains cabin and a small social game with the officers which had served to some extent to vaguely relieve his irritation and their pockets he had presumably quite forgotten the incident of the afternoon as he looked about him and complacently took in the quiet beauty of the night  the low banks on either side offered no break to the uninterrupted level of the landscape through which the river seemed to wind only as a race track for the rushing boat every fibre of her vast but fragile bulk quivered under the goad of her powerful engines there was no other movement but hers no other sound but this monstrous beat and panting the whole tranquil landscape seemed to breathe and pulsate with her dwellers in the tules miles away heard and felt her as she passed and it seemed to jack leaning over the railing as if the whole river swept like a sluice through her paddleboxes  jack had quite unconsciously lounged before that part of the railing where the young girl had leaned a few hours ago as he looked down upon the streaming yellow millrace below him he noticedwhat neither he nor the girl had probably noticed beforethat a space of the top bar of the railing was hinged and could be lifted by withdrawing a small bolt thus giving easy access to the guards he was still looking at it whistling softly when footsteps approached  jack said a lazy voice hows sister mary  its a long time since youve seen her only child jack aint it said a second voice and yet it sort o seems to me somehow that ive seen her before  jack recognized the voice of two of his late companions at the cardtable his whistling ceased so also dropped every trace of color and expression from his handsome face but he did not turn and remained quietly gazing at the water  aunt rachel too must be getting on in years jack continued the first speaker halting behind jack  and mrs johnson does not look so much like sophys old nurse as she used to remarked the second following his example still jack remained unmoved  you dont seem to be interested jack continued the first speaker what are you looking at  without turning his head the gambler replied looking at the boat shes booming along just chawing up and spitting out the river aint she look at that sweep of water going under her paddlewheels he continued unbolting the rail and lifting it to allow the two men to peer curiously over the guards as he pointed to the murderous incline beneath them a man wouldnt stand much show who got dropped into it how these paddles would just snatch him baldheaded pick him up and slosh him round and round and then sling him out down there in such a shape that his own father wouldnt know him  yes said the first speaker with an ostentatious little laugh but all that aint telling us how sister mary is  no said the gambler slipping into the opening with a white and rigid face in which nothing seemed living but the eyes no but its telling you how two dd fools who didnt know when to shut their mouths might get them shut once and forever its telling you what might happen to two men who tried to play a man who didnt care to be playeda man who didnt care much what he did when he did it or how he did it but would do what hed set out to doeven if in doing it he went to hell with the men he sent there  he had stepped out on the guards beside the two men closing the rail behind him he had placed his hands on their shoulders they had both gripped his arms yet viewed from the deck above they seemed at that moment an amicable even fraternal group albeit the faces of the three were dead white in the moonlight  i dont think im so very much interested in sister mary said the first speaker quietly after a pause  and i dont seem to think so much of aunt rachel as i did said his companion  i thought you wouldnt said jack coolly reopening the rail and stepping back again it all depends upon the way you look at those things goodnight  goodnight  the three men paused shook each others hands silently and separated jack sauntering slowly back to his stateroom   ii   the educational establishment of mrs mix and madame bance situated in the best quarter of sacramento and patronized by the highest state officials and members of the clergy was a pretty if not an imposing edifice although surrounded by a high white picket fence and entered through a heavily boarded gate its balconies festooned with jasmine and roses and its spotlessly draped windows as often graced with fresh flowerlike faces were still plainly and provokingly visible above the ostentatious spikes of the pickets nevertheless mr jack hamlin who had six months before placed his niece miss sophonisba brown under its protecting care felt a degree of uneasiness even bordering on timidity which was new to that usually selfconfident man remembering how his first appearance had fluttered this dovecote and awakened a severe suspicion in the minds of the two principals he had discarded his usual fashionable attire and elegantly fitting garments for a rough homespun suit supposed to represent a homely agriculturist but which had the effect of transforming him into an adorable strephon infinitely more dangerous in his rustic shepherdlike simplicity he had also shaved off his silken mustache for the same prudential reasons but had only succeeded in uncovering the delicate lines of his handsome mouth and so absurdly reducing his apparent years that his avuncular pretensions seemed more preposterous than ever and when he had rung the bell and was admitted by a severe irish waitingmaid his momentary hesitation and half humorous diffidence had such an unexpected effect upon her that it seemed doubtful if he would be allowed to pass beyond the vestibule shure miss she said in a whisper to an under teacher theres wan at the dhure who calls himself mister hamlin but av it is not a young lady maskeradin in her brothers clothes oim very much mistaken and av its a boy one of the pupils brothers shure ye might put a dhress on him when you take the others out for a walk and hed pass for the beauty of the whole school  meantime the unconscious subject of this criticism was pacing somewhat uneasily up and down the formal reception room into which he had been finally ushered its farther end was filled by an enormous parlor organ a number of music books and a cheerfully variegated globe a large presentation bible an equally massive illustrated volume on the holy land a few landscapes in cold bluish milk and water colors and rigid heads in crayonsthe work of pupilswere presumably ornamental an imposing mahogany sofa and what seemed to be a disproportionate excess of chairs somewhat coldly furnished the room jack had reluctantly made up his mind that if sophy was accompanied by any one he would be obliged to kiss her to keep up his assumed relationship as she entered the room with miss mix jack advanced and soberly saluted her on the cheek but so positive and apparent was the gallantry of his presence and perhaps so suggestive of some pastoral flirtation that miss mix to jacks surprise winced perceptibly and became stony but he was still more surprised that the young lady herself shrank half uneasily from his lips and uttered a slight exclamation it was a new experience to mr hamlin  but this somewhat mollified miss mix and she slightly relaxed her austerity she was glad to be able to give the best accounts of miss brown not only as regarded her studies but as to her conduct and deportment really with the present freedom of manners and laxity of home discipline in california it was gratifying to meet a young lady who seemed to value the importance of a proper decorum and behavior especially towards the opposite sex mr hamlin although her guardian was perhaps too young to understand and appreciate this to this inexperience she must also attribute the indiscretion of his calling during school hours and without preliminary warning she trusted however that this informality could be overlooked after consultation with madame bance but in the mean time perhaps for half an hour she must withdraw miss brown and return with her to the class mr hamlin could wait in this public room reserved especially for visitors until they returned or if he cared to accompany one of the teachers in a formal inspection of the school she added doubtfully with a glance at jacks distracting attractions she would submit this also to madame bance  thank you thank you returned jack hurriedly as a depressing vision of the fifty or sixty scholars rose before his eyes but id rather not i mean you know id just as lief stay here alone i wouldnt have called anyway dont you see only i had a day offandandi wanted to talk with my niece on family matters he did not say that he had received a somewhat distressful letter from her asking him to come a new instinct made him cautious  considerably relieved by jacks unexpected abstention which seemed to spare her pupils the distraction of his graces miss mix smiled more amicably and retired with her charge in the single glance he had exchanged with sophy he saw that although resigned and apparently selfcontrolled she still appeared thoughtful and melancholy she had improved in appearance and seemed more refined and less rustic in her school dress but he was conscious of the same distinct separation of her personality which was uninteresting to him from the sentiment that had impelled him to visit her she was possibly still hankering after that fellow stratton in spite of her protestations to the contrary perhaps she wanted to go back to her sister although she had declared she would die first and had always refused to disclose her real name or give any clue by which he could have traced her relations she would cry of course he almost hoped that she would not return alone he half regretted he had come she still held him only by a single quality of her naturethe desperation she had shown on the boat that was something he understood and respected  he walked discontentedly to the window and looked out he walked discontentedly to the end of the room and stopped before the organ it was a fine instrument he could see that with an admiring and experienced eye he was alone in the room in fact quite alone in that part of the house which was separated from the classrooms he would disturb no one by trying it and if he did what then he smiled a little recklessly slowly pulled off his gloves and sat down before it  he played cautiously at first with the soft pedal down the instrument had never known a strong masculine hand before having been fumbled and friveled over by softly incompetent feminine fingers but presently it began to thrill under the passionate hand of its lover and carried away by his one innocent weakness jack was launched upon a sea of musical reminiscences scraps of church music puritan psalms of his boyhood dying strains from sad forgotten operas fragments of oratorios and symphonies but chiefly phases from old masses heard at the missions of san pedro and santa isabel swelled up from his loving and masterful fingers he had finished an agnus dei the formal room was pulsating with divine aspiration the rascals hands were resting listlessly on the keys his brown lashes lifted in an effort of memory tenderly towards the ceiling  suddenly a subdued murmur of applause and a slight rustle behind him recalled him to himself again he wheeled his chair quickly round the two principals of the school and half a dozen teachers were standing gravely behind him and at the open door a dozen curled and frizzled youthful heads peered in eagerly but half restrained by their teachers the relaxed features and apologetic attitude of madame bance and miss mix showed that mr hamlin had unconsciously achieved a triumph  he might not have been as pleased to know that his extraordinary performance had solved a difficulty effaced his other graces and enabled them to place him on the moral pedestal of a mere musician to whom these eccentricities were allowable and privileged he shared the admiration extended by the young ladies to their music teacher which was always understood to be a sexless enthusiasm and a contagious juvenile disorder it was also a fine advertisement for the organ madame bance smiled blandly improved the occasion by thanking mr hamlin for having given the scholars a gratuitous lesson on the capabilities of the instrument and was glad to be able to give miss brown a halfholiday to spend with her accomplished relative miss brown was even now upstairs putting on her hat and mantle jack was relieved sophy would not attempt to cry on the street  nevertheless when they reached it and the gate closed behind them he again became uneasy the girls clouded face and melancholy manner were not promising it also occurred to him that he might meet some one who knew him and thus compromise her this was to be avoided at all hazards he began with forced gayety  well now where shall we go  she slightly raised her teardimmed eyes where you pleasei dont care  there isnt any show going on here is there he had a vague idea of a circus or menageriehimself behind her in the shadow of the box  i dont know of any  or any restaurantor cake shop  theres a place where the girls go to get candy on main street some of them are there now  jack shuddered this was not to be thought of but where do you walk  up and down main street  where everybody can see you said jack scandalized  the girl nodded  they walked on in silence for a few moments then a bright idea struck mr hamlin he suddenly remembered that in one of his many fits of impulsive generosity and largesse he had given to an old negro retainerwhose wife had nursed him through a dangerous illnessa house and lot on the river bank he had been told that they had opened a small laundry or washhouse it occurred to him that a stroll there and a call upon uncle hannibal and aunt chloe combined the propriety and respectability due to the young person he was with and the requisite secrecy and absence of publicity due to himself he at once suggested it  you see she was a mighty good woman and you ought to know her for she was my old nurse  the girl glanced at him with a sudden impatience  honest injin said jack solemnly she did nurse me through my last cough i aint playing old family gags on you now  oh dear burst out the girl impulsively i do wish you wouldnt ever play them again i wish you wouldnt pretend to be my uncle i wish you wouldnt make me pass for your niece it isnt right its all wrong oh dont you know its all wrong and cant come right any way its just killing me i cant stand it id rather youd say what i am and how i came to you and how you pitied me  they had luckily entered a narrow side street and the sobs which shook the young girls frame were unnoticed for a few moments jack felt a horrible conviction stealing over him that in his present attitude towards her he was not unlike that hound stratton and that however innocent his own intent there was a sickening resemblance to the situation on the boat in the base advantage he had taken of her friendlessness he had never told her that he was a gambler like stratton and that his peculiarly infelix reputation among women made it impossible for him to assist her except by a stealth or the deception he had practiced without compromising her he who had for years faced the sneers and halffrightened opposition of the world dared not tell the truth to this girl from whom he expected nothing and who did not interest him he felt he was almost slinking at her side at last he said desperately  but i snatched them baldheaded at the organ sophy didnt i  oh yes said the girl you played beautifully and grandly it was so good of you too for i think somehow madame bance had been a little suspicious of you but that settled it everybody thought it was fine and some thought it was your profession perhaps she added timidly it is  i play a good deal i reckon said jack with a grim humor which did not however amuse him  i wish i could and make money by it said the girl eagerly jack winced but she did not notice it as she went on hurriedly thats what i wanted to talk to you about i want to leave the school and make my own living anywhere where people wont know me and where i can be alone and work i shall die here among these girlswith all their talk of their friends and theirsistersand their questions about you  tell em to dry up said jack indignantly take em to the cake shop and load em up with candy and ice cream thatll stop their mouths youve got money you got my last remittance didnt you he repeated quickly if you didnt hereshis hand was already in his pocket when she stopped him with a despairing gesture  yes yes i got it all i havent touched it i dont want it for i cant live on you dont you understandi want to work listeni can draw and paint madame bance says i do it well my drawingmaster says i might in time take portraits and get paid for it and even now i can retouch photographs and make colored miniatures from them and she stopped and glanced at jack halftimidly ivedone some already  a glow of surprised relief suffused the gambler not so much at this astonishing revelation as at the change it seemed to effect in her her pale blue eyes made paler by tears cleared and brightened under their swollen lids like wiped steel the lines of her depressed mouth straightened and became firm her voice had lost its hopeless monotone  theres a shop in the next streeta photographerswhere they have one of mine in their windows she went on reassured by jacks unaffected interest its only round the corner if you care to see  jack assented a few paces farther brought them to the corner of a narrow street where they presently turned into a broader thoroughfare and stopped before the window of a photographer sophy pointed to an oval frame containing a portrait painted on porcelain mr hamlin was startled inexperienced as he was a certain artistic inclination told him it was good although it is to be feared he would have been astonished even if it had been worse the mere fact that this headstrong country girl who had run away with a cur like stratton should be able to do anything else took him by surprise  i got ten dollars for that she said hesitatingly and i could have got more for a larger one but i had to do that in my room during recreation hours if i had more time and a place where i could workshe stopped timidly and looked tentatively at jack but he was already indulging in a characteristically reckless idea of coming back after he had left sophy buying the miniature at an extravagant price and ordering half a dozen more at extraordinary figures here however two passersby stopping ostensibly to look in the window but really attracted by the picturesque spectacle of the handsome young rustic and his schoolgirl companion gave jack such a fright that he hurried sophy away again into the side street theres nothing mean about that picture business he said cheerfully it looks like a square kind of game and relapsed into thoughtful silence  at which sophy the ice of restraint broken again burst into passionate appeal if she could only go away somewherewhere she saw no one but the people who would buy her work who knew nothing of her past nor cared to know who were her relations she would work hard she knew she could support herself in time she would keep the name he had given herit was not distinctive enough to challenge any inquirybut nothing more she need not assume to be his niece he would always be her kind friend to whom she owed everything even her miserable life she trusted still to his honor never to seek to know her real name nor ever to speak to her of that man if he ever met him it would do no good to her or to them it might drive her for she was not yet quite sure of herself to do that which she had promised him never to do again  there was no threat impatience or acting in her voice but he recognized the same dull desperation he had once heard in it and her eyes which a moment before were quick and mobile had become fixed and set he had no idea of trying to penetrate the foolish secret of her name and relations he had never had the slightest curiosity but it struck him now that stratton might at any time force it upon him the only way that he could prevent it was to let it be known that for unexpressed reasons he would shoot stratton on sight this would naturally restrict any verbal communication between them jacks ideas of morality were vague but his convictions on points of honor were singularly direct and positive   iii   meantime hamlin and sophy were passing the outskirts of the town the open lots and cleared spaces were giving way to grassy stretches willow copses and groups of cottonwood and sycamore and beyond the level of yellowing tules appeared the fringed and raised banks of the river half tropical looking cottages with deep verandasthe homes of early southern pioneerstook the place of incomplete blocks of modern houses monotonously alike in these sylvan surroundings mr hamlins picturesque rusticity looked less incongruous and more arcadian the young girl had lost some of her restraint with her confidences and lounging together side by side without the least consciousness of any sentiment in their words or actions they nevertheless contrived to impress the spectator with the idea that they were a charming pair of pastoral lovers so strong was this impression that as they approached aunt chloes laundry a pretty rosecovered cottage with an enormous whitewashed barnlike extension in the rear the black proprietress herself standing at the door called her husband to come and look at them and flashed her white teeth in such unqualified commendation and patronage that mr hamlin withdrawing himself from sophys side instantly charged down upon them  if you dont slide the lid back over that grinning box of dominoes of yours and take it inside ill just carry hannibal off with me he said in a quick whisper with a halfwicked halfmischievous glitter in his brown eyes that young ladysa ladydo you understand no riffraff friend of mine but a regular nuna saintdo you hear so you just stand back and let her take a good look round and rest herself until she wants you two black idiots miss brown he continued cheerfully in a higher voice of explanation as sophy approached who think because one of em used to shave me and the other saved my life theyve got a right to stand at their humble cottage door and frighten horses  so great was mr hamlins ascendency over his former servants that even this ingenious pleasantry was received with every sign of affection and appreciation of the humorist and of the profound respect for his companion aunt chloe showed them effusively into her parlor a small but scrupulously neat and sweetsmelling apartment inordinately furnished with a huge mahogany centretable and chairs and the most fragile and meretricious china and glass ornaments on the mantel but the three jasmineedged lattice windows opened upon a homely garden of oldfashioned herbs and flowers and their fragrance filled the room the cleanest and starchiest of curtains the most dazzling and whitest of tidies and chaircovers bespoke the adjacent laundry indeed the whole cottage seemed to exhale the odors of lavender soap and freshly ironed linen yet the cottage was large for the couple and their assistants dar was two front rooms on de next flo dat dey never used explained aunt chloe friends allowed dat dey could let em to white folks but dey had always been done kep for marse hamlin ef he ever wanted to be wid his old niggers again jack looked up quickly with a brightened face made a sign to hannibal and the two left the room together  when he came through the passage a few moments later there was a sound of laughter in the parlor he recognized the full round lazy chuckle of aunt chloe but there was a higher girlish ripple that he did not know he had never heard sophy laugh before nor when he entered had he ever seen her so animated she was helping chloe set the table to that ladys intense delight at missys girlish housewifery she was picking the berries fresh from the garden buttering the sally lunn making the tea and arranging the details of the repast with apparently no trace of her former discontent and unhappiness in either face or manner he dropped quietly into a chair by the window and with the homely scents of the garden mixing with the honest odors of aunt chloes cookery watched her with an amusement that was as pleasant and grateful as it was strange and unprecedented  now den said aunt chloe to her husband as she put the finishing touch to the repast in a plate of doughnuts as exquisitely brown and shining as jacks eyes were at that moment hannibal you just come away and let dem two white quality chillens have dey tea deys done starved shuah and with an approving nod to jack she bundled her husband from the room  the door closed the young girl began to pour out the tea but jack remained in his seat by the window it was a singular sensation which he did not care to disturb it was no new thing for mr hamlin to find himself at a teteatete repast with the admiring and complaisant fair there was a cabinet particulier in a certain san francisco restaurant which had listened to their various vanities and professions of undying faith he might have recalled certain festal rendezvous with a widow whose piety and impeccable reputation made it a moral duty for her to come to him only in disguise it was but a few days ago that he had been let privately into the palatial mansion of a high official for a midnight supper with a foolish wife it was not strange therefore that he should be alone here secretly with a member of that indiscreet loving sex but that he should be sitting there in a cheap negro laundry with absolutely no sentiment of any kind towards the heavyhaired frecklefaced country schoolgirl opposite him from whom he sought and expected nothing and enjoying it without scorn of himself or his companion to use his own expression got him presently he rose and sauntered to the table with shining eyes  well what do you think of aunt chloes shebang he asked smilingly  oh its so sweet and clean and homelike said the girl quickly at any other time he would have winced at the last adjective it struck him now as exactly the word  would you like to live here if you could  her face brightened she put the teapot down and gazed fixedly at jack  because you can look here i spoke to hannibal about it you can have the two front rooms if you want to one of em is big enough and light enough for a studio to do your work in you tell that nigger what you want to put in em and hes got my orders to do it i told him about your painting said you were the daughter of an old friend you know hold on sophy dn it all ive got to do a little giltedged lying but i let you out of the niece business this time yes from this moment im no longer your uncle i renounce the relationship its hard continued the rascal after all these years and considering sister marys feelings but as you seem to wish it it must be done  sophys steelblue eyes softened she slid her long brown hand across the table and grasped jacks he returned the pressure quickly and fraternally even to that halfshamed halfhurried evasion of emotion peculiar to all brothers this was also a new sensation but he liked it  you are tootoo good mr hamlin she said quietly  yes said jack cheerfully thats whats the matter with me it isnt natural and if i keep it up too long it brings on my cough  nevertheless they were happy in a boy and girl fashion eating heartily and i fear not always decorously scrambling somewhat for the strawberries and smacking their lips over the sally lunn meantime it was arranged that mr hamlin should inform miss mix that sophy would leave school at the end of the term only a few days hence and then transfer herself to lodgings with some old family servants where she could more easily pursue her studies in her own profession she need not make her place of abode a secret neither need she court publicity she would write to jack regularly informing him of her progress and he would visit her whenever he could jack assented gravely to the further proposition that he was to keep a strict account of all the moneys he advanced her and that she was to repay him out of the proceeds of her first pictures he had promised also with a slight mental reservation not to buy them all himself but to trust to her success with the public they were never to talk of what had happened before she was to begin life anew of such were their confidences spoken often together at the same moment and with their mouths full only one thing troubled jack he had not yet told her frankly who he was and what was his reputation he had hitherto carelessly supposed she would learn it and in truth had cared little if she did but it was evident from her conversation that day that by some miracle she was still in ignorance unable now to tell her himself he had charged hannibal to break it to her casually after he was gone you can let me down easy if you like but youd better make a square deal of it while youre about it and jack had added cheerfully if she thinks after that shed better drop me entirely you just say that if she wishes to stay youll see that i dont ever come here again and you keep your word about it too you black nigger or ill be the first to thrash you  nevertheless when hannibal and aunt chloe returned to clear away the repast they were a harmonious party albeit mr hamlin seemed more content to watch them silently from his chair by the window a cigar between his lips and the pleasant distraction of the homely scents and sounds of the garden in his senses allusion having been made again to the morning performance of the organ he was implored by hannibal to diversify his talent by exercising it on an old guitar which had passed into that retainers possession with certain clothes of his masters when they separated mr hamlin accepted it dubiously it had twanged under his volatile fingers in more pretentious but less innocent halls but presently he raised his tenor voice and soft brown lashes to the humble ceiling and sang       way down upon the swanee river  discoursed jack plaintively              far far away      thars whar my heart is turning ever      thars whar the old folks stay  the two dusky scions of an emotional race that had been wont to sweeten its toil and condone its wrongs with music sat wrapt and silent swaying with jacks voice until they could burst in upon the chorus the jasmine vines trilled softly with the afternoon breeze a slender yellowhammer perhaps emulous of jack swung himself from an outer spray and peered curiously into the room and a few neighbors gathering at their doors and windows remarked that after all when it came to real singing no one could beat those dd niggers  the sun was slowly sinking in the rolling gold of the river when jack and sophy started leisurely back through the broken shafts of light and across the farstretching shadows of the cottonwoods in the midst of a lazy silence they were presently conscious of a distant monotonous throb the booming of the up boat on the river the sound came nearerpassed them the boat itself hidden by the trees but a trailing cloud of smoke above cast a momentary shadow upon their path the girl looked up at jack with a troubled face mr hamlin smiled reassuringly but in that instant he had made up his mind that it was his moral duty to kill mr edward stratton   iv   for the next two months mr hamlin was professionally engaged in san francisco and marysville and the transfer of sophy from the school to her new home was effected without his supervision from letters received by him during that interval it seemed that the young girl had entered energetically upon her new career and that her artistic efforts were crowned with success there were a few indianink sketches studies made at school and expanded in her own studio which were eagerly bought as soon as exhibited in the photographers windownotably by a florid and inartistic bookkeeper an old negro woman a slangy stable boy a gorgeously dressed and painted female and the bearded second officer of a river steamboat without hesitation and without comment this as mr hamlin intelligently pointed out in a letter to sophy showed a general and diversified appreciation on the part of the public indeed it emboldened her in the retouching of photographs to offer sittings to the subjects and to undertake even large crayon copies which had resulted in her getting so many orders that she was no longer obliged to sell her drawings but restricted herself solely to profitable portraiture the studio became known even its quaint surroundings added to the popular interest and the originality and independence of the young painter helped her to a genuine success all this she wrote to jack meantime hannibal had assured him that he had carried out his instructions by informing missy of his old masters real occupation and reputation but that the young lady hadnt took no notice certainly there was no allusion to it in her letters nor any indication in her manner mr hamlin was greatly and it seemed to him properly relieved and he looked forward with considerable satisfaction to an early visit to old hannibals laundry  it must be confessed also that another matter a simple affair of gallantry was giving him an equally unusual unexpected and absurd annoyance which he had never before permitted to such trivialities in a recent visit to a fashionable wateringplace he had attracted the attention of what appeared to be a respectable matter of fact woman the wife of a recently elected rural senator she was however singularly beautiful and as singularly cold it was perhaps this quality and her evident annoyance at some unreasoning prepossession which jacks fascinations exercised upon her that heightened that reckless desire for risk and excitement which really made up the greater part of his gallantry nevertheless as was his habit he had treated her always with a charming unconsciousness of his own attentions and a frankness that seemed inconsistent with any insidious approach in fact mr hamlin seldom made love to anybody but permitted it to be made to him with goodhumored deprecation and cheerful skepticism he had once quite accidentally while riding come upon her when she had strayed from her own riding party and had behaved with such unexpected circumspection and propriety not to mention a certain thoughtful abstractionit was the day he had received sophys letterthat she was constrained to make the first advances this led to a later innocent rendezvous in which mrs camperly was impelled to confide to mr hamlin the fact that her husband had really never understood her jack listened with an understanding and sympathy quickened by long experience of such confessions if anything had ever kept him from marriage it was this evident incompatibility of the conjugal relations with a just conception of the feminine soul and its aspirations  and so eventually this yearning for sympathy dragged mrs camperlys clean skirts and rustic purity after jacks heels into various places and various situations not so clean rural or innocent made her miserably unhappy in his absence and still more miserably happy in his presence impelled her to lie cheat and bear false witness forced her to listen with mingled shame and admiration to narrow criticism of his faults from natures so palpably inferior to his own that her moral sense was confused and shaken gave her two distinct lives but so unreal and feverish that with a recklessness equal to his own she was at last ready to merge them both into his for the first time in his life mr hamlin found himself bored at the beginning of an affair actually hesitated and suddenly disappeared from san francisco  he turned up a few days later at aunt chloes door with various packages of presents and quite the air of a returning father of a family to the intense delight of that lady and to sophys proud gratification for he was lost in a profuse boyish admiration of her pretty studio and in wholesome reverence for her art and her astounding progress they were also amused at his awe and evident alarm at the portraits of two ladies her latest sitters that were still on the easels and in consideration of his halfassumed halfreal bashfulness they turned their faces to the wall then his quick observant eye detected a photograph of himself on the mantel  whats that he asked suddenly  sophy and aunt chloe exchanged meaning glances sophy had as a surprise to jack just completed a handsome crayon portrait of himself from an old photograph furnished by hannibal and the picture was at that moment in the window of her former patronthe photographer  oh dat miss sophy jus put it dar fo de lady sitters to look at to gib em a pleasant spresshion said aunt chloe chuckling  mr hamlin did not laugh but quietly slipped the photograph into his pocket yet perhaps it had not been recognized  then sophy proposed to have luncheon in the studio it was quite bohemian and fashionable and many artists did it but to her great surprise jack gravely objected preferring the little parlor of aunt chloe the vinefringed windows and the heavy respectable furniture he thought it was profaning the studio and thenanybody might come in this unusual circumspection amused them and was believed to be part of the boyish awe with which jack regarded the models the draperies and the studies on the walls certain it was that he was much more at his ease in the parlor and when he and sophy were once more alone at their meal although he ate nothing he had regained all his old naivete presently he leaned forward and placed his hand fraternally on her arm sophy looked up with an equally frank smile  you know i promised to let bygones be bygones eh well i intended it and morei intended to make em so i told you id never speak to you again of that man who tried to run you off and i intended that no one else should well as he was the only one who could talkthat meant him but the cards are out of my hands the games been played without me for hes dead  the girl started mr hamlins hand passed caressingly twice or thrice along her sleeve with a peculiar gentleness that seemed to magnetize her  dead he repeated slowly shot in san diego by another man but not by me i had him tracked as far as that and had my eyes on him but it wasnt my deal but there he added giving her magnetized arm a gentle and final tap as if to awaken it hes dead and so is the whole story and now well drop it forever  the girls downcast eyes were fixed on the table but theres my sister she murmured  did she know you went with him asked jack  no but she knows i ran away  well you ran away from home to study how to be an artist dont you see some day shell find out you are one that settles the whole thing  they were both quite cheerful again when aunt chloe returned to clear the table especially jack who was in the best spirits with preternaturally bright eyes and a somewhat rare color on his cheeks aunt chloe who had noticed that his breathing was hurried at times watched him narrowly and when later he slipped from the room followed him into the passage he was leaning against the wall in an instant the negress was at his side  de lawdy gawd marse jack not agin  he took his handkerchief slightly streaked with blood from his lips and said faintly yes it came onon the boat but i thought the dd thing was over get me out of this quick to some hotel before she knows it you can tell her i was called away say thatbut his breath failed him and when aunt chloe caught him like a child in her strong arms he could make no resistance  in another hour he was unconscious with two doctors at his bedside in the little room that had been occupied by sophy it was a sharp attack but prompt attendance and skillful nursing availed he rallied the next day but it would be weeks the doctors said before he could be removed in safety sophy was transferred to the parlor but spent most of her time at jacks bedside with aunt chloe or in the studio with the door open between it and the bedroom in spite of his enforced idleness and weakness it was again a singularly pleasant experience to jack it amused him to sometimes see sophy at her work through the open door and when sitters camefor he had insisted on her continuing her duties as before keeping his invalid presence in the house a secrethe had all the satisfaction of a mischievous boy in rehearsing to sophy such of the conversation as could be overheard through the closed door and speculating on the possible wonder and chagrin of the sitters had they discovered him even when he was convalescent and strong enough to be helped into the parlor and garden he preferred to remain propped up in sophys little bedroom it was evident however that this predilection was connected with no suggestion nor reminiscence of sophy herself it was true that he had once asked her if it didnt make her feel like home the decided negative from sophy seemed to mildly surprise him thats odd he said now all these fixings and things pointing to the flowers in a vase the little hanging shelf of books the knickknacks on the mantelshelf and the few feminine ornaments that still remained look rather like home to me  so the days slipped by and although mr hamlin was soon able to walk short distances leaning on sophys arm in the evening twilight along the river bank he was still missed from the haunts of dissipated men a good many people wondered and others chiefly of the more irrepressible sex were singularly concerned apparently one of these one sultry afternoon stopped before the shadowed window of a photographers she was a handsome welldressed woman yet bearing a certain countrylike simplicity that was unlike the restless smartness of the more urban promenaders who passed her nevertheless she had halted before mr hamlins picture which sophy had not yet dared to bring home and present to him and was gazing at it with rapt and breathless attention suddenly she shook down her veil and entered the shop could the proprietor kindly tell her if that portrait was the work of a local artist  the proprietor was both proud and pleased to say that it was it was the work of a miss brown a young girl student in fact a mere schoolgirl one might say he could show her others of her pictures  thanks but could he tell her if this portrait was from life  no doubt the young lady had a studio and he himself had sent her sitters  and perhaps this was the portrait of one that he had sent her  no but she was very popular and becoming quite the fashion very probably this gentleman who he understood was quite a public character had heard of her and selected her on that account  the ladys face flushed slightly the photographer continued the picture was not for sale it was only there on exhibition in fact it was to be returned tomorrow  to the sitter  he couldnt say it was to go back to the studio perhaps the sitter would be there  and this studio could she have its address  the man wrote a few lines on his card perhaps the lady would be kind enough to say that he had sent her the lady thanking him partly lifted her veil to show a charming smile and gracefully withdrew the photographer was pleased miss brown had evidently got another sitter and from that momentary glimpse of her face it would be a picture as beautiful and attractive as the mans but what was the odd idea that struck him she certainly reminded him of some one there was the same heavy hair only this ladys was golden and she was older and more mature and he remained for a moment with knitted brows musing over his counter  meantime the fair stranger was making her way towards the river suburb when she reached aunt chloes cottage she paused with the unfamiliar curiosity of a newcomer over its quaint and incongruous exterior she hesitated a moment also when aunt chloe appeared in the doorway and with a puzzled survey of her features went upstairs to announce a visitor there was the sound of hurried shutting of doors of the moving of furniture quick footsteps across the floor and then a girlish laugh that startled her she ascended the stairs breathlessly to aunt chloes summons found the negress on the landing and knocked at a door which bore a card marked studio the door opened she entered there were two sudden outcries that might have come from one voice  sophonisba  marianne  hush  the woman had seized sophy by the wrist and dragged her to the window there was a haggard look of desperation in her face akin to that which hamlin had once seen in her sisters eyes on the boat as she said huskily i did not know you were here i came to see the woman who had painted mr hamlins portrait i did not know it was you listen quick answer me one question tell mei implore youfor the sake of the mother who bore us bothtell meis this the man for whom you left home  no no a hundred times no  then there was a silence mr hamlin from the bedroom heard no more  an hour later when the two women opened the studio door pale but composed they were met by the anxious and tearful face of aunt chloe  lawdy gawd missybut dey done gonebofe of em  who is gone demanded sophy as the woman beside her trembled and grew paler still  marse jack and dat fool nigger hannibal  mr hamlin gone repeated sophy incredulously when where  jess nowon de down boat sudden business didnt like to disturb yo and yo friend said hed write  but he was illalmost helpless gasped sophy  dats why he took dat old nigger lawdy missy bress yo heart dey both knows aich udder shuah its all right dar now dar dey are listen  she held up her hand a slow pulsation that might have been the dull labored beating of their own hearts was making itself felt throughout the little cottage it came nearera deep regular inspiration that seemed slowly to fill and possess the whole tranquil summer twilight it was nearer stillwas abreast of the housepassedgrew fainter and at last died away like a deepdrawn sigh it was the down boat that was now separating mr hamlin and his protegee even as it had once brought them together     an ingenue of the sierras   i   we all held our breath as the coach rushed through the semidarkness of gallopers ridge the vehicle itself was only a huge lumbering shadow its sidelights were carefully extinguished and yuba bill had just politely removed from the lips of an outside passenger even the cigar with which he had been ostentatiously exhibiting his coolness for it had been rumored that the ramon martinez gang of road agents were laying for us on the second grade and would time the passage of our lights across gallopers in order to intercept us in the brush beyond if we could cross the ridge without being seen and so get through the brush before they reached it we were safe if they followed it would only be a stern chase with the odds in our favor  the huge vehicle swayed from side to side rolled dipped and plunged but bill kept the track as if in the whispered words of the expressman he could feel and smell the road he could no longer see we knew that at times we hung perilously over the edge of slopes that eventually dropped a thousand feet sheer to the tops of the sugarpines below but we knew that bill knew it also the half visible heads of the horses drawn wedgewise together by the tightened reins appeared to cleave the darkness like a ploughshare held between his rigid hands even the hoofbeats of the six horses had fallen into a vague monotonous distant roll then the ridge was crossed and we plunged into the still blacker obscurity of the brush rather we no longer seemed to moveit was only the phantom night that rushed by us the horses might have been submerged in some swift lethean stream nothing but the top of the coach and the rigid bulk of yuba bill arose above them yet even in that awful moment our speed was unslackened it was as if bill cared no longer to guide but only to drive or as if the direction of his huge machine was determined by other hands than his an incautious whisperer hazarded the paralyzing suggestion of our meeting another team to our great astonishment bill overheard it to our greater astonishment he replied it ud be only a neck and neck race which would get to hll first he said quietly but we were relievedfor he had spoken almost simultaneously the wider turnpike began to glimmer faintly as a visible track before us the wayside trees fell out of line opened up and dropped off one after another we were on the broader tableland out of danger and apparently unperceived and unpursued  nevertheless in the conversation that broke out again with the relighting of the lamps and the comments congratulations and reminiscences that were freely exchanged yuba bill preserved a dissatisfied and even resentful silence the most generous praise of his skill and courage awoke no response i reckon the old man waz just spilin for a fight and is feelin disappointed said a passenger but those who knew that bill had the true fighters scorn for any purely purposeless conflict were more or less concerned and watchful of him he would drive steadily for four or five minutes with thoughtfully knitted brows but eyes still keenly observant under his slouched hat and then relaxing his strained attitude would give way to a movement of impatience you aint uneasy about anything bill are you asked the expressman confidentially bill lifted his eyes with a slightly contemptuous surprise not about anything ter come its what hez happened that i dont exackly sabe i dont see no signs of ramons gang ever havin been out at all and ef they were out i dont see why they didnt go for us  the simple fact is that our ruse was successful said an outside passenger they waited to see our lights on the ridge and not seeing them missed us until we had passed thats my opinion  you aint puttin any price on that opinion air ye inquired bill politely  no  cos thars a comic paper in frisco pays for them things and ive seen worse things in it  come off bill retorted the passenger slightly nettled by the tittering of his companions then what did you put out the lights for  well returned bill grimly it mout have been because i didnt keer to hev you chaps blazin away at the first bush you thought you saw move in your skeer and bringin down their fire on us  the explanation though unsatisfactory was by no means an improbable one and we thought it better to accept it with a laugh bill however resumed his abstracted manner  who got in at the summit he at last asked abruptly of the expressman  derrick and simpson of cold spring and one of the excelsior boys responded the expressman  and that pike county girl from dows flat with her bundles dont forget her added the outside passenger ironically  does anybody here know her continued bill ignoring the irony  youd better ask judge thompson he was mighty attentive to her gettin her a seat by the off window and lookin after her bundles and things  gettin her a seat by the window repeated bill  yes she wanted to see everything and wasnt afraid of the shooting  yes broke in a third passenger and he was so dd civil that when she dropped her ring in the straw he struck a match agin all your rules you know and held it for her to find it and it was just as we were crossin through the brush too i saw the hull thing through the window for i was hanging over the wheels with my gun ready for action and it wasnt no fault of judge thompsons if his dd foolishness hadnt shown us up and got us a shot from the gang  bill gave a short grunt but drove steadily on without further comment or even turning his eyes to the speaker  we were now not more than a mile from the station at the crossroads where we were to change horses the lights already glimmered in the distance and there was a faint suggestion of the coming dawn on the summits of the ridge to the west we had plunged into a belt of timber when suddenly a horseman emerged at a sharp canter from a trail that seemed to be parallel with our own we were all slightly startled yuba bill alone preserving his moody calm  hullo he said  the stranger wheeled to our side as bill slackened his speed he seemed to be a packer or freight muleteer  ye didnt get held up on the divide continued bill cheerfully  no returned the packer with a laugh i dont carry treasure but i see youre all right too i saw you crossin over gallopers  saw us said bill sharply we had our lights out  yes but there was suthin whitea handkerchief or womans veil i reckonhangin from the window it was only a movin spot agin the hillside but ez i was lookin out for ye i knew it was you by that goodnight  he cantered away we tried to look at each others faces and at bills expression in the darkness but he neither spoke nor stirred until he threw down the reins when we stopped before the station the passengers quickly descended from the roof the expressman was about to follow but bill plucked his sleeve  im goin to take a look over this yer stage and these yer passengers with ye afore we start  why whats up  well said bill slowly disengaging himself from one of his enormous gloves when we waltzed down into the brush up there i saw a man ez plain ez i see you rise up from it i thought our time had come and the band was goin to play when he sorter drew back made a sign and we just scooted past him  well  well said bill it means that this yer coach was passed through free tonight  you dont object to thatsurely i think we were deucedly lucky  bill slowly drew off his other glove ive been riskin my everlastin life on this dd line three times a week he said with mock humility and im allus thankful for small mercies but he added grimly when it comes down to being passed free by some pal of a hoss thief and thet called a speshal providence i aint in it no sir i aint in it   ii   it was with mixed emotions that the passengers heard that a delay of fifteen minutes to tighten certain screwbolts had been ordered by the autocratic bill some were anxious to get their breakfast at sugar pine but others were not averse to linger for the daylight that promised greater safety on the road the expressman knowing the real cause of bills delay was nevertheless at a loss to understand the object of it the passengers were all well known any idea of complicity with the road agents was wild and impossible and even if there was a confederate of the gang among them he would have been more likely to precipitate a robbery than to check it again the discovery of such a confederateto whom they clearly owed their safetyand his arrest would have been quite against the californian sense of justice if not actually illegal it seemed evident that bills quixotic sense of honor was leading him astray  the station consisted of a stable a wagon shed and a building containing three rooms the first was fitted up with bunks or sleeping berths for the employees the second was the kitchen and the third and larger apartment was diningroom or sittingroom and was used as general waitingroom for the passengers it was not a refreshment station and there was no bar but a mysterious command from the omnipotent bill produced a demijohn of whiskey with which he hospitably treated the company the seductive influence of the liquor loosened the tongue of the gallant judge thompson he admitted to having struck a match to enable the fair pike countian to find her ring which however proved to have fallen in her lap she was a fine healthy young womana type of the far west sir in fact quite a prairie blossom yet simple and guileless as a child she was on her way to marysville he believed although she expected to meet friendsa friend in factlater on it was her first visit to a large townin fact any civilized centresince she crossed the plains three years ago her girlish curiosity was quite touching and her innocence irresistible in fact in a country whose tendency was to produce frivolity and forwardness in young girls he found her a most interesting young person she was even then out in the stableyard watching the horses being harnessed preferring to indulge a pardonable healthy young curiosity than to listen to the empty compliments of the younger passengers  the figure which bill saw thus engaged without being otherwise distinguished certainly seemed to justify the judges opinion she appeared to be a wellmatured country girl whose frank gray eyes and large laughing mouth expressed a wholesome and abiding gratification in her life and surroundings she was watching the replacing of luggage in the boot a little feminine start as one of her own parcels was thrown somewhat roughly on the roof gave bill his opportunity now there he growled to the helper ye aint carting stone look out will yer some of your things miss he added with gruff courtesy turning to her these yer trunks for instance  she smiled a pleasant assent and bill pushing aside the helper seized a large square trunk in his arms but from excess of zeal or some other mischance his foot slipped and he came down heavily striking the corner of the trunk on the ground and loosening its hinges and fastenings it was a cheap commonlooking affair but the accident discovered in its yawning lid a quantity of white laceedged feminine apparel of an apparently superior quality the young lady uttered another cry and came quickly forward but bill was profuse in his apologies himself girded the broken box with a strap and declared his intention of having the company make it good to her with a new one then he casually accompanied her to the door of the waitingroom entered made a place for her before the fire by simply lifting the nearest and most youthful passenger by the coat collar from the stool that he was occupying and having installed the lady in it displaced another man who was standing before the chimney and drawing himself up to his full six feet of height in front of her glanced down upon his fair passenger as he took his waybill from his pocket  your name is down here as miss mullins he said  she looked up became suddenly aware that she and her questioner were the centre of interest to the whole circle of passengers and with a slight rise of color returned yes  well miss mullins ive got a question or two to ask ye i ask it straight out afore this crowd its in my rights to take ye aside and ask itbut that aint my style im no detective i neednt ask it at all but act as ef i knowed the answer or i might leave it to be asked by others ye neednt answer it ef ye dont like yeve got a friend over therjudge thompsonwho is a friend to ye right or wrong jest as any other man here isas though yed packed your own jury well the simple question ive got to ask ye is this did you signal to anybody from the coach when we passed gallopers an hour ago  we all thought that bills courage and audacity had reached its climax here to openly and publicly accuse a lady before a group of chivalrous californians and that lady possessing the further attractions of youth good looks and innocence was little short of desperation there was an evident movement of adhesion towards the fair stranger a slight muttering broke out on the right but the very boldness of the act held them in stupefied surprise judge thompson with a bland propitiatory smile began really bill i must protest on behalf of this young ladywhen the fair accused raising her eyes to her accuser to the consternation of everybody answered with the slight but convincing hesitation of conscientious truthfulness  i did  ahem interposed the judge hastily erthat iseryou allowed your handkerchief to flutter from the windowi noticed it myselfcasuallyone might say even playfullybut without any particular significance  the girl regarding her apologist with a singular mingling of pride and impatience returned briefly  i signaled  who did you signal to asked bill gravely  the young gentleman im going to marry  a start followed by a slight titter from the younger passengers was instantly suppressed by a savage glance from bill  what did you signal to him for he continued  to tell him i was here and that it was all right returned the young girl with a steadily rising pride and color  wot was all right demanded bill  that i wasnt followed and that he could meet me on the road beyond casss ridge station she hesitated a moment and then with a still greater pride in which a youthful defiance was still mingled said  ive run away from home to marry him and i mean to no one can stop me dad didnt like him just because he was poor and dads got money dad wanted me to marry a man i hate and got a lot of dresses and things to bribe me  and youre taking them in your trunk to the other feller said bill grimly  yes hes poor returned the girl defiantly  then your fathers name is mullins asked bill  its not mullins iitook that name she hesitated with her first exhibition of selfconsciousness  wot is his name  eli hemmings  a smile of relief and significance went round the circle the fame of eli or skinner hemmings as a notorious miser and usurer had passed even beyond gallopers ridge  the step that youre taking miss mullins i need not tell you is one of great gravity said judge thompson with a certain paternal seriousness of manner in which however we were glad to detect a glaring affectation and i trust that you and your affianced have fully weighed it far be it from me to interfere with or question the natural affections of two young people but may i ask you what you know of theeryoung gentleman for whom you are sacrificing so much and perhaps imperiling your whole future for instance have you known him long  the slightly troubled air of trying to understandnot unlike the vague wonderment of childhoodwith which miss mullins had received the beginning of this exordium changed to a relieved smile of comprehension as she said quickly oh yes nearly a whole year  and said the judge smiling has he a vocationis he in business  oh yes she returned hes a collector  a collector  yes he collects bills you knowmoney she went on with childish eagerness not for himselfhe never has any money poor charleybut for his firm its dreadful hard work too keeps him out for days and nights over bad roads and baddest weather sometimes when hes stole over to the ranch just to see me hes been so bad he could scarcely keep his seat in the saddle much less stand and hes got to take mighty big risks too times the folks are cross with him and wont pay once they shot him in the arm and he came to me and i helped do it up for him but he dont mind hes real bravejest as brave as hes good there was such a wholesome ring of truth in this pretty praise that we were touched in sympathy with the speaker  what firm does he collect for asked the judge gently  i dont know exactlyhe wont tell me but i think its a spanish firm you seeshe took us all into her confidence with a sweeping smile of innocent yet halfmischievous artfulnessi only know because i peeped over a letter he once got from his firm telling him he must hustle up and be ready for the road the next day but i think the name was martinezyes ramon martinez  in the dead silence that ensueda silence so profound that we could hear the horses in the distant stableyard rattling their harnessone of the younger excelsior boys burst into a hysteric laugh but the fierce eye of yuba bill was down upon him and seemed to instantly stiffen him into a silent grinning mask the young girl however took no note of it following out with loverlike diffusiveness the reminiscences thus awakened she went on  yes its mighty hard work but he says its all for me and as soon as were married hell quit it he might have quit it before but he wont take no money of me nor what i told him i could get out of dad that aint his style hes mighty proudif he is pooris charley why thars all mas money which she left me in the savins bank that i wanted to draw outfor i had the rightand give it to him but he wouldnt hear of it why he wouldnt take one of the things ive got with me if he knew it and so he goes on ridin and ridin here and there and everywhere and gettin more and more played out and sad and thin and pale as a spirit and always so uneasy about his business and startin up at times when were meetin out in the south woods or in the far clearin and sayin i must be goin now polly and yet always tryin to be chiffle and chipper afore me why he must have rid miles and miles to have watched for me thar in the brush at the foot of gallopers tonight jest to see if all was safe and lordy id have given him the signal and showed a light if id died for it the next minit there thats what i know of charleythats what im running away from home forthats what im running to him for and i dont care who knows it and i only wish id done it aforeand i wouldifififhed only asked me there now she stopped panted and choked then one of the sudden transitions of youthful emotion overtook the eager laughing face it clouded up with the swift change of childhood a lightning quiver of expression broke over it andthen came the rain  i think this simple act completed our utter demoralization we smiled feebly at each other with that assumption of masculine superiority which is miserably conscious of its own helplessness at such moments we looked out of the window blew our noses said ehwhat and i say vaguely to each other and were greatly relieved and yet apparently astonished when yuba bill who had turned his back upon the fair speaker and was kicking the logs in the fireplace suddenly swept down upon us and bundled us all into the road leaving miss mullins alone then he walked aside with judge thompson for a few moments returned to us autocratically demanded of the party a complete reticence towards miss mullins on the subjectmatter under discussion reentered the station reappeared with the young lady suppressed a faint idiotic cheer which broke from us at the spectacle of her innocent face once more cleared and rosy climbed the box and in another moment we were under way  then she dont know what her lover is yet asked the expressman eagerly  no  are you certain its one of the gang  cant say for sure it mout be a young chap from yolo who bucked agin the tiger at sacramento got regularly cleaned out and busted and joined the gang for a flier they say thar was a new hand in that job over at keeleysand a mighty game one too and ez there was some buckshot onloaded that trip he might hev got his share and that would tally with what the girl said about his arm see ef thats the man ive heered he was the son of some big preacher in the states and a college sharp to boot who ran wild in frisco and played himself for all he was worth theyre the wust kind to kick when they once get a foot over the traces for stiddy comfble kempany added bill reflectively give me the son of a man that was hanged        gambled at faro  but what are you going to do about this  that depends upon the feller who comes to meet her  but you aint going to try to take him that would be playing it pretty low down on them both  keep your hair on jimmy the judge and me are only going to rastle with the sperrit of that gay young galoot when he drops down for his girland exhort him powful ef he allows hes convicted of sin and will find the lord well marry him and the gal offhand at the next station and the judge will officiate himself for nothin were goin to have this yer elopement done on the squareand our waybill cleanyou bet  but you dont suppose hell trust himself in your hands  polly will signal to him that its all square  ah said the expressman nevertheless in those few moments the men seemed to have exchanged dispositions the expressman looked doubtfully critically and even cynically before him bills face had relaxed and something like a bland smile beamed across it as he drove confidently and unhesitatingly forward  day meantime although full blown and radiant on the mountain summits around us was yet nebulous and uncertain in the valleys into which we were plunging lights still glimmered in the cabins and few ranch buildings which began to indicate the thicker settlements and the shadows were heaviest in a little copse where a note from judge thompson in the coach was handed up to yuba bill who at once slowly began to draw up his horses the coach stopped finally near the junction of a small crossroad at the same moment miss mullins slipped down from the vehicle and with a parting wave of her hand to the judge who had assisted her from the steps tripped down the crossroad and disappeared in its semiobscurity to our surprise the stage waited bill holding the reins listlessly in his hands five minutes passedan eternity of expectation and as there was that in yuba bills face which forbade idle questioning an aching void of silence also this was at last broken by a strange voice from the road  go on well follow  the coach started forward presently we heard the sound of other wheels behind us we all craned our necks backward to get a view of the unknown but by the growing light we could only see that we were followed at a distance by a buggy with two figures in it evidently polly mullins and her lover we hoped that they would pass us but the vehicle although drawn by a fast horse preserved its distance always and it was plain that its driver had no desire to satisfy our curiosity the expressman had recourse to bill  is it the man you thought of he asked eagerly  i reckon said bill briefly  but continued the expressman returning to his former skepticism whats to keep them both from levanting together now  bill jerked his hand towards the boot with a grim smile  their baggage  oh said the expressman  yes continued bill well hang on to that gals little frills and fixins until this yer jobs settled and the ceremonys over jest as ef we waz her own father and whats more young man he added suddenly turning to the expressman youll express them trunks of hers through to sacramento with your kempanys labels and hand her the receipts and checks for them so she can get em there thatll keep him outer temptation and the reach o the gang until they get away among white men and civilization again when your hoaryheaded ole grandfather or to speak plainer that partikler old whiskeysoaker known as yuba bill wot sits on this box he continued with a diabolical wink at the expressman waltzes in to pervide for a young couple jest startin in life thars nothin mean about his style you bet he fills the bill every time speshul providences take a back seat when hes around  when the station hotel and straggling settlement of sugar pine now distinct and clear in the growing light at last rose within rifleshot on the plateau the buggy suddenly darted swiftly by us so swiftly that the faces of the two occupants were barely distinguishable as they passed and keeping the lead by a dozen lengths reached the door of the hotel the young girl and her companion leaped down and vanished within as we drew up they had evidently determined to elude our curiosity and were successful  but the material appetites of the passengers sharpened by the keen mountain air were more potent than their curiosity and as the breakfastbell rang out at the moment the stage stopped a majority of them rushed into the diningroom and scrambled for places without giving much heed to the vanished couple or to the judge and yuba bill who had disappeared also the through coach to marysville and sacramento was likewise waiting for sugar pine was the limit of bills ministration and the coach which we had just left went no farther in the course of twenty minutes however there was a slight and somewhat ceremonious bustling in the hall and on the veranda and yuba bill and the judge reappeared the latter was leading with some elaboration of manner and detail the shapely figure of miss mullins and yuba bill was accompanying her companion to the buggy we all rushed to the windows to get a good view of the mysterious stranger and probable exbrigand whose life was now linked with our fair fellowpassenger i am afraid however that we all participated in a certain impression of disappointment and doubt handsome and even cultivatedlooking he assuredly wasyoung and vigorous in appearance but there was a certain halfshamed halfdefiant suggestion in his expression yet coupled with a watchful lurking uneasiness which was not pleasant and hardly becoming in a bridegroomand the possessor of such a bride but the frank joyous innocent face of polly mullins resplendent with a simple happy confidence melted our hearts again and condoned the fellows shortcomings we waved our hands i think we would have given three rousing cheers as they drove away if the omnipotent eye of yuba bill had not been upon us it was well for the next moment we were summoned to the presence of that softhearted autocrat  we found him alone with the judge in a private sittingroom standing before a table on which there was a decanter and glasses as we filed expectantly into the room and the door closed behind us he cast a glance of hesitating tolerance over the group  gentlemen he said slowly you was all present at the beginnin of a little game this mornin and the judge thar thinks that you oughter be let in at the finish i dont see that its any of your dd businessso to speak but ez the judge here allows youre all in the secret ive called you in to take a partin drink to the health of mr and mrs charley byngez is now comfably off on their bridal tower what you know or what you suspects of the young galoot thats married the gal aint worth shucks to anybody and i wouldnt give it to a yaller pup to play with but the judge thinks you ought all to promise right here that youll keep it dark thats his opinion ez far as my opinion goes genlmen continued bill with greater blandness and apparent cordiality i wanter simply remark in a keerless offhand ginral way that ef i ketch any godforsaken lopeared chuckleheaded blatherin idjet airin his opinion  one moment bill interposed judge thompson with a grave smile let me explain you understand gentlemen he said turning to us the singular and i may say affecting situation which our goodhearted friend here has done so much to bring to what we hope will be a happy termination i want to give here as my professional opinion that there is nothing in his request which in your capacity as good citizens and lawabiding men you may not grant i want to tell you also that you are condoning no offense against the statutes that there is not a particle of legal evidence before us of the criminal antecedents of mr charles byng except that which has been told you by the innocent lips of his betrothed which the law of the land has now sealed forever in the mouth of his wife and that our own actual experience of his acts have been in the main exculpatory of any previous irregularityif not incompatible with it briefly no judge would charge no jury convict on such evidence when i add that the young girl is of legal age that there is no evidence of any previous undue influence but rather of the reverse on the part of the bridegroom and that i was content as a magistrate to perform the ceremony i think you will be satisfied to give your promise for the sake of the bride and drink a happy life to them both  i need not say that we did this cheerfully and even extorted from bill a grunt of satisfaction the majority of the company however who were going with the through coach to sacramento then took their leave and as we accompanied them to the veranda we could see that miss polly mullinss trunks were already transferred to the other vehicle under the protecting seals and labels of the allpotent express company then the whip cracked the coach rolled away and the last traces of the adventurous young couple disappeared in the hanging red dust of its wheels  but yuba bills grim satisfaction at the happy issue of the episode seemed to suffer no abatement he even exceeded his usual deliberately regulated potations and standing comfortably with his back to the centre of the now deserted barroom was more than usually loquacious with the expressman you see he said in bland reminiscence when your old uncle bill takes hold of a job like this he puts it straight through without changin hosses yet thar was a moment young feller when i thought i was stompt it was when wed made up our mind to make that chap tell the gal fust all what he was ef shed rared or kicked in the traces or hung back only ez much ez that wed hev given him jest five minits law to get up and get and leave her and wed hev toted that gal and her fixins back to her dad again but she jest gave a little scream and start and then went off inter hysterics right on his buzzum laughing and cryin and sayin that nothin should part em gosh if i didnt think he woz more cut up than she about it a minit it looked as ef he didnt allow to marry her arter all but that passed and they was married hard and fastyou bet i reckon hes had enough of stayin out o nights to last him and ef the valley settlements hevnt got hold of a very shining member at least the foothills hev got shut of one more of the ramon martinez gang  whats that about the ramon martinez gang said a quiet potential voice  bill turned quickly it was the voice of the divisional superintendent of the express companya man of eccentric determination of character and one of the few whom the autocratic bill recognized as an equalwho had just entered the barroom his dusty pongee cloak and soft hat indicated that he had that morning arrived on a round of inspection  dont care if i do bill he continued in response to bills invitatory gesture walking to the bar its a little raw out on the road well what were you saying about ramon martinez gang you havent come across one of em have you  no said bill with a slight blinking of his eye as he ostentatiously lifted his glass to the light  and you wont added the superintendent leisurely sipping his liquor for the fact is the gang is about played out not from want of a job now and then but from the difficulty of disposing of the results of their work since the new instructions to the agents to identify and trace all dust and bullion offered to them went into force you see they cant get rid of their swag all the gang are spotted at the offices and it costs too much for them to pay a fence or a middleman of any standing why all that flaky river gold they took from the excelsior company can be identified as easy as if it was stamped with the companys mark they cant melt it down themselves they cant get others to do it for them they cant ship it to the mint or assay offices in marysville and frisco for they wont take it without our certificate and seals and we dont take any undeclared freight within the lines that weve drawn around their beat except from people and agents known why you know that well enough jim he said suddenly appealing to the expressman dont you  possibly the suddenness of the appeal caused the expressman to swallow his liquor the wrong way for he was overtaken with a fit of coughing and stammered hastily as he laid down his glass yesof coursecertainly  no sir resumed the superintendent cheerfully theyre pretty well played out and the best proof of it is that theyve lately been robbing ordinary passengers trunks there was a freight wagon held up near dows flat the other day and a lot of baggage gone through i had to go down there to look into it darned if they hadnt lifted a lot o womans wedding things from that rich couple who got married the other day out at marysville looks as if they were playing it rather low down dont it coming down to hardpan and the bed rockeh  the expressmans face was turned anxiously towards bill who after a hurried gulp of his remaining liquor still stood staring at the window then he slowly drew on one of his large gloves ye didnt he said with a slow drawling but perfectly distinct articulation happen to know old skinner hemmings when you were over there  yes  and his daughter  he hasnt got any  a sort o mild innocent guileless child of nature persisted bill with a yellow face a deadly calm and satanic deliberation  no i tell you he hasnt any daughter old man hemmings is a confirmed old bachelor hes too mean to support more than one  and you didnt happen to know any o that gang did ye continued bill with infinite protraction  yes knew em all there was french pete cherokee bob kanaka joe oneeyed stillson softy brown spanish jack and two or three greasers  and ye didnt know a man by the name of charley byng  no returned the superintendent with a slight suggestion of weariness and a distraught glance towards the door  a dark stylish chap with shifty black eyes and a curledup merstache continued bill with dry colorless persistence  no look here bill im in a little bit of a hurrybut i suppose you must have your little joke before we part now what is your little game  wot you mean demanded bill with sudden brusqueness  mean well old man you know as well as i do youre giving me the very description of ramon martinez himself ha ha nobill you didnt play me this time youre mighty spry and clever but you didnt catch on just then  he nodded and moved away with a light laugh bill turned a stony face to the expressman suddenly a gleam of mirth came into his gloomy eyes he bent over the young man and said in a hoarse chuckling whisper  but i got even after all  how  hes tied up to that lying little shedevil hard and fast     the reformation of james reddy   i   it was a freshly furrowed field so large that the eye at first scarcely took in its magnitude the irregular surface of upturned oily waveshaped clods took the appearance of a vast black chopping sea that reached from the actual shore of san francisco bay to the low hills of the coast range the seabreeze that blew chilly over this bleak expanse added to that fancy and the line of straggling whitewashed farm buildings that half way across lifted themselves above it seemed to be placed on an island in its midst even the one or two huge misshapen agricultural machines abandoned in the furrows bore an odd resemblance to hulks or barges adrift upon its waste  this marine suggestion was equally noticeable from the door of one of the farm buildingsa long detached wooden shedinto which a number of farm laborers were slowly filing although one man was apparently enough impressed by it to linger and gaze over that rigid sea except in their rough dress and the laborstains of soil on their hands and faces they represented no particular type or class they were young and old robust and delicate dull and intelligent kept together only by some philosophical careless or humorous acceptance of equally enforced circumstance in their labors as convicts might have been for they had been picked up on the streets and wharves of san franciscodischarged sailors brokendown miners helpless newcomers unemployed professional men and ruined tradersto assist in ploughing and planting certain broad leagues of rich alluvial soil for a speculative joint stock company at a weekly wage that would have made an european peasant independent for half a year yet there was no enthusiasm in their labor although it was seldom marked by absolute laziness or evasion and was more often hindered by illregulated spurts and excessive effort as if the laborer was anxious to get through with it for in the few confidences they exchanged there was little allusion to the present and they talked chiefly of what they were going to do when their work was over they were gregarious only at their meals in one of the sheds or when at night they sought their bunks or berths together in the larger building  the man who had lingered to look at the dreary prospect had a somewhat gloomy discontented face whose sensitive lines indicated a certain susceptibility to such impressions he was further distinguished by having also lingered longer with the washing of his hands and face in the battered tin basin on a stool beside the door and by the circumstance that the operation revealed the fact that they were whiter than those of his companions drying his fingers slowly on the long rollertowel he stood gazing with a kind of hard abstraction across the darkening field the strip of faded colorless shore and the chill gray sea to the dividing point of land on the opposite coast which in the dying daylight was silhouetted against the cold horizon  he knew that around that point and behind it lay the fierce halfgrown halftamed city of yesterday that had worked his ruin  it was scarcely a year ago that he had plunged into its wildest excessesa reckless gambler among speculators a hopeless speculator among gamblers until the little fortune he had brought thither had been swept away  from time to time he had kept up his failing spirit with the feverish exaltation of dissipation until awakening from a drunkards dream one morning he had found himself on board a steamboat crossing the bay in company with a gang of farm laborers with whom he was hired a bitter smile crossed his lips as his eyes hovered over the cold rugged fields before him yet he knew that they had saved him the unaccustomed manual labor in the open air the regular hours the silent heavy passionless nights the plain but wholesome food were all slowly restoring his youth and strength again temptation and passion had alike fled these unlovely fields and grim employment yet he was not grateful he nursed his dreary convalescence as he had his previous dissipation as part of a wrong done him by one for whose sake he was wont to believe he had sacrificed himself that person was a woman  turning at last from the prospect and his bitter memories to join his companions he found that they had all passed in the benches before the long table on which supper was spread were already filled and he stood in hesitation looking down the line of silent and hungrily preoccupied men on either side a young girl who was standing near a smaller servingtable apparently assisting an older woman in directing the operation of half a dozen chinese waiters moved forward and cleared a place for him at a sidetable pushing before it the only chair in the roomthe one she had lately vacated as she placed some of the dishes before him with a timid ostentation and her large but wellshaped hands came suddenly in contact with and in direst contrast to his own whiter and more delicate ones she blushed faintly he lifted his eyes to hers  he had seen her half a dozen times before for she was the daughter of the ranch superintendent and occasionally assisted her mother in this culinary supervisionwhich did not however bring her into any familiar association with the men even the younger ones perhaps from overconsciousness of their inferior position or the preoccupation of their labor never indulged in any gallantry toward her and he himself in his revulsion of feeling against the whole sex had scarcely noticed that she was goodlooking but this naive exhibition of preference could not be overlooked either by his companions who smiled cynically across the table or by himself from whose morbid fancy it struck an ignoble suggestion ah well the girl was prettythe daughter of his employer who rumor said owned a controlling share in the company why should he not make this chance preference lead to something if only to ameliorate in ways like this his despicable position here he knew the value of his own good looks his superior education and a certain recklessness which women liked why should he not profit by them as well as the one woman who had brought him to this he owed her sex nothing if those among them who were not bad were only fools there was no reason why he should not deceive them as they had him there was all this small audacity and cynical purpose in his brown eyes as he deliberately fixed them on hers and i grieve to say that these abominable sentiments seemed only to impart to them a certain attractive brilliancy and a determination which the undetermining sex is apt to admire  she blushed again dropped her eyes replied to his significant thanks with a few indistinct words and drew away from the table with a sudden timidity that was half confession  she did not approach him again during the meal but seemed to have taken a sudden interest in the efficiency of the waiters generally which she had not shown before i do not know whether this was merely an effort at concealment or an awakened recognition of her duty but after the fashion of her sexand perhaps in contrast to hisshe was kinder that evening to the average man on account of him he did not however notice it nor did her absence interfere with his now healthy appetite he finished his meal and only when he rose to take his hat from the peg above him did he glance around the room their eyes met again as he passed out although it was dark he put on his hat a little more smartly  the air was clear and cold but the outlines of the landscape had vanished his companions with the instinct of tired animals were already making their way in knots of two or three or in silent file across the intervening space between the building and their dormitory a few had already lit their pipes and were walking leisurely but the majority were hurrying from the chill seabreeze to the warmth and comfort of the long welllit room lined with blanketed berths and set with plain wooden chairs and tables the young man lingered for a moment on the wooden platform outside the diningshedpartly to evade this only social gathering of his fellows as they retired for the night and partly attracted by a strange fascination to the faint distant glow beyond the point of land which indicated the lights of san francisco  there was a slight rustle behind him it was the young girl who with a white woolen scarf thrown over her head and shoulders had just left the room she started when she saw him and for an instant hesitated  you are going home miss woodridge he said pleasantly  yes she returned in a faint embarrassed voice i thought id run on ahead of ma  will you allow me to accompany you  its only a step she protested indicating the light in the window of the superintendents house the most remote of the group of buildings yet scarcely a quarter of a mile distant  but its quite dark he persisted smilingly  she stepped from the platform to the ground he instantly followed and ranged himself at a little distance from her side she protested still feebly against his troubling himself but in another moment they were walking on quietly together nevertheless a few paces from the platform they came upon the upheaved clods of the fresh furrows and their progress over them was slow and difficult  shall i help you will you take my arm he said politely  no thank you mr reddy  so she knew his name he tried to look into her eyes but the woolen scarf hid her head after all there was nothing strange in her knowing him she probably had the names of the men before her in the diningroom or on the books after a pause he said  you quite startled me one becomes such a mere working machine here that one quite forgets ones own nameespecially with the prefix of mr  and if it dont happen to be ones real name either said the girl with an odd timid audacity  he looked up quicklymore attracted by her manner than her words more amused than angry  but reddy happens to be my real name  oh  what made you think it was not  the clods over which they were clambering were so uneven that sometimes the young girl was mounting one at the same moment that reddy was descending from another her reply half muffled in her shawl was delivered over his head oh because pa says most of the men here dont give their real namesthey dont care to be known afterward ashamed of their work i reckon  his face flushed a moment even in the darkness he was ashamed of his work and perhaps a little of the pitiful sport he was beginning but oddly enough the aggressive criticism only whetted his purpose the girl was evidently quite able to take care of herself why should he be overchivalrous  it isnt very pleasant to be doing the work of a horse an ox or a machine if you can do other things he said half seriously  but you never used to do anything at all did you she asked  he hesitated here was a chance to give her an affecting history of his former exalted fortune and position and perhaps even to stir her evidently romantic nature with some suggestion of his sacrifices to one of her own sex women liked that sort of thing it aroused at once their emulation and their condemnation of each other he seized the opportunity butfor some reason he knew not whyawkwardly and clumsily with a simulated pathos that was lachrymose a selfassertion that was boastful and a dramatic manner that was unreal suddenly the girl stopped him  yes i know all that pa told me told me youd been given away by some woman  his face again flushedthis time with anger the utter failure of his story to excite her interest and her perfect possession of herself and the situationso unlike her conduct a few moments beforemade him savagely silent and he clambered on sullenly at her side presently she stopped balancing herself with a dexterity he could not imitate on one of the larger upheaved clods and said  i was thinking that as you cant do much with those hands of yours digging and shoveling and not much with your feet either over ploughed ground you might do some inside work that would pay you better too you might help in the dining room setting table and washing up helping ma and methough i dont do much except overseeing i could show you what to do at first and youd learn quick enough if you say yes ill speak to pa tonight hell do whatever i say  the rage and shame that filled his breast choked even the bitter laugh that first rose to his lips if he could have turned on his heel and left her with marked indignation he would have done so but they were scarcely half way across the field his stumbling retreat would have only appeared ridiculous and he was by no means sure that she would not have looked upon it as merely a confession of his inability to keep up with her and yet there was something peculiarly fascinating and tantalizing in the situation she did not see the sardonic glitter in his eye as he said brutally  ha and that would give me the exquisite pleasure of being near you  she seemed a little confused even under her enwrappings and in stepping down her foot slipped reddy instantly scrambled up to her and caught her as she was pitching forward into the furrow yet in the struggle to keep his own foothold he was aware that she was assisting him and although he had passed his arm around her waist as if for her better security it was only through her firm grasp of his wrists that he regained his own footing the cloud had fallen back from her head and shoulders her heavy hair had brushed his cheek and left its faint odor in his nostrils the rounded outline of her figure had been slightly drawn against his own his mean resentment wavered her proposition which at first seemed only insulting now took a vague form of satisfaction his ironical suggestion seemed a natural expression well i say yes then he said with an affected laugh that is if you think i can manage to do the work it is not exactly in my line you know yet he somehow felt that his laugh was feeble and unconvincing  oh its easy enough said the girl quietly youve only got to be cleanand thats in your line i should say  and if i thought it would please you he added with another attempt at gallantry  she did not reply but moved steadily on he fancied a little more rapidly they were nearing the house he felt he was losing time and opportunity the uneven nature of the ground kept him from walking immediately beside her unless he held her hand or arm yet an odd timidity was overtaking him surely this was the same girl whose consciousness and susceptibility were so apparent a moment ago yet her speech had been inconsistent unsympathetic and coldly practical its very kind of you he began again scrambling up one side of the furrow as she descended on the other tototake such an interest inin a stranger and i wish you knew how she had mounted the ridge again and stood balancing herself as if waiting for him to finish his sentence howhow deeplyiishe dropped quickly down again with the same movement of uneasy consciousness and he left the sentence unfinished the house was now only a few yards away he hurried forward but she reached the wooden platform and stoop upon it first he however at the same moment caught her hand  i want to thank you he said and say goodnight  goodnight her voice was indistinct again and she was trembling emboldened and reckless he sprang upon the platform and encircling her with one arm with his other hand he unloosed the woolen cloud around her head and bared her faintly flushed cheek and halfopen hurriedly breathing lips but the next moment she threw her head back with a single powerful movement and as it seemed to him with scarcely an effort cast him off with both hands and sent him toppling from the platform to the ground he scrambled quickly to his feet again flushed angry andfrightened perhaps she would call her father he would be insulted or worselaughed at he had lost even this pitiful chance of bettering his condition but he was as relieved as he was surprised to see that she was standing quietly on the edge of the platform apparently waiting for him to rise her face was still uncovered still slightly flushed but bearing no trace of either insult or anger when he stood erect again she looked at him gravely and drew the woolen cloud over her head as she said calmly then ill tell pa youll take the place and i reckon youll begin tomorrow morning   ii   angered discomfited and physically and morally beaten james reddy stumbled and clambered back across the field the beam of light that had streamed out over the dark field as the door opened and shut on the girl left him doubly confused and bewildered in his dull anger and mortification there seemed only one course for him to pursue he would demand his wages in the morning and cut the whole concern he would go back to san francisco and work there where he at least had friends who respected his station yet he ought to have refused the girls offer before she had repulsed him his retreat now meant nothing and might even tempt her in her vulgar pique to reveal her rebuff of him he raised his eyes mechanically and looked gloomily across the dark waste and distant bay to the opposite shore but the fog had already hidden the glow of the citys lights and thickening around the horizon seemed to be slowly hemming him in with the dreary rancho in his present frame of mind there was a certain fatefulness in this that precluded his once free agency and to that extent relieved and absolved him of any choice he reached the dormitory and its turneddown lights in a state of tired and dull uncertainty for which sleep seemed to offer the only relief he rolled himself in his blankets with an animal instinct of comfort and shut his eyes but their sense appeared to open upon nelly woodridge as she stood looking down upon him from the platform even through the dull pain of his bruised susceptibilities he was conscious of a strange satisfaction he had not felt before he fell asleep at last to waken only to the sunlight streaming through the curtainless windows on his face to his surprise the long shed was empty and deserted except for a single chinaman who was sweeping the floor at the farther end as reddy started up the man turned and approached him with a characteristic vague and patient smile  all lity john you sleepee heap mistel woodlidge he say you no go wolkee field allee same mellikan man you stoppee inside housee allee same me shabbee you come to glubbee grub now pointing to the distant diningshed and then you washee dish  the full extent of his new degradation flashed upon reddy with this added insult of his brother menials implicit equality he understood it all he had been detached from the fieldworkers and was to come to a later breakfast perhaps the broken victuals of the first repast and wash the dishes he remembered his new bargain very well he would refuse positively take his dismissal and leave that morning he hurriedly dressed himself and followed the chinaman into the open air  the fog still hung upon the distant bay and hid the opposite point but the sun shone with dry californian brilliancy over the leaguelong field around him revealing every detail of the rancho with sharp matter of fact directness and without the least illusion of distance or romance the rough unplaned unpainted walls of the dinnershed stood out clearly before him the halffilled buckets of water on the near platform and the immense tubs piled with dirty dishes he scowled darkly as he walked forward conscious nevertheless of the invigorating discipline of the morning air and the wholesome whip in the sky above him he entered sharply and aggressively to his relief the room at first sight seemed like the dormitory he had just left to be empty but a voice clear dry direct and practical as the morning itself spoke in his ear mornin reddy my daughter says youre willin to take an indoor job and i reckon speakin square as man to man its more in your line than what youve bin doin it maynt be hightoned work but works work anyhow you can fix it and the only difference i kin see is in the work that a man does squarely and the work that he shirks  but said reddy hurriedly theres a mistake i came here only to  work like the others i understand well you see you cant you do your best i know i aint findin fault but it aint in your line this is and the pay is better  but stammered reddy miss woodridge didnt understand  yes she did returned woodridge impatiently and she told me she says shell show you round at first youll catch on all right sit down and eat your breakfast and shell be along before youre through ez for me i must get up and get so long and before reddy had an opportunity to continue his protest he turned away  the young man glanced vexatiously around him a breakfast much better in service and quality than the one he had been accustomed to smoked on the table there was no one else in the room he could hear the voices of the chinese waiters in the kitchen beyond he was healthily hungry and after a moments hesitation sat down and began his meal he could expostulate with her afterward and withdraw his promise he was entitled to his breakfast anyway  once or twice while thus engaged he heard the door of the kitchen open and the clipping tread of the chinese waiters who deposited some rattling burden on the adjacent tables but he thought it prudent not to seem to notice them when he had finished the pleasant hesitating boyish contralto of miss woodridge fell upon his ear  when youre ready ill show you how to begin your work  he turned quickly with a flush of mortification at being discovered at his repast and his anger returned but as his eyes fell upon her delicately colored but tranquil face her wellshaped figure coquettishly and spotlessly cuffed collared and aproned and her clear blue but halfaverted eyes he again underwent a change she certainly was very prettythat most seductive prettiness which seemed to be warmed into life by her consciousness of himself why should he take her or himself so seriously why not play out the farce and let those who would criticise him and think his acceptance of the work degrading understand that it was only an affair of gallantry he could afford to serve woodridge at least a few weeks for the favor of this rachel forgetful of his rebuff of the night before he fixed his brown eyes on hers with an audacious levity  oh yesthe work let us see it im ready in name and nature for anything that miss woodridge wants of me im just dying to begin  his voice was raised slightly with a high comedy jauntiness for the benefit of the chinese waiters who might be lingering to see the mellican man assume their functions but it failed in effect with their characteristic calm acceptance of any eccentricity in a foreign devil they scarcely lifted their eyes the young girl pointed to a deep basket filled with dishes which had been placed on the larger table and said without looking at reddy  you had better begin by checking the crockery that is counting the pieces separately and then arranging them in sets as they come back from washing theres the book to compare them with and to set down what is broken missing or chipped youll have a clean towel with you to wipe the pieces that have not been cleaned enough or if they are too dirty youll send them back to the kitchen  couldnt i wash them myself said reddy continuing his ostentatious levity  not yet said the girl with grave hesitation youd break them  she stood watching him as with affected hilarity he began to take the dishes from the basket but she noticed that in spite of this jocular simulation his grasp was firm and delicate and that there was no clatterwhich would have affected her sensitive earas he put them down she laid a pencil and account book beside him and turned away  but you are not going he said in genuine surprise  yes she said quietly until you get through checking then ill come back and show you what you have to do next youre getting on very well  but that was because you were with me  she colored slightly and without looking at him moved slowly to the door and disappeared  reddy went back to his work disappointed but not discomfited he was getting accustomed to the girls eccentricities whether it was the freshness of the morning air and sunlight streaming in at the open windows the unlookedfor solitude and security of the empty room or that there was nothing really unpleasant in his occupation he went on cheerfully checking the dishes narrowly examining them for chips and cracks and noting them in the book again discovering that a few were imperfectly cleaned and wiped he repaired the defect with cold water and a towel without the least thought of the operation being degrading he had finished his task in half an hour she had not returned why should he not go on and set the table as he straightened and turned the coarse tablecloth he made the discovery that the long table was really composed of half a dozen smaller ones and that the hideous parallelogram which had always so offended him was merely the outcome of carelessness and want of taste without a moments hesitation he set at work to break up the monotonous line and rearranged the tables laterally with small open spaces between them the task was no light one even for a stronger man but he persevered in it with a newfound energy until he had changed the whole aspect of the room it looked larger wider and less crowded its hard practical workhouselike formality had disappeared he had paused to survey it panting still with his unusual exertion when a voice broke upon his solitude  well i wanter know  the voice was not nellys but that of her mothera largeboned angular woman of fiftywho had entered the room unperceived the accents were simply those of surprise but on james reddys present sensitive mood coupled with the feeling that here was a new witness to his degradation he might have resented it but he detected the handsome reserved figure of the daughter a few steps behind her their eyes met wonderful to relate the young girls no longer evaded him but looked squarely into his with a bright expression of pleasure he had not seen before he checked himself with a sudden thrill of gratification  well i declare continued mrs woodridge is that your ideaor yours helen  here reddy simply pointed out the advantages for serving afforded by the new arrangement that all the tables were equally and quickly accessible from the servingtable and sideboard and that it was no longer necessary to go the whole length of the room to serve the upper table he tactfully did not refer to the improved appearance of the room  well as long as it aint mere finikin said the lady graciously and seems to bring the folks and their vittles nearer togetherwell try it today it does look kinder cityfiedand i reckoned that was all the good it was but i calkilated you were goin to check the crockery this morning  its done said reddy smilingly handing her the accountbook  mrs woodridge glanced over it and then surveyed her new assistant  and you didnt find any plates that were dirty and that had to be sent back  yes two or three but i cleaned them myself  mrs woodridge glanced at him with a look of approving curiosity but his eyes were just then seeking her daughters for a more grateful sympathy all of which the good lady noted and as it apparently answered the unasked question in her own mind she only uttered the single exclamation humph  but the approbation he received later at dinner in the satisfaction of his old companions with the new arrangement had also the effect of diverting from him the criticism he had feared they would make in finding him installed as an assistant to mrs woodridge on the contrary they appeared only to recognize in him some especial and superior faculty utilized for their comfort and when the superintendent equally pleased said it was all reddys own idea no one doubted that it was this particular stroke of genius which gained him the obvious promotion if he had still thought of offering his flirtation with nelly as an excuse there was now no necessity for any having shown to his employers his capacity for the highest and lowest work they naturally preferred to use his best abilitiesand he was kept from any menial service his accounts were so carefully and intelligently rendered that the entire care of the building and its appointments was intrusted to him at the end of the week mr woodridge took him aside  i say you aint got any job in view arter you finish up here hev ye  reddy started scarcely ten days ago he had a hundred projects schemes and speculations more or less wild and extravagant wherewith he was to avenge and recoup himself in san francisco now they were gone he knew not where and how he briefly said he had not  because continued woodridge ive got an idea of startin a hotel in the oak grove just on the slope back o the rancho the companys bound to make some sort o settlement there for the regular hands and the place is pooty enough for frisco people who want to run over here and get set up for a day or two thars plenty of wood and water up thar and the companys sure to have a wharf down on the shore ill provide the capital if you will put in your time you can sling in ez much style as you like there this was an allusion to reddys attempt to enliven the blank walls with colored pictures from the illustrated papers and green ceanothus sprays from the slope in fact the more style the better for them city folks well you think it over  he did but meantime he seemed to make little progress in his court of the superintendents daughter he tried to think it was because he had allowed himself to be diverted by his work but although she always betrayed the same odd physical consciousness of his presence it was certain that she never encouraged him she gave him the few directions that his new occupation still made necessary and looked her approval of his success but nothing more he was forced to admit that this was exactly what she might have done as the superintendents daughter to a deserving employee whereat for a few days he assumed an air of cold and ceremonious politeness until perceiving that far from piquing the girl it seemed to gratify her and even to render her less sensitive in his company he sulked in good earnest this proving ineffective alsoexcept to produce a kind of compassionate curiosityhis former dull rage returned the planting of the rancho was nearly over his service would be ended next week he had not yet given his answer to woodridges proposition he would decline it and cut the whole concern  it was a crisp sunday morning the breakfast hour was later on that day to allow the men more time for their holiday which however they generally spent in cards gossip or reading in their sleeping sheds it usually delayed reddys work but as he cared little for the companionship of his fellows it enabled him without a show of unsociability to seclude himself in the diningroom and this morning he was early approached by his employer  im goin to take the women folks over to oakdale to church said mr woodridge ef ye keer to join us thars a seat in the wagon and ill turn on a couple of chinamen to do the work for you just now and nelly or the old woman will give you a lift this afternoon with the counting up  reddy felt instinctively that the invitation had been instigated by the young girl a week before he would have rejoiced at it a month ago he would have accepted it if only as a relief to his degraded position but in the pique of this new passion he almost rudely declined it an hour later he saw nelly becomingly and even tastefully dressedwith the american girls triumphant superiority to her condition and surroundingsride past in her fathers smart carryall he was startled to see that she looked so like a lady then with a new and jealous inconsistency significant of the progress of his passion he resolved to go to church too she should see that he was not going to remain behind like a mere slave he remembered that he had still certain remnants of his past finery in his trunk he would array himself in them walk to oakdale and make one of the congregation he managed to change his clothes without attracting the attention of his fellows and set out  the air was pure but keen with none of the languor of spring in its breath although a few flowers were beginning to star the weedy wagontracked lane and there was an awakening spice in the wayside southernwood and myrtle he felt invigorated although it seemed only to whet his jealous pique he hurried on without even glancing toward the distant coastline of san francisco or even thinking of it the bitter memories of the past had been obliterated by the bitterness of the present he no longer thought of that woman even when he had threatened to himself to return to san francisco he was vaguely conscious that it was not she who was again drawing him there but nelly who was driving him away  the service was nearly over when he arrived at the chilly little corrugatedzinc church at oakdale but he slipped into one of the back seats a few worshipers turned round to look at him among them were the daughters of a neighboring miller who were slightly exercised over the unusual advent of a goodlooking stranger with certain exterior signs of elegance their excitement was communicated by some mysterious instinct to their neighbor nelly woodridge she also turned and caught his eye but to all appearances she not only showed no signs of her usual agitation at his presence but did not seem to even recognize him in the acerbity of his pique he was for a moment gratified at what he believed to be the expression of her wounded pride but his uneasiness quickly returned and at the conclusion of the service he slipped out of the church with one or two of the more restless in the congregation as he passed through the aisle he heard the escort of the millers daughters in response to a whispered inquiry say distinctly only the headwaiter over at the companys rancho whatever hesitating idea reddy might have had of waiting at the church door for the appearance of nelly vanished before the brutal truth his brow darkened and with flushed cheeks he turned his back upon the building and plunged into the woods this time there was no hesitation in his resolve he would leave the rancho at the expiration of his engagement even in a higher occupation he felt he could never live down his reputation there  in his morose abstraction he did not know how long or how aimlessly he had wandered among the mossy liveoaks his head and shoulders often imperiled by the downcurving of some huge knotted limb his feet straying blindly from the faint track over the thickly matted carpet of chickweed which hid their roots but it was nearly an hour before he emerged upon a wide open wooded slope and from the distant view of field and shore knew that he was at oak grove the site of woodridges projected hotel and there surely at a little distance was the woodridges wagon and team tied up to a sapling while the superintendent and his wife were slowly climbing the slope and apparently examining the prospect without waiting to see if nelly was with them reddy instantly turned to avoid meeting them but he had not proceeded a hundred yards before he came upon that young lady who had evidently strayed from the party and who was now unconsciously advancing toward him a rencontre was inevitable  she started slightly and then stopped with all her old agitation and embarrassment but to his own surprise he was also embarrassed and even tonguetied  she spoke first  you were at church i didnt quite know you ininthese clothes  in her own finery she had undergone such a change to reddys consciousness that he for the first time in their acquaintance now addressed her as on his own level and as if she had no understanding of his own feelings  oh he said with easy bitterness others did if you did not they all detected the headwaiter at the union companys rancho even if i had accepted your kindness in offering me a seat in your wagon it would have made no difference he was glad to put this construction on his previous refusal for in the new relations which seemed to be established by their sunday clothes he was obliged to soften the churlishness of that refusal also  i dont think youd look nice setting the table in kid gloves she said glancing quickly at his finery as if accepting it as the real issue but you can wear what you like at other times i never found fault with your working clothes  there was such a pleasant suggestion in her emphasis that his illhumor softened her eyes wandered over the opposite grove where her unconscious parents had just disappeared  papas very keen about the hotel she continued and is going to have the workmen break ground tomorrow he says hell have it up in two months and ready to open if he has to make the men work double time when youre manager you wont mind what folks say  there was no excuse for his further hesitation he must speak out but he did it in a halfhearted way  but if i simply go awaywithout being manageri wont hear their criticism either  what do you mean she said quickly  iveive been thinking ofof going back to san francisco he stammered awkwardly  a slight flush of contemptuous indignation passed over her face and gave it a strength and expression he had never seen there before oh youve not reformed yet then she said under her scornful lashes  i dont understand you he said flushing  father ought to have told you she went on dryly that that woman has gone off to the springs with her husband and you wont see her at san francisco  i dont know what you meanand your father seems to take an unwarrantable interest in my affairs said reddy with an anger that he was conscious however was half simulated  no more than he ought to if he expects to trust you with all his affairs said the girl shortly but you had better tell him you have changed your mind at once before he makes any further calculations on your staying hes just over the hill there with mother  she turned away coldly as she spoke but moved slowly and in the direction of the hill although she took a less direct trail than the one she had pointed to him but he followed her albeit still embarrassedly and with that new sense of respect which had checked his former surliness there was her strong healthy welldeveloped figure moving before him but the modish gray dress seemed to give its pronounced outlines something of the dignity of a goddess even the firm hands had the distinguishment of character  you understand he said apologetically that i mean no discourtesy to your father or his offer andhe hesitatedneither is my reason what you would infer  then what is it she asked turning to him abruptly you know you have no other place when you leave here nor any chance as good as the one father offers you you are not fit for any other work and you know it you have no money to speculate with nor can you get any if you could you would have never stayed here  he could not evade the appalling truthfulness of her clear eyes he knew it was no use to lie to her she had evidently thoroughly informed herself regarding his past more than that she seemed to read his present thoughts but not all of them no he could startle her still it was desperate but he had nothing now to lose and she liked the truthshe should have it  you are right he said shortly these are not my reasons  then what reason have you  you  me she repeated incredulously yet with a rising color  yes you i cannot stay here and have you look down upon me  i dont look down on you she said simply yet without the haste of repelling an unjust accusation why should i mother and i have done the same work that you are doingif thats what you mean and father who is a man like yourself helped us at first until he could do other things better she paused perhaps you think so because you looked down on us when you first came here  but i didnt said reddy quickly  you did said the young girl quietly thats why you acted toward me as you did the night you walked home with me you would not have behaved in that way to any san francisco young ladyand im not one of yourfastmarried women  reddy felt the hot blood mount to his cheek and looked away i was foolish and rudeand i think you punished me at the time he stammered but you see i was right in saying you looked down on me he concluded triumphantly  this was at best a feeble sequitur but the argument of the affections is not always logical and it had its effect on the girl  i wasnt thinking of that she said its that you dont know your own mind  if i said that i would stay and accept your fathers offer would you think that i did he asked quickly  i should wait and see what you actually did do she replied  but if i stayedandandif i told you that i stayed on your accountto be with you and near you onlywould you think that a proof he spoke hesitatingly for his lips were dry with a nervousness he had not known before  i might if you told father you expected to be engaged on those terms for it concerns him as much as me and he engages you and not i otherwise id think it was only your talk  reddy looked at her in astonishment there was not the slightest trace of coyness coquetry or even raillery in her clear honest eyes and yet it would seem as if she had taken his proposition in its fullest sense as a matrimonial declaration and actually referred him to her father he was pleased frightened and utterly unprepared  but what would you say nelly he drew closer to her and held out both his hands but she retreated a step and slipped her own behind her  better see what father says first she said quietly you may change your mind again and go back to san francisco  he was confused and reddened again but he had become accustomed to her ways rather perhaps he had begun to recognize the quaint justice that underlaid them or possibly some better self of his own that had been buried under bitterness and sloth and struggled into life but whatever he says he returned eagerly cannot alter my feelings to you it can only alter my position here and you say you are above being influenced by that tell me nellydear nelly have you nothing to say to me as i am or is it only to your fathers manager that you would speak his voice had an unmistakable ring of sincerity in it and even startled himhalf rascal as he was  the young girls clear scrutinizing eyes softened her red resolute lips trembled slightly and then parted the upper one hovering a little to one side over her white teeth it was nellys own peculiar smile and its serious piquancy always thrilled him but she drew a little farther back from his brightening eyes her hands still curled behind her and said with the faintest coquettish toss of her head toward the hill if you want to see father youd better hurry up  with a sudden determination as new to him as it was incomprehensible reddy turned from her and struck forward in the direction of the hill he was not quite sure what he was going for yet that he who had only a moment before fully determined to leave the rancho and her was now going to her father to demand her hand as a contingency of his remaining did not strike him as so extravagant and unexpected a denouement as it was a difficult one he was only concerned how and in what way he should approach him in a moment of embarrassment he hesitated turned and looked behind him  she was standing where he had left her gazing after him leaning forward with her hands still held behind her suddenly as with an inspiration she raised them both carried them impetuously to her lips blew him a dozen riotous kisses and then lowering her head like a colt whisked her skirt behind her and vanished in the cover   iii   it was only may but the freshness of early summer already clothed the great fields of the rancho the old resemblance to a sea was still there more accented perhaps by the undulations of bluishgreen grain that rolled from the actual shoreline to the foothills the farm buildings were half submerged in this glowing tide of color and lost their uncouth angularity with their hidden rude foundations the same seabreeze blew chilly and steadily from the bay yet softened and subdued by the fresh odors of leaf and flower the outlying fringe of oaks were starred through their underbrush with anemones and dogroses there were lupines growing rankly in the open spaces and along the gentle slopes of oak grove daisies were already scattered and as if it were part of this vernal efflorescence the eminence itself was crowned with that latest flower of progress and improvementthe new oak grove hotel  long low dazzling with white colonnades verandas and balconies which retained however enough of the dampness of recent creation to make them too cool for loungers except at high noon the hotel nevertheless had the charms of freshness youth and cleanliness reddys fastidious neatness showed itself in all the appointments from the mirrored and marbled barroom gilded parlors and snowy diningroom to the chintz and maple furnishing of the bedrooms above reddys taste too had selected the pretty site his good fortune had afterward discovered in an adjoining thicket a spring of blandly therapeutic qualities a complaisant medical faculty of san francisco attested to its merits a sympathetic press advertised the excellence of the hotel a noveltyseeking fashionable circleas yet without laws and blindly imitativefound the new hotel an admirable variation to the vulgar ordinary across the bay excursion and an accepted excuse for a novel social dissipation a number of distinguished people had already visited it certain exclusive families had secured the best rooms there were a score of pretty women to be seen in its parlors there had already been a slight scandal nothing seemed wanting to insure its success  reddy was passing through the little wood where four months before he had parted from kelly woodridge to learn his fate from her father he remembered that interview to which nellys wafted kiss had inspired him he recalled today as he had many times before the singular complacency with which mr woodridge had received his suit as if it were a slight and unimportant detail of the business in hand and how he had told him that kelly and her mother were going to the states for a three months visit but that after her return if they were both still agreed he woodridge would make no objection he remembered the slight shock which this announcement of kellys separation from him during his probationary labors had given him and his sudden suspicion that he had been partly tricked of his preliminary intent to secure her company to solace him but he had later satisfied himself that she knew nothing of her fathers intentions at the time and he was fain to content himself with a walk through the fields at her side the day she departed and a single kisswhich left him cold and now in a few days she would return to witness the successful fufillment of his labors andreward him  it was certainly a complacent prospect he could look forward to a sensible prosperous respectable future he had won back his good name his fortune and positionnot perhaps exactly in the way he had expectedand he had stilled the wanton foolish cravings of his passionate nature in the calm virginal love of an honest handsome girl who would make him a practical helpmeet and a comfortable trustworthy wife he ought to be very happy he had never known such perfect health before he had lost his reckless habits his handsome nervous face had grown more placid and contented his long curls had been conventionally clipped he had gained flesh unmistakably and the lower buttons of the slim waistcoat he had worn to church that memorable sunday were too tight for comfort or looks he was happy yet as he glanced over the material spring landscape full of practical health blossom and promise of fruition it struck him that the breeze that blew over it was chilly even if healthful and he shivered slightly  he reached the hotel entered the office glanced at the register and passed through into his private room he had been away for two days and noticed with gratification that the influx of visitors was still increasing his clerk followed into the room  theres a lady in 56 who wanted to see you when you returned she asked particularly for the manager  who is she  dont know its a mrs merrydew from sacramento expecting her husband on the next steamer  humph youll have to be rather careful about these solitary married women we dont want another scandal you know  she asked for you by name sir and i thought you might know her returned the clerk  very well ill go up  he sent a waiter ahead to announce him and leisurely mounted the stairs no 56 was the sittingroom of a private suite on the first floor the waiter was holding the door open as he approached it a faint perfume from the interior made him turn pale but he recovered his presence of mind sufficiently to close the door sharply upon the waiter behind him  jim said a voice which thrilled him  he looked up and beheld what any astute reader of romance will have already suspectedthe woman to whom he believed he owed his ruin in san francisco she was as beautiful and alluring as ever albeit she was thinner and more spiritual than he had ever seen her she was tastefully dressed as she had always been a certain style of languorous silken deshabille which she was wont to affect in better health now became her paler cheek and feverishly brilliant eyes there was the same opulence of lace and ornament and whether by accident or design clasped around the slight wrist of her extended hand was a bracelet which he remembered had swept away the last dregs of his fortune  he took her hand mechanically yet knowing whatever rage was in his heart he had not the strength to refuse it  they told me it was mrs merrydew he stammered  that was my mothers name she said with a little laugh i thought you knew it but perhaps you didnt when i got my divorce from dickyou didnt know that either i suppose its three months agoi didnt care to take my maiden name again too many people remembered it so after the decree was made i called myself mrs merrydew you had disappeared they said you had gone east  but the clerk says you are expecting your husband on the steamer what does this mean why did you tell him that he had so far collected himself that there was a ring of inquisition in his voice  oh i had to give him some kind of reason for my being alone when i did not find you as i expected she said half wearily then a change came over her tired face a smile of mingled audacity and tentative coquetry lit up the small features perhaps it is true perhaps i may have a husband coming on the steamerthat depends sit down jim  she let his hand drop and pointed to an armchair from which she had just risen and sank down herself in a corner of the sofa her thin fingers playing with and drawing themselves through the tassels of the cushion  you see jim as soon as i was free louis sylvesteryou remember louis sylvesterwanted to marry me and even thought that he was the cause of dicks divorcing me he actually went east to settle up some property he had left him there and hes coming on the steamer  louis sylvester repeated reddy staring at her why he was a bigger fool than i was and a worse man he added bitterly  i believe he was said the lady smiling and i think he still is but she added glancing at reddy under her light fringed lids youyoure regularly reformed arent you youre stouter too and altogether more solid and commercial looking yet whod have thought of your keeping a hotel or ever doing anything but speculate in wildcat or play at draw poker how did you drift into it come tell me im not mrs sylvester just yet and maybe i might like to go into the business too you dont want a partner do you  her manner was light and irresponsible or rather it suggested a childlike putting of all responsibility for her actions upon others which he remembered now too well perhaps it was this which kept him from observing that the corners of her smiling lips however twitched slightly and that her fingers twisting the threads of the tassel were occasionally stiffened nervously for he burst out oh yes he had drifted into it when it was a toss up if it wasnt his body instead that would be found drifting out to sea from the first wharf of san francisco yes he had been a common laborera farm hand in those fields she had passeda waiter in the farm kitchen and but for luck he might be taking her orders now in this very hotel it was not her fault if he was not in the gutter  she raised her thin hand with a tired gesture as if to ward off the onset of his words the same old jim she repeated and yet i thought you had forgotten all that now and become calmer and more sensible since you had taken flesh and grown so matter of fact you ought to have known then as you know now that i never could have been anything to you as long as i was tied to dick and you know you forced your presents on me jim i took them from you because i would take nothing from dick for i hated him and i never knew positively that you were in straits then you know you always talked big jim and were always going to make your fortune with the next thing you had in hand  it was true and he remembered it he had not intended this kind of recrimination but he was exasperated with her wearied acceptance of his reproaches and by a sudden conviction that his longcherished grievance against her now that he had voiced it was inadequate mean and trifling yet he could not help saying  then you had presents from sylvester too i presume you did not hate him either  he would have married me the day after i got my divorce  and so would i burst out reddy  she looked at him fixedly you would she said with a peculiar emphasis and now  he colored it had been part of his revengeful purpose on seeing her to tell her of his engagement to kelly he now found himself tonguetied irresolute and ashamed yet he felt she was reading his innermost thoughts  she however only lowered her eyes and with the same tired expression said no matter now let us talk of something nearer that was two months ago and so you have charge of this hotel i like it so much i mean the place itself i fancy i could live here forever it is so far away and restful i am so sick of towns and cities and people and this little grove is so secluded if one had merely a little cottage here one might be so happy  what did she meanwhat did she expectwhat did she think of doing she must be got rid of before kellys arrival and yet he found himself wavering under her potent and yet scarcely exerted influence the desperation of weakness is apt to be more brutal than the determination of strength he remembered why he had come upstairs and blurted out but you cant stay here the rules are very stringent in regard toto strangers like yourself it will be known who you really are and what people say of you even your divorce will tell against you its all wrong i knowbut what can i do i didnt make the rules i am only a servant of the landlord and must carry them out  she leaned back against the sofa and laughed silently but she presently recovered herself although with the same expression of fatigue dont be alarmed my poor jim if you mean your friend mr woodridge i know him it was he himself who suggested my coming here and dont misunderstand himnor me either hes only a good friend of sylvesters they had some speculation together hes coming here to see me after louis arrives hes waiting in san francisco for his wife and daughter who come on the same steamer so you see you wont get into trouble on my account dont look so scared my dear boy  does he know that you knew me said reddy with a white face  perhaps but then that was three months ago returned the lady smiling and you know how you have reformed since and grown ever so much more steady and respectable  did he talk to you of me continued reddy still aghast  a littlecomplimentary of course dont look so frightened i didnt give you away  her laugh suddenly ceased and her face changed into a more nervous activity as she rose and went toward the window she had heard the sound of wheels outsidethe coach had just arrived  theres mr woodridge now she said in a more animated voice the steamer must be in but i dont see louis do you  she turned to where reddy was standing but he was gone  the momentary animation of her face changed she lifted her shoulders with a half gesture of scorn but in the midst of it suddenly threw herself on the sofa and buried her face in her hands  a few moments elapsed with the bustle of arrival in the hall and passages then there was a hesitating step at her door she quickly passed her handkerchief over her wet eyes and resumed her former look of weary acceptation the door opened but it was mr woodridge who entered the rough shirtsleeved ranchman had developed during the last four months into an equally blunt but soberly dressed proprietor his keen energetic face however wore an expression of embarrassment and anxiety with an added suggestion of a half humorous appreciation of it  i wouldnt have disturbed you mrs merrydew he said with a gentle bluntness if i hadnt wanted to ask your advice before i saw reddy im keeping out of his way until i could see you i left nelly and her mother in frisco theres been some queer goingson on the steamer coming home kelly has sprang a new game on her mother andand suthin that looks as if there might be a new deal however here a sense that he was perhaps treating his statement too seriously stopped him and he smiled reassuringly that is as may be  i dont know he went on as i ever told you anything about my kelly and reddypartiklerly about kelly shes a good girl a square girl but shes got some allfired romantic ideas in her head mebbee it kem from her reading mebbee it kem from her not knowing other girls or seeing too much of a queer sort of men but she got an interest in the bad ones and thought it was her mission to reform themreform them by pure kindness attentive little sisterly ways and moral example she first tried her hand on reddy when he first kem to us he waswell he was a blazin ruin she took him in hand yanked him outer himself put his foot on the bedrock and made him what you see him now wellwhat happened why he got reglarly soft on her wanted to marry her and i agreed conditionally of course to keep him up to the mark did you speak  no said the lady with her bright eyes fixed upon him  well that was all well and good and id liked to have carried out my part of the contract and was willing and am still but you see kelly after shed landed reddy on firm ground got a little tired i reckon gallike of the thing shed worked so easily and when she went east she looked around for some other wreck to try her hand on and she found it on the steamer coming back and who do you think it was why our friend louis sylvester  mrs merrydew smiled slightly with her bright eyes still on the speaker  well you know he is fast at timesif he is a friend of mineand she reglarly tackled him and as my old woman says it was a sight to see her go for him but then he didnt tumble to it no reformin aint in his line im afeard and what was the result why kelly only got all the more keen when she found she couldnt manage him like reddyand between you and me shed have liked reddy more if he hadnt been so easyand its ended i reckon in her now falling dead in love with sylvester she swears she wont marry any one else and wants to devote her whole life to him now whats to be done reddy dont know it yet and i dont know how to tell him kelly says her mission was ended when she made a new man of him and he oughter be thankful for that couldnt you kinder break the news to him and tell him there aint any show for him  does he love the girl so much then said the lady gently  yes but i am afraid there is no hope for reddy as long as she thinks theres a chance of her capturing sylvester  the lady rose and went to the writingtable would it be any comfort to you mr woodridge if you were told that she had not the slightest chance with sylvester  yes  she wrote a few lines on a card put it in an envelope and handed it to woodridge find out where sylvester is in san francisco and give him that card i think it will satisfy you and now as i have to catch the return coach in ten minutes i must ask you to excuse me while i put my things together  and you wont first break the news to reddy for me  no and i advise you to keep the whole matter to yourself for the present goodby  she smiled again fascinatingly as usual but as it seemed to him a trifle wearily and then passed into the inner room years after in his practical matter of fact recollections of this strange woman he always remembered her by this smile  but she had sufficiently impressed him by her parting adjuration to cause him to answer reddys eager inquiries with the statement that kelly and her mother were greatly preoccupied with some friends in san francisco and to speedily escape further questioning reddys disappointment was somewhat mitigated by the simultaneous announcement of mrs merrydews departure but he was still more relieved and gratified to hear a few days later of the marriage of mrs merrydew with louis sylvester if to the general surprise and comment it excited he contributed only a smile of cynical toleration and superior selfcomplacency the reader will understand and not blame him nor did the public who knew the austere completeness of his reform nor did mr woodridge who failed to understand the only actor in this little comedy who might perhaps have differed from them all  a month later james reddy married kelly woodridge in the chilly little church at oakdale perhaps by that time it might have occurred to him that although the freshness and fruition of summer were everywhere the building seemed to be still unwarmed and when he stepped forth with his bride and glanced across the prosperous landscape toward the distant bay and headlands of san francisco he shivered slightly at the dryly practical kiss of the keen northwestern trades  but he was prosperous and comfortable thereafter as the respectable owner of broad lands and paying shares it was said that mrs reddy contributed much to the popularity of the hotel by her charming freedom from prejudice and sympathy with mankind but this was perhaps only due to the contrast to her more serious and at times abstracted husband at least this was the charitable opinion of the proverbially tolerant and kindhearted baroness streichholzer nee merrydew and relict of the late lamented louis sylvester esq whom i recently had the pleasure of meeting at wiesbaden where the waters and reposeful surroundings strongly reminded her of oakdale     the heir of the mchulishes   i   the consul for the united states of america at the port of st kentigern was sitting alone in the settled gloom of his private office yet it was only high noon of a seasonable winters day by the face of the clock that hung like a pallid moon on the murky wall opposite to him what else could be seen of the apartment by the faint light that struggled through the pall of fog outside the lustreless windows presented the ordinary aspect of a business sanctum there were a shelf of fogbound admiralty law one or two colored prints of ocean steamships under full steam bow on tremendously foreshortened and seeming to force themselves through shadowy partitions there were engravings of lincoln and washington as unsubstantial and shadowy as the dead themselves outside against the window which was almost level with the street an occasional procession of black silhouetted figures of men and women with prayerbooks in their hands and gloom on their faces seemed to be born of the fog and prematurely to return to it at which a conviction of sin overcame the consul he remembered that it was the sabbath day and that he had no business to be at the consulate at all  unfortunately with this shameful conviction came the sound of a bell ringing somewhere in the depths of the building and the shuffling of feet on the outer steps the light of his fire had evidently been seen and like a beacon had attracted some wandering and possibly intoxicated mariner with american papers the consul walked into the hall with a sudden righteous frigidity of manner it was one thing to be lounging in ones own office on the sabbath day and quite another to be deliberately calling there on business  he opened the front door and a middleaged man entered accompanying and partly shoving forward a more diffident and younger one neither appeared to be a sailor although both were dressed in that dingy respectability and remoteness of fashion affected by second and third mates when ashore they were already well in the hall and making their way toward the private office when the elder man said with an air of casual explanation lookin for the american consul i reckon this yers the consulate  it is the consulate said the official dryly and i am the consul but  thats all right interrupted the stranger pushing past him and opening the door of the private office into which he shoved his companion thar now he continued to the diffident youth pointing to a chair and quite ignoring the presence of the consul thars a bit of america sit down thar youre under the flag now and can do as you darn please nevertheless he looked a little disappointed as he glanced around him as if he had expected a different environment and possibly a different climate  i presume said the consul suavely you wish to see me on some urgent matter for you probably know that the consulate is closed on sunday to ordinary business i am here myself quite accidentally  then you dont live here said the visitor disappointedly  no  i reckon thats the reason why we didnt see no flag aflyin when we was ahuntin this place yesterday we were directed here but i says to malcolm says i no it aint here or youd see the stars and stripes afore youd see anythin else but i reckon you float it over your house eh  the consul here explained smilingly that he did not fly a flag over his lodgings and that except on national holidays it was not customary to display the national ensign on the consulate  then you cant do hereand you a consulwhat any nigger can do in the states eh thats about how it pans out dont it but i didnt think youd tumble to it quite so quick jack  at this mention of his christian name the consul turned sharply on the speaker a closer scrutiny of the face before him ended with a flash of reminiscence the fog without and within seemed to melt away he was standing once more on a western hillside with this man a hundred miles of sparkling sunshine and crisp dry air stretching around him and above a blue and arched sky that roofed the third of a continent with six months summer and then the fog seemed to come back heavier and thicker to his consciousness he emotionally stretched out his hand to the stranger but it was the fog and his personal surroundings which now seemed to be unreal  why its harry custer he said with a laugh that however ended in a sigh i didnt recognize you in this half light he then glanced curiously toward the diffident young man as if to identify another possible old acquaintance  well i spotted you from the first said custer though i aint seen you since we were in scotts camp together thats ten years ago youre lookin at him he continued following the consuls wandering eye well its about him that i came to see you this yers a mchulisha genuine mchulish  he paused as if to give effect to this statement but the name apparently offered no thrilling suggestion to the consul who regarded the young man closely for further explanation he was a fairfaced youth of about twenty years with pale reddishbrown eyes dark hair reddish at the roots and a singular white and pink waxiness of oval cheek which however narrowed suddenly at the angle of the jaw and fell away with the retreating chin  yes continued custer i oughter say the only mchulish he is the direct heirand of royal descent hes one of them mchulishes whose name in them old history times was enough to whoop up the boys and make em paint the town red a regular campaign boomerthe old mchulish was stump speeches and brassbands warnt in it with the boys when he was around theyd go their bottom dollar and last cartridgeif theyd had cartridges in them dayson him that was the regular mchulish gait and malcolm theres the last of emgot the same style of features too  ludicrous as the situation was it struck the consul dimly as through fog and darkness that the features of the young man were not unfamiliar and indeed had looked out upon him dimly and vaguely at various times from various historic canvases it was the face of complacent fatuity incompetency and inconstancy which had dragged down strength competency and constancy to its own idiotic fate and levelsa face for whose weaknesses valor and beauty had not only sacrificed themselves but made things equally unpleasant to a great many minor virtues nevertheless the consul with an amused sense of its ridiculous incongruity to the grim scottish sabbath procession in the street and the fogbound volumes of admiralty law in the room smiled affably  of course our young friend has no desire to test the magic of his name here in these degenerate days  no said custer complacently though between you and me old man theres always no tellin what might turn up over in this yer monarchy things of course are different over our way but jest now malcolm will be satisfied to take the title and property to which hes rightful heir  the consuls face fell alas it was only the old old story its endless repetitions and variations had been familiar to him even in his youth and in his own land ef that man had his rights had once been pointed out to him in a wild western camp hed be now sittin in scarlet on the right of the queen of england the gentleman who was indicated in this apocalyptical vision it appeared simply bore a singular likeness to a reigning hanoverian family which for some unexplained reason he had contented himself with bearing with fortitude and patience but it was in his official capacity that the consuls experience had been the most trying at times it had seemed to him that much of the real property and peerage of great britain was the inherited right of penniless american republicans who had hitherto refrained from presenting their legal claims and that the habitual first duty of generations of british noblemen on coming into their estates and titles was to ship their heirs and next of kin to america and then forget all about them he had listened patiently to claims to positions more or less exaltedclaims often presented with ingenuous sophistry or pathetic simplicity prosecuted with great good humor and abandoned with invincible cheerfulness but they seldom culminated more seriously than in the disbursement of a few dollars by the consul to enable the rightful owner of millions to procure a steerage passage back to his previous democratic retirement there had been others less sincere but more pretentious in quality to whom however a letter to the heralds college in london was all sufficient and who on payment of various fees and emoluments were enabled to stagger back to new york or boston with certain unclaimed and forgotten luggage which a more gallant ancestor had scorned to bring with him into the new life or had thrown aside in his undue haste to make them citizens of the republic still all this had grown monotonous and wearisome and was disappointing as coming through the intervention of an old friend who ought to know better  of course you have already had legal opinion on the subject over there said the consul with a sigh but here you know you ought first to get some professional advice from those acquainted with scotch procedure but perhaps you have that too  no said custer cheerfully why it aint only two months ago that i first saw malcolm tumbled over him on his own farm jest out of maccorkleville kentucky where he and his fathers before him had been livin nigh a hundred yearsyes a hundred years by jove ever since they first emigrated to the country had a talk over it saw an old bible about as big and as used up as thatlifting the wellworn consular biblewith dates in it and heard the whole story and here we are  and you have consulted no lawyer gasped the consul  the mchulishes said an unexpected voice that sounded thin and feminine never took any legal decision from the craggy summits of glen crankie he lifted the banner of his forefathers or raised the warcry hulish dhu ieroe from the battlements of craigiedurrach and the clan gathered round him with shouts that rent the air that was the way of it in old times and the boys whooped him up and stood by him it was the diffident young man who had half spoken half recited with an odd enthusiasm that even the culminating slang could not make conventional  thats about the size of it said custer leaning back in his chair easily with an approving glance at the young man and i dont know if that aint the way to work the thing now  the consul stared hopelessly from the one to the other it had always seemed possible that this dreadful mania might develop into actual insanity and he had little doubt but that the younger mans brain was slightly affected but this did not account for the delusion and expectations of the elder harry custer as the consul remembered him was a levelheaded practical miner whose leaning to adventure and excitement had not prevented him from being a cool speculator and he had amassed more than a competency by reason of his judicious foresight and prompt action yet he was evidently under the glamour of this madman although outwardly as lazily selfcontained as ever  do you mean to tell me said the consul in a suppressed voice that you two have come here equipped only with a statement of facts and a family bible and that you expect to take advantage of a feudal enthusiasm which no longer existsand perhaps never did exist out of the pages of romanceas a means of claiming estates whose titles have long since been settled by law and can be claimed only under that tenure surely i have misunderstood you you cannot be in earnest  honest injun said custer nodding his head lazily we mean it but not jest that way youve put it fr instance it aint only us two this yer thing ole pard were runnin as a syndicate  a syndicate echoed the consul  a syndicate repeated custer half the boys that were at eagle camp are in it and two of malcolms neighbors from kentuckythe regular old scotch breed like himself for you know that maccorkle county was settled by them old scotch covenanters and the folks are scotch presbyterians to this day and for the matter of that the eagle boys that are in it are of scotch descent or a kind of blend you know in fact im half scotch myselfor irish he added thoughtfully so you see that settles your argument about any local opinion for if them scots dont know their own people who does  may i ask said the consul with a desperate attempt to preserve his composure what you are proposing to do  well said custer settling himself comfortably back in his chair again that depends do you remember the time that we jumped them mexican claims on the north forkthe time them greasers wanted to take in the whole riverbank because theyd found gold on one of the upper bars seems to me we jest went peacefullike over there one moonshiny night and took up their stakes and set down ours seems to me you were one of the party  that was in our own country returned the consul hastily and was an indefensible act even in a lawless frontier civilization but you are surely not mad enough even to conceive of such a thing here  keep your hair on jack said custer lazily whats the matter with constitutional methods eh do you remember the time when we didnt like pueblo rules and we laid out eureka city on their lines and whooped up the mexicans and diggers to elect mayor and aldermen and put the city front on juanita creek and then corraled it for water lots seems to me you were county clerk then now whos to keep dick macgregor and joe hamilton that are both up the nile now from droppin in over here to see malcolm in his own house whos goin to object to wallace or baird who are on this side doin the eytalian lakes from comin here on their way home or watson and moore and timley that are livin over in paris from joinin the boys in givin malcolm a housewarmin in his old home whats to keep the whole syndicate from gatherin at kelpie island up here off the west coast among the tombs of malcolms ancestors and fixin up things generally with the clan  only one thing said the consul with a gravity which he nevertheless felt might be a mistaken attitude you shouldnt have told me about it for if as your old friend i cannot keep you from committing an unconceivable folly as the american consul here it will be my first duty to give notice to our legation and perhaps warn the authorities and you may be sure i will do it  to his surprise custer leaned forward and pressed his hand with an expression of cheerful relief thats so old pard i reckoned on it in fact i told malcolm that that would be about your gait of course you couldnt do otherwise and it would have been playin it rather low down on you to have left you out in the coldwithout even that show in the game for what you will do in warnin the other fellows dont you see will just waken up the clan its better than a campaign circular  dont be too sure of that said the consul with a halfhysterical laugh but we wont consider so lamentable a contingency come and dine with me both of you and well discuss the only thing worth discussingyour legal rightsand you can tell me your whole story which by the way i havent heard  sorry jack but it cant be done said custer with his first approach to seriousness of manner you see wed made up our mind not to come here again after this first call we aint goin to compromise you  i am the best judge of that returned the consul dryly then suddenly changing his manner he grasped custers hands with both his own come harry he said earnestly i will not believe that this is not a joke but i beg of you to promise me one thingdo not move a step further in this matter without legal counsel i will give you a letter to a legal friend of minea man of affairs a man of the world and a scot as typical perhaps as any you have mentioned state your legal case to himonly that but his opinion will show you also if i am not mistaken the folly of your depending upon any sectional or historical sentiment in this matter  without waiting for a reply he sat down and hastily wrote a few lines to a friendly local magnate when he had handed the note to custer the latter looked at the address and showed it to his young companion  same name isnt it he asked  yes responded mr mchulish  do you know him asked the consul evidently surprised  we dont but hes a friend of one of the eagle boys i reckon we would have seen him anyhow but well agree with you to hold on until we do its a go goodby old pard so long  they both shook the consuls hand and departed leaving him staring at the fog into which they had melted as if they were unreal shadows of the past   ii   the next morning the fog had given way to a palpable horizontally driving rain which wet the inside as well as the outside of umbrellas and caused them to be presented at every conceivable angle as they drifted past the windows of the consulate there was a tap at the door and a clerk entered  ye will be in to sir james macfen  the consul nodded and added show him in here  it was the magnate to whom he had sent the note the previous day a man of large yet slow and cautious nature learned and even pedantic yet farsighted and practical very human and hearty in social intercourse which however left him as it found himwith no sentimental or unbusinesslike entanglements the consul had known him sensible and sturdy at board meetings and executive councils logical and convincing at political gatherings decorous and grave in the kirk and humorous and jovial at festivities where perhaps later in the evening in company with others hands were clasped over a libation lyrically defined as a right guid williewaught on one of these occasions they had walked home together not without some ostentation of steadiness yet when macfens eminently respectable front door had closed upon him the consul was perfectly satisfied that a distinctly proper and unswerving man of business would issue from it the next morning  ay but its a soft day said sir james removing his gloves yell not be gadding about in this weather  you got my note of introduction i suppose said the consul when the momentous topic of the weather was exhausted  oh ay  and you saw the gentlemen  ay  and whats your opinion ofhis claims  hes a fine ladthat malcolma fine type of a lad said sir james with an almost too effusive confidence yell be thinking so yourselfno doubt ay its wonderful to consider the preservation of type so long after its dispersal in other lands and its a strange and wonderful country that of yours with its plantationsas one might sayof homogeneity unimpaired for so many years and keeping the old faith tooand all its strange survivals ay and that kentucky where his land isit will be a rich state its very instructing and interesting to hear his account of that remarkable region they call the blue grass country and the stock they raise there im obliged to ye my friend for a most edifying and improving evening  but his claimdid he not speak of that  oh ay and that mr custerhes a grand man and an amusing one yell be great comrades you and he man it was delightful to hear him tell of the rare doings and the bit fun ye two had in the old times eh sir but whod think that of the proper american consul at st kentigern and sir james leaned back in his chair and bestowed an admiring smile on that official  the consul thought he began to understand this evasion then you dont think much of mr mchulishs claim he said  im not saying that  but do you really think a claim based upon a family bible and a family likeness a subject for serious consideration  im not saying that either laddie  perhaps he has confided to you more fully than he has to me or possibly you yourself knew something in corroboration of his facts  his companion had evidently no desire to be communicative but the consul had heard enough to feel that he was justified in leaving the matter in his hands he had given him fair warning yet nevertheless he would be even more explicit  i do not know he began whether this young mchulish confided to you his great reliance upon some peculiar effect of his presence among the tenants and of establishing his claim to the property by exciting the enthusiasm of the clan it certainly struck me that he had some rather exaggerated ideas borrowed perhaps from romances hed read like don quixote his books of chivalry he seems to believe in the existence of a clan loyalty and the actual survival of old feudal instincts and of old feudal methods in the highlands he appears to look upon himself as a kind of local prince charlie and by jove ive an idea hes almost as crazy  and why should he na believe in his own kith and kin said sir james quickly with a sudden ring in his voice and a dialectical freedom quite distinct from his former deliberate and cautious utterance the mchulishes were chieftains before america was discovered and manys the time they overran the border before they went as far as that if theres anything in blood and loyalty it would be strange if they did na respond and i can tell ye ma frien theres more in the hielands than any romancer as ye call themay even scott hissel and he was but an edinboro manever dreamed of dont fash yoursel about that and you and mell not agree about prince charlie some day ill tell ye ma frien mair aboot that bonnie laddie than yell gather from your partisan historians until then yell be wise when yell be talking to scotchmen not to be expressing your southern prejudices  intensely surprised and amused at this sudden outbreak of enthusiasm on the part of the usually cautious lawyer the consul could not refrain from accenting it by a marked return to practical business  i shall be delighted to learn more about prince charlie he said smiling but just now his prototypeif youll allow me to call him sois a nearer topic and for the present at least until he assume his new titles and dignities has a right to claim my protection and i am responsible for him as an american citizen now my dear friend is there really any property land or title of any importance involved in his claim and what and where in heavens name is it for i assure you i know nothing practical about it and cannot make head or tail of it  sir james resumed his slow serenity and gathered up his gloves ay theres a great deerforest in ballochbrinkie and theres part of loch phillibeg in cairngormshire and theres kelpie island off moreovershire ay theres enough land when the crofters are cleared off and the small sheeptenants evicted it will be a grand property then  the consul stared the crofters and tenants evicted he repeated are they not part of the clan and loyal to the mchulish  the mchulish said sir james with great deliberation hasnt set foot there for years theyd be burning him in effigy  but said the astonished consul thats rather bad for the expectant heirand the magic of the mchulish presence  im not saying that returned sir james cautiously ye see he can be making better arrangements with the family on account of it  with the family repeated the consul then does he talk of compromising  i mean they would be more likely to sell for a fair consideration and hed be better paying money to them than the lawyers the syndicate will be rich eh and im not saying the mchulish wouldnt take kentucky lands in exchange its a fine country that blue grass district  the consul stared at sir james so long that a faint smile came into the latters shrewd eyes at which the consul smiled too a vague air of relief and understanding seemed to fill the apartment  oh ay continued sir james drawing on his gloves with easy deliberation hes a fine lad that malcolm and its a praiseworthy instinct in him to wish to return to the land of his forebears and take his place again among them and im noticing mr consul that a great many of your countrymen are doing the same eh yours is a gran country of progress and ceevel and religious liberty but for a that as burns says its in your blood to turn to the auld home again and its a fine thing to have the money to do itand im thinking money well spent all around goodmorning eh but im forgetting that i wanted to ask you to dine with me and malcolm and your mr custer and mr watson who will be one of your syndicate and whom i once met abroad but yell get a bit note of invitation with the day from me later  the consul remembered that custer had said that one of the eagle boys had known sir james this was evidently watson he smiled again but this time sir james responded only in a general sort of way as he genially bowed himself out of the room  the consul watched his solid and eminently respectable figure as it passed the window and then returned to his desk still smiling first of all he was relieved what had seemed to him a wild and reckless enterprise with possibly some grim international complications on the part of his compatriots had simply resolved itself into an ordinary business speculationthe ethics of which they had pretty equally divided with the local operators if anything it seemed that the scotchman would get the best of the bargain and that for once at least his countrymen were deficient in foresight but that was a matter between the parties and custer himself would probably be the first to resent any suggestion of the kind from the consul the vision of the mchulish burned in effigy by his devoted tenants and retainers and the thought that the prosaic dollars of his countrymen would be substituted for the potent presence of the heir tickled it is to be feared the saturnine humor of the consul he had taken an invincible dislike to the callow representative of the mchulish who he felt had in some extraordinary way imposed upon custers credulity but then he had apparently imposed equally upon the practical sir james the thought of this sham ideal of feudal and privileged incompetency being elevated to actual position by the combined efforts of american republicans and hardheaded scotch dissenters on whom the soft scotch mists fell from above with equal impartiality struck him as being very amusing and for some time thereafter lightened the respectable gloom of his office other engagements prevented his attendance at sir jamess dinner although he was informed afterward that it had passed off with great eclat the later singing of auld lang syne and the drinking of the health of custer and malcolm with hieland honors he learned also that sir james had invited custer and malcolm to his lacustrine countryseat in the early spring but he learned nothing more of the progress of malcolms claim its details or the manner in which it was prosecuted no one else seemed to know anything about it it found no echo in the gossip of the clubs or in the newspapers of st kentigern in the absence of the parties connected with it it began to assume to him the aspect of a halfhumorous romance he often found himself wondering if there had been any other purpose in this quest or speculation than what had appeared on the surface it seemed so inadequate in result it would have been so perfectly easy for a wealthy syndicate to buy up a much more valuable estate he disbelieved utterly in the sincerity of malcolms sentimental attitude there must be some other reasonperhaps not known even to the syndicate  one day he thought that he had found it he had received a note addressed from one of the principal hotels but bearing a large personal crest on paper and envelope a miss kirkby passing through st kentigern on her way to edinburgh desired to see the consul the next day if he would appoint an hour at the consulate or as her time was limited she would take it as a great favor if he would call at her hotel although a countrywoman her name might not be so well known to him as those of her old friends harry custer esq and sir malcolm mchulish the consul was a little surprised the use of the titleunless it referred to some other mchulishwould seem to indicate that malcolms claim was successful he had however no previous knowledge of the title of sir in connection with the estate and it was probable that his fair correspondentlike most of her countrywomenwas more appreciative than correct in her bestowal of dignities he determined to waive his ordinary business rules and to call upon her at once accepting as became his patriotism that charming tyranny which the american woman usually reserves exclusively for her devoted countrymen  she received him with an affectation of patronage as if she had lately become uneasily conscious of being in a country where there were distinctions of class she was young pretty and tastefully dressed the national feminine adaptability had not however extended to her voice and accent both were strongly southwestern and as she began to speak she seemed to lose her momentary affectation  it was mighty good of you to come and see me for the fact is i didnt admire going to your consulatenot one bit you see im a southern girl and never was reconstructed either i dont hanker after your govment i havent recognized it and dont want to i reckon i aint been under the flag since the wah so you see i havent any papers to get authenticated nor any certificates to ask for and aint wanting any advice or protection i thought id be fair and square with you from the word go  nothing could be more fascinating and infectious than the mirthful ingenuousness which accompanied and seemed to mitigate this ungracious speech and the consul was greatly amused albeit conscious that it was only an attitude and perhaps somewhat worn in sentiment he knew that during the war of the rebellion and directly after it great britain was the resort of certain americans from the west as well as from the south who sought social distinction by the affectation of dissatisfaction with their own government or the ostentatious simulation of enforced exile but he was quite unprepared for this senseless protraction of dead and gone issues he ventured to point out with goodhumored practicality that several years had elapsed since the war that the south and north were honorably reconciled and that he was legally supposed to represent kentucky as well as new york your friends he added smilingly mr custer and mr mchulish seemed to accept the fact without any posthumous sentiment  i dont go much on that she said with a laugh ive been living in paris till mawwhos lying down upstairscame over and brought me across to england for a look around and i reckon malcolms got to keep touch with you on account of his property  the consul smiled ah then i hope you can tell me something about that for i really dont know whether he has established his claim or not  why returned the girl with naive astonishment that was just what i was going to ask you he reckoned youd know all about it  i havent heard anything of the claim for two months said the consul but from your reference to him as sir malcolm i presumed you considered it settled though of course even then he wouldnt be sir malcolm and you might have meant somebody else  well then lord malcolmi cant get the hang of those titles yet  neither lord nor sir you know the estate carries no title whatever with it said the consul smilingly  but wouldnt he be the laird of something or other you know  yes but that is only a scotch description not a title its not the same as lord  the young girl looked at him with undisguised astonishment a half laugh twitched the corners of her mouth are you sure she said  perfectly returned the consul a little impatiently but do i understand that you really know nothing more of the progress of the claim  miss kirkby still abstracted by some humorous astonishment said quickly wait a minute ill just run up and see if maws coming down shed admire to see you then she stopped hesitated and as she rose added then a lairds wife wouldnt be lady anything anyway would she  she certainly would acquire no title merely through her marriage  the young girl laughed again nodded and disappeared the consul amused yet somewhat perplexed over the naive brusqueness of the interview waited patiently presently she returned a little out of breath but apparently still enjoying some facetious retrospect and said maw will be down soon after a pause fixing her bright eyes mischievously on the consul she continued  did you see much of malcolm  i saw him only once  what did you think of him  the consul in so brief a period had been unable to judge  you wouldnt think i was half engaged to him would you  the consul was obliged again to protest that in so short an interview he had been unable to conceive of malcolms good fortune  i know what you mean said the girl lightly you think hes a crank but its all over now the engagements off  i trust that this does not mean that you doubt his success  the lady shrugged her shoulders disdainfully thats all right enough i reckon theres a hundred thousand dollars in the syndicate maw put in twenty thousand and custers bound to make it goparticularly as theres some talk of a compromise but malcolms a crank and i reckon if it wasnt for the compromise the syndicate wouldnt have much show why he didnt even know that the mchulishes had no title  do you think he has been suffering under a delusion in regard to his relationship  no he was only a fool in the way he wanted to prove it he actually got these boys to think it could be filibustered into his possession had a sort of idea of a rising in the highlands you know like that poem or picturewhich is it and those fool boys and custer among them thought it would be great fun and a great spree luckily maw had the gumption to get watson to write over about it to one of his friends a mrmrmacfen a very prominent man  perhaps you mean sir james macfen suggested the consul hes a knight and what did he say he added eagerly  oh he wrote a most sensible letter returned the lady apparently mollified by the title of watsons adviser saying that there was little doubt if any that if the american mchulishes wanted the old estate they could get it by the expenditure of a little capital he offered to make the trial that was the compromise theyre talking about but he didnt say anything about there being no lord mchulish  perhaps he thought as you were americans you didnt care for that said the consul dryly  thats no reason why we shouldnt have it if it belonged to us or we chose to pay for it said the lady pertly  then your changed personal relations with mr mchulish is the reason why you hear so little of his progress or his expectations  yes but he dont know that they are changed for we havent seen him since weve been here although they say hes here and hiding somewhere about  why should he be hiding  the young girl lifted her pretty brows maybe he thinks its mysterious didnt i tell you he was a crank yet she laughed so naively and with such sublime unconsciousness of any reflection on herself that the consul was obliged to smile too  you certainly do not seem to be breaking your heart as well as your engagement he said  not muchbut here comes maw look here she said turning suddenly and coaxingly upon him if she asks you to come along with us up north youll come wont you do it will be such fun  up north repeated the consul interrogatively  yes to see the property heres maw  a more languid but equally wellappointed woman had entered the room when the ceremony of introduction was over she turned to her daughter and said run away dear while i talk business witherthis gentleman and as the girl withdrew laughingly she half stifled a reminiscent yawn and raised her heavy lids to the consul  youve had a talk with my elsie  the consul confessed to having had that pleasure  she speaks her mind said mrs kirkby wearily but she means well and for all her flightiness her heads level and since her father died she runs me she continued with a slight laugh after a pause she added abstractedly i suppose she told you of her engagement to young mchulish  yes but she said she had broken it  mrs kirkby lifted her eyebrows with an expression of relief it was a piece of girl and boy foolishness anyway she said elsie and he were children together at maccorklevillesecond cousins in factand i reckon he got her fancy excited over his nobility and his being the chief of the mchulishes of course custer will manage to get something for the shareholders out of iti never knew him to fail in a money speculation yetbut i think thats about all i had an idea of going up with elsie to take a look at the property and i thought of asking you to join us did elsie tell you i know shed like itand so would i  for all her indolent purposeless manner there was enough latent sincerity and earnestness in her request to interest the consul besides his own curiosity in regard to this singularly supported claim was excited and here seemed to be an opportunity of satisfying it he was not quite sure either that his previous antagonism to his fair countrywomans apparent selfishness and snobbery was entirely just he had been absent from america a long time perhaps it was he himself who had changed and lost touch with his compatriots and yet the demonstrative independence and recklessness of men like custer were less objectionable to and less inconsistent with his american ideas than the snobbishness and almost servile adaptability of the women or was it possible that it was only a weakness of the sex which no republican nativity or education could eliminate nevertheless he looked up smilingly  but the property is i understand scattered about in various places he said  oh but we mean to go only to kelpie island where there is the ruin of an old castle elsie must see that  the consul thought it might be amusing by all means let us see that i shall be delighted to go with you  his ready and unqualified assent appeared to relieve and dissipate the ladys abstraction she became more natural and confiding spoke freely of malcolms mania which she seemed to accept as a hallucination or a conviction with equal cheerfulness and in brief convinced the consul that her connection with the scheme was only the caprice of inexperienced and unaccustomed idleness he left her promising to return the next day and arrange for their early departure  his way home lay through one of the public squares of st kentigern at an hour of the afternoon when it was crossed by working men and women returning to their quarters from the docks and factories never in any light a picturesque or even cheery procession there were days when its unwholesome monotonous poverty and dull hopelessness of prospect impressed him more forcibly he remembered how at first the spectacle of barefooted girls and women slipping through fog and mist across the greasy pavement had offended his fresh new world conception of a more tenderly nurtured sex until his susceptibilities seemed to have grown as callous and hardened as the flesh he looked upon and he had begun to regard them from the easy local standpoint of a distinct and differently equipped class  it chanced also that this afternoon some of the male workers had added to their usual solidity a singular trancelike intoxication it had often struck him before as a form of drunkenness peculiar to the st kentigern laborers men passed him singly and silently as if following some vague alcoholic dream or moving through some scotch mist of whiskey and water others clung unsteadily but as silently together with no trace of convivial fellowship or hilarity in their dull fixed features and mechanically moving limbs there was something weird in this mirthless companionship and the appalling loneliness of those fixed or abstracted eyes suddenly he was aware of two men who were reeling toward him under the influence of this druglike intoxication and he was startled by a likeness which one of them bore to some one he had seen but where and under what circumstances he could not determine the fatuous eye the features of complacent vanity and selfsatisfied reverie were there either intensified by drink or perhaps suggesting it through some other equally hopeless form of hallucination he turned and followed the man trying to identify him through his companion who appeared to be a petty tradesman of a shrewder more material type but in vain and as the pair turned into a side street the consul slowly retraced his steps but he had not proceeded far before the recollection that had escaped him returned and he knew that the likeness suggested by the face he had seen was that of malcolm mchulish   iii   a journey to kelpie island consisted of a series of consecutive episodes by rail by coach and by steamboat the consul was already familiar with them as indeed were most of the civilized world for it seemed that all roads at certain seasons led out of and returned to st kentigern as a point in a vast circle wherein travelers were sure to meet one another again coming or going at certain depots and caravansaries with more or less superiority or envy tourists on the road to the historic crags of wateffa came sharply upon other tourists returning from them and glared suspiciously at them as if to wrest the dread secret from their soulsa scrutiny which the others returned with halfhumorous pity or superior calm  the consul knew also that the service by boat and rail was admirable and skillful for were not the righteous st kentigerners of the tribe of tubalcain great artificers in steel and iron and a mighty race of engineers before the lord who had carried their calling and accent beyond the seas he knew too that the land of these delightful caravansaries overflowed with marmalade and honey and that the manna of delicious scones and cakes fell even upon deserted waters of crag and heather he knew that their way would lie through much scenery whose rude barrenness and grim economy of vegetation had been usually accepted by cockney tourists for sublimity and grandeur but he knew also that its severity was mitigated by lowland glimpses of sylvan luxuriance and tangled delicacy utterly unlike the complacent snugness of an english pastoral landscape with which it was often confounded and misunderstood as being tame and civilized  it rained the day they left st kentigern and the next and the day after that spasmodically as regarded local effort sporadically as seen through the filmed windows of railway carriages or from the shining decks of steamboats there was always a shower being sown somewhere along the valley or reluctantly tearing itself from a mountaintop or being pulled into long threads from the leaden bosom of a lake the coach swept in and out of them to the folding and unfolding of umbrellas and mackintoshes accompanied by flying beams of sunlight that raced with the vehicle on long hillsides and vanished at the turn of the road there were hatlifting scurries of wind down the mountainside small tumults in little lakes below hysteric ebullitions on mild melancholy inland seas boisterous passages of nearly half an hour with landings on tempestuous miniature quays all this seen through wonderful aqueous vapor against a background of sky darkened at times to the depths of an india ink washed sketch but more usually blurred and confused on the surface like the gray silhouette of a childs slatepencil drawing half rubbed from the slate by soft palms occasionally a rare glinting of real sunshine on a distant fringe of dripping larches made some frowning crest appear to smile as through wet lashes  miss elsie tucked her little feet under the mackintosh i know she said sadly i should get webfooted if i stayed here long why its like coming down from ararat just after the deluge cleared up  mrs kirkby suggested that if the sun would only shine squarely and decently like a christian for a few moments they could see the prospect better  the consul here pointed out that the admirers of scotch scenery thought that this was its greatest charm it was this misty effect which made it so superior to what they called the vulgar chromos and sunpictures of less favored lands  you mean because it prevents folks from seeing how poor the view really is  the consul remarked that perhaps distance was lacking as to the sun shining in a christian way this might depend upon the local idea of christianity  well i dont call the scenery giddy or frivolous certainly and i reckon i begin to understand the kind of sermons malcolms folks brought over to maccorkleville i guess they didnt know much of the heaven they only saw once a year why even the highest hillswhich they call mountains hereaint big enough to get above the fogs of their own creating  feminine wit is not apt to be abstract it struck the consul that in miss elsies sprightliness there was the usual ulterior and personal object and he glanced around at his fellowpassengers the object evidently was sitting at the end of the opposite seat an amused but wellbehaved listener for the rest he was still young and reserved but in face figure and dress utterly unlike his companionsan englishman of a pronounced and distinct type the man of society and clubs while there was more or less hinting of local influence in the apparel of the othersthere was a kilt and bare unweatherbeaten knees from birmingham and even the american elsie wore a bewitching tamoshanterthe stranger carried easy distinction from his tweed travelingcap to his wellmade shoes and gaiters as an unmistakable southerner his deep and pleasantly level voice had been heard only once or twice and then only in answering questions and his quiet composed eyes alone had responded to the young girls provocation  they were passing a brown glen in the cheerless depths of which a brown watercourse a shade lighter was running and occasionally foaming like brown beer beyond it heaved an arid bulk of hillside the scant vegetation of which scattered like patches of hair made it look like the decaying hide of some huge antediluvian ruminant on the dreariest part of the dreary slope rose the ruins of a tower and crumbling walls and battlements  whatever possessed folks to build there said miss elsie if they were poor it might be some excuse but that those old swells or chiefs should put up a castle in such a godforsaken place gets me  but dont you know they were poor according to our modern ideas and i fancy they built these things more for defense than show and really more to gather in cattlelike one of your texan ranchesafter a raid that is i have heard so i rather fancy that was the idea wasnt it it was the englishman who had spoken and was now looking around at the other passengers as if in easy deference to local opinion  what raid said miss elsie animatedly oh yes i seeone of their old border raidsmosstroopers i used to like to read about them  i fancy dont you know said the englishman slowly that it wasnt exactly that sort of thing you know for its a good way from the border but it was one of their raids upon their neighbors to lift their cattlesteal em in fact thats the way those chaps had but of course youve read all about that you americans dont you know are all up in these historical matters  eh but they were often reprisals said a scotch passenger  i dont suppose they took much trouble to inquire if the beasts belonged to an enemy said the englishman  but here miss elsie spoke of castles generally and averred that the dearest wish of her life was to see macbeths castle at glamis where duncan was murdered at which the englishman still deferentially mistrusted the fact that the murder had been committed there and thought that the castle to which shakespeare probably referred if he hadnt invented the murder too was farther north at cawdor you know he added playfully over there in america youve discovered that shakespeare himself was an invention  this led to some retaliating brilliancy from the young lady and when the coach stopped at the next station their conversation had presumably become interesting enough to justify him in securing a seat nearer to her the talk returning to ruins miss elsie informed him that they were going to see some on kelpie island the consul from some instinctive impulseperhaps a recollection of custers peculiar methods gave her a sign of warning but the englishman only lifted his eyebrows in a kind of halfhumorous concern  i dont think youd like it you know its a beastly placerocks and seaworse than this and half the time you cant see the mainland only a mile away really you know they oughtnt to have induced you to take tickets therethose excursionticket chaps theyre jolly frauds its no place for a stranger to go to  but there are the ruins of an old castle the old seat ofbegan the astonished miss elsie but she was again stopped by a significant glance from the consul  i believe there was something of the kind there oncesomething like your friends the cattlestealers castle over on that hillside returned the englishman but the stones were taken by the fishermen for their cabins and the walls were quite pulled down  how dared they do that said the young lady indignantly i call it not only sacrilege but stealing  it was defrauding the owner of the property they might as well take his money said mrs kirkby in languid protest  the smile which this outburst of proprietorial indignation brought to the face of the consul lingered with the englishmans reply  but it was only robbing the old robbers dont you know and they put their spoils to better use than their old masters did certainly to more practical use than the owners do now for the ruins are good for nothing  but the hallowed associationsthe picturesqueness continued mrs kirkby with languid interest  the associations wouldnt be anything except to the family you know and i should fancy they wouldnt be either hallowed or pleasant as for picturesqueness the ruins are beastly ugly weatherbeaten instead of being mellowed by time you know and bare where they ought to be hidden by vines and moss i cant make out why anybody sent you there for you americans are rather particular about your sightseeing  we heard of them through a friend said the consul with assumed carelessness perhaps its as good an excuse as any for a pleasant journey  and very likely your friend mistook it for something else or was himself imposed upon said the englishman politely but you might not think it so and after all he added thoughtfully its years since ive seen it i only meant that i could show you something better a few miles from my place in gloucestershire and not quite so far from a railway as this if he added with a pleasant deliberation which was the real courtesy of his conventionally worded speech you ever happened at any time to be anywhere near audrey edge and would look me up i should be glad to show it to you and your friends an hour later when he left them at a railway station where their paths diverged miss elsie recovered a fluency that she had lately checked well i like that he never told us his name or offered a card i wonder if they call that an invitation over here does he suppose anybodys going to look up his old audrey edgeperhaps its named after his wifeto find out who he is he might have been civil enough to have left his name if hemeant anything  but i assure you he was perfectly sincere and meant an invitation returned the consul smilingly audrey edge is evidently a wellknown place and he a man of some position that is why he didnt specify either  well you wont catch me going there said miss elsie  you would be quite right in either going or staying away said the consul simply  miss elsie tossed her head slightly nevertheless before they left the station she informed him that she had been told that the stationmaster had addressed the stranger as my lord and that another passenger had said he was lord duncaster  and that proves  that im right said the young lady decisively and that his invitation was a mere form  it was after sundown when they reached the picturesque and wellappointed hotel that lifted itself above the little fishingvillage which fronted kelpie island the hotel was in as strong contrast to the narrow curving street of dull comfortlesslooking stone cottages below it as were the smart tourists who had just landed from the steamer to the hardvisaged roughly clad villagers who watched them with a certain mingling of critical independence and superior selfrighteousness as the new arrivals walked down the main street half beach half thoroughfare their baggage following them in low trolleys drawn by porters at their heels like a decorous funeral the joyless faces of the lookerson added to the resemblance beyond them in the prolonged northern twilight the waters of the bay took on a peculiar pewtery brightness but with the usual mourningedged border of scotch seacoast scenery low banks of cloud lay on the chill sea the outlines of kelpie island were hidden  but the interior of the hotel bright with the latest fastidiousness in modern decoration and artfurniture and gay with pictured canvases and color seemed to mock the sullen landscape and the sterile crags amid which the building was set an attempt to make a pleasance in this barren waste had resulted only in empty vases bleak statuary and iron settees as cold and slippery to the touch as the sides of their steamer  itll be a fine morning tomorra and therll be a boat going away to kelpie for a peekneek in the ruins said the porter as the consul and his fair companions looked doubtfully from the windows of the cheerful hall  a picnic in the sacred ruins of kelpie the consul saw the ladies stiffening with indignation at this trespass upon their possible rights and probable privileges and glanced at them warningly  do you mean to say that it is common property and anybody can go there demanded miss elsie scornfully  no its only the hotel that owns the boat and gives the ticketsa halfcrown the passage  and do the owners the mchulishes permit this  the porter looked at them with a puzzled halfpitying politeness he was a handsome tall broadshouldered young fellow with a certain naive and gentle courtesy of manner that relieved his strong accent oh ay he said with a reassuring smile yell no be troubled by them ill just gang away noo and see if i can secure the teekets  an elderly guest who was examining a timetable on the wall turned to them as the porter disappeared  yell be strangers noo and not knowing that tonalt the porter is a mchulish hissel he said deliberately  a what said the astonished miss elsie  a mchulish ay one of the family the mchulishes of kelpie were his own forebears eh but hes a fine lad and doin well for the hotel  miss elsie extinguished a sudden smile with her handkerchief as her mother anxiously inquired and are the family as poor as that  but i am not saying hes poor maam no replied the stranger with native caution what wi tips and gratooities and percentages on the teekets its a bit of money hell be having in the bank noo  the prophecy of donald mchulish as to the weather came true the next morning was bright and sunny and the boat to kelpie islanda large yawlduly received its complement of passengers and provision hampers the ladies had apparently become more tolerant of their fellow pleasureseekers and it appeared that miss elsie had even overcome her hilarity at the discovery of what might have been a relative in the person of the porter donald i had a long talk with him before breakfast this morning she said gayly and i know all about him it appears that there are hundreds of himall mchulishesall along the coast and elsewhereonly none of them ever lived on the island and dont want to but he looks more like a laird and a chief than malcolm and if it comes to choosing a head of the family remember maw i shall vote solid for him  how can you go on so elsie said mrs kirkby with languid protest only i trust you didnt say anything to him of the syndicate and thank heaven the property isnt here  no the waiter tells me all the lovely things we had for breakfast came from miles away and they dont seem to have ever raised anything on the island from its looks think of having to row three miles for the mornings milk  there was certainly very little appearance of vegetation on the sterile crags that soon began to lift themselves above the steely waves ahead a few scraggy trees and bushes which twisted and writhed like vines around the square tower and crumbling walls of an irregular but angular building looked in their brown shadows like part of the debris  its just like a burntdown boneboiling factory said miss elsie critically and i shouldnt wonder if that really was old mchulishs business they couldnt have it on the mainland for its being a nuisance  nevertheless she was one of the first to leap ashore when the yawls bow grated in a pebbly cove and carried her pretty but incongruous little slippers through the seaweed wet sand and slimy cobbles with a heroism that redeemed her vanity a scrambling ascent of a few moments brought them to a wall with a gap in it which gave easy ingress to the interior of the ruins this was merely a little curving hollow from which the outlines of the plan had long since faded it was kept green by the brown walls which like the crags of the mainland valleys sheltered it from the incessant strife of the atlantic gales a few pale flowers that might have grown in a damp cellar shivered against the stones scraps of newspapers sodawater and beer bottles highly decorated old provision tins and spent cartridge casesthe remains of chilly picnics and damp shooting luncheonshad at first sight lent color to the foreground by mere contrast but the corrosion of time and weather had blackened rather than mellowed the walls in a way which forcibly reminded the consul of miss elsies simile of the burntdown factory the view from the square towera mere roost for unclean seafowl from the sides of which rags of peeling moss and vine hung like tattered clothingwas equally depressing the few fishermens huts along the shore were built of stones taken from the ruin and roofed in with sodden beams and timbers in the last stages of deliquescence the thick smoke of smouldering peatfires came from the low chimneys and drifted across the ruins with the odors of drying fish  ive just seen a sort of groundplan of the castle said miss elsie cheerfully it never had a room in it as big as our bedroom in the hotel and there werent windows enough to go round a slit in the wall about two inches wide by two feet long was considered dazzling extravagance to malcolms ancestors i dont wonder some of em broke out and swam over to america that reminds me who do you suppose is herecame over from the hotel in a boat of his own just to see maw  not malcolm surely  not much replied miss elsie setting her small lips together its mr custer hes talking business with her now down on the beach theyll be here when lunch is ready  the consul remembered the romantic plan which the enthusiastic custer had imparted to him in the foggy consulate at st kentigern and then thought of the matter of fact tourists the few stolid fishermen and the prosaic ruins around them and smiled he looked up and saw that miss elsie was watching him  you know mr custer dont you  we are old californian friends  i thought so but i think he looked a little upset when he heard you were here too  he certainly was a little awkward as if struggling with some halfhumorous embarrassment as he came forward a few moments later with mrs kirkby but the stimulation of the keen sea air triumphed over the infelicities of the situation and surroundings and the little party were presently enjoying their wellselected luncheon with the wholesome appetite of travel and change the chill damp made limp the napkins and tablecloth and invaded the victuals the wind which was rising whistled round the walls and made miniature cyclones of the torn paper and dried twigs around them but they ate drank and were merry at the end of the repast the two gentlemen rose to light their cigars in the lee of the wall  i suppose you know all about malcolm said custer after an awkward pause  my dear fellow said the consul somewhat impatiently i know nothing about him and you ought to know that by this time  i thought your friend sir james might have told you continued custer with significant emphasis  i have not seen sir james for two months  well malcolms a crankalways was one i reckon and is reglarly off his head now yes sir scotch whiskey and your friend sir james finished him after that dinner at macfens he was done forwent wild danced a sworddance or a strathspey or some other blamed thing on the table and yelled louder than the pipes so they all did jack ive painted the town red once myself i thought i knew what a firstclass jamboree was but they were prayermeetings to that show everybody was blind drunkbut they all got over it except him they were a different lot of men the next day as cool and cautious as you please but he was shut up for a week and came out crazy  but whats that to do with his claim  well there aint much use whooping up the boys when only the whooper gets wild  still that does not affect any right he may have in the property  but it affects the syndicate said custer gloomily and when we found that he was whooping up some shopkeepers and factory hands who claimed to belong to the clanand you cant heave a stone at a dog around here without hitting a mchulishwe concluded we hadnt much use for him ornamentally so we shipped him home last steamer  and the property  oh thats all right said custer still gloomily weve effected an amicable compromise as sir james calls it that means weve taken a lot of land somewhere north that you can shoot overthat is you neednt be afraid of hitting a house or a tree or a man anywhere and weve got a strip more of the same sort on the seashore somewhere off here occupied only by some gay galoots called crofters and you can raise a lawsuit and an imprecation on every acre then theres this soulsubduing sequestered spot and whats left of the old boneboiling establishment and the rights of fishing and peatburning and otherwise creating a nuisance off the mainland it cost the syndicate only a hundred thousand dollars half cash and half in texan and kentucky grass lands but weve carried the thing through  i congratulate you said the consul  thanks custer puffed at his cigar for a few moments that sir james macfen is a fine man  he is  a large broad allround man knows everything and everybody dont he  i think so  big man in the church i should say no slouch at a party canvass or ward politics eh as a board director or president just takes the cake dont he  i believe so  nothing mean about jimmy as an advocate or an arbitrator either is there rings the bell every time dont he financiers take a back seat when hes around owns half of scotland by this time i reckon  the consul believed that sir james had the reputation of being exceedingly sagacious in financial and mercantile matters and that he was a man of some wealth  naturally i wonder what hed take to come over to america and give the boys points continued custer in meditative admiration there were two or three men on scotts river and one chinaman that we used to think smart but they were doddering ijuts to him and as for mei say jack you didnt see any hayseed in my hair that day i walked inter your consulate did you  the consul smilingly admitted that he had not noticed these signs of rustic innocence in his friend  nor any flies well for all that when i get home im going to resign no more foreign investments for me when anybody calls at the consulate and asks for h j custer say you dont know me and you dont and i say jack try to smooth things over for me with her  with miss elsie  custer cast a glance of profound pity upon the consul no with mrs kirkby of course see  the consul thought he did see and that he had at last found a clue to custers extraordinary speculation but like most theorists who argue from a single fact a few months later he might have doubted his deduction  he was staying at a large countryhouse many miles distant from the scene of his late experiences already they had faded from his memory with the departure of his compatriots from st kentigern he was smoking by the fire in the billiardroom late one night when a fellowguest approached him  saw you didnt remember me at dinner  the voice was hesitating pleasant and not quite unfamiliar the consul looked up and identified the figure before him as one of the new arrivals that day whom in the informal and easy courtesy of the house he had met with no further introduction than a vague smile he remembered too that the stranger had glanced at him once or twice at dinner with shy but engaging reserve  you must see such a lot of people and the way things are arranged and settled here everybody expects to look and act like everybody else dont you know so you cant tell one chap from another deuced annoying eh thats where you americans are different and thats why those countrywomen of yours were so charming dont you know so original we were all together on the top of a coach in scotland dont you remember had such a jolly time in the beastly rain you didnt catch my name its duncaster  the consul at once recalled his former fellowtraveler the two men shook hands the englishman took a pipe from his smokingjacket and drew a chair beside the consul  yes he continued comfortably filling his pipe the daughter miss kirkby was awfully good fun so fresh so perfectly natural and innocent dont you know and yet so extraordinarily sharp and clever she had some awfully good chaff over that scotch scenery before those scotch tourists do you remember and it was all so beastly true too perhaps shes with you here  there was so much unexpected and unaffected interest in the young englishmans eyes that the consul was quite serious in his regrets that the ladies had gone back to paris  id like to have taken them over to audrey edge from here its no distance by train i did ask them in scotland but i suppose they had something better to do but you might tell them ive got some sisters there and that it is an old place and not half bad dont you know when you write to them you might give me their address  the consul did so and added a few pleasant words regarding their positionbarring the syndicatewhich he had gathered from custer lord duncasters look of interest far from abating became gently confidential  i suppose you must see a good deal of your countrymen in your business and i suppose just like englishmen they differ by jove some of them dont you know are rather pushing and anxious for position and all that sort of thing and some of em like your friends are quite independent and natural  he stopped and puffed slowly at his pipe presently he took it from his mouth with a little laugh ive a mind to tell you a rather queer experience of mine its nothing against your people generally you know nor do i fancy its even an american type so you wont mind my speaking of it ive got some property in scotlandrather poor stuff youd call itbut by jove some americans have been laying claim to it under some obscure plea of relationship there might have been something in it although not all they claim but my business man a clever chap up in your placeperhaps you may have heard of him sir james macfenwrote to me that what they really wanted were some ancestral lands with the right to use the family name and privileges the oddest part of the affair was that the claimant was an impossible sort of lunatic and the whole thing was run by a syndicate of shrewd western men as i dont care for the property which has only been dropping a lot of money every year for upkeep and litigation sir james who is an awfully farsighted chap at managing thought he could effect a compromise and get rid of the property at a fair valuation and by jove he did but what your countrymen can get out of itfor the shooting isnt half as good as what they can get in their own countryor what use the privileges are to them i cant fancy  i think i know the story said the consul eying his fellowguest attentively but if i remember rightly the young man claimed to be the rightful and only surviving heir  the englishman rose and bending over the hearth slowly knocked the ashes from his pipe thats quite impossible dont you know for he added as he stood up in front of the fire in face figure and careless repose more decidedly english than ever you see my title of duncaster only came to me through an uncle but i am the direct and sole heir of the old family and the scotch property i dont perhaps look like a scotweve been settled in england some timebut he continued with an invincible english drawling deliberation  iamreallyyouknowwhat they call the mchulish     an episode of west woodlands   i   the rain was dripping monotonously from the scant eaves of the little church of the sidon brethren at west woodlands hewn out of the very heart of a thicket of buckeye spruce and alder unsunned and unblown upon by any wind it was so green and unseasoned in its solitude that it seemed a part of the arboreal growth and on damp sundays to have taken root again and sprouted there were moss and shining spots on the underside of the unplaned rafters little green pools of infusoria stood on the ledge of the windows whose panes were at times suddenly clouded by mysterious unknown breaths from without or within it was oppressed with an extravagance of leaves at all seasons whether in summer when green and limp they crowded the porch doorways and shutters or when penetrating knotholes and interstices of shingle and clapboard on some creeping vine they unexpectedly burst and bourgeoned on the walls like banners or later when they rotted in brown heaps in corners outlined the edges of the floor with a thin yellow border or invaded the ranks of the highbacked benches which served as pews  there had been a continuous rustling at the porch and the shaking out of waterproofs and closing of umbrellas until the halffilled church was already redolent of damp dyes and the sulphur of india rubber the eyes of the congregation were turned to the door with something more than the usual curiosity and expectation for the new revivalist preacher from horse shoe bay was coming that morning already voices of authority were heard approaching and keeping up their conversation to the very door of the sacred edifice in marked contrast with the awed and bashful whisperings in the porch of the ordinary congregation the worshipers recognized the voices of deacons shadwell and bradley in the reverential hush of the building they seemed charged with undue importance  it was set back in the road for quiet in the lords work said bradley  yes but it oughtnt be hidden let your light so shine before men you know brother bradley returned a deep voice unrecognized and unfamiliarpresumably that of the newcomer  it wouldnt take much to move iton skids and rollersnearer to the road suggested shadwell tentatively  no but if you left it stranded there in the wind and sun green and sappy as it is now yed have every seam and crack startin till the ribs shone through and no amount of calkin would make it watertight agin no my idea isclear out the brush and shadder around it let the light shine in upon it make the waste places glad around it but keep it there and thats my idea o genral missionary work thats how the gospel orter be rooted  here the bell which from the plain open fourposted belfry above had been clanging with a metallic sharpness that had an odd impatient worldliness about it suddenly ceased  that bell said bradleys voice with the same suggestion of conveying important truths to the listening congregation within was took from the wreck of the tamalpais brother horley bought it at auction at horse shoe bay and presented it you know the tamalpais ran ashore on skinners reef jest off here  yes with plenty of sea room not half a gale o wind blowing and her real course fifty miles to westward the whole watch must have drunk or sunk in slothful idleness returned the deep voice again a momentary pause followed and then the two deacons entered the church with the stranger  he appeared to be a powerfullybuilt man with a square beardless chin a face that carried one or two scars of smallpox and a deeper one of a less peaceful suggestion set in a complexion weatherbeaten to the color of spanish leather two small moist gray eyes that glistened with every emotion seemed to contradict the hard expression of the other features he was dressed in cheap black like the two deacons with the exception of a loose black alpaca coat and the usual black silk neckerchief tied in a large bow under a turndown collarthe general sign and symbol of a minister of his sect he walked directly to the raised platform at the end of the chapel where stood a table on which was a pitcher of water a glass and hymnbook and a tall upright desk holding a bible glancing over these details he suddenly paused carefully lifted some hitherto undetected object from the desk beside the bible and stooping gently placed it upon the floor as it hopped away the congregation saw that it was a small green frog the intrusion was by no means an unusual one but some odd contrast between this powerful man and the little animal affected them profoundly no oneeven the youngestsmiled every oneeven the youngestbecame suddenly attentive turning over the leaves of the hymnbook he then gave out the first two lines of a hymn the choir accordion in the front side bench awoke like an infant into wailing life and cissy appleby soprano took up a little more musically the lugubrious chant at the close of the verse the preacher joined in after a sailor fashion with a breezy bass that seemed to fill the little building with the trouble of the sea then followed prayer from deacon shadwell broken by amens from the preacher with a nautical suggestion of ay ay about them and he began his sermon  it was as those who knew his methods might have expected a suggestion of the conversation they had already overheard he likened the little chapel choked with umbrage and rotting in its dampness to the gospel seed sown in crowded places famishing in the midst of plenty and sterile from the absorptions of the more active life around it he pointed out again the true work of the pioneer missionary the careful pruning and elimination of those forces that grew up with the christians life which many people foolishly believed were a part of it the world must live and the word must live said they and there were easygoing brethren who thought they could live together but he warned them that the world was always closing uponshadderingand strangling the word unless kept down and that fair seemin settlement or city which appeared to be bustin and bloomin with life and progress was really hustlin and jostlin the word of god even in the midst of these fancy spires and steeples it had erected to its glory it was the work of the missionary pioneer to keep down or root out this carnal worldly growth as much in the settlement as in the wilderness some were for getting over the difficulty by dragging the mere wasted letter of the word or the rotten and withered husks of it into the highways and byways where the blazin scorn of the world would finish it a low penitential groan from deacon shadwell followed this accusing illustration but the preacher would tell them that the only way was to boldly attack this rankly growing world around them to clear out fresh paths for the truth and let the sunlight of heaven stream among them  there was little doubt that the congregation was moved whatever they might have thought of the application the fact itself was patent the rheumatic beaseleys felt the truth of it in their aching bones it came home to the fever and ague stricken filgees in their damp seats against the sappy wall it echoed plainly in the chronic cough of sister mary strutt and widow doddridge and cissy appleby with her round brown eyes fixed upon the speaker remembering how the starch had been taken out of her sunday frocks how her long ringlets had become uncurled her frills limp and even her ribbons lustreless felt that indeed a prophet had arisen in israel  one or two however were disappointed that he had as yet given no indication of that powerful exhortatory emotion for which he was famed and which had been said to excite certain corresponding corybantic symptoms among his sensitive female worshipers when the service was over and the congregation crowded around him sister mary strutt on the outer fringe of the assembly confided to sister evans that she had hearn tell how that when he was over at soquel he prayed that powful that all the wimmen got fits and tremblin spells and ole mrs jackson had to be hauled off his legs that she was kneelin and claspin while wrestling with the sperit  i reckon we seemed kinder strange to him this morning and he wanted to jest feel his way to our hearts first exclaimed brother jonas steers politely hell be more at home at evenin service its queer that some of the best exhortin work is done arter early candlelight i reckon hes goin to stop over with deacon bradley to dinner  but it appeared that the new preacher now formally introduced as brother seabright was intending to walk over to hemlock mills to dinner he only asked to be directed the nearest way he would not trouble brother shadwell or deacon bradley to come with him  but heres cissy appleby lives within a mile o thar and you could go along with her shed jest admire to show you the way interrupted brother shadwell wouldnt you cissy  thus appealed to the young choristera tall girl of sixteen or seventeentimidly raised her eyes to brother seabright as he was about to repeat his former protestation and he stopped  ef the young lady is goin that way its only fair to accept her kindness in a christian sperit he said gently  cissy turned with a mingling of apology and bashfulness towards a young fellow who seemed to be acting as her escort but who was hesitating in an equal bashfulness when seabright added and perhaps our young friend will come too  but the young friend drew back with a confused laugh and brother seabright and cissy passed out from the porch together for a few moments they mingled with the stream and conversation of the departing congregation but presently cissy timidly indicated a diverging bypath and they both turned into it  it was much warmer in the open than it had been in the chapel and thicket and cissy by way of relieving a certain awkward tension of silence took off the waterproof cloak and slung it on her arm this disclosed her five long brown cablelike curls that hung down her shoulders reaching below her waist in some forgotten fashion of girlhood they were cissys peculiar adornment remarkable for their length thickness and the extraordinary youthfulness imparted to a figure otherwise precociously matured in some wavering doubt of her actual years and privileges brother seabright offered to carry her cloak for her but she declined it with a rustic and youthful pertinacity that seemed to settle the question in fact cissy was as much embarrassed as she was flattered by the company of this distinguished stranger however it would be known to all west woodland that he had walked home with her while nobody but herself would know that they had scarcely exchanged a word she noticed how he lounged on with a heavy rolling gait sometimes a little before or behind her as the path narrowed at such times when they accidentally came in contact in passing she felt a half uneasy physical consciousness of him which she referred to his size the scars on his face or some latent hardness of expression but was relieved to see that he had not observed it yet this was the man that made grown women cry she thought of old mrs jackson fervently grasping the plodding ankles before her and a hysteric desire to laugh with the fear that he might see it on her face overcame her then she wondered if he was going to walk all the way home without speaking yet she knew she would be more embarrassed if he began to talk to her  suddenly he stopped and she bumped up against him  oh excuse me she stammered hurriedly  eh he evidently had not noticed the collision did you speak  nothat isit wasnt anything returned the girl coloring  but he had quite forgotten her and was looking intently before him they had come to a break in the fringe of woodland and upon a sudden view of the ocean at this point the low line of coastrange which sheltered the valley of west woodlands was abruptly cloven by a gorge that crumbled and fell away seaward to the shore of horse shoe bay on its northern trend stretched the settlement of horse shoe to the promontory of whale mouth point with its outlying reef of rocks curved inwards like the vast submerged jaw of some marine monster through whose blunt toothlike projections the shiplong swell of the pacific streamed and fell on the southern shore the light yellow sands of punta de las concepcion glittered like sunshine all the way to the olivegardens and white domes of the mission the two shores seemed to typify the two different climates and civilizations separated by the bay  the heavy woodland atmosphere was quickened by the salt breath of the sea the stranger inhaled it meditatively  thats the reef where the tamalpais struck he said and moren fifty miles out of her courseyes moren fifty miles from where she should have bin it dont look natral noitdontlooknatral  as he seemed to be speaking to himself the young girl who had been gazing with far greater interest at the foreignlooking southern shore felt confused and did not reply then as if recalling her presence brother seabright turned to her and said  yes young lady and when you hear the old bell of the tamalpais and think of how it came here you may rejoice in the goodness of the lord that made even those who strayed from the straight course and the true reckoning the means of testifying onto him  but the young are quicker to detect attitudes and affectation than we are apt to imagine and cissy could distinguish a certain other straying in this afterthought or moral of the preacher called up by her presence and knew that it was not the real interest which the view had evoked she had heard that he had been a sailor and with the tact of her sex answered with what she thought would entertain him  i was a little girl when it happened and i heard that some sailors got ashore down there and climbed up this gully from the rocks below and they camped that nightfor there were no houses at west woodlands thenjust in the woods where our chapel now stands it was funny wasnt iti mean she corrected herself bashfully it was strange they chanced to come just there  but she had evidently hit the point of interest  what became of them he said quickly they never came to horse shoe settlement where the others landed from the wreck i never heard of that boats crew or of any landing here  no they kept on over the range south to the mission i reckon they didnt know there was a way down on this side to horse shoe returned cissy  brother seabright moved on and continued his slow plodding march but he kept a little nearer cissy and she was conscious that he occasionally looked at her presently he said  you have a heavenly gift miss appleby  cissy flushed and her hand involuntarily went to one of her long distinguishing curls it might be that the preacher continued  yes a voice like yours is a heavenly gift and you have properly devoted it to his service have you been singing long  about two years but ive got to study a heap yet  the little birds dont think it necessary to study to praise him said the preacher sententiously  it occurred to cissy that this was very unfair argument she said quickly  but the little birds dont have to follow words in the hymnbooks you dont give out lines to larks and bobolinks and blushed  the preacher smiled it was a very engaging smile cissy thought that lightened his hard mouth it enabled her to take heart of grace and presently to chatter like the very birds she had disparaged oh yes she knew she had to learn a great deal more she had studied some already she was taking lessons over at point concepcion where her aunt had friends and she went three times a week the gentleman who taught her was not a catholic and of course he knew she was a protestant she would have preferred to live there but her mother and father were both dead and had left her with her aunt she liked it better because it was sunnier and brighter there she loved the sun and warmth she had listened to what he had said about the dampness and gloom of the chapel it was true the dampness was that dreadful sometimes it just ruined her clothes and even made her hoarse did he think they would really take his advice and clear out the woods round the chapel  would you like it he asked pleasantly  yes  and you think you wouldnt pine so much for the sunshine and warmth of the mission  im not pining said cissy with a toss of her curls for anything or anybody but i think the woods ought to be cleared out its just as it was when the runaways hid there  when the runaways hid there said brother seabright quickly what runaways  why the boats crew said cissy  why do you call them runaways  i dont know didnt you said cissy simply didnt you say they never came back to horse shoe bay perhaps i had it from aunty but i know its damp and creepy and when i was littler i used to be frightened to be alone there practicing  why said the preacher quickly  oh i dont know hurried on cissy with a vague impression that she had said too much only my fancy i guess  well said brother seabright after a pause well see what can be done to make a clearing there birds sing best in the sunshine and you ought to have some say about it  cissys dimples and blushes came together this time thats our house she said suddenly with a slight accent of relief pointing to a weatherbeaten farmhouse on the edge of the gorge i turn off here but you keep straight on for the mills theyre back in the woods a piece but she stammered with a sudden sense of shame of forgotten hospitality wont you come in and see aunty  no thank you not now he stopped turning his gaze from the house to her how old is your house was it there at the time of the wreck  yes said cissy  its odd that the crew did not come there for help eh  maybe they overlooked it in the darkness and the storm said cissy simply goodby sir  the preacher held her hand for an instant in his powerful but gently graduated grasp goodby until evening service  yes sir said cissy  the young girl tripped on towards her house a little agitated and conscious and yet a little proud as she saw the faces of her aunt her uncle her two cousins and even her discarded escort jo adams at the windows watching her  so said her aunt as she entered breathlessly ye walked home with the preacher it was a speshal providence and manifestation for ye cissy i hope ye was mannerly and humbleand profited by the words of grace  i dont know said cissy putting aside her hat and cloak listlessly he didnt talk much of anythingbut the old wreck of the tamalpais  what said her aunt quickly  the wreck of the tamalpais and the boats crew that came up the gorge repeated the young girl  and what did he know about the boats crew said her aunt hurriedly fixing her black eyes on cissy  nothing except what i told him  what you told him echoed her aunt with an ominous color filling the sallow hollows of her cheek  yes he has been a sailor you knowand i thought it would interest him and it did he thought it strange  cecilia jane appleby said her aunt shrilly do you mean to say that you threw away your chances of salvation and saving grace just to tell gossiping tales that you knew was lies and evil report and false witnesses  i only talked of what id heard aunt vashti said cecilia indignantly and he afterwards talked ofofmy voice and said i had a heavenly gift she added with a slight quiver of her lip  aunt vashti regarded the girl sharply  and you may thank the lord for that heavenly gift she said in a slightly lowered voice for ef ye hadnt to use it tonight id shut ye up in your room to make it pay for yer foolish gaddin tongue and i reckon ill escort ye to chapel tonight myself miss and get shut o some of this foolishness   ii   the broad plaza of the mission de la concepcion had been baking in the daylong sunlight shining drifts from the outlying sand dunes blown across the illpaved roadway radiated the heat in the faces of the few loungers like the pricking of liliputian arrows and invaded even the cactus hedges the hot air visibly quivered over the dark red tiles of the tienda roof as if they were undergoing a second burning the black shadow of a chimney on the whitewashed adobe wall was like a door or cavernous opening in the wall itself the tops of the olive and pear trees seen above it were russet and sere already in the fierce light even the moist breath of the sea beyond had quite evaporated before it crossed the plaza and now rustled the leaves in the mission garden with a dry crepitant sound  nevertheless it seemed to cissy appleby as she crossed the plaza a very welcome change from west woodlands although the late winter rains had ceased a month agoa few days after the revivalist preacher had leftthe woods around the chapel were still sodden and heavy and the threatened improvement in its site had not taken place neither had the preacher himself alluded to it again his evening sermonthe only other one he preached therewas unexciting and he had in fact left west woodlands without any display of that extraordinary exhortatory faculty for which he was famous yet cissy in spite of her enjoyment of the dry hot mission remembered him and also recalled albeit poutingly his blunt suggesting that she was pining for it nevertheless she would like to have sung for him heresupposing it was possible to conceive of a sidon brotherhood chapel at the mission it was a great pity she thought that the sidon brotherhood and the franciscan brotherhood were not more brotherly towards each other cissy belonged to the former by hereditary right locality and circumstance but it is to be feared that her theology was imperfect  she entered a lane between the mission wall and a lighter iron fenced inclosure once a part of the garden but now the appurtenance of a private dwelling that was reconstructed over the heavy adobe shell of some forgotten structure of the old ecclesiastical founders it was pierced by many windows and openings and that sunlight and publicity which the former padres had jealously excluded was now wooed from long balconies and verandas by the new proprietor a well to do american elisha braggs whose name was generously and euphoniously translated by his native neighbors into don eliseo although a heretic had given largess to the church in the way of restoring its earthquakeshaken tower and in presenting a new organ to its dilapidated choir he had further endeared himself to the conservative spanish population by introducing no obtrusive improvements by distributing his means through the old channels by apparently inciting no further alien immigration but contenting himself to live alone among them adopting their habits customs and language a harmless musical taste and a disposition to instruct the young boy choristers was equally balanced by great skill in horsemanship and the personal management of a ranche of wild cattle on the inland plains  consciously pretty and prettily conscious in her whitestarched rosesprigged muslin her pink parasol beribboned gypsy hat and the long manelike curls that swung over her shoulders cissy entered the house and was shown to the large low drawingroom on the groundfloor she once more inhaled its hot potpourri fragrance in which the spice of the castilian roseleaves of the garden was dominant a few boys whom she recognized as the choristers of the mission and her fellowpupils were already awaiting her with some degree of anxiety and impatience this fact and a certain quick animation that sprang to the blue eyes of the master of the house as the rosesprigged frock and long curls appeared at the doorway showed that cissy was clearly the favorite pupil  elisha braggs was a man of middle age with a figure somewhat rounded by the adipose curves of a comfortable life and an air of fastidiousness which was however occasionally at variance with what seemed to be his original condition he greeted cissy with a certain nervous overconsciousness of his duties as host and teacher and then plunged abruptly into the lesson it lasted an hour cissy tactfully dividing his somewhat exclusive instruction with the others and even interpreting it to their slower comprehension when it was over the choristers shyly departed according to their usual custom leaving cissy and don eliseoand occasionally one of the padres to more informal practicing and performance neither the ingenuousness of cissy nor the worldly caution of aunt vashti had ever questioned the propriety of these prolonged and secluded seances and the young girl herself although by no means unaccustomed to the bashful attentions of the youth of west woodlands had never dreamed of these later musical interviews as being anything but an ordinary recreation of her art the feeling of gratitude and kindness she had for don eliseo her aunts friend had never left her conscious or embarrassed when she was alone with him but today possibly from his own nervousness and preoccupation she was aware of some vague uneasiness and at an early opportunity rose to go but don eliseo gently laid his hand on hers and said  dont go yet i want to talk to you his touch suddenly reminded her that once or twice before he had done the same thing and she had been disagreeably impressed by it but she lifted her brown eyes to his with an unconsciousness that was more crushing than a withdrawal of her hand and waited for him to go on  it is such a long way for you to come and you have so little time to stay when you are here that i am thinking of asking your aunt to let you live here at the mission as a pupil in the house of the senora hernandez until your lessons are finished padre jose will attend to the rest of your education would you like it  poor cissys eyes leaped up in unaffected and sparkling affirmation before her tongue replied to bask in this beloved sunshine for days together to have this quaint spanish life before her eyes and those soft spanish accents in her ears to forget herself in wandering in the oldtime mission garden beyond to have daily access to mr braggss piano and the organ of the churchthis was indeed the realization of her fondest dreams yet she hesitated somewhere in her inherited puritan nature was a vague conviction that it was wrong and it seemed even to find an echo in the warning of the preacher this was what she was pining for  i dont know she stammered i must ask auntie i shouldnt like to leave her and theres the chapel  isnt that revivalist preacher enough to run it for a while said her companion halfsneeringly  the remark was not a tactful one  mr seabright hasnt been here for a month she answered somewhat quickly but hes coming next sunday and im glad of it hes a very good man and theres nothing he dont notice he saw how silly it was to stick the chapel into the very heart of the woods and he told them so  and i suppose hell run up a brandnew meetinghouse out on the road said braggs smiling  no hes going to open up the woods and let the sun and light in and clear out the underbrush  and whats that for  there was such an utter and abrupt change in the speakers voice and mannerwhich until then had been lazily fastidious and confidentthat cissy was startled and the change being rude and dictatorial she was startled into opposition she had wanted to say that the improvement had been suggested by her but she took a more aggressive attitude  brother seabright says its a question of religion and morals its a scandal and a wrong and a disgrace to the word that the chapel should have been put there  don eliseos face turned so white and waxy that cissy would have noticed it had she not femininely looked away while taking this attitude  i suppose thats a part of his sensation style and very effective he said resuming his former voice and manner i must try to hear him some day but now in regard to your coming here of course i shall consult your aunt although i imagine she will have no objection i only wanted to know how you felt about it he again laid his hand on hers  i should like to come very much said cissy timidly and its very kind of you im sure but youll see what auntie says wont you she withdrew her hand after momentarily grasping his as if his own act had been only a parting salutation and departed  aunt vashti received cissys account of her interview with a grim satisfaction she did not know what ideas young gals had nowadays but in her time shed been fit to jump outer her skin at such an offer from such a good man as elisha braggs and he was a rich man too and ef he was goin to give her an edication free it wasnt goin to stop there for her part she didnt like to put ideas in young girls headsgoodness knows theyd enough foolishness already but if cissy made a christian use of her gifts and tended to her edication and privileges and made herself a fit helpmeet for any man she would say that there were few men in these parts that was as comfble ketch as lish braggs or would make as good a husband and provider  the blood suddenly left cissys cheeks and then returned with uncomfortable heat her aunts words had suddenly revealed to her the meaning of the uneasiness she had felt in braggss house that morningthe old repulsion that had come at his touch she had never thought of him as a suitor or a beau before yet it now seemed perfectly plain to her that this was the ulterior meaning of his generosity and yet she received that intelligence with the same mixed emotions with which she had received his offer to educate her she did not conceal from herself the pride and satisfaction she felt in this presumptive selection of her as his wife the worldly advantages that it promised nor that it was a destiny far beyond her deserts yet she was conscious of exactly the same sense of wrongdoing in her preferencessomething that seemed vaguely akin to that conviction of sin of which she had heard so muchas when she received his offer of education it was this mixture of fear and satisfaction that caused her alternate paling and flushing yet this time it was the fear that came first perhaps she was becoming unduly sensitive the secretiveness of her sex came to her aid here and she awkwardly changed the subject aunt vashti complacently believing that her words had fallen on fruitful soil discreetly said no more  it was a hot morning when cissy walked alone to chapel early next sunday there was a dry irritation in the air which even the northwest trades blowing through the seaward gorge could not temper and for the first time in her life she looked forward to the leafy seclusion of the buried chapel with a feeling of longing she had avoided her youthful escort for she wished to practice alone for an hour before the service with the new harmonium that had taken the place of the old accordion and its unskillful performer perhaps too there was a timid desire to be at her best on the return of brother seabright and to show him with a new performance that the heavenly gift had not been neglected she opened the chapel with the key she always carried swished away an intrusive squirrel left the door and window open for a moment until the beating of frightened wings against the rafters had ceased and after carefully examining the floor for spiders mice and other creeping things brushed away a few fallen leaves and twigs from the top of the harmonium then with her long curls tossed over her shoulders and hanging limply down the back of her new mapleleaf yellow frockwhich was also a timid recognition of brother seabrights returnand her brown eyes turned to the rafters this rustic st cecilia of the coast range began to sing the shell of the little building dilated with the melody the sashes of the windows pulsated the two ejected linnets joined in timidly from their coign of vantage in the belfry outside and the limp vines above the porch swayed like her curls once she thought she heard stealthy footsteps without once she was almost certain she felt the brushing of somebody outside against the thin walls of the chapel and once she stopped to glance quickly at the window with a strange instinct that some one was looking at her but she quickly reflected that brother seabright would come there only when the deacons did and with them why she should think that it was brother seabright or why brother seabright should come thus and at such a time she could not have explained  he did not in fact make his appearance until later and after the congregation had quite filled the chapel he did not moreover appear to notice her as she sat there and when he gave out the hymn he seemed to have quietly overlooked the new harmonium she sang her best however and more than one of the audience thought that little sister appleby had greatly improved indeed it would not have seemed strange to someremembering brother seabrights discursive oratoryif he had made some allusion to it but he did not his heavy eyes moved slowly over the congregation and he began  as usual he did not take a text but he would talk to them that morning about the conviction of sin and the sense of wrongdoing that was innate in the sinner this included all form of temptation for what was temptation but the inborn consciousness of something to struggle against and that was sin at this apparently concise exposition of her own feelings in regard to don eliseos offer cissy felt herself blushing to the roots of her curls could it be possible that brother seabright had heard of her temptation to leave west woodlands and that this warning was intended for her he did not even look in her direction yet his next sentence seemed to be an answer to her own mental query  folks might ask he continued if even the young and inexperienced should feel thisor was there a state of innocent guilt without consciousness he would answer that question by telling them what had happened to him that morning he had come to the chapel not by the road but through the tangled woods behind them cissy startedthrough the thick brush and undergrowth that was choking the life out of this little chapelthe wilderness that he had believed was never before trodden by human feet and was known only to roaming beasts and vermin but that was where he was wrong  in the stillness and listening silence a sudden cough from some one in one of the back benches produced that instantaneous diversion of attention common to humanity on such occasions cissys curls swung round with the others but she was surprised to see that mr braggs was seated in one of the benches near the door and from the fact of his holding a handkerchief to his mouth and being gazed at by his neighbors it was evident that it was he who had coughed perhaps he had come to west woodlands to talk to her aunt with the preacher before her and her probable suitor behind her she felt herself again blushing  brother seabright continued yes he was wrong for there before him in the depths of the forest were two children they were looking at a bush of pizon berriesthe deadly nightshade as it was fitly calledand one was warning the other of its dangerous qualities  but how do you know its the pizon berry asked the other  because its larger and nicer and bigger and easier to get than the real good ones returned the other  and it was so thus was the truth revealed from the mouths of babes and sucklings even they were conscious of temptation and sin but here there was another interruption from the back benches which proved however to be only the suppressed giggle of a boyevidently the youthful hero of the illustration surprised into nervous hilarity  the preacher then passed to the conviction of sin in its more familiar phases many brothers confounded this with discovery and publicity it was not their own sin finding them out but others discovering it until that happened they fancied themselves safe stilling their consciences confounding the blinded eye of the world with the allseeing eye of the lord but were they safe even then did not sooner or later the sea deliver up its dead the earth what was buried in it the wild woods what its depths had hidden was not the foolish secret the guilty secret the forgotten sin sure to be disclosed then if they could not fly from the testimony of his works if they could not evade even their fellowman why did they not first turn to him why from the penitent child at his mothers knee to the murderer on the scaffold did they only at the last confess unto him  his voice and manner had suddenly changed from the rough note of accusation and challenge it had passed into the equally rough but broken and sympathetic accents of appeal why did they hesitate longer to confess their sinnot to manbut unto him why did they delay nowthat evening that very moment this was the appointed time he entreated them in the name of religious faith in the name of a human brotherly love his delivery was now no longer deliberate but hurried and panting his speech now no longer chosen but made up of reiterations and repetitions ejaculations and even incoherent epithets his gestures and long intonations which began to take the place of even that interrupted speech affected them more than his reasoning short sighs escaped them they swayed to and fro with the rhythm of his voice and movements they had begun to comprehend this exacerbation of emotionthis paroxysmal rhapsody this was the dithyrambic exaltation they had ardently waited for they responded quickly first with groans equally inarticulate murmurs of assent shouts of glory and the reckless invocation of sacred names then a wave of hysteria seemed to move the whole mass and broke into tears and sobs among the women in her own excited consciousness it seemed to cissy that some actual struggle between good and evillike unto the casting out of devilswas shaking the little building she cast a hurried glance behind her and saw mr braggs sitting erect white and scornful she knew that she too was shrinking from the speakernot from any sense of conviction but because he was irritating and disturbing her innate sense of fitness and harmonyand she was pained that mr braggs should see him thus meantime the weird invisible struggle continued heightened and it seemed to her incited by the partisan groans and exultant actions of those around her until suddenly a wild despairing cry arose above the conflict a vague fear seized herthe voice was familiar she turned in time to see the figure of aunt vashti rise in her seat with a hysterical outburst and fall convulsively forward upon her knees she would have rushed to her side but the frenzied woman was instantly caught by deacon shadwell and surrounded by a group of her own sex and became hidden and when cissy recovered herself she was astonished to find brother seabrightwith every trace of his past emotion vanished from his hardset facecalmly taking up his coherent discourse in his ordinary level tones the furious struggle of the moment before was over the chapel and its congregation had fallen back into an exhausted and apathetic silence then the preacher gave out the hymnthe words were singularly jubilant among that usually mournful collection in the book before herand cissy began it with a tremulous voice but it gained strength clearness and volume as she went on and she felt thrilled throughout with a new human sympathy she had never known before the preachers bass supported her now for the first time not unmusicallyand the service was over  relieved she turned quickly to join her aunt but a hand was laid gently upon her shoulder it was brother seabright who had just stepped from the platform the congregation knowing her to be the niece of the hysteric woman passed out without disturbing them  you have indeed improved your gift sister cecilia he said gravely you must have practiced much  yesthat is noonly a little stammered cissy  but excuse me i must look after auntie she added drawing timidly away  your aunt is better and has gone on with sister shadwell she is not in need of your help and really would do better without you just now i shall see her myself presently  but you made her sick already said cissy with a sudden halfnervous audacity you even frightened me  frightened you repeated seabright looking at her quickly  yes said cissy meeting his gaze with brown truthful eyes yes when youwhen youmade those faces i like to hear you talk butshe stopped  brother seabrights rare smile again lightened his face but it seemed sadder than when she had first seen it  then you have been practicing again at the mission he said quietly and you still prefer it  yes said cissy she wanted to appear as loyal to the mission in brother seabrights presence as she was faithful to west woodlands in mr braggss she had no idea that this was dangerously near to coquetry so she said a little archly i dont see why you dont like the mission youre a missionary yourself the old padres came here to spread the word so do you  but not in that way he said curtly ive seen enough of them when i was knocking round the world a seafaring man and a sinner i knew themreceivers of the illgotten gains of adventurers fools and scoundrels i knew themenriched by the spoils of persecution and oppression gathering under their walls outlaws and fugitives from justice and flinging an indulgence here and an absolution there as they were paid for it dont talk to me of themi know them  they were passing out of the chapel together and he made an impatient gesture as if dismissing the subject accustomed though she was to the sweeping criticism of her catholic friends by her west woodlands associates she was nevertheless hurt by his brusqueness she dropped a little behind and they separated at the porch notwithstanding her anxiety to see her aunt she felt she could not now go to deacon shadwells without seeming to follow himand after he had assured her that her help was not required she turned aside and made her way slowly towards her home  there she found that her aunt had not returned gathering from her uncle that she was recovering from a fit of high strikes hysterics and would be better alone whether he underrated her complaint or had a consciousness of his masculine helplessness in such disorders he evidently made light of it and when cissy afterwards a little ashamed that she had allowed her momentary pique against brother seabright to stand in the way of her duty determined to go to her aunt instead of returning to the chapel that evening he did not oppose it she learned also that mr braggs had called in the morning but finding that her aunt vashti was at chapel he had followed her there intending to return with her but he had not been seen since the service and had evidently returned to the mission  but when she reached deacon shadwells house she was received by mrs shadwell only her aunt said that lady was physically better but brother seabright had left partkler word that she was to see nobody it was an extraordinary case of findin the lord the like of which had never been known before in west woodlands and she cissy would yet be proud of one of her fammerly being speshally selected for grace but the workins o salvation was not to be finicked away on worldly things or even the affections of the flesh and if cissy really loved her aunt she wouldnt interfere with her while she was so to speak still on the mourners bench wrastlin with the sperret in their back sittinroom but she might wait until brother seabrights return from evening chapel after service  cissy waited nine oclock came but brother seabright did not return then a small but inconsequent dignity took possession of her and she slightly tossed her long curls from her shoulders she was not going to wait for any mans permission to see her own aunt if auntie did not want to see her that was enough she could go home alone she didnt want any one to go with her  lifted and sustained by these lofty considerations with an erect head and slightly ruffled mane well enwrapped in a becoming white merino cloud the young girl stepped out on her homeward journey she had certainly enough to occupy her mind and perhaps justify her independence to have a suitor for her hand in the person of the superior and wealthy mr braggsfor that was what his visit that morning to west woodlands meantand to be personally complimented on her improvement by the famous brother seabright all within twelve hours was something to be proud of even although it was mitigated by her aunts illness her suitors abrupt departure and brother seabrights momentary coldness and impatience oddly enough this last and apparently trivial circumstance occupied her thoughts more than the others she found herself looking out for him in the windings of the moonlit road and when at last she reached the turning towards the little wood and chapel her small feet unconsciously lingered until she felt herself blushing under her fleecy cloud she looked down the lane from the point where she was standing the lights of the chapel should have been plainly visible but now all was dark it was nearly ten oclock and he must have gone home by another road then a spirit of adventure seized her she had the key of the chapel in her pocket she remembered she had left a small black spanish fana former gift of mr braggs lying on the harmonium she would go and bring it away and satisfy herself that brother seabright was not there still it was but a step and in the clear moonlight  the lane wound before her like a silver stream except where it was interrupted and bridged over by jagged black shadows the chapel itself was black the clustering trees around it were black also the porch seemed to cover an inky well of shadow the windows were rayless and dead and in the chancel one still left open showed a yawning vault of obscurity within nevertheless she opened the door softly glided into the dark depths and made her way to the harmonium but here the sound of footsteps without startled her she glanced hurriedly through the open window and saw the figure of elisha braggs suddenly revealed in the moonlight as he crossed the path behind the chapel he was closely followed by two peons whom she recognized as his servants at the mission and they each carried a pickaxe from their manner it was evident that they had no suspicion of her presence in the chapel but they had stopped and were listening her heart beat quickly with a sudden instinct she ran and bolted the door but it was evidently another intruder they were watching for she presently saw brother seabright quietly cross the lane and approach the chapel the three men had disappeared but there was a sudden shout the sound of scuffling the deep voice of brother seabright saying back there will you hands off and a pause she could see nothing she listened in every pulse then the voice of brother seabright arose again quite clearly slowly and as deliberately as if it had risen from the platform in the chapel  lish barker i thought as much lish barker first mate of the tamalpais who was said to have gone down with a boats crew and the ships treasure after she struck i thought i knew that face today  yes said the voice of him whom she had known as elisha braggsyes and i knew your face jim seabright exwhaler slaver pirate and bosn of the highflyer marooned in the south pacific where you found the lordha haand became the psalmsinging converted american sailor preacher  i am not ashamed before men

illgotten gains turn sinner turn turn elisha braggs while there is yet time  belay there brother seabright were not inside your gospelshop just now keep your palaver for those that need it let me pass before i have to teach you that you havent to deal with a gang of hysterical old women tonight  but not until you know that one of those womenvashti whiteby gods grace converted of her sins has confessed her secret and yours elisha barker yes she has told me how her sisters husbandthe father of the young girl you are trying to lure awayhelped you off that night with your booty took his

let me pass  not until i know your purpose here tonight  then take the consequences here pedro ramon seize him tie him head and heels together and toss him in the bush  the sound of scuffling recommenced the struggle seemed fierce and long with no breath wasted in useless outcry then there was a bright flash a muffled report and the stinging and fire of gunpowder at the window  transfixed with fear cissy cast a despairing glance around her ah the bellrope in another instant she had grasped it frantically in her hands  all the fear indignation horror sympathy and wild appeal for help that had arisen helplessly in her throat and yet remained unuttered now seemed to thrill through her fingers and the tightened rope and broke into frantic voice in the clanging metal above her the whole chapel the whole woodland the clear moonlit sky above was filled with its alarming accents it shrieked implored protested summoned and threatened in one ceaseless outcry seeming to roll over and overas indeed it didin leaps and bounds that shook the belfry never before even in the blows of the striking surges had the bell of the tamalpais clamored like that once she heard above the turmoil the shaking of the door against the bolt that still held firmly once she thought she heard seabrights voice calling to her once she thought she smelled the strong smoke of burning grass but she kept on until the window was suddenly darkened by a figure and brother seabright leaping in caught her in his arms as she was reeling fainting but still clinging to the rope but his strong presence and some powerful magnetism in his touch restored her  you have heard all he said  yes  then for your aunts sake for your dead fathers sake forget all that wretched man has fled with his wounded hirelingslet his sin go with him but the village is alarmedthe brethren may be here any moment neither question nor deny what i shall tell them fear nothing god will forgive the silence that leaves the vengeance to his hands alone voices and footsteps were heard approaching the chapel brother seabright significantly pressed her hand and strode towards the door deacon shadwell was first to enter  you herebrother seabright what has happened  god be praised said brother seabright cheerfully nothing of consequence the danger is over yet but for the courage and presence of mind of sister appleby a serious evil might have been done he paused and with another voice turned halfinterrogatively towards her some children or a passing tramp had carelessly thrown matches in the underbrush and they were ignited beside the chapel sister appleby chancing to return here for  for my fan said cissy with a timid truthfulness of accent  found herself unable to cope with it and it occurred to her to give the alarm you heard i happened to be passing and was first to respond happily the flames had made but little headway and were quickly beaten down it is all over now but let us hope that the speedy clearing out of the underbrush and the opening of the woods around the chapel will prevent any recurrence of the alarm of tonight    that the lesson thus reiterated by brother seabright was effective the following extract from the columns of the whale point gazette may not only be offered as evidence but may even give the cautious reader further light on the episode itself   strange discovery at west woodlandsthe tamalpais mystery again  the improvements in the clearing around the sidon chapel at west woodlands undertaken by the rev james seabright have disclosed another link in the mystery which surrounded the loss of the tamalpais some years ago at whale mouth point it will be remembered that the boat containing adams  cos treasure the tamalpais first officer and a crew of four men was lost on the rocks shortly after leaving the illfated vessel none of the bodies were ever recovered and the treasure itself completely baffled the search of divers and salvers a lidless box bearing the mark of adams  co of the kind in which their treasure was usually shipped was yesterday found in the woods behind the chapel half buried in brush bark and windfalls there were no other indications except the traces of a campfire at some remote period probably long before the building of the chapel but how and when the box was transported to the upland and by whose agency still remains a matter of conjecture our reporter who visited the rev mr seabright who has lately accepted the regular ministry of the chapel was offered every facility for information but it was evident that the early settlers who were cognizant of the factif there were anyare either dead or have left the vicinity     the homecoming of jim wilkes   i   for many minutes there had been no sound but the monotonous drumming of the rain on the roof of the coach the swishing of wheels through the gravelly mud and the momentary clatter of hoofs upon some rocky outcrop in the road conversation had ceased the lighthearted young editor in the front seat more than suspected of dangerous levity had relapsed into silence since the heavy man in the middle seat had taken to regarding the ceiling with ostentatious resignation and the thin female beside him had averted her respectable bonnet an occasional lurch of the coach brought down a fringe of raindrops from its eaves that filmed the windows and shut out the sodden prospect already darkening into night there had been a momentary relief in their hurried dash through summit springs and the spectacle of certain newly arrived county delegates crowding the veranda of its one hotel but that was now three miles behind the young editors sole resource was to occasionally steal a glance at the face of the one passenger who seemed to be in sympathy with him but who was too far away for easy conversation it was the halfamused halfperplexed face of a young man who had been for some time regarding him from a remote corner of the coach with an odd mingling of admiring yet cogitating interest which however had never extended to any further encouragement than a faint sad smile even this at last faded out in the growing darkness the powerful coach lamps on either side that flashed on the wayside objects gave no light to the interior everybody was slowly falling asleep suddenly everybody woke up to find that the coach was apparently standing still when it had stopped no one knew the young editor lowered his window the coach lamp on that side was missing but nothing was to be seen in the distance there appeared to be a faint splashing  well called out an impatient voice from the box above what do you make it it was the authoritative accents of yuba bill the driver and everybody listened eagerly for the reply  it came faintly from the distance and the splashing almost four feet here and deepening as you go  dead water  noback water from the fork  there was a general movement towards the doors and windows the splashing came nearer then a light flashed on the trees the windows andtwo feet of yellow water peacefully flowing beneath them the thin female gave a slight scream  theres no danger said the expressman now wading towards them with the coach lamp in his hand but well have to pull round out of it and go back to the springs theres no getting past this break tonight  why didnt you let us know this before said the heavy man indignantly from the window  jim said the driver with that slow deliberation which instantly enforced complete attention  yes bill  have you got a spare copy of that reglar bulletin that the stage kempany issoos every ten minutes to each passenger to tell em where we are how far it is to the next place and wots the state o the weather ginrally  no said the expressman grimly as he climbed to the box theres not one left why  cos the emperor of chinys inside wantin one hoop keep your seats down there glang the whip cracked there was a desperate splashing a backward and forward jolting of the coach the glistening wet flanks and tossing heads of the leaders seen for a moment opposite the windows a sickening swirl of the whole body of the vehicle as if parting from its axles a long straight dragging pull andpresently the welcome sound of hoofs once more beating the firmer ground  hi hold updriver  it was the editors quiet friend who was leaning from the window  isnt wilkess ranch just off here  yes half a mile along the ridge i reckon returned the driver shortly  well if youre not going on tonight id get off and stop there  i reckon your heads level stranger said bill approvingly for theyre about chock full at the springs house  to descend the passenger was obliged to pass out by the middle seat and before the young editor as he did so he cast a shy look on him and leaning over said hesitatingly in a lower voice i dont think you will be able to get in at the springs hotel ififyou care to come with me totothe ranch i can take care of you  the young editora man of actionpaused for an instant only then seizing his bag he said promptly thank you and followed his newlyfound friend to the ground the whip cracked the coach rolled away  you know wilkes he said  yeees hes my father  ah said the editor cheerfully then youre going home  yes  it was quite light in the open and the stranger after a moments survey of the prospecta survey that however seemed to be characterized by his previous hesitationsaid this way crossed the road and began to follow a quite plain but long disused wagon track along the slope his manner was still so embarrassed that the young editor after gayly repeating his thanks for his companions thoughtful courtesy followed him in silence at the end of ten minutes they had reached some cultivated fields and orchards the stranger brightened although still with a preoccupied air quickened his pace and then suddenly stopped when the editor reached his side he was gazing with apparently still greater perplexity upon the level half obliterated and blackened foundations of what had been a large farmhouse  why its been burnt down he said thoughtfully  the editor stared at him burnt down it certainly had been but by no means recently grasses were already springing up from the charred beams in the cellar vines were trailing over the fallen chimneys excavations already old had been made among the ruins when were you here last the editor asked abruptly  five years ago said the stranger abstractedly  five yearsand you knew nothing of this  no i was in tahiti australia japan and china all the time  and you never heard from home  no you see i quoled with the old man and ran away  and you didnt write to tell them you were coming  no he hesitated and then added never thought o coming till i saw you  me  yes you andthe high water  do you mean to say said the young editor sharply that you brought mean utter stranger to youout of that coach to claim the hospitality of a father you had quarreled withhadnt seen for five years and didnt know if he would receive you  yesyou see thats just why i did it you see i reckoned my chances would be better to see him along with a cheerful chipper fellow like you i didnt of course kalkilate on this he added pointing dejectedly to the ruins  the editor gasped then a sudden conception of the unrivaled absurdity of the situation flashed upon himof his passively following the amiable idiot at his side in order to contemplate by the falling rain and lonely night a heap of sodden ruins while the coach was speeding to summit springs and shelter and above all the reason why he was inviteduntil putting down his bag he leaned upon his stick and laughed until the tears came to his eyes  at which his companion visibly brightened i told you so he said cheerfully i knew youd be able to take itand the old manin that way and that would have fetched him round  for heavens sake dont talk any more said the editor wiping his eyes but try to remember if you ever had any neighbors about here where we can stay tonight we cant walk to summit springs and we cant camp out on these ruins  there didnt use to be anybody nearer than the springs  but that was five years ago you say said the editor impatiently and although your father probably moved away after the house burned down the countrys been thickly settled since then that field has been lately planted there must be another house beyond lets follow the trail a little farther  they tramped along in silence this time the editor leading presently he stopped theres a housein thereamong the trees he said pointing whose is it  the stranger shook his head dubiously although apparently unaffected by any sentimental consideration of his fathers misfortune the spectacle of the blackened ruins of the homestead had evidently shaken his preconceived plans it wasnt there in my time he said musingly  but it is there in our time responded the editor briskly and i propose to go there from what you have told me of your fathereven if his house were still standingour chances of getting supper and a bed from him would be doubtful i suppose he continued as they moved on together you left him in angerfive years ago  yees  did he say anything as you left  i dont remember anything particular that he said  well what did he do  shot at me from the window  ah said the young editor softly nevertheless they walked on for some time in silence gradually a white picket fence came into view at right angles with the trail and a man appeared walking leisurely along what seemed to be the regularly traveled road beside it the editor who had taken matters in his own hands without speaking to his companion ran quickly forward and accosted the stranger briefly stating that he had left the stagecoach with a companion because it was stopped by high water and asked without entering into further details to be directed to some place where they could pass the night the man quite as briefly directed him to the house among the trees which he said was his own and then leisurely pursued his way along the road the young editor ran back to his companion who had halted in the dripping shadow of a sycamore and recounted his good fortune  i didnt he added say anything about your father you can make inquiries yourself later  i reckon there wont be much need of that returned his companion you didnt take much note o that man did you  not much said the editor  well thats my father and i reckon that new house must be his   ii   the young editor was a little startled the man he had just quitted certainly was not dangerous looking and yet remembering what his son had said there were homicidal possibilities look here he said quickly hes not there now why dont you seize the opportunity to slip into the house make peace with your mother and sisters and get them to intercede with your father when he returns  thar aint any mother she died afore i left my sister almirys a little girlthough thats four years ago and mebbee shes growed my brothers and me didnt pull together much but i was thinkin that mebbee you might go in thar for me first and see how the land lays then sorter tell em bout me in your takin chipper easy way make em laugh and when youve squared emill be hangin round outsideyou kin call me in dont you see  the young editor did see ridiculous as the proposal would have seemed to him an hour ago it now appeared practical and even commended itself to his taste his name was well known in the county and his mediation might be effective perhaps his vanity was slightly flattered by his companions faith in him perhaps he was not free from a certain human curiosity to know the rest perhaps he was more interested than he cared to confess in the helpless homeseeker beside him  but you must tell me something more of yourself and your fortune and prospects theyll be sure to ask questions  mebbee they wont but you can say ive done wellmade my pile over in australia and aint comin on them remembersay i aint comin on them  the editor nodded and then as if fearful of letting his present impulse cool ran off towards the house  it was large and respectable looking and augured well for the present fortunes of the wilkess the editor had determined to attack the citadel on its weaker feminine side and when the front door was opened to his knock asked to see miss almira wilkes the irish servant showed him into a comfortable looking sittingroom and in another moment with a quick rustle of skirts in the passage a very pretty girl impulsively entered from the first flash of her keen blue eyes the editora fair student of the sexconceived the idea that she had expected somebody else from the second that she was an arrant flirt and did not intend to be disappointed this much was in his favor  spurred by her provoking eyes and the novel situation he stated his business with an airy lightness and humor that seemed to justify his late companions estimate of his powers but even in his cynical attitude he was unprepared for the girls reception of his news he had expected some indignation or even harshness towards this man whom he was beginning to consider as a kind of detrimental outcast or prodigal but he was astounded at the complete and utter indifferencethe frank and heartless unconcernwith which she heard of his return when she had followed the narrator rather than his story to the end she languidly called her brothers from the adjoining room this gentleman mr grey of the argus has come across jimand jim is calculating to come here and see father  the two brothers stared at grey slightly shrugged their shoulders with the same utter absence of fraternal sympathy or concern which the girl had shown and said nothing  one moment said grey a little warmly i have no desire to penetrate family secrets but would you mind telling me if there is any grave reason why he should not come was there any scandalous conduct unpardonable offenselet us even sayany criminal act on his part which makes his return to this roof impossible  the three looked at each other with a dull surprise that ended in a vacant wondering smile no no they said in one voice no only  only what asked grey impatiently  dad just hates him  like pizon smiled almira  the young editor rose with a slight increase of color look here said the girl whose dimples had deepened as she keenly surveyed him as if detecting some amorous artifice under his show of interest for her brother dads gone down to the sheepfold and wont be back for an hour yo might bringyo friendin  he aint wantin anything aint dead broke nor nothin eh suggested one of the brothers dubiously  grey hastened to assure them of jims absolute solvency and even enlarged considerably on his australian fortune they looked relieved but not interested  go and fetch him said the witch archly hovering near grey with dancing eyes and mind yo come back too  grey hesitated a moment and then passed out in the dark porch a dripping figure emerged from the trees opposite it was jim  your sister and brothers will see you said grey hastily to avoid embarrassing details he wont be here for an hour but id advise you to make the most of your time and get the goodwill of your sister he would have drawn back to let the prodigal pass in alone but the man appealingly seized his arm and grey was obliged to reenter with him he noticed however that he breathed hard  they turned slightly towards their relative but did not offer to shake hands with him nor did he with them he sat down sideways on an unoffered chair the old house got burnt he said wiping his lips and then drying his wet hair with his handkerchief  as the remark was addressed to no one in particular it was some seconds before the elder brother replied yes  almiras growed  again no one felt called upon to answer and almira glanced archly at the young editor as if he might have added and improved  youve done well returned one of the brothers tentatively  yes im all right said jim  there was another speechless interval even the conversational grey felt under some unhallowed spell of silence that he could not break  i see the old well is there yet said jim wiping his lips again  where dad was once goin to chuck you down for givin him back talk said the younger brother casually  to mr greys relief and yet astonishment jim burst into a loud laugh and rubbed his legs thats sohow old times do come back  and said the brighteyed almira theres that old butternuttree that you shinned up one day when we set the hounds on you goodness how you scooted  again jim laughed loudly and nodded yes the same old butternut how you do remember almira this admiringly  and dont you remember delia short continued almira pleased at the admiration and perhaps a little exalted at the singular attention which the young editor was giving to those cheerful reminiscences she you know you was reglarly sick after so that we always allowed she kinder turned yo brain afore you went away well all the while you were courtin her it appears she was secretly married to joyo friendjo stacy lord there was a talk about that and about yo all along thinkin yo had chances yo friend here with an arch glance at grey whos allus puttin folks in the newspapers orter get a hold on that  jim again laughed louder than the others and rubbed his lips grey however offered only the tribute of a peculiar smile and walked to the window you say your father will return in an hour he said turning to the elder brother  yes unless he kept on to watsons  where said jim suddenly  it struck grey that his voice had changedor rather that he was now speaking for the first time in his natural tone  watsons just over the bridge explained his brother if he went there he wont be back till ten  jim picked up his india rubber cape and hat said i reckon ill just take a turn outside until he gets back and walked towards the door none of his relatives moved nor seemed to offer any opposition grey followed him quickly ill go with you he said  no returned jim with singular earnestness you stay here and keep em up cheerful like this theyre doing all this for you you know almirys just this chipper only on your account  seeing the young man was inflexible grey returned grimly to the room but not until he had noticed with some surprise that jim immediately on leaving the house darted off at a quick run through the rain and darkness preoccupied with this and perhaps still influenced by the tone of the previous conversation he did not respond readily to the fair almiras conversational advances and was speedily left to a seat by the fire alone at the end of ten minutes he regretted he had ever come when half an hour had passed he wondered if he had not better try to reach the summit alone with the lapse of an hour he began to feel uneasy at jims prolonged absence in spite of the cold indifference of the household suddenly he heard stamping in the porch a muttered exclamation and the voices of the two brothers in the hall why dad whats up yo look half drowned  the door opened upon the sodden steaming figure of the old man whom he had met on the road followed by the two sons but he was evidently more occupied and possessed by some mental passion than by his physical discomfort yet strong and dominant over both he threw off his wet coat and waistcoat as he entered and marched directly to the fire utterly ignoring the presence of a stranger he suddenly turned and faced his family  half drowned yes and i might have been hull drowned for that matter the back water of the fork is all over watsons and the bridge is gone i stumbled onto this end of it in the dark and went off head first into twenty feet of water tried to fight my way out but the current was agin me id bin down twice and was going down for the third time when somebody grabbed me by the scruff o my neck and under the armsoand swam me to the bank when i scrambled up i sez i cant see your face sez i i dont know who you are sez i but i reckon youre a white man and clear grit sez i and theres my hand on it and he grabs it and sez were quits and scooted out o my sight and continued the old man staring at their faces and raising his voice almost to a scream who do you think it was why that sneakin hound of a brother of yoursjim jim the scallawag that i booted outer the ranch five years ago crawlin writhin back again after all these years to insult his old fathers gray hairs and some of youby godonce thought that i was hard on him    the sun was shining brightly the next morning as the young editor halted the up coach in the now dried hollow as he was clambering to a seat beside the driver his elbow was jogged at the window looking down he saw the face of jim  we had a gay talk last night remembering old times didnt we said the prodigal cheerfully  yes butwhere are you going now  back to australia i reckon but it was mighty good to drop in on the old homestead once more  rather said the editor clinging to the window and lingering in midair to the manifest impatience of yuba bill but i saylook herewere you quite satisfied  jims hand tightened around the young editors as he answered cheerfully yes but his face was turned away from the window
