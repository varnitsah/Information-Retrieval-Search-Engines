farmer bassett with a house full of sturdy sons and daughters growing up about him they were poor in money but rich in land and love for the wide acres of wood corn and pasture land fed warmed and clothed the flock while mutual patience affection and courage made the old farmhouse a very happy home  november had come the crops were in and barn buttery and bin were overflowing with the harvest that rewarded the summers hard work the big kitchen was a jolly place just now for in the great fireplace roared a cheerful fire on the walls hung garlands of dried apples onions and corn up aloft from the beams shone crooknecked squashes juicy hams and dried venisonfor in those days deer still haunted the deep forests and hunters flourished savory smells were in the air on the crane hung steaming kettles and down among the red embers copper saucepans simmered all suggestive of some approaching feast  a whiteheaded baby lay in the old blue cradle that had rocked seven other babies now and then lifting his head to look out like a round full moon then subsided to kick and crow contentedly and suck the rosy apple he had no teeth to bite two small boys sat on the wooden settle shelling corn for popping and picking out the biggest nuts from the goodly store their own hands had gathered in october four young girls stood at the long dresser busily chopping meat pounding spice and slicing apples and the tongues of tilly prue roxy and rhody went as fast as their hands farmer bassett and eph the oldest boy were chorin round outside for thanksgiving was at hand and all must be in order for that timehonored day  to and fro from table to hearth bustled buxom mrs bassett flushed and floury but busy and blithe as the queen bee of this busy little hive should be  i do like to begin seasonable and have things to my mind thanksgivin dinners cant be drove and it does take a sight of victuals to fill all these hungry stomicks said the good woman as she gave a vigorous stir to the great kettle of cider applesauce and cast a glance of housewifely pride at the fine array of pies set forth on the buttery shelves  only one more day and then it will be time to eat i didnt take but one bowl of hasty pudding this morning so i shall have plenty of room when the nice things come confided seth to sol as he cracked a large hazelnut as easily as a squirrel  no need of my starvin beforehand i always have room enough and id like to have thanksgiving every day answered solomon gloating like a young ogre over the little pig that lay near by ready for roasting  sakes alive i dont boys its a marcy it dont come but once a year i should be worn to a threadpaper with all this extra work atop of my winter weavin and spinnin laughed their mother as she plunged her plump arms into the long breadtrough and began to knead the dough as if a famine was at hand  tilly the oldest girl a redcheeked blackeyed lass of fourteen was grinding briskly at the mortar for spices were costly and not a grain must be wasted prue kept time with the chopper and the twins sliced away at the apples till their little brown arms ached for all knew how to work and did so now with a will  i think its real fun to have thanksgiving at home im sorry granma is sick so we cant go there as usual but i like to mess round here dont you girls asked tilly pausing to take a sniff at the spicy pestle  it will be kind of lonesome with only our own folks i like to see all the cousins and aunts and have games and sing cried the twins who were regular little romps and could run swim coast and shout as well as their brothers  i dont care a mite for all that it will be so nice to eat dinner together warm and comfortable at home said quiet prue who loved her own cozy nooks like a cat  come girls fly round and get your chores done so we can clear away for dinner jest as soon as i clap my bread into the oven called mrs bassett presently as she rounded off the last loaf of brown bread which was to feed the hungry mouths that seldom tasted any other  heres a man comin up the hill lively guess its gad hopkins pa told him to bring a dezzen oranges if they warnt too high shouted sol and seth running to the door while the girls smacked their lips at the thought of this rare treat and baby threw his apple overboard as if getting ready for a new cargo  but all were doomed to disappointment for it was not gad with the muchdesired fruit it was a stranger who threw himself off his horse and hurried up to mr bassett in the yard with some brief message that made the farmer drop his ax and look so sober that his wife guessed at once some bad news had come and crying mothers wuss i know she is out ran the good woman forgetful of the flour on her arms and the oven waiting for its most important batch  the man said old mr chadwick down to keene stopped him as he passed and told him to tell mrs bassett her mother was failin fast and shed better come today he knew no more and having delivered his errand he rode away saying it looked like snow and he must be jogging or he wouldnt get home till night  we must go right off eldad hitch up and ill be ready in lessn no time said mrs bassett wasting not a minute in tears and lamentations but pulling off her apron as she went in with her mind in a sad jumble of bread anxiety turkey sorrow haste and cider applesauce  a few words told the story and the children left their work to help her get ready mingling their grief for granma with regrets for the lost dinner  im dreadful sorry dears but it cant be helped i couldnt cook nor eat no way now and if that blessed woman gets better sudden as she has before well have cause for thanksgivin and ill give you a dinner you wont forget in a hurry said mrs bassett as she tied on her brown silk pumpkinhood with a sob for the good old mother who had made it for her  not a child complained after that but ran about helpfully bringing moccasins heating the footstone and getting ready for a long drive because granma lived twenty miles away and there were no railroads in those parts to whisk people to and fro like magic by the time the old yellow sleigh was at the door the bread was in the oven and mrs bassett was waiting with her camlet cloak on and the baby done up like a small bale of blankets  now eph you must look after the cattle like a man and keep up the fires for theres a storm brewin and neither the children nor dumb critters must suffer said mr bassett as he turned up the collar of his rough coat and put on his blue mittens while the old mare shook her bells as if she preferred a trip to keene to hauling wood all day  tilly put extry comfortables on the beds tonight the wind is so searchin up chamber have the baked beans and injunpuddin for dinner and whatever you do dont let the boys git at the mincepies or youll have them down sick i shall come back the minute i can leave mother pa will come tomorrer anyway so keep snug and be good i depend on you my darter use your jedgment and dont let nothin happen while mothers away  yesm yesmgoodbye goodbye called the children as mrs bassett was packed into the sleigh and driven away leaving a stream of directions behind her  eph the sixteenyearold boy immediately put on his biggest boots assumed a sober responsible manner and surveyed his little responsibilities with a paternal air drolly like his fathers tilly tied on her mothers bunch of keys rolled up the sleeves of her homespun gown and began to order about the younger girls they soon forgot poor granny and found it great fun to keep house all alone for mother seldom left home but ruled her family in the good oldfashioned way there were no servants for the little daughters were mrs bassetts only maids and the stout boys helped their father all working happily together with no wages but love learning in the best manner the use of the heads and hands with which they were to make their own way in the world  the few flakes that caused the farmer to predict bad weather soon increased to a regular snowstorm with gusts of wind for up among the hills winter came early and lingered long but the children were busy gay and warm indoors and never minded the rising gale nor the whirling white storm outside  tilly got them a good dinner and when it was over the two elder girls went to their spinning for in the kitchen stood the big and little wheels and baskets of woolrolls ready to be twisted into yarn for the winters knitting and each day brought its stint of work to the daughters who hoped to be as thrifty as their mother  eph kept up a glorious fire and superintended the small boys who popped corn and whittled boats on the hearth while roxy and rhody dressed corncob dolls in the settle corner and bose the brindled mastiff lay on the braided mat luxuriously warming his old legs thus employed they made a pretty picture these rosy boys and girls in their homespun suits with the rustic toys or tasks which most children nowadays would find very poor or tiresome  tilly and prue sang as they stepped to and fro drawing out the smoothly twisted threads to the musical hum of the great spinningwheels the little girls chattered like magpies over their dolls and the new bedspread they were planning to make all white dimity stars on a blue calico ground as a christmas present to ma the boys roared at ephs jokes and had rough and tumble games over bose who didnt mind them in the least and so the afternoon wore pleasantly away  at sunset the boys went out to feed the cattle bring in heaps of wood and lock up for the night as the lonely farmhouse seldom had visitors after dark the girls got the simple supper of brown bread and milk baked apples and a doughnut all round as a treat then they sat before the fire the sisters knitting the brothers with books or games for eph loved reading and sol and seth never failed to play a few games of morris with barley corns on the little board they had made themselves at one corner of the dresser  read out a piece said tilly from mothers chair where she sat in state finishing off the sixth woolen sock she had knit that month  its the old history book but heres a bit you may like since its about our folks answered eph turning the yellow page to look at a picture of two quaintly dressed children in some ancient castle  yes read that i always like to hear about the lady matildy i was named for and lord bassett pas greatgreatgreatgrandpa hes only a farmer now but its nice to know that we were somebody two or three hundred years ago said tilly bridling and tossing her curly head as she fancied the lady matilda might have done  dont read the queer words cause we dont understand em tell it commanded roxy from the cradle where she was drowsily cuddled with rhody  well a long time ago when charles the first was in prison lord bassett was a true friend to him began eph plunging into his story without delay the lord had some papers that would have hung a lot of people if the kings enemies got hold of em so when he heard one day all of a sudden that soldiers were at the castlegate to carry him off he had just time to call his girl to him and say i may be going to my death but i wont betray my master there is no time to burn the papers and i can not take them with me they are hidden in the old leathern chair where i sit no one knows this but you and you must guard them till i come or send you a safe messenger to take them away promise me to be brave and silent and i can go without fear you see he wasnt afraid to die but he was to seem a traitor lady matildy promised solemnly and the words were hardly out of her mouth when the men came in and her father was carried away a prisoner and sent off to the tower  but she didnt cry she just called her brother and sat down in that chair with her head leaning back on those papers like a queen and waited while the soldiers hunted the house over for em wasnt that a smart girl cried tilly beaming with pride for she was named for this ancestress and knew the story by heart  i reckon she was scared though when the men came swearin in and asked her if she knew anything about it the boy did his part then for he didnt know and fired up and stood before his sister and he says says he as bold as a lion if my lord had told us where the papers be we would die before we would betray him but we are children and know nothing and it is cowardly of you to try to fright us with oaths and drawn swords  as eph quoted from the book seth planted himself before tilly with the long poker in his hand saying as he flourished it valiantly  why didnt the boy take his fathers sword and lay about him i would if any one was hash to tilly  you bantam he was only a bit of a boy and couldnt do anything sit down and hear the rest of it commanded tilly with a pat on the yellow head and a private resolve that seth should have the largest piece of pie at dinner next day as reward for his chivalry  well the men went off after turning the castle out of window but they said they should come again so faithful matildy was full of trouble and hardly dared to leave the room where the chair stood all day she sat there and at night her sleep was so full of fear about it that she often got up and went to see that all was safe the servants thought the fright had hurt her wits and let her be but rupert the boy stood by her and never was afraid of her queer ways she was a pious maid the book says and often spent the long evenings reading the bible with her brother by her all alone in the great room with no one to help her bear her secret and no good news of her father at last word came that the king was dead and his friends banished out of england then the poor children were in a sad plight for they had no mother and the servants all ran away leaving only one faithful old man to help them  but the father did come cried roxy eagerly  youll see continued eph half telling half reading  matilda was sure he would so she sat on in the big chair guarding the papers and no one could get her away till one day a man came with her fathers ring and told her to give up the secret she knew the ring but would not tell until she had asked many questions so as to be very sure and while the man answered all about her father and the king she looked at him sharply then she stood up and said in a tremble for there was something strange about the man sir i doubt you in spite of the ring and i will not answer till you pull off the false beard you wear that i may see your face and know if you are my fathers friend or foe off came the disguise and matilda found it was my lord himself come to take them with him out of england he was very proud of that faithful girl i guess for the old chair still stands in the castle and the name keeps in the family pa says even over here where some of the bassetts came along with the pilgrims  our tilly would have been as brave i know and she looks like the old picter down to grandmas dont she eph cried prue who admired her bold bright sister very much  well i think youd do the settin part best prue you are so patient till would fight like a wild cat but she cant hold her tongue worth a cent answered eph whereat tilly pulled his hair and the story ended with a general frolic  when the moonfaced clock behind the door struck nine tilly tucked up the children under the extry comfortables and having kissed them all around as mother did crept into her own nest never minding the little drifts of snow that sifted in upon her coverlet between the shingles of the roof nor the storm that raged without  as if he felt the need of unusual vigilance old bose lay down on the mat before the door and pussy had the warm hearth all to herself if any late wanderer had looked in at midnight he would have seen the fire blazing up again and in the cheerful glow the old cat blinking her yellow eyes as she sat bolt upright beside the spinningwheel like some sort of household goblin guarding the children while they slept  when they woke like early birds it still snowed but up the little bassetts jumped broke the ice in their pitchers and went down with cheeks glowing like winter apples after a brisk scrub and scramble into their clothes eph was off to the barn and tilly soon had a great kettle of mush ready which with milk warm from the cows made a wholesome breakfast for the seven hearty children  now about dinner said the young housekeeper as the pewter spoons stopped clattering and the earthen bowls stood empty  ma said have what we liked but she didnt expect us to have a real thanksgiving dinner because she wont be here to cook it and we dont know how began prue doubtfully  i can roast a turkey and make a pudding as well as anybody i guess the pies are all ready and if we cant boil vegetables and so on we dont deserve any dinner cried tilly burning to distinguish herself and bound to enjoy to the utmost her brief authority  yes yes cried all the boys lets have a dinner anyway ma wont care and the good victuals will spoil if they aint eaten right up  pa is coming tonight so we wont have dinner till late that will be real genteel and give us plenty of time added tilly suddenly realizing the novelty of the task she had undertaken  did you ever roast a turkey asked roxy with an air of deep interest  should you darst to try said rhody in an awestricken tone  you will see what i can do ma said i was to use my jedgment about things and im going to all you children have got to do is to keep out of the way and let prue and me work eph i wish youd put a fire in the best room so the little ones can play in there we shall want the settinroom for the table and i wont have em pickin round when we get things fixed commanded tilly bound to make her short reign a brilliant one  i dont know about that ma didnt tell us to began cautious eph who felt that this invasion of the sacred best parlor was a daring step  dont we always do it sundays and thanksgivings wouldnt ma wish the children kept safe and warm anyhow can i get up a nice dinner with four rascals under my feet all the time come now if you want roast turkey and onions plumpuddin and mincepie youll have to do as i tell you and be lively about it  tilly spoke with such spirit and her last suggestion was so irresistible that eph gave in and laughing goodnaturedly tramped away to heat up the best room devoutly hoping that nothing serious would happen to punish such audacity  the young folks delightedly trooped in to destroy the order of that prim apartment with housekeeping under the black horsehair sofa horseback riders on the arms of the best rockingchair and an indian wardance all over the wellwaxed furniture eph finding the society of the peaceful sheep and cows more to his mind than that of two excited sisters lingered over his chores in the barn as long as possible and left the girls in peace  now tilly and prue were in their glory and as soon as the breakfast things were out of the way they prepared for a grand cookingtime they were handy girls though they had never heard of a cookingschool never touched a piano and knew nothing of embroidery beyond the samplers which hung framed in the parlor one ornamented with a pink mourner under a blue weepingwillow the other with this pleasing verse each word being done in a different color which gave the effect of a distracted rainbow      this sampler neat was worked by me      in my twelfth year prudence b  both rolled up their sleeves put on their largest aprons and got out all the spoons dishes pots and pans they could find so as to have everything handy as prue said  now sister well have dinner at five pa will be here by that time if he is coming tonight and be so surprised to find us all ready for he wont have had any very nice victuals if granma is so sick said tilly importantly i shall give the children a piece at noon tilly meant luncheon doughnuts and cheese with applepie and cider will please em theres beans for eph he likes cold pork so we wont stop to warm it up for theres lots to do and i dont mind saying to you im dreadful dubersome about the turkey  its all ready but the stuffing and roasting is as easy as can be i can baste first rate ma always likes to have me im so patient and stiddy she says answered prue for the responsibility of this great undertaking did not rest upon her so she took a cheerful view of things  i know but its the stuffin that troubles me said tilly rubbing her round elbows as she eyed the immense fowl laid out on a platter before her i dont know how much i want nor what sort of yarbs to put in and hes so awful big im kind of afraid of him  i aint i fed him all summer and he never gobbled at me i feel real mean to be thinking of gobbling him poor old chap laughed prue patting her departed pet with an air of mingled affection and appetite  well ill get the puddin off my mind fust for it ought to bile all day put the big kettle on and see that the spit is clean while i get ready  prue obediently tugged away at the crane with its black hooks from which hung the iron teakettle and threelegged pot then she settled the long spit in the grooves made for it in the tall andirons and put the drippingpan underneath for in those days meat was roasted as it should be not baked in ovens  meantime tilly attacked the plumpudding she felt pretty sure of coming out right here for she had seen her mother do it so many times it looked very easy so in went suet and fruit all sorts of spice to be sure she got the right ones and brandy instead of wine but she forgot both sugar and salt and tied it in the cloth so tightly that it had no room to swell so it would come out as heavy as lead and as hard as a cannonball if the bag did not burst and spoil it all happily unconscious of these mistakes tilly popped it into the pot and proudly watched it bobbing about before she put the cover on and left it to its fate  i cant remember what flavorin ma puts in she said when she had got her bread well soaked for the stuffing sage and onions and applesauce go with goose but i cant feel sure of anything but pepper and salt for a turkey  ma puts in some kind of mint i know but i forget whether it is spearmint peppermint or pennyroyal answered prue in a tone of doubt but trying to show her knowledge of yarbs or at least of their names  seems to me its sweet marjoram or summer savory i guess well put both in and then we are sure to be right the best is up garret you run and get some while i mash the bread commanded tilly diving into the mess  away trotted prue but in her haste she got catnip and wormwood for the garret was darkish and prues little nose was so full of the smell of the onions she had been peeling that everything smelt of them eager to be of use she pounded up the herbs and scattered the mixture with a liberal hand into the bowl  it doesnt smell just right but i suppose it will when it is cooked said tilly as she filled the empty stomach that seemed aching for food and sewed it up with the blue yarn which happened to be handy she forgot to tie down his legs and wings but she set him by till his hour came well satisfied with her work  shall we roast the little pig too i think hed look nice with a necklace of sausages as ma fixed one last christmas asked prue elated with their success  i couldnt do it i loved that little pig and cried when he was killed i should feel as if i was roasting the baby answered tilly glancing toward the buttery where piggy hung looking so pink and pretty it certainly did seem cruel to eat him  it took a long time to get all the vegetables ready for as the cellar was full the girls thought they would have every sort eph helped and by noon all was ready for cooking and the cranberrysauce a good deal scorched was cooling in the leanto  luncheon was a lively meal and doughnuts and cheese vanished in such quantities that tilly feared no one would have an appetite for her sumptuous dinner the boys assured her they would be starving by five oclock and sol mourned bitterly over the little pig that was not to be served up  now you all go and coast while prue and i set the table and get out the best chiny said tilly bent on having her dinner look well no matter what its other failings might be  out came the rough sleds on went the round hoods old hats red cloaks and moccasins and away trudged the four younger bassetts to disport themselves in the snow and try the ice down by the old mill where the great wheel turned and splashed so merrily in the summertime  eph took his fiddle and scraped away to his hearts content in the parlor while the girls after a short rest set the table and made all ready to dish up the dinner when that exciting moment came it was not at all the sort of table we see now but would look very plain and countrified to us with its greenhandled knives and twopronged steel forks its redandwhite china and pewter platters scoured till they shone with mugs and spoons to match and a brown jug for the cider the cloth was coarse but white as snow and the little maids had seen the blueeyed flax grow out of which their mother wove the linen they had watched and watered while it bleached in the green meadow they had no napkins and little silver but the best tankard and mas few wedding spoons were set forth in state nuts and apples at the corners gave an air and the place of honor was left in the middle for the oranges yet to come  dont it look beautiful said prue when they paused to admire the general effect  pretty nice i think i wish ma could see how well we can do it began tilly when a loud howling startled both girls and sent them flying to the window the short afternoon had passed so quickly that twilight had come before they knew it and now as they looked out through the gathering dusk they saw four small black figures tearing up the road to come bursting in all screaming at once the bear the bear eph get the gun hes coming hes coming  eph had dropped his fiddle and got down his gun before the girls could calm the children enough to tell their story which they did in a somewhat incoherent manner down in the holler coastin we heard a growl began sol with his eyes as big as saucers i see him fust lookin over the wall roared seth eager to get his share of honor  awful big and shaggy quavered roxy clinging to tilly while rhody hid in prues skirts and piped out his great paws kept clawing at us and i was so scared my legs would hardly go  we ran away as fast as we could go and he come growling after us hes awful hungry and hell eat every one of us if he gets in continued sol looking about him for a safe retreat  oh eph dont let him eat us cried both little girls flying up stairs to hide under their mothers bed as their surest shelter  no danger of that you little geese ill shoot him as soon as he comes get out of the way boys and eph raised the window to get good aim  there he is fire away and dont miss cried seth hastily following sol who had climbed to the top of the dresser as a good perch from which to view the approaching fray  prue retired to the hearth as if bent on dying at her post rather than desert the turkey now browning beautiful as she expressed it but tilly boldly stood at the open window ready to lend a hand if the enemy proved too much for eph  all had seen bears but none had ever come so near before and even brave eph felt that the big brown beast slowly trotting up the dooryard was an unusually formidable specimen he was growling horribly and stopped now and then as if to rest and shake himself  get the ax tilly and if i should miss stand ready to keep him off while i load again said eph anxious to kill his first bear in style and alone a girls help didnt count  tilly flew for the ax and was at her brothers side by the time the bear was near enough to be dangerous he stood on his hind legs and seemed to sniff with relish the savory odors that poured out of the window  fire eph cried tilly firmly  wait till he rears again ill get a better shot then answered the boy while prue covered her ears to shut out the bang and the small boys cheered from their dusty refuge up among the pumpkins  but a very singular thing happened next and all who saw it stood amazed for suddenly tilly threw down the ax flung open the door and ran straight into the arms of the bear who stood erect to receive her while his growlings changed to a loud haw haw that startled the children more than the report of a gun  its gad hopkins tryin to fool us cried eph much disgusted at the loss of his prey for these hardy boys loved to hunt and prided themselves on the number of wild animals and birds they could shoot in a year  oh gad how could you scare us so laughed tilly still held fast in one shaggy arm of the bear while the other drew a dozen oranges from some deep pocket in the buffaloskin coat and fired them into the kitchen with such good aim that eph ducked prue screamed and sol and seth came down much quicker than they went up  wal you see i got upsot over yonder and the old horse went home while i was floundering in a drift so i tied on the buffalers to tote em easy and come along till i see the children playin in the holler i jest meant to give em a little scare but they run like partridges and i kep up the joke to see how eph would like this sort of company and gad hawhawed again  youd have had a warm welcome if we hadnt found you out id have put a bullet through you in a jiffy old chap said eph coming out to shake hands with the young giant who was only a year or two older than himself  come in and set up to dinner with us prue and i have done it all ourselves and pa will be along soon i reckon cried tilly trying to escape  couldnt no ways my folks will think im dead ef i dont get along home sence the horse and sleigh have gone ahead empty ive done my arrant and had my joke now i want my pay tilly and gad took a hearty kiss from the rosy cheeks of his little sweetheart as he called her his own cheeks tingled with the smart slap she gave him as she ran away calling out that she hated bears and would bring her ax next time  i aint afeared your sharp eyes found me out and ef you run into a bears arms you must expect a hug answered gad as he pushed back the robe and settled his fur cap more becomingly  i should have known you in a minute if i hadnt been asleep when the girls squalled you did it well though and i advise you not to try it again in a hurry or youll get shot said eph as they parted he rather crestfallen and gad in high glee  my sakes alivethe turkey is burnt one side and the kettles have biled over so the pies i put to warm are all ashes scolded tilly as the flurry subsided and she remembered her dinner  well i cant help it i couldnt think of victuals when i expected to be eaten alive myself could i pleaded poor prue who had tumbled into the cradle when the rain of oranges began  tilly laughed and all the rest joined in so good humor was restored and the spirits of the younger ones were revived by sucks from the one orange which passed from hand to hand with great rapidity while the older girls dished up the dinner they were just struggling to get the pudding out of the cloth when roxy called out heres pa  theres folks with him added rhody  lots of em i see two big sleighs chock full shouted seth peering through the dusk  it looks like a semintary guess grammas dead and come up to be buried here said sol in a solemn tone this startling suggestion made tilly prue and eph hasten to look out full of dismay at such an ending of their festival  if that is a funeral the mourners are uncommon jolly said eph drily as merry voices and loud laughter broke the white silence without  i see aunt cinthy and cousin hettyand theres mose and amos i do declare pas bringin em all home to have some fun here cried prue as she recognized one familiar face after another  oh my patience aint i glad i got dinner and dont i hope it will turn out good exclaimed tilly while the twins pranced with delight and the small boys roared  hooray for pa hooray for thanksgivin  the cheer was answered heartily and in came father mother baby aunts and cousins all in great spirits and all much surprised to find such a festive welcome awaiting them  aint granma dead at all asked sol in the midst of the kissing and handshaking  bless your heart no it was all a mistake of old mr chadwicks hes as deaf as an adder and when mrs brooks told him mother was mendin fast and she wanted me to come down today certain sure he got the message all wrong and give it to the fust person passin in such a way as to scare me most to death and send us down in a hurry mother was sittin up as chirk as you please and dreadful sorry you didnt all come  so to keep the house quiet for her and give you a taste of the fun your pa fetched us all up to spend the evenin and we are goin to have a jolly time ont to jedge by the looks of things said aunt cinthy briskly finishing the tale when mrs bassett paused for want of breath  what in the world put it into your head we was comin and set you to gettin up such a supper asked mr bassett looking about him well pleased and much surprised at the plentiful table  tilly modestly began to tell but the others broke in and sang her praises in a sort of chorus in which bears pigs pies and oranges were oddly mixed great satisfaction was expressed by all and tilly and prue were so elated by the commendation of ma and the aunts that they set forth their dinner sure everything was perfect  but when the eating began which it did the moment wraps were off then their pride got a fall for the first person who tasted the stuffing it was big cousin mose and that made it harder to bear nearly choked over the bitter morsel  tilly bassett whatever made you put wormwood and catnip in your stuffin demanded ma trying not to be severe for all the rest were laughing and tilly looked ready to cry  i did it said prue nobly taking all the blame which caused pa to kiss her on the spot and declare that it didnt do a might of harm for the turkey was all right  i never see onions cooked better all the vegetables is well done and the dinner a credit to you my dears declared aunt cinthy with her mouth full of the fragrant vegetable she praised  the pudding was an utter failure in spite of the blazing brandy in which it layas hard and heavy as one of the stone balls on squire dunkins great gate it was speedily whisked out of sight and all fell upon the pies which were perfect but tilly and prue were much depressed and didnt recover their spirits till the dinner was over and the evening fun well under way  blindmans buff hunt the slipper come philander and other lively games soon set every one bubbling over with jollity and when eph struck up money musk on his fiddle old and young fell into their places for a dance all down the long kitchen they stood mr and mrs bassett at the top the twins at the bottom and then away they went heeling and toeing cutting pigeonwings and taking their steps in a way that would convulse modern children with their newfangled romps called dancing mose and tilly covered themselves with glory by the vigor with which they kept it up till fat aunt cinthy fell into a chair breathlessly declaring that a very little of such exercise was enough for a woman of her heft  apples and cider chat and singing finished the evening and after a grand kissing all round the guests drove away in the clear moonlight which came just in time to cheer their long drive  when the jingle of the last bell had died away mr bassett said soberly as they stood together on the hearth children we have special cause to be thankful that the sorrow we expected was changed into joy so well read a chapter fore we go to bed and give thanks where thanks is due  then tilly set out the lightstand with the big bible on it and a candle on each side and all sat quietly in the firelight smiling as they listened with happy hearts to the sweet old words that fit all times and seasons so beautifully  when the goodnights were over and the children in bed prue put her arm around tilly and whispered tenderly for she felt her shake and was sure she was crying  dont mind about the old stuffin and puddin dearynobody cared and ma said we really did do surprisin well for such young girls  the laughter tilly was trying to smother broke out then and was so infectious prue could not help joining her even before she knew the cause of the merriment  i was mad about the mistakes but dont care enough to cry im laughing to think how gad fooled eph and i found him out i thought mose and amos would have died over it when i told them it was so funny explained tilly when she got her breath  i was so scared that when the first orange hit me i thought it was a bullet and scrabbled into the cradle as fast as i could it was real mean to frighten the little ones so laughed prue as tilly gave a growl  here a smart rap on the wall of the next room caused a sudden lull in the fun and mrs bassetts voice was heard saying warningly girls go to sleep immediate or youll wake the baby  yesm answered two meek voices and after a few irrepressible giggles silence reigned broken only by an occasional snore from the boys or the soft scurry of mice in the buttery taking their part in this oldfashioned thanksgiving     ii  how it all happened   it was a small room with nothing in it but a bed two chairs and a big chest a few little gowns hung on the wall and the only picture was the wintry sky sparkling with stars framed by the uncurtained window but the moon pausing to peep saw something pretty and heard something pleasant two heads in little round nightcaps lay on one pillow two pairs of wideawake blue eyes stared up at the light and two tongues were going like mill clappers  im so glad we got our shirts done in time it seemed as if we never should and i dont think six cents is half enough for a great red flannel thing with four buttonholesdo you said one little voice rather wearily  no but then we each made four and fifty cents is a good deal of money are you sorry we didnt keep our quarters for ourselves asked the other voice with an undertone of regret in it  yes i am till i think how pleased the children will be with our tree for they dont expect anything and will be so surprised i wish we had more toys to put on it for it looks so small and mean with only three or four things  it wont hold any more so i wouldnt worry about it the toys are very red and yellow and i guess the babies wont know how cheap they are but like them as much as if they cost heaps of money  this was a cheery voice and as it spoke the four blue eyes turned toward the chest under the window and the kind moon did her best to light up the tiny tree standing there a very pitiful little tree it wasonly a branch of hemlock in an old flowerpot propped up with bits of coal and hung with a few penny toys earned by the patient fingers of the elder sisters that the little ones should not be disappointed  but in spite of the magical moonlight the broken branch with its scanty supply of fruit looked pathetically poor and one pair of eyes filled slowly with tears while the other pair lost their happy look as if a cloud had come over the sunshine  are you crying dolly  not much polly  what makes you dear  i didnt know how poor we were till i saw the tree and then i couldnt help it sobbed the elder sister for at twelve she already knew something of the cares of poverty and missed the happiness that seemed to vanish out of all their lives when father died  its dreadful i never thought wed have to earn our tree and only be able to get a broken branch after all with nothing on it but three sticks of candy two squeaking dogs a red cow and an ugly bird with one feather in its tail and overcome by a sudden sense of destitution polly sobbed even more despairingly than dolly  hush dear we must cry softly or mother will hear and come up and then we shall have to tell you know we said we wouldnt seem to mind not having any christmas she felt so sorry about it  i must cry but ill be quiet  so the two heads went under the pillow for a few minutes and not a sound betrayed them as the little sisters cried softly in one anothers arms lest mother should discover that they were no longer careless children but brave young creatures trying to bear their share of the burden cheerfully  when the shower was over the faces came out shining like roses after rain and the voices went on again as before  dont you wish there really was a santa claus who knew what we wanted and would come and put two silver halfdollars in our stockings so we could go and see puss in boots at the museum tomorrow afternoon  yes indeed but we didnt hang up any stockings you know because mother had nothing to put in them it does seem as if rich people might think of poor people now and then such little bits of things would make us happy and it couldnt be much trouble to take two small girls to the play and give them candy now and then  i shall when im rich like mr chrome and miss kent i shall go round every christmas with a big basket of goodies and give all the poor children some  praps if we sew ever so many flannel shirts we may be rich byandby i should give mother a new bonnet first of all for i heard miss kent say no lady would wear such a shabby one mrs smith said fine bonnets didnt make real ladies i like her best but i do want a locket like miss kents  i should give mother some new rubbers and then i should buy a white apron with frills like miss kents and bring home nice bunches of grapes and good things to eat as mr chrome does i often smell them but he never gives me any he only says hullo chick and id rather have oranges any time  it will take us a long while to get rich im afraid it makes me tired to think of it i guess wed better go to sleep now dear  goodnight dolly  goodnight polly  two soft kisses were heard a nestling sound followed and presently the little sisters lay fast asleep cheek against cheek on the pillow wet with their tears never dreaming what was going to happen to them tomorrow  now miss kents room was next to theirs and as she sat sewing she could hear the childrens talk for they soon forgot to whisper at first she smiled then she looked sober and when the prattle ceased she said to herself as she glanced about her pleasant chamber  poor little things they think im rich and envy me when im only a milliner earning my living i ought to have taken more notice of them for their mother has a hard time i fancy but never complains im sorry they heard what i said and if i knew how to do it without offending her id trim a nice bonnet for a christmas gift for she is a lady in spite of her old clothes i can give the children some of the things they want anyhow and i will the idea of those mites making a fortune out of shirts at six cents apiece  miss kent laughed at the innocent delusion but sympathized with her little neighbors for she knew all about hard times she had good wages now but spent them on herself and liked to be fine rather than neat still she was a goodhearted girl and what she had overheard set her to thinking soberly then to acting kindly as we shall see  if i hadnt spent all my money on my dress for the party tomorrow night id give each of them a halfdollar as i can not ill hunt up the other things they wanted for its a shame they shouldnt have a bit of christmas when they tried so hard to please the little ones  as she spoke she stirred about her room and soon had a white apron an old carnelian heart on a fresh blue ribbon and two papers of bonbons ready as no stockings were hung up she laid a clean towel on the floor before the door and spread forth the small gifts to look their best  miss kent was so busy that she did not hear a step come quietly up stairs and mr chrome the artist peeped at her through the balusters wondering what she was about he soon saw and watched her with pleasure thinking that she never looked prettier than now  presently she caught him at it and hastened to explain telling what she had heard and how she was trying to atone for her past neglect of these young neighbors then she said goodnight and both went into their rooms she to sleep happily and he to smoke as usual  but his eye kept turning to some of the nice little bundles that lay on his table as if the story he had heard suggested how he might follow miss kents example i rather think he would not have disturbed himself if he had not heard the story told in such a soft voice with a pair of bright eyes full of pity looking into his for little girls were not particularly interesting to him and he was usually too tired to notice the industrious creatures toiling up and down stairs on various errands or sewing at the long red seams  now that he knew something of their small troubles he felt as if it would please miss kent and be a good joke to do his share of the pretty work she had begun  so presently he jumped up and opening his parcels took out two oranges and two bunches of grapes then he looked up two silver halfdollars and stealing into the hall laid the fruit upon the towel and the money atop of the oranges this addition improved the display very much and mr chrome was stealing back well pleased when his eye fell on miss kents door and he said to himself she too shall have a little surprise for she is a dear kindhearted soul  in his room was a prettily painted plate and this he filled with green and purple grapes tucked a sentimental note underneath and leaving it on her threshold crept away as stealthily as a burglar  the house was very quiet when mrs smith the landlady came up to turn off the gas well upon my word heres fine doings to be sure she said when she saw the state of the upper hall now i wouldnt have thought it of miss kent she is such a giddy girl nor of mr chrome he is so busy with his own affairs i meant to give those children each a cake tomorrow they are such good little things ill run down and get them now as my contribution to this fine set out  away trotted mrs smith to her pantry and picked out a couple of tempting cakes shaped like hearts and full of plums there was a goodly array of pies on the shelves and she took two of them saying as she climbed the stairs again they remembered the children so ill remember them and have my share of the fun  so up went the pies for mrs smith had not much to give and her spirit was generous though her pastry was not of the best it looked very droll to see pies sitting about on the thresholds of closed doors but the cakes were quite elegant and filled up the corners of the towel handsomely for the apron lay in the middle with the oranges right and left like two sentinels in yellow uniforms  it was very late when the flicker of a candle came up stairs and a pale lady with a sweet sad face appeared bringing a pair of red and a pair of blue mittens for her dolly and polly poor mrs blake did have a hard time for she stood all day in a great store that she might earn bread for the poor children who staid at home and took care of one another her heart was very heavy that night because it was the first christmas she had ever known without gifts and festivity of some sort but petkin the youngest child had been ill times were very hard the little mouths gaped for food like the bills of hungry birds and there was no tender mate to help fill them  if any elves had been hovering about the dingy hall just then they would have seen the mothers tired face brighten beautifully when she discovered the gifts and found that her little girls had been so kindly remembered something more brilliant than the mock diamonds in miss kents best earrings fell and glittered on the dusty floor as mrs blake added the mittens to the other things and went to her lonely room again smiling as she thought how she could thank them all in a sweet and simple way  her windows were full of flowers for the delicate tastes of the poor lady found great comfort in their beauty i have nothing else to give and these will show how grateful i am she said as she rejoiced that the scarlet geraniums were so full of gay clusters the white chrysanthemum stars were all out and the pink roses at their loveliest  they slept now dreaming of a sunny morrow as they sat safely sheltered from the bitter cold but that night was their last for a gentle hand cut them all and soon three pretty nosegays stood in a glass waiting for dawn to be laid at three doors with a few grateful words which would surprise and delight the receivers for flowers were rare in those hardworking lives and kind deeds often come back to the givers in fairer shapes than they go  now one would think that there had been gifts enough and no more could possibly arrive since all had added his or her mite except betsey the maid who was off on a holiday and the babies fast asleep in their trundlebed with nothing to give but love and kisses nobody dreamed that the old cat would take it into her head that her kittens were in danger because mrs smith had said she thought they were nearly old enough to be given away but she must have understood for when all was dark and still the anxious mother went patting up stairs to the childrens door meaning to hide her babies under their bed sure they would save them from destruction mrs blake had shut the door however so poor puss was disappointed but finding a soft clean spot among a variety of curious articles she laid her kits there and kept them warm all night with her head pillowed on the blue mittens  in the cold morning dolly and polly got up and scrambled into their clothes not with joyful haste to see what their stockings held for they had none but because they had the little ones to dress while mother got the breakfast  dolly opened the door and started back with a cry of astonishment at the lovely spectacle before her the other people had taken in their gifts so nothing destroyed the magnificent effect of the treasures so curiously collected in the night puss had left her kits asleep and gone down to get her own breakfast and there in the middle of the ruffled apron as if in a dainty cradle lay the two maltese darlings with white bibs and boots on and white tips to the tiny tails curled round their little noses in the sweetest way  polly and dolly could only clasp their hands and look in rapturous silence for a minute then they went down on their knees and revelled in the unexpected richness before them  i do believe there is a santa claus and that he heard us for here is everything we wanted said dolly holding the carnelian heart in one hand and the plummy one in the other  it must have been some kind of a fairy for we didnt mention kittens but we wanted one and here are two darlings cried polly almost purring with delight as the downy bunches unrolled and gaped till their bits of pink tongues were visible  mrs smith was one fairy i guess and miss kent was another for that is her apron i shouldnt wonder if mr chrome gave us the oranges and the money men always have lots and his name is on this bit of paper said dolly  oh im so glad now we shall have a christmas like other people and ill never say again that rich folks dont remember poor folks come and show all our treasures to mother and the babies they must have some answered polly feeling that the world was all right and life not half as hard as she thought it last night  shrieks of delight greeted the sisters and all that morning there was joy and feasting in mrs blakes room and in the afternoon dolly and polly went to the museum and actually saw puss in boots for their mother insisted on their going having discovered how the hardearned quarters had been spent this was such unhopedfor bliss that they could hardly believe it and kept smiling at one another so brightly that people wondered who the happy little girls in shabby cloaks could be who clapped their new mittens so heartily and laughed till it was better than music to hear them  this was a very remarkable christmasday and they long remembered it for while they were absorbed in the fortunes of the marquis of carabas and the funny cat who tucked his tail in his belt washed his face so awkwardly and didnt know how to purr strange things were happening at home and more surprises were in store for our little friends you see when people once begin to do kindnesses it is so easy and pleasant they find it hard to leave off and sometimes it beautifies them so that they find they love one another very muchas mr chrome and miss kent did though we have nothing to do with that except to tell how they made the poor little tree grow and blossom  they were very jolly at dinner and talked a good deal about the blakes who ate in their own rooms miss kent told what the children said and it touched the soft spot in all their hearts to hear about the red shirts though they laughed at pollys lament over the bird with only one feather in its tail  id give them a better tree if i had any place to put it and knew how to trim it up said mr chrome with a sudden burst of generosity which so pleased miss kent that her eyes shone like christmas candles  put it in the back parlor all the browns are away for a week and well help you trim itwont we my dear cried mrs smith warmly for she saw that he was in a sociable mood and thought it a pity that the blakes should not profit by it  yes indeed i should like it of all things and it neednt cost much for i have some skill in trimmings as you know and miss kent looked so gay and pretty as she spoke that mr chrome made up his mind that millinery must be a delightful occupation  come on then ladies and well have a little frolic im a lonely old bachelor with nowhere to go today and id like some fun  they had it i assure you for they all fell to work as busy as bees flying and buzzing about with much laughter as they worked their pleasant miracle mr chrome acted more like the father of a large family than a crusty bachelor miss kents skillful fingers flew as they never did before and mrs smith trotted up and down as briskly as if she were sixteen instead of being a stout old woman of sixty  the children were so full of the play and telling all about it that they forgot their tree till after supper but when they went to look for it they found it gone and in its place a great paper hand with one finger pointing down stairs and on it these mysterious words in red ink  look in the browns back parlor  at the door of that interesting apartment they found their mother with will and petkin for another hand had suddenly appeared to them pointing up the door flew open quite as if it were a fairy play and they went in to find a pretty tree planted in a red box on the centre table lighted with candles hung with gilded nuts red apples gay bonbons and a gift for each  mr chrome was hidden behind one foldingdoor and fat mrs smith squeezed behind the other and they both thought it a great improvement upon the oldfashioned santa claus to have miss kent in the white dress she made for the party with mrs blakes roses in her hair step forward as the children gazed in silent rapture and with a few sweet words welcome them to the little surprise their friends had made  there were many christmas trees in the city that night but none which gave such hearty pleasure as the one which so magically took the place of the broken branch and its few poor toys they were all there however and dolly and polly were immensely pleased to see that of all her gifts petkin chose the forlorn bird to carry to bed with her the one yellow feather being just to her taste  mrs blake put on her neat bonnet and was so gratified that miss kent thought it the most successful one she ever trimmed she was well paid for it by the thanks of one neighbor and the admiration of another for when she went to her party mr chrome went with her and said something on the way which made her heart dance more lightly than her feet that night  good mrs smith felt that her house had covered itself with glory by this event and dolly and polly declared that it was the most perfect and delightful surprise party ever seen  it was all over by nine oclock and with goodnight kisses for every one the little girls climbed up to bed laden with treasures and too happy for many words but as they tied their round caps dolly said thoughtfully  on the whole i think its rather nice to be poor when people are kind to you  well id rather be rich but if i cant be it is very good fun to have christmas trees like this one answered truthful polly never guessing that they had planted the seed from which the little pinetree grew so quickly and beautifully  when the moon came to look in at the window on her nightly round two smiling faces lay on the pillow which was no longer wet with tears but rather knobby with the mine of riches hidden underneathfirst fruits of the neighborly friendship which flourished in that house until another and a merrier christmas came     iii  the dolls journey from minnesota to maine   mr plum lived in st paul minnesota usa  there were six little plums all girls varying in ages from fourteen to seven and named kate lucy susy lizzy marjory and maggie there was no mamma but mrs gibbs the housekeeper was a kind old soul and papa did everything he could to make the small daughters good and happy  one stormy saturday afternoon the children were all together in the schoolroom and papa busy at his desk in the library with the door open because he liked to hear the pleasant voices and catch glimpses of the droll plays that went on there  kate lay on the sofa reading the daisy chain for the fourth time susy lucy and lizzie were having a select tea party in their own recess the entrance to which was barricaded with chairs to keep out the babies as they called the little ones who were much offended at being excluded and sat up in the cushioned windowseat pensively watching the rain  if it had only waited till tomorrow we should have had time for our journey now we cant go till next saturday flora is so disappointed she would cry if i had not taught her to behave said maggie with a sigh as she surveyed the doll on her knee in its new summer suit  so is dora just see how sweet she looks with her hat and cape on and her travellingbag all ready couldnt we play travel in the house it is such a pity to wait when the children are in such a hurry to go answered marjory settling the tiny bag that held doras nightcap and gown as well as the morsels of cake that were to serve for her lunch  no said maggie decidedly we cant do it because there is no room for carriages and boats and railroads and hotels and accidents it is a long journey from minnesota to maine and we couldnt get it all into one room im sure  i dont think papa would mind our coming into the library if we didnt ring the car bells very loud or scream much when the accidents happen said marjory who hated to give up the plan they had been cherishing all the week  what is it little ones come and tell me what is the matter called mr plum hearing his name and the magic word railroad for he was the president of one and had his hands full just then  down jumped the little girls and ran to perch on either arm of his chair pouring out their small tribulations as freely as if he had been the most sympathizing of mothers  we planned to take a long long journey round the garden with our dolls today and play go to maine and see aunt maria you know she asked us and we looked out the way on the map and got all ready and now it rains and we are dreadfully disappointed said maggie while marjory sighed as she looked at the red d worked on the inch square travellingbag  as you cant go why not send the dolls to make aunty a visit and she will send them back when they get homesick proposed mr plum smiling as if a sudden idea had popped into his head  really cried maggie  how could we asked marjory  they could go and come by mail and tell you all about their adventures when they got back said papa  both children were speechless for a moment then as the full splendor of this proposition dawned upon them they clapped their hands crying eagerly  we will we will lets do it at once  what where who asked susy lucy and lizzie forgetting their tea party to run and see what was going on  they were told and in their turn exclaimed so loudly that kate came to join in the fun  after a great deal of talking and laughing the dolls were prepared for the long journey they were common woodenheaded dollies a hand long with stuffed bodies and stout legs ornamented with very small feet in red and blue boots dora was a blonde and flora a brunette otherwise they were just alike and nearly new usually when people go travelling they put on their hats and cloaks but these pilgrims by papas advice left all encumbrances behind them for they were to travel in a peculiar way and blue gingham dresses were chosen for the expedition  it is possible that they may never come back accidents will happen you know are you prepared for that asked mr plum pausing with the brown paper spread out before him  i am answered maggie firmly as she laid flora on the table her black eyes staring as if rather alarmed at this sudden start  marjory hesitated a moment clasping dora to her bosom with a face full of maternal anxiety but susy lucy and lizzie cried let her go do let her go and if she is lost papa will give you a new doll  goodby my darling dear have a splendid time and be sure you come back to me whispered marjory with a tender farewell kiss as she gave up her child  all stood watching silently while papa tied the dolls back to back with the ribbon kate pulled from her neck then folded them carefully in strong brown paper leaving their heads out that they might see the world as they went along being carefully fastened up with several turns of cord mr plum directed the precious parcel to miss maria plum portland maine with care then it was weighed stamped and pronounced ready for the post  i shall write and tell aunty they are coming because she will want to be prepared for such distinguished visitors said papa taking up his pen with a glance at the six excited little faces round him  silence reigned while the letter was written and as he sealed it up mr plum said solemnly with his hand on the parcel  for the last time shall they go  yes answered the spartan mothers with one voice while the other sisters danced round them and kate patted the curly heads approvingly  going going gone answered papa as he whisked on his coat and hat and slammed the door behind him  the children clustered at the window to see him set out on this momentous errand and he often looked back waving his umbrella at them till he vanished round the corner with a reassuring pat on the pocket out of which dear do and flo popped their heads for a last look at their sweet home  now let us take out poor old lucinda and rose augusta to play with i know their feelings were hurt at our leaving them for the new dolls said maggie rummaging in the babyhouse whither margery soon followed her to reinstate the old darlings in the place of the departed new ones  safely off reported mr plum when he came into tea and we may expect to hear from them in a week or two parcels go more slowly than letters and this is auntys busy season so wait patiently and see what will happen  we will said the little girls and they did but week after week went by and nothing was heard of the wanderers  we however can follow them and learn much that their anxious mothers never knew  as soon as flora and dora recovered from the bewilderment occasioned by the confusion of the post office they found themselves in one of the many leathern mail bags rumbling eastward as it was perfectly dark they could not see their companions so listened to the whispering and rustling that went on about them the newspapers all talked politics and some of them used such bad language that the dolls would have covered their ears if their hands had not been tied down the letters were better behaved and more interesting for they told one another the news they carried because nothing is private in america and even gummed envelopes cannot keep gossip from leaking out  it is very interesting but i should enjoy it more if i was not grinding my nose against the rough side of this leather bag whispered dora who lay undermost just then  so should i if a heavy book was not pinching my toes ive tried to kick it away but it wont stir and keeps droning on about reports and tariffs and such dull things answered flora with a groan  do you like travelling asked dora presently when the letters and papers fell asleep lulled by the motion of the cars  not yet but i shall when i can look about me this bundle near by says the mails are often sorted in the cars and in that way we shall see something of the world i hope answered flora cheering up for like her mamma she was of an enquiring turn  the dolls took a nap of some hours and were roused by a general tumbling out on a long shelf where many other parcels lay and lively men sent letters and papers flying here and there as if a whirlwind was blowing a long box lay beside the dolls who stood nearly erect leaning against a pile of papers several holes were cut in the lid and out of one of them was thrust a little black nose as if trying to get air  dear me what can be in it said flora who was nearest  im a poor little alligator going to a boy in chicago if you please and i want my mother sobbed a voice from the box and there was a rap on the lid as of an agitated tail  mercy on us i hope we shall not have to travel with the monster whispered dora trying to see over her shoulder  im not afraid he cant be very dreadful for the box is not any longer than we are natural history is very useful ive heard mamma say so and i shall talk with him while we rest here answered flo nodding toward the eye which now took the place of the nose  so the little alligator told her something of his home on the banks of a great river where he was just learning to play happily with his brothers and sisters when he was caught and sent away to pine in captivity  the dolls comforted him as well as they could and a pair of babys shoes travelling in an envelope sympathized with him while a shabby bundle directed to michael dolan at mrs judy quins next door to mr pat murphy boston north street told them to whisht and slape quite till they came forninst the place  such low people whispered do to flo and both stood primly silent till they were tumbled into another mail bag and went rattling on again with a new set of companions  i hope that poor baby will go safely and the boy be good to him said flora for the little alligator went with the live stock in some other way  thank goodness he didnt go with us i shall dream about that black nose and winking eye im sure the dangers of travelling are great but we are safe and comfortable now i think and dora settled down in a cozy corner of the bag wondering when they should reach chicago  i like adventures and hope we shall have some answered flora briskly little dreaming how soon her wish was to be granted  a few hours later there come a bump a crash a cry and then all the mail bags rolled one over the other with the car down an embankment into a river  now we are dead shrieked the poor dolls clinging together as they heard the splash of water the shouting of men the splintering of wood and the hiss of steam  dont be frightened ladies mail bags are always looked after said a large envelope with an official seal and the name of a senator on it  any bones broken dear madam asked a jaunty pink letter with a scent of musk about it evidently a loveletter  i think one foot is hurt and my clothes are dripping sighed dora faintly  water wont hurt calico called out a magazine full of fashion plates adding dolefully as its gay colors began to run i shall be in a nice mess if i ever get out of this people will wear odd fashions if they follow me this time  hope they will telegraph news of this accident in time for the evening papers said a dingy sheet called the barahoo thunderbolt as it lay atop of the heap in its yellow wrapper  be calm my friends and wait with fortitude for death or deliverance as i do with which philosophic remark the st louis cosmos folded the pages which for the first time since the paper was started were not dry  here the water rose over the topmost letter and a moist silence prevailed till a sudden jerk fished up the bag and before the dolls could recover their wits they were spread out on the floor of a mail car to dry while several busy men sorted and saved such papers and letters as still held together  now we shall see something said flora feeling the warm air blow over her as they spun along for a slight accident like this did not delay the energetic westerners a moment longer than absolutely necessary  i cant see you dear but i hope you look better than i do for the yellow of my hair has washed into my eyes and the red of my cheeks is quite gone im sure answered dora as her wet dress flopped in the breeze and the broken foot sticking up showed her that her blue boots were ruined  i dont care a bit how i look its great fun now we are safe pop up your head and see the wide prairie flying past i do hope that poor baby got away and swam home to his mother the upset into the river was quite to his taste i fancy said flora who was much excited by her adventure and eager for more  presently one of the men set the dolls up in the corner of a window to dry and there they stood viewing the fine landscape with one eye while the other watched the scene of devastation within everything was in great confusion after the accident so it is not strange that the dolls were not missed when they slowly slid lower and lower till a sudden lurch of the car sent them out of the window to roll into a green field where cows were feeding and children picking strawberries  this is the end of us here we shall lie and mould forgotten by everybody said dora who always took a tragical view of things  not a bit of it i see cows eating toward us and they may give us a lift ive heard of their tossing people up though i dont know just how its done if they dont we are in the path and some of those children are sure to find us answered flora cheerfully though she stood on her head with a bunch of burrs pricking her nose  she was right a brighteyed little german girl presently came trotting along the path with a great basket full of berries on her head arranged in pretty pottles ready for the market seeing the red cow sniffing at a brown paper parcel she drove her away picked it up and peeped in at the open end  the sight of two dolls in such a place made her feel as if fairies had dropped them there for her she could not read the direction and hurried home to show her treasure to her brothers and sisters of whom there were eight  what will become of us now exclaimed dora as eager hands slipped them out of the wrapper and smoothed their damp skirts in a room that seemed swarming with boys and girls of all sizes  dont worry we shall get on nicely im sure and learn german of these young persons it is a great relief to be able to stretch ones limbs and stand up isnt it answered flora undismayed by anything that had happened as yet  yes dear i love you but i am tired of being tied to you all day i hope we shall live through this noise and get a little rest but i give up the idea of ever seeing portland answered dora staring with all her blue eyes at the display of musical instruments about the room and longing to stop her ears for several of the children were playing on the violin flute horn or harp they were street musicians and even the baby seemed to be getting ready to take part in the concert for he sat on the floor beside an immense bass horn taller than himself with his rosy lips at the mouth piece and his cheeks puffed out in vain attempts to make a boom boom as brother fritz did  flora was delighted and gave skips on her red boots in time to the lively tooting of the boys while the girls gazed at the lovely dolls and jabbered away with their yellow braids quivering with excitement  the wrapper was laid aside till a neighbor who read english came in to translate it meantime they enjoyed the new toys immensely and even despondent dora was cheered up by the admiration she received while they in their turn were deeply interested in the pretty dolls furniture some of the children made  beds tables and chairs covered the long bench and round it sat the neathanded little maidens gluing tacking and trimming while they sang and chatted at their work as busy and happy as a hive of bees  all day the boys went about the streets playing and in the evening trooped off to the beer gardens to play again for they lived in chicago and the dolls had got so far on their way to aunt maria as they soon discovered  for nearly two months they lived happily with minna gretchen and nanerl then they set out on their travels again and this was the way it happened a little girl came to order a set of furniture for her new babyhouse and seeing two shabby dolls reposing in a fine bed she asked about them her mamma spoke german so minna told how they were found and showed the old wrapper saying that they always meant to send the dolls on their way but grew so fond of them they kept putting it off  i am going as far as new york very soon and will take them along if you like for i think little miss maria plum must have been expecting her dolls all this time shall i asked the mamma as she read the address and saw the dash under with care as if the dollies were of great importance to some one  ja ja answered minna glad to oblige a lady who bought two whole sets of their best furniture and paid for it at once  so again the dolls were put in their brown paper cover and sent away with farewell kisses  this now is genteel and just suits me said dora as they drove along with little clara to the handsome house where she was staying  i have a feeling that she is a spoilt child and we shall not be as happy with her as with the dear poppleheimers we shall see answered flora wisely for clara had soon tossed the dolls into a corner and was fretting because mamma would not buy her the big horn to blow on  the party started for new york in a day or two and to the delight of flo and do they were left out of the trunks for clara to play with on the way her own waxen blanche marie annabel being too delicate to be used  oh my patience this is worse than tumbling about in a mailbag groaned dora after hours of great suffering for clara treated the poor dolls as if they had no feeling  she amused herself with knocking their heads together shutting them in the window with their poor legs hanging out swinging them by one arm and drawing lines with a pencil all over their faces till they looked as if tattooed by savages even brave flora was worn out and longed for rest finding her only comfort in saying i told you so when clara banged them about or dropped them on the dusty floor to be trampled on by passing feet  there they were left and would have been swept away if a little dog had not found them as the passengers were leaving the car and carried them after his master trotting soberly along with the bundle in his mouth for fortunately clara had put them into the paper before she left them so they were still together in the trials of the journey  hullo jip what have you got asked the young man as the little dog jumped up on the carriage seat and laid his load on his masters knee panting and wagging his tail as if he had done something to be praised for  dolls i declare what can a bachelor do with the poor things wonder who maria plum is midge will like a look at them before we send them along and into the young mans pocket they went trembling with fear of the dog but very grateful for being rescued from destruction  jip kept his eye on them and gave an occasional poke with his cold nose to be sure they were there as they drove through the bustling streets of new york to a great house with an inscription over the door  i do hope midge will be a nicer girl than clara children ought to be taught to be kind to dumb dolls as well as dumb animals said dora as the young man ran up the steps and hurried along a wide hall  i almost wish we were at home with our own kind little mothers began flo for even her spirits were depressed by bad treatment but just then a door opened and she cried out in amazement bless my heart this man has more children than even mr poppleheimer  she might well think so for all down both sides of the long room stood little white beds with a small pale face on every pillow all the eyes that were open brightened when jip and his master came in and several thin hands were outstretched to meet them  ive been good doctor let me pat him first cried one childish voice  did you bring me a flower please asked another feeble one  i know hes got something nice for us i see a bundle in his pocket and a little fellow who sat up among his pillows gave a joyful cough as he could not shout  two dollies for midge to play with jip found them but i think the little girl they are going to will lend them for a few days we shall not need them longer im afraid added the young man to a rosy faced nurse who came along with a bottle in her hand  dear no the poor child is very low today but she will love to look at the babies if she isnt strong enough to hold em said the woman leading the way to a corner where the palest of all the pale faces lay smiling on the pillow and the thinnest of the thin hands were feebly put up to greet the doctor  so nice she whispered when the dolls were laid beside her while jip proudly beat his tail on the floor to let her know that she owed the welcome gift to him  for an hour flo and do lay on the arm of poor midge who never moved except to touch them now and then with a tender little finger or to kiss them softly saying dear babies it is very nice not to be all alone are you comfy darlings till she fell asleep still smiling  sister do you think this can be the heaven we hear people talk about it is so still and white and may be these children are angels whispered dora looking at the sweet face turned toward her with the long lashes lying on the colorless cheek and the arms outstretched like wings  no dear it is a hospital i heard that man say so and those are sick children come to be cured it is a sweet place i think and this child much nicer than that horrid clara answered flo who was quicker to hear see and understand what went on than dora  i love to lie here safe and warm but there doesnt seem to be much breath to rock me said do who lay nearest the little bosom that very slowly rose and fell with the feeble flutter of the heart below  hush we may disturb her and lively flo controlled her curiosity contenting herself with looking at the other children and listening to their quiet voices for pain seemed to have hushed them all  for a week the dolls lay in midges bed and though their breasts were full of sawdust and their heads were only wood the sweet patience of the little creature seemed to waken something like a heart in them and set them thinking for dolls dont live in vain i am firmly persuaded  all day she tended them till the small hands could no longer hold them and through the weary nights she tried to murmur bits of lullabies lest the dollies would not be able to sleep because of the crying or the moans some of the poor babies could not repress she often sent one or the other to cheer up some little neighbor and in this way do and flo became small sisters of charity welcomed eagerly reluctantly returned and loved by all although they never uttered a word and their dingy faces could not express the emotion that stirred their sawdust bosoms  when saturday night came they were laid in their usual place on midges arm she was too weak to kiss them now and nurse laid their battered cheeks against the lips that whispered faintly be sure you send em to the little girl and tell hertell herall about it then she turned her cheek to the pillow with a little sigh and lay so still the dolls thought she had gone to sleep  she had but the sweet eyes did not open in the morning and there was no breath in the little breast to rock the dolls any more  i knew she was an angel and now she has flown away said dora softly as they watched the white image carried out in the weeping nurses arms with the early sunshine turning all the pretty hair to gold  i think that is what they call dying sister it is a much lovelier way to end than as we do in the dust bin or ragbag i wonder if there is a little heaven anywhere for good dolls answered flora with what looked like a tear on her cheek but it was only a drop from the violets sent by the kind doctor last night  i hope so for i think the souls of little children might miss us if they loved us as dear midge did whispered dora trying to kiss the blue flower in her hand for the child had shared her last gift with these friends  why didnt you let her take them along poor motherless baby asked the doctor when he saw the dolls lying as she had left them  i promised her they should go to the girl they were sent to and please id like to keep my word to the little darling answered nurse with a sob  you shall said the doctor and put them in his breast pocket with the faded violets for everybody loved the pauper child sent to die in a hospital because christian charity makes every man and woman father and mother to these little ones  all day the dolls went about in the busy doctors pocket and i think the violets did them good for the soft perfume clung to them long afterward like the memory of a lovely life as short and sweet as that of the flowers  in the evening they were folded up in a fresh paper and redirected carefully the doctor wrote a little note telling why he had kept them and was just about to put on some stamps when a friend came in who was going to boston in the morning  anything to take along fred asked the newcomer  this parcel if you will i have a feeling that id rather not have it knock about in a mailbag and the doctor told him why  it was pleasant to see how carefully the traveller put away the parcel after that and to hear him say that he was going through boston to the mountains for his holiday and would deliver it in portland to miss plum herself  now there is some chance of our getting there said flora as they set off next day in a new russia leather bag  on the way they overheard a long chat between some new york and boston ladies which impressed them very much flora liked to hear the fashionable gossip about clothes and people and art and theatres but dora preferred the learned conversation of the young boston ladies who seemed to know a little of everything or think they did  i hope mamma will give me an entirely new wardrobe when i get home and we will have dolls weddings and balls and a play and be as fine and fashionable as those ladies down there said flora after listening a while  you have got your head full of dressy ideas and high life sister i dont care for such things but mean to cultivate my mind as fast as i can that girl says she is in college and named over more studies than i can count i do wish we were to stop and see a little of the refined society of boston answered dora primly  pooh said flo dont you try to be intellectual for you are only a woodenheaded doll i mean to be a real westerner and just enjoy myself as i please without caring what other folks do or think boston is no better than the rest of the world i guess  groans from every article in the bag greeted this disrespectful speech and an avalanche of boston papers fell upon the audacious doll but flo was undaunted and shouted from underneath the pile i dont care minnesota forever till her breath gave out  dora was so mortified that she never said a word till they were let out in a room at the parker house here she admired everything and read all the evening in a volume of emersons poems from the bag for mr mt vernon beacon was a boston man and never went anywhere without a wise book or two in his pocket  flo turned up her nose at all she saw and devoted herself to a long chat with the smart bag which came from new york and was full of gossip  the next afternoon they really got to portland and as soon as mr beacon had made his toilet he set out to find little miss plum when the parlor door opened to admit her he was much embarrassed for advancing with a paternal smile and the dolls extended to the expected child he found himself face to face with a pretty young lady who looked as if she thought him a little mad  a few words explained the errand however and when she read the note aunt marias bright eyes were full of tears as she said hugging the dilapidated dolls  ill write the story of their travels and send the dear old things back to the children as soon as possible  and so she did with mr beacons help for he decided to try the air of portland and spent his vacation there the dolls were repainted and redressed till they were more beautiful than ever and their clothes fine enough to suit even flo  they were a good while doing this and when all was ready aunt maria took it into her head to run out to st paul and surprise the children by a singular coincidence mr beacon had railroad business in that direction so they set off together with two splendid dolls done up in a gay box  all that was ever known about that journey was that these travellers stopped at the hospital in new york and went on better friends than before after hearing from the good doctor all the pathetic story of little midge  the young plums had long ago given up the hope of ever seeing do and flo again for they started in june and it was early in september when aunt maria appeared before them without the least warning accompanied by a pleasant gentleman from boston  six kisses had hardly resounded from auntys blooming cheeks when a most attractive box was produced from the russia leather bag and the wandering dolls restored to the arms of their enraptured mammas  a small volume neatly written and adorned with a few pictures of the most exciting incidents of the trip also appeared  every one writes or prints a book in boston you know so we did both said aunt maria laughing as she handed over the remarkable history which she had composed and mr beacon illustrated  it was read with intense interest and was as true as most stories are nowadays  nothing more delightful can happen now exclaimed the children as they laid by the precious work and enthroned the travelled dolls in the place of honor on the roof of the babyhouse  but something much more delightful did happen for at thanksgiving time there was a wedding at the plums not a dolls wedding as flo had planned but a real one for the gentleman from boston actually married aunt maria  there were six bridesmaids all in blue and flora and dora in the loveliest of new pink gowns were set aloft among the roses on the weddingcake their proper place as everyone said for there never would have been any marriage at all but for this dolls journey from minnesota to maine     vi  morningglories   whats thatand daisy sat up in her little bed to listen for she had never heard a sound like it before  it was very early and the house was still the sun was just rising and the morningglories at the window were turning their blue and purple cups to catch the welcome light the sky was full of rosy clouds dew shone like diamonds on the waving grass and the birds were singing as they only sing at dawn but softer sweeter than any birdvoice was the delicate music which daisy heard so airy and gay was the sound it seemed impossible to lie still with that fairy dancingtune echoing through the room out of bed scrambled daisy her sleepy eyes opening wider and wider with surprise and pleasure as she listened and wondered  where is it she said popping her head out of the window the morningglories only danced lightly on their stems the robins chirped shrilly in the garden below and the wind gave daisy a kiss but none of them answered her and still the lovely music sounded close beside her  its a new kind of bird perhaps or maybe its a fairy hidden somewhere oh if it is how splendid it will be cried daisy and she began to look carefully in all the colored cups under the leaves of the woodbine and in the wrens nest close by there was neither fairy nor bird to be seen and daisy stood wondering when a voice cried out from below  why little nightcap what brings you out of your bed so early  o aunt wee do you hear itthat pretty music playing somewhere near i cant find it but i think its a fairy dont you said daisy looking down at the young lady standing in the garden with her hands full of roses  aunt wee listened smiled and shook her head  dont you remember you said last night that you thought the world a very stupid grownup place because there were no giants and fairies in it now well perhaps there are fairies and they are going to show themselves to you if you watch well  daisy clapped her hands and danced about on her little bare feet for of all things in the world she most wanted to see a fairy  what must i do to find them aunt wee she cried popping out her head again with her cap half off and her curly hair blowing in the wind  why you see they frolic all night and go to sleep at dawn so we must get up very early if we want to catch the elves awake they are such delicate flyaway little things and we are so big and clumsy we shall have to look carefully and perhaps hunt a long time before we find even one replied aunt wee very gravely  mamma says im quick at finding things and you know all about fairies so i guess well catch one cant we begin now its very early and this music has waked me up so i dont want to sleep any more will you begin to hunt now  but you dont like to get up early or to walk in the fields and if we mean to catch a fairy we must be up and out by sunrise every fair morning till we get one can you do this lazy daisy and aunt wee smiled to herself as if something pleased her very much  oh i will truly get up and not fret a bit if youll only help me look please come now to dress me and see if you can find what makes the music  daisy was very much in earnest and in such a hurry to be off that she could hardly stand still to have her hair brushed and thought there were a great many unnecessary buttons and strings on her clothes that day usually she lay late got up slowly and fretted at every thing as little girls are apt to do when they have had too much sleep she wasnt a rosy stout daisy but had been ill and had fallen into a way of thinking she couldnt do anything but lie about reading fairytales and being petted by every one mamma and papa had tried all sorts of things to amuse and do her good for she was their only little daughter and they loved her very dearly but nothing pleased her long and she lounged about pale and fretful till aunt laura came daisy called her wee when she was a baby and couldnt talk plainly and she still used the name because it suited the cheery little aunt so well  i dont see anything and the music has stopped i think some elf just came to wake you up and then flew away so we wont waste any more time in looking here said wee as she finished dressing daisy who flew about like a willothewisp all the while  do you think it will come again tomorrow asked daisy anxiously  i dare say youll hear it if you wake in time now get your hat and we will see what we can find down by the brook i saw a great many fireflies there last night and fancy there was a ball so we may find some drowsy elf among the buttercups and clover  away rushed daisy for her hat and soon was walking gayly down the green lane looking about her as if she had never been there before for every thing seemed wonderfully fresh and lovely  how pink the clouds are and how the dew twinkles in the grass i never saw it so before she said  because by the time you are up the pretty pink clouds are gone and the thirsty grass has drank the dew or the sun has drawn it up to fall again at night for the flowers evening bath replied wee watching the soft color that began to touch daisys pale cheeks  i think wed better look under that cobweb spread like a tent over the white clovers a fairy would be very likely to creep in there and sleep  daisy knelt down and peeped carefully but all she saw was a little brown spider who looked very much surprised to see visitors so early  i dont like spiders said daisy much disappointed  there are things about spiders as interesting to hear as fairy tales said wee this is mrs epeira diadema and she is a respectable industrious little neighbor she spreads her tent but sits under a leaf near by waiting for her breakfast she wraps her eggs in a soft silken bag and hides them in some safe chink where they lie till spring the eggs are prettily carved and ornamented and so hard that the baby spiders have to force their way out by biting the shell open and poking their little heads through the mother dies as soon as her eggs are safely placed and the spiderlings have to take care of themselves  how do you know about it aunt wee you talk as if mrs eppyraor whatever her name ishad told you herself did she asked daisy feeling more interested in the brown spider  no i read it in a book and saw pictures of the eggs web and family i had a live one in a bottle and she spun silken ladders all up and down and a little room to sleep in she ate worms and bugs and was very amiable and interesting till she fell ill and died  i should like to see the book and have a spiderbottle so i could take care of the poor little orphans when they are born goodby maam i shall call again for you are most as good as a fairy there in your pretty tent with a white clover for your bed  daisy walked on a few steps and then stopped to say  what does that bird mean by calling hurry up hurry up he keeps flying before us and looking back as if he wanted to show me something  let me hear what he says i may be able to understand him or the bobolink that swings on the alder by the brook  wee listened a moment while the birds twittered and chirped with all their hearts presently wee sang in a tone very like the bobolinks          daisy and wee         come here and see     what a dainty feast is spread         down in the grass         where fairies pass     here are berries ripe and red          all wet with dew         they wait for you     come hither and eat your fill         while i gayly sing         in my airy swing     and the sun climbs up the hill  did he really say that cried daisy watching the bobolink who sat swaying up and down on the green bough and nodding his whitecapped head at her in the most friendly manner  perhaps i didnt translate it rightly for it is very hard to put birdnotes into our language because we havent words soft and sweet enough but i really think there are berries over there and we will see if what he says is true said wee  over the wall they went and there on a sunny bank found a bed of the reddest ripest berries ever seen  thank you thank you for telling me to hurry up and showing me such a splendid feast said daisy with her mouth full as she nodded back at the birds these are so much sweeter than those we buy id carry some home to mamma if i only had a basket  you can pick this great leaf full while i make you a basket said wee  daisy soon filled the leaf and then sat watching her aunt plait a pretty basket of rushes while she waited she looked about and kept finding something curious or pleasant to interest and amuse her first she saw a tiny rainbow in a dewdrop that hung on a blade of grass then she watched a frisky calf come down to drink on the other side of the brook and laughed to see him scamper away with his tail in the air close by grew a pitcherplant and a yellow butterfly sat on the edge bathing its feet daisy said presently she discovered a little ground bird sitting on her nest and peeping anxiously as if undecided whether to fly away or trust her  i wont hurt you little mother dont be afraid whispered the child and as if it understood the bird settled down on her nest with a comfortable chirp while its mate hopped up to give her a nice plump worm for breakfast  i love birds tell me something about them aunt wee you must know many things for they like you and come when you call  once upon a time began wee while her fingers flew and the pretty basket grew there was a great snowstorm and all the country was covered with a thick white quilt it froze a little so one could walk over it and i went out for a run oh so cold it was with a sharp wind and no sun or any thing green to make it pleasant i went far away over the fields and sat down to rest while i sat there a little bird came by and stopped to rest also  how do you do said i  chickadeedee said he  a cold day said i  chickadeedee said he  arent you afraid of starving now the ground is covered and the trees are bare  chickadeedee maam chickadeedee answered the bird in the same cheerful tone and it sounded as if he said i shall be cared for im not afraid  what will you eat theres nothing here or for miles round i really think youll starve birdie said i  then he laughed and gave me a merry look as he lit on a tall dry weed near by he shook it hard with his little bill when down fell a shower of seeds and there was dinner all ready on a snowwhite cloth all the while he ate he kept looking up at me with his quick bright eyes and when he had done he said as plainly as a bird could say it      cold winds may blow         and snows may fall       but well we know         god cares for all  i like that little story and shall always think of it when i hear the chickadeedee daisy sat a moment with a thoughtful look in her eyes then she said slowly as if sorry for the words  it isnt a stupid grownup world its a very pleasant young world and i like it a great deal better this morning than i did last night  im glad of that and even if we dont find our fairy today you will have found some sunshine daisy and that is almost as good now put in the berries and well go on  how they hunted they climbed trees to peep into squirrelholes and birdsnests they chased bees and butterflies to ask for news of the elves they waded in the brook hoping to catch a watersprite they ran after thistledown fancying a fairy might be astride they searched the flowers and ferns questioned sun and wind listened to robin and thrush but no one could tell them any thing of the little people though all had gay and charming bits of news about themselves and daisy thought the world got younger and happier every minute  when they came in to breakfast papa and mamma looked at daisy and then nodded with a smile at aunt wee for though daisys frock was soiled her boots wet and her hair tumbled her cheeks were rosy eyes bright and voice so cheerful that they thought it better music than any in the summer world without  hunting fairies is a pleasant play isnt it daisy said papa as he tasted the berries and admired the green basket  oh yes and we are going again tomorrow aunt wee says we must try seven days at least i like it and mean to keep on till i really find my fairy  i think you will find something better than little vanishers dear said mamma filling up the bowl of bread and milk which daisy was fast emptying for she certainly had found an appetite  there it is again cried daisy flying out of bed the next morning still earlier than the day before yes there it was the fairy music as blithe and sweet as ever and the morningglories rung their delicate bells as if keeping time daisy felt rather sleepy but remembered her promise to aunt wee and splashed into her tub singing the bobolinks song as she bathed  where shall we go today she asked as they went out into the garden  i think wed better try a new place so well go to the farmyard and while we feed the hens ill listen to their chat and perhaps can learn something from it replied wee soberly  do hens know about fairies i thought they were very dull things and didnt care for any thing but eating corn and laying eggs said daisy surprised  oh dear no they are very sensible creatures and see a deal of the world in their daily walks hunting for insects gives them an excellent chance to see fairies if there are any here is some corn for the biddies and after we have fed them we will look for eggs and so may find a brownie or two  such a clatter as there was when they came to the barnyard for every thing was just awake and in the best spirits ducks were paddling off to the pond geese to the meadow and meek gray guineahens tripping away to hunt bugs in the garden a splendid cock stood on the wall and crowed so loud and clear that all the neighboring chanticleers replied the motherly hens clucked and scratched with their busy broods about them or sat and scolded in the coops because the chicks would gad abroad doves cooed on the sunny roof and smoothed their gleaming feathers daisys donkey nibbled a thistle by the wall and a stately peacock marched before the door with all his plumage spread it made daisy laugh to see the airs the fowls put on as she scattered corn and threw meal and water to the chicks some pushed and gobbled some stood meekly outside the crowd and got what they could others seized a mouthful and ran away to eat it in a corner the chicks got into the pan entirely and tumbled one over the other in their hurry to eat but the mammas saw that none went hungry and the polite cock waited upon them in the most gentlemanly manner making queer little clucks and gurgles as if he said  allow me madam to offer you this kernel or here my dear try that bit and sometimes he pecked a little with a loud quaver evidently saying come come children behave yourselves and dont eat like pigs  what is she saying asked daisy pointing to an old gray hen in a black turban who was walking about alone muttering to herself as hens often do in their promenades  she says a cat has made a nest and hatched three kits up on the loft near her own nest and she doesnt like it because their mewing annoys her said wee after listening a minute  how nice lets go and find them but do you learn anything about the fairies from the hens chat  no they have been so busy setting they have had no time for picnics yet but they will let us know if they discover any  in the barn the cows were being milked and daisy had a mugful of it warm and sweet out of the foaming pail  well take some to mrs purr for i dare say she doesnt like to leave the kits long and will enjoy a sip of something comfortable said wee as daisy climbed the ladder and went rustling over the hay to a corner whence came a joyful mew what a charming sight it was to be sure a snowwhite cat lying in a cosy nest and by her three snowwhite kits wagging three very small gray tails  there never was any thing so lovely cried daisy as she sat with the three downy balls in her lap while the mamma gratefully lapped the new milk from aunt wees cup  are they better than fairies  almost for i know about pussies and can cuddle them but i couldnt a fairy you know and they might be afraid of me these dears are not afraid and i shall have such fun with them as they grow up what shall we name them auntie  snowball patpaw and wagtail would do i think said wee stroking the cat who rubbed against her purring very loud  yes i like those names for my pets but what is mrs purr saying with her mouth up to your ear asked daisy who firmly believed that aunt wee knew every thing  she tells me that when she went on a grasshopper hunt the other day as she ran through the meadow she saw some lovely creatures all in blue with gauze wings flying about over the river and sitting in the waterlilies she thinks they may be fairies and advises us to go and look  so we will tomorrow said daisy ask her please if i may take the kits into the house if ill be very careful and give them a nice big bed to sleep in  she says you may but she must go too else the kits will cry said wee after listening to pussys purr a minute  much pleased with her new pets daisy took them in her apron and followed by their confiding mamma marched to the house and established them in the old cradle which used to be hers pussy got in also and when they were settled on a soft cushion daisy rocked them gently to and fro at first mrs purr opened her yellow eyes and looked rather anxious but as nothing uncomfortable happened she composed herself and soon quite liked the motion for she fell asleep and made a pretty picture as she lay with her downy white babies on her downy white breast  when the sun rose next morning he saw daisy and wee floating down the river in their boat bless me heres company said the sun and began at once to make them welcome in his most charming manner he set the waves to sparkling with a sudden shimmer he shot long rays of light through the dark hemlocks till they looked like fairy trees he touched daisys hair and it turned to gold he chased away the shadows that lurked among the hills he drew up the misty curtain that hovered over the river and with the warmth of his kisses waked the sleeping lilies  look look aunt wee how they open one by one as the light shines on them we shant have to wait any longer for they get up with the sun as you do as she spoke daisy caught a halfopen lily and drew it up fragrant and dripping fresh from its sleep  they look like a fleet of fairy ships anchored in this quiet harbor with sails half furled and crews asleep see the little sailors in their yellow jackets lifting up their heads as the wind blows its whistle like a boatswain to pipe all hands  daisy laughed at aunt wees fancy and stirred up the crew of the watersprite as she called her flower till the white sails were all set and it was ready for a summer voyage  it is time we saw the fairies in blue unless old madam purr deceived us i hope we shall find one for though i enjoy every thing we see i do want my elf too  what is that cried wee and daisy flew up so quickly that the boat rocked like a cradle a slender creature in a blue dress with gauzy wings darted by and vanished among the rushes that nodded by the bank  go nearersoftly softlyand maybe it will fly out again i really think it was a fairy for i never saw any thing like it before whispered daisy much excited  wee rowed in among the green rushes and purple waterweeds and out flew halfadozen of the bluebodied creatures they didnt seem afraid but skimmed about the boat as if curious to see what it was and daisy sat and stared with all her might presently one of the lovely things lit on the lily in her hand and she held her breath to watch it a little shadow of disappointment passed over her face as she looked but it was gone at once and her voice was full of delight as she said softly  its not a fairy aunt wee but it is very beautiful with its slender blue body its lacy wings and bright eyes what name does it have  we call it a dragonfly and it could tell you a pretty little story about itself could you understand it in may the tiny eggs are dropped on the water and sink to the bottom where little creatures are bornugly brown things with six legs and no wings they feed on waterinsects and for a long time swim about in this state when ready they climb up the stem of some plant and sit in the sun till the ugly brown shells drop away and the lovely winged creatures appear they grow in an hour to be perfect dragonflies and float away to lead happy lives in the sunshine by the river  as if only waiting till the story was done the dragonfly flew off with a whirr and darted to and fro hunting for its breakfast glittering splendidly as it flashed among the leaves or darted close above the water daisy forgot her disappointment in a minute and went fishing for lilies while the turtles came up to sun themselves on the rocks the merry little tadpoles wiggled in the shallow places and a wild duck paddled by with a brood of ducklings following in her wake  oh dear it rains and we cant go fairyhunting at all said daisy next morning as the patter on the windowpane woke her up and aunt wee came in to dress her  yes we can dear jump up and see what a funny place ill take you to  daisy thought the rain would be a capital excuse for lying in bed for she still liked to cuddle and drowse in her cosey warm nest but she was curious to know where the curious place was so she got up and followed  why aunt wee this is the garret and there isnt any thing nice or funny here she said as they climbed the stairs and came into the big attic filled with all manner of old things  isnt there well soon see and so they did for aunt wee began to play and presently daisy was shouting with fun as she sat on an old saddle with a haircovered trunk for a horse a big oldfashioned bonnet on her head and a red silk petticoat for a habit then they went to sea in a great chest and got wrecked on a desert island where they built a fort with boxes and bags hunted bears with rusty guns and had to eat dried berries herbs and nuts for no other food could be found aunt wee got an old fiddle and had a dancingschool where daisy capered till she was tired so they rummaged out some dusty books and looked at pictures so quietly that a little mouse came out of a drawer and peeped about thinking no one was there  lets find the nest since we dont find any fairy said wee and opening the drawer she turned over the things till she came to a pair of old velvet shoes and there in the toe of one nicely cuddled under a bit of flannel lay four pink mites which woke up and stretched their tiny legs and squeaked such small squeaks one could hardly hear them  how cunning they are i wish they would let me put them with the kits and have a nursery full of babies wouldnt it be nice to see them all grow up said daisy  im afraid they wouldnt grow up if mrs purr lived with them began wee but got no further for just then the cat bounced into the drawer and ate up the mouselings in four mouthfuls daisy screamed the mothermouse gave a doleful squeak and ran into a hole and aunt wee tried to save the little ones but it was too late purr had got her breakfast and sat washing her face after it as if she had enjoyed it  never mind daisy she would have caught them by and by and its as well to have them taken care of before they do any harm there is the bell dont cry but come and tell papa what a fine romp weve had  it doesnt rain but its dreadfully wet so well go to the dairy and see if any sprites are hiding there said wee next day and to the dairy they went  a pleasant place it wasso clean and cool and as full of sweet odors as if the ghosts of buttercups and clover still haunted the milk which they had helped to make dolly was churning and polly was making up butter in nice little pats both were very kind and let daisy peep everywhere all round on white shelves stood the shining pans full of milk the stone floor was wet and a stream of water ran along a narrow bed through the room and in it stood jars of butter pots of cream and cans of milk the window was open and hopvines shook their green bells before it the birds sang outside and maids sang inside as the churn and the wooden spatters kept time      brindle and bess     whitestar and jess       come butter come     eat cowslips fine     red columbine       come butter come     grasses green and tall     clover best of all       come butter come     and give every night     milk sweet and white       come butter come     make the churn go     see the lumps grow       come butter come  daisy sang also and turned the handle till she was tired then she helped polly with the butter and made four little patsone stamped with a star for papa one with a rose for mamma a strawberry for aunt wee and a cow for herself she skimmed a pitcher of cream with a shallow shell and liked the work so much she asked to have a little pan of milk put by for her to take care of every day dolly promised and gave her a small shell and a low shelf all to herself when she went in she carried her pretty pats in one hand the creampot in the other and entered the breakfast room looking as brisk and rosy as a little milkmaid  it was a lovely morning when daisy was next roused by the fairy music and the ponies were standing at the door are we going far she asked as wee put on her ridingskirt and tied back her hair  up to the mountaintop its only a mile and we shall have time if we ride fast answered wee  away they went through the green lane over the bridge and up the steep hillside where the sheep fed and colts frisked as they passed by higher and higher climbed dandy and prance the ponies and gayer and gayer grew daisy and wee as the fresh air blew over them and the morningred glowed on their faces when they reached the top they sat on a tall stone and looked down into the valley on either side  this seems like a place to find giants not fairies it is so high and big and splendid up here said daisy as her eye roamed over river forest town and hill  there are giants here and i brought you up to see them answered wee  mercy me where are they cried daisy looking very curious and rather frightened  there is one of them and wee pointed to the waterfall that went dashing and foaming down into the valley that giant turns the wheels of all the mills you see some of them grind grain for our bread some help to spin cloth for our clothes some make paper and others saw trees into boards that is a beautiful and busy giant daisy  so it is and some day well go and see it work show me the others i like your giants most as well as those in the fairybooks  on this side youll see another called steam he is a very strong fellow for with the help of gunpowder he will break the granite mountain in pieces and carry it away he works in the other mills and takes heavy loads of stone cloth paper and wood all over the country then on the right of us is a third giant called electricity he runs along those wires and carries messages from one end of the world to the other he goes under the sea and through the air he brings news to every one runs day and night yet never tires and often helps sick people with his lively magic  i like him best i think for he is more like a real wonderful giant is there any on that side of us asked daisy turning round to look behind her  yes the best and most powerful of all lives in that big house with the bell on the roof said wee smiling  why thats only the schoolhouse  education is a long word dear but you know what it means and as you grow older you will see what wonders it can work it is a noble giant for in this country rich and poor are helped by it and no one need suffer for it unless they choose it works more wonders than any other it changes little children into wise good men and women who rule the world and make happy homes everywhere it helps write books sing songs paint pictures do good deeds and beautify the world love and respect it my little daisy and be glad that you live now when such giants lend a hand to dwarfs like us  daisy sat still a long time looking all about her on the mountaintop and when she rode away she carried a new thought in her mind which she never forgot  this is the last day of the seven and no fairies have been found do you think i ever shall see one said daisy on the sunday morning that ended her weeks hunt  not the kind you think of for there are none such daisy but you have found two better and more beautiful ones than any fanciful sprites said wee  have i where are they what are their names  aunt wee drew her to the glass and said as she pointed to daisys face  here they are and their names are health and happiness there are many ways of losing them and they are hard to catch when once lost i wanted you to keep both and tried to show you how a happy healthful hour in the morning sweetens and brightens the whole day and there is no fairybook half so wonderful as the lovely world all about us if we only know how to read it  then all these mornings we were hunting after health and happiness instead of fairies were we  yes havent you enjoyed it and dont you think you have caught my fairies  daisy looked from a little picture of herself which wee had drawn some time ago to her image in the glass one was dull and sad pale and cross the other rosy gay and smilingthe likeness of a happy hearty little girl wideawake and in good tune she understood the kind joke and turning kissed aunt wee as she said gratefully  i think i have caught your elves and ill try to keep them all my life but tell me one thing was the music that woke me all a joke too  no dear here it is and now it is your own for you have learned to wake and listen to it  daisy looked and saw aunt wee lean from the window and take out of a hollow nook in the old tree close by a little box she set it on the table touched a spring and the airy music sounded more beautiful than ever  is it mine all mine cried daisy  yes i hid it while i tried my little plan and now you shall have it for your own see here is the best elf i can give you and she will dance whenever you call her  wee pushed a golden pin and up sprang a tiny figure all crimson and gold with shining wings and a garland on its dainty head softly played the hidden music and airily danced the little sylph till the silvery chime died away then folding her delicate arms she sank from sight leaving daisy breathless with delight     v  shadowchildren   ned polly and will sat on the steps one sunshiny morning doing nothing except wish they had something pleasant to do  something new something never heard of beforewouldnt that be jolly said ned with a great yawn  it must be an amusing play and one that we dont get tired of very soon added polly gravely  and something that didnt be wrong else mamma wouldnt like it said little will who was very good for a small boy  as no one could suggest any thing to suit they all sat silent a few minutes suddenly ned said rather crossly i wish my shadow wouldnt mock me every time i stretch or gape it does the same and i dont like it  poor thing it cant help that it has to do just what you do and be your slave all day im glad i aint a shadow said polly  i try to run away from mine sometimes but i cant ever it will come after me and in the night it scares me if it gets big and black said will looking behind him  wouldnt it be fun to see shadows going about alone and doing things like people asked polly  i just wish they would id like to see ours cut capers that would be a jolly new game wouldnt it said ned  no one had time to speak for suddenly the three little shadows on the sunny wall behind them stood up straight and began to bow  mercy me cried polly staring at them  by jove thats odd said ned looking queer  are they alive asked will a little frightened  dont be alarmed they wont hurt you said a soft voice today is midsummerday and whoever wishes a wish can have it till midnight you want to see your shadows by themselves and you can if you promise to follow them as they have followed you so long they will not get you into harm so you may safely try it if you like do you agree for the day to do as they do and so have your wish  yes we promise answered the children  tell no one till night and be faithful shadows to the shadows  the voice was silent but with more funny little bows the shadows began to move off in different directions the children knew their own for neds was the tallest and had its hands in its pockets pollys had a frock on and two bows where its hair was tied up while wills was a plump little shadow in a blouse with a curly head and a pug nose each child went after its shadow laughing and enjoying the fun  neds master went straight to the shed took down a basket and marched away to the garden where it began to move its hands as if busily picking peas ned stopped laughing when he saw that and looked rather ashamed for he remembered that his mother had asked him to do that little job for her and he had answered  oh bother the old peas im busy and i cant  who told you about this he asked beginning to work  the shadow shook its head and pointed first to neds new jacket then to a set of nice garden tools near by and then seemed to blow a kiss from its shadowy fingers towards mamma who was just passing the open gate  oh you mean that she does lots for me so i ought to do what i can for her and love her dearly said ned getting a pleasanter face every minute  the shadow nodded and worked away as busily as the bees tumbling heels over head in the great yellow squash blossoms and getting as dusty as little millers somehow ned rather liked the work with such an odd comrade near by for though the shadow didnt really help a bit it seemed to try and set an excellent example when the basket was full the shadow took one handle and ned the other and they carried it in  thank you dear i was afraid we should have to give up our peas today im so busy i cant stop said mamma looking surprised and pleased  ned couldnt stop to talk for the shadow ran away to the woodpile and began to chop with all its might  well i suppose i must but i never saw such a fellow for work as this shadow is he isnt a bit like me though hes been with me so long said ned swinging the real hatchet in time with the shadowy one  pollys new mistress went to the diningroom and fell to washing up the breakfast cups polly hated that work and sulkily began to rattle the spoons and knock the things about but the shadow wouldnt allow that and polly had to do just what it did though she grumbled all the while  she doesnt splash a bit or make any clatter so i guess shes a tidy creature said polly how long she does rub each spoon and glass we never shall get done what a fuss she makes with the napkins laying them all even in the drawer and now shes at the saltcellars doing them just as mamma likes i wish shed live here and do my work for me why whats that and polly stopped fretting to listen for she seemed to hear the sound of singingso sweet and yet so very faint she could catch no words and only make out a cheerful little tune  do you hear any one singing mamma she asked  no i wish i did and mamma sighed for baby was poorly piles of sewing lay waiting for her biddy was turning things topsyturvy in the kitchen for want of a word from the mistress and polly was looking sullen  the little girl didnt say any more but worked quietly and watched the shadow feeling sure the faint song came from it presently she began to hum the tune she caught by snatches and before she knew it she was singing away like a blackbird baby stopped crying and mamma said smiling  now i hear somebody singing and its the music i like best in the world  that pleased polly but a minute after she stopped smiling for the shadow went and took baby or seemed to and polly really did now baby was heavy and cross with its teeth and polly didnt feel like tending it one bit mamma hurried away to the kitchen and polly walked up and down the room with poor baby hanging over her arm crying dismally with a pin in its back a wet bib under its chin and nothing cold and hard to bite with its hot aching gums where the little teeth were trying to come through  do stop you naughty fretty baby im tired of your screaming and its high time you went to sleep bless me whats miss shadow doing with her baby said polly  miss shadow took out the big pin and laid it away put on a dry bib and gave her baby a nice ivory ring to bite then began to dance up and down the room till the shadowy baby clapped its hands and kicked delightedly polly laughed and did the same feeling sorry she had been so pettish presently both babies grew quiet went to sleep and were laid in the cradle  now i hope we shall rest a little said polly stretching her arms  but no down sat the shadow and began to sew making her needle fly like a real little seamstress  oh dear groaned polly i promised to hem those handkerchiefs for ned and so i must but i do think handkerchiefs are the most pokey things in the world to sew i dare say you think you can sew faster than i can just wait a bit and see what i can do miss she said to the shadow  it took some time to find her thimble and needles and spools for polly wasnt a very neat little girl but she got settled at last and stitched away as if bent on beating her dumb friend  little wills shadow went up to the nursery and stopped before a basin of water oh ah aint this drefful cried will with a shiver for he knew hed got to have his face washed because he wouldnt have it done properly when he got up but ran away now will was a good child but this one thing was his great trouble and sometimes he couldnt bear it jane was so rough she let soap get in his eyes and water run down his neck and she pinched his nose when she wiped him and brushed his hair so hard that really it was dreadful and even a bigger boy would have found it hard to bear he shivered and sighed but jane came in and when he saw that the shadow stood still and took the scrubbing like a little hero he tried to do the same and succeeded so well that jane actually patted his head and called him a deary which was something new for old nurse jane was always very busy and rather cross  feeling that nothing worse could possibly happen to him will ran after his shadow as it flitted away into the barn and began to feed the chickens  there now i forgetted all about my chickeys and the shadow membered em and im glad of it said will scattering dabs of meal and water to the chirping downy little creatures who pecked and fluttered at his feet little shadow hunted for eggs drove the turkeys out of the garden and picked a basket of chips then it went to play with sammy a neighbors child for being a small shadow it hadnt many jobs to do and plenty of active play was good for it  sammy was a rough little boy and rather selfish so when they played ball he wanted to throw all the time and when will objected he grew angry and struck him the blow didnt hurt wills cheek much but it did his little feelings and he lifted his hand to strike back when he saw his shadow go and kiss sammys shadow all his anger was gone in a minute and he just put his arm round sammys neck and kissed him this kiss for a blow made him so ashamed that he began to cry and couldnt be comforted till he had given will his best marble and a ride on his pony  about an hour before dinner the three shadows and the children met in the garden and had a grand game of play after they had told each other what they had been doing since they parted now the shadows didnt forget baby even then but got out the wagon and miss baby all fresh from her nap sat among her pillows like a queen while ned was horse polly footman and will driver and in this way she travelled all round the garden and barn up the lane and down to the brook where she was much delighted with the water sparkling along and the fine splash of the stones they threw in  when the dinnerbell rang mamma saw four clean rosy faces and four smooth heads at the table for the shadowchildren made themselves neat without being told every one was merry and hungry and goodnatured even poor baby forgot her teeth and played a regular rubadub with her spoon on her mug and tried to tell about the fine things she saw on her drive the children said nothing about the new play and no one observed the queer actions of their shadows but themselves they saw that there was no gobbling or stretching over or spilling of things among the shadows but that they waited to be helped served others first and ate tidily which was a great improvement upon the usual state of things  it was saturday afternoon the day was fine and mamma told them they could go for a holiday frolic in the woods dont go to the pond and be home early she said  yes mamma well remember they answered as they scampered away to get ready  we shall go through the village and mary king will be looking out so i shall wear my best hat mamma wont see me if i slip down the back way and i do so want mary to know that my hat is prettier than hers said polly up in her little room  now polly was rather vain and liked to prink so she got out the new hat and spent some time in smoothing her braids and putting on her blue ribbons but when all was ready and the boys getting impatient she found her shadow with a sunbonnet on standing by the door as if to prevent her going out  you tiresome thing do you mean that i mustnt wear my hat but that old bonnet asked polly  the shadow nodded and beckoned and patted its head as if it was all right  i wish i hadnt promised to do as you do then i could do as i like and not make a fright of myself said polly rather sulkily as she put away the hat and tied on the old bonnet with a jerk  once out in the lovely sunshine she soon forgot the little disappointment and as they didnt go through the village but by a green lane where she found some big blackberries she was quite contented polly had a basket to hold fruit or flowers ned his jackknife and will a long stick on which he rode fancying that this sort of horse would help his short legs along so they picked whittled and trotted their way to the wood finding all manner of interesting things on the road  the wood was full of pleasant sights and sounds for wild roses bloomed all along the path ferns and scarlet berries filled the little dells squirrels chattered birds sang and pines whispered musically overhead  im going to stop here and rest and make a wreath of these pretty wild roses for baby its her birthday and it will please mamma said polly sitting down on a mound of moss with a lapful of flowers  im going to cut a fishingpole and will be back in a minute and ned went crashing into the thickest part of the wood  i shall see where that rabbit went to and maybe ill find some berries said will trotting down the path the wild rabbit had gone  the sound of the boys steps died away and polly was wondering how it would seem to live all alone in the wood when a little girl came trudging by with a great pail of berries on her arm she was a poor child her feet were bare her gown was ragged she wore an old shawl over her head and walked as if lame polly sat behind the ferns and the child did not see her till polly called out the sudden sound startled her and she dropped her pail spilling the berries all over the path the little girl began to cry and polly to laugh saying in a scornful tone  how silly to cry for a few berries  ive been all day picking em said the girl and im so tired and hungry cause i didnt dare to go home till my pail was fullmother scolds if i doand now theyre all spoilt oh dear dear me and she cried so hard that great tears fell on the moss  polly was sorry now and sat looking at her till she saw her shadow down on its knees picking up the berries then it seemed to fold its little handkerchief round the girls bruised foot and give her something from its pocket polly jumped up and imitated the kind shadow even to giving the great piece of gingerbread she had brought for fear she should be hungry  take this she said gently im sorry i frightened you here are the berries all picked up and none the worse for falling in the grass if youll take them to the white house on the hill my mamma will buy them and then your mother wont scold you  oh thank you miss its ever so good ill take the berries to your mother and bring her more whenever she likes said the child gratefully as she walked away munching the gingerbread and smiling till there were little rainbows in her tears  meanwhile ned had poked about in the bushes looking for a good pole presently he saw a willow down by the pond and thought that would give him a nice smooth pole he forgot his promise and down he went to the pond where he cut his stick and was whittling the end when he saw a boat by the shore it was untied and oars lay in it as if waiting for some one to come and row out  ill just take a little pull across and get those cardinalflowers for polly he said and went to the boat  he got in and was about to push off when he saw his shadow standing on the shore  dont be a fool get in and come along he said to it remembering his promise now but deciding to break it and ask pardon afterwards  but the shadow shook its head pointed to the swift stream that ran between the banks the rocks and mud on the opposite side and the leaky boat itself  i aint afraid mamma wont mind if i tell her im sorry and it will be such fun to row alone be a good fellow and let me go said ned beckoning  but the shadow would not stir and ned was obliged to mind he did so very reluctantly and scolded the shadow well as he went back to polly though all the time he felt he was doing right and knew he should be glad afterwards  will trotted after the rabbit but didnt find it he found a birdsnest instead with four little birds in it he had an empty cage at home and longed for something to put in it for kittens didnt like it and caterpillars and beetlebugs got away he chose the biggest bird and holding him carefully walked away to find polly the poor motherbird chirped and fluttered in great distress but will kept on till his little shadow came before him and tried to make him turn back  no no i want him said will i wont hurt him and his mother has three left she wont mind if i take one  here the motherbird chirped so loud it was impossible to help seeing that she did care very much and the shadow stamped its foot and waved its hand as if ordering the young robber to carry back the babybird will stood still and thought a minute but his little heart was a very kind one and he soon turned about saying pleasantly  yes it is naughty and i wont do it ill ask mamma to get me a canary and will let this birdie stay with his brothers  the shadow patted him on the shoulder and seemed to be delighted as will put the bird in the nest and walked on feeling much happier than if he had kept it a bush of purple berries grew by the path and will stopped to pick some he didnt know what they were and mamma had often told him never to eat strange things but they smelt so good and looked so nice he couldnt resist and lifted one to his mouth when little shadow motioned for him to stop  oh dear you dont let me do any thing i want to sighed will i shall ask polly if i tarnt eat these and if she says i may i shall so now  he ran off to ask polly but she said they were poisonous and begged him to throw them away  good little shadow to keep me safe cried will i like you and ill mind better next time cause you are always right  the shadow seemed to like this and bobbed about so comically it made will laugh till his eyes were full of tears ned came back and they went on having grand times in the wood they found plenty of berries to fill the basket they swung down on slender birches and got rolls of white bark for canoes they saw all sorts of wildwood insects and birds and frolicked till they were tired as they crossed a field a cow suddenly put down her head and ran at them as if she was afraid they meant to hurt her calf all turned and ran as fast as they could toward the wall but poor will in his fright tumbled down and lay screaming ned and polly had reached the wall and looking back saw that their shadows had not followed neds stood before will brandishing his pole and pollys was flapping a shadowy sunbonnet with all its might as soon as they saw that back they wentned to threaten till he broke his pole and polly to flap till the strings came off as if anxious to do its part the bonnet flew up in the air and coming down lit on the cross cows head which so astonished her that she ran away as hard as she could pelt  wasnt that funny said will when they had tumbled over the wall and lay laughing in the grass on the safe side  im glad i wore the old bonnet for i suppose my best hat would have gone just the same said polly thankfully  the calf doesnt know its own mother with that thing on laughed ned  how brave and kind you were to come back and save me id have been deaded if you hadnt said will looking at his brother and sister with his little face full of grateful admiration  they turned towards home after this flurry feeling quite like heroes when they came to the corner where two roads met ned proposed they should take the riverroad for though the longest it was much the pleasantest  we shant be home at suppertime said polly you wont be able to do your jobs ned nor i mine and wills chickens will have to go to bed hungry  never mind its a holiday so lets enjoy it and not bother answered ned  we promised mamma wed come home early said will  they stood looking at the two roadsone sandy hot and hilly the other green and cool and level along the riverside they all chose the pleasant path and walked on till ned cried out why where are our shadows  they looked behind before and on either side but nowhere could they see them  they were with us at the corner said will  lets run back and try to find them said polly  no let em go im tired of minding mine and dont care if i never see it again said ned  dont say so for i remember hearing about a man who sold his shadow and then got into lots of trouble because he had none we promised to follow them and we must said polly  i wish began ned in a pet but polly clapped her hand over his mouth saying  pray dont wish now for it may come to pass as the mans wish in the fairy tale did and the black pudding flew up and stuck tight to his wifes nose  this made ned laugh and they all turned back to the corner looking up the hilly road they saw the three shadows trudging along as if bent on getting home in good time without saying a word the children followed and when they got to the garden gate they all said at once  arent you glad you came  under the elmtree stood a pretty teatable covered with bread and butter custards and berries and in the middle a fine cake with sugarroses on the top and mamma and baby all nicely dressed were waiting to welcome them to the birthday feast polly crowned the little queen ned gave her a willow whistle he had made and will some pretty bright pebbles he had found and miss baby was as happy as a bird with her treasures  a pleasant suppertime then the small duties for each one and then the gotobed frolic the nursery was a big room and in the evening a bright wood fire always burned there for baby mamma sat before it softly rubbing babys little rosy limbs before she went to bed singing and telling stories meanwhile to the three children who pranced about in their long nightgowns this evening they had a gay time for the shadows amused them by all sorts of antics and kept them laughing till they were tired as they sat resting on the big sofa they heard a soft sweet voice singing it wasnt mamma for she was only talking to baby and this voice sang a real song presently they saw mammas shadow on the wall and found it was the shadowmother singing to the shadowchildren they listened intently and this is what they heard      little shadows little shadows       dancing on the chamber wall     while i sit beside the hearthstone       where the red flames rise and fall     caps and nightgowns caps and nightgowns       my three antic shadows wear     and no sound they make in playing       for the six small feet are bare      dancing gayly dancing gayly       to and fro all together     like a family of daisies       blown about in windy weather     nimble fairies nimble fairies       playing pranks in the warm glow     while i sing the nursery ditties       childish phantoms love and know      now what happens now what happens       one small shadows tumbled down     i can see it on the carpet       softly rubbing its hurt crown     no one whimpers no one whimpers       a bravehearted sprite is this     see the others offer comfort       in a silent shadowy kiss      hush theyre creeping hush theyre creeping       up about my rockingchair     i can feel their loving fingers       clasp my neck and touch my hair     little shadows little shadows       take me captive hold me tight     as they climb and cling and whisper       mother dear good night good night  as the song ended the real children as well as the shadows lovingly kissed mamma and said goodnight then went away into their rooms said their prayers and nestled down into their beds ned slept alone in the room next that which polly and will had and after lying quiet a little while he called out softly  i say polly are you asleep  no im thinking what a queer day weve had answered polly  its been a good day and im glad we tried our wish for the shadows showed us as well as they could what we ought to do and be i shant forget it shall you said ned  no im much obliged for the lesson  so is i called out will in a very earnest but rather a sleepy little voice  i wonder what mamma will say when we tell her about it said ned  and i wonder if our shadows will come back to us at midnight and follow us as they used to do added polly  i shall be very careful where i lead my shadow cause hes a good little one and set me a righter zarmple than ever i did him said will and then dropped asleep  the others agreed with him and resolved that their shadows should not be ashamed of them all were fast asleep and no one but the moon saw the shadows come stealing back at midnight and having danced about the little beds vanish as the clock struck twelve     vi  poppys pranks   she wasnt a wilfully naughty child this harumscarum poppy but very thoughtless and very curious she wanted to see every thing do every thing and go every where she feared nothing and so was continually getting into scrapes  her pranks began early for when she was about four her mamma one day gave her a pair of green shoes with bright buttons poppy thought there never was any thing so splendid and immediately wanted to go to walk but mamma was busy and poppy couldnt go alone any farther than the garden she showed her shoes to the servants the cat the doves and the flowers and then opened the gate that the people in the street might see the trim little feet she was so proud of now poppy had been forbidden to go out but when she saw kitty allen her neighbor playing ball down the street she forgot every thing but the desire to show her new shoes and away she went marching primly along as vain as a little peacock as she watched the bright buttons twinkle and heard the charming creak kitty saw her coming and being an illnatured little girl took no notice but called out to her brother jack  aint some folks grand if i couldnt have red shoes for my best i wouldnt have any would you  they both laughed and this hurt poppys feelings dreadfully she tossed her head and tried to turn up her nose but it was so very small it couldnt be very scornful she said nothing but walked gravely by as if she was going on an errand and hadnt heard a word round the corner she went thinking she would wait till kitty was gone as she didnt like to pass again fearing jack might say something equally trying an organman with a monkey was playing near by and poppy was soon so busy listening to the music and watching the sadlooking monkey that she forgot home shoes and kitty altogether  she followed the man a long way and when she turned to go back she took the wrong street and found herself by the park being fond of dandelions poppy went in and gathered her hands full enjoying herself immensely for betsy the maid never let her play in the pond or roll down the hill or make dirtpies and now she did all these things besides playing with strange children and talking with any one she pleased if she had not had her luncheon just before she started she would have been very hungry for dinnertime came without her knowing it  by three oclock she began to think it was time to go home and boldly started off to find it but poor little poppy didnt know the way and went all wrong she was very tired now and hot and hungry and wanted to see mamma and wondered why she didnt come to the brown house with the white gardengate on and on she went up streets and down amusing herself with looking in the shopwindows and sitting to rest on doorsteps once she asked a pleasantfaced little girl to show her the way home but as she didnt know in what street it was and said her fathers name was papa the girl couldnt help her so she gave her a bun and went away poppy ate her bun and began to wonder what would become of her for night was coming on and there didnt seem to be any prospect of finding mamma or home or bed her courage was all gone now and coming to a quiet place she sat down on some high steps and cried till her little hankchif as she called it was all wet  nobody minded her and she felt very forlorn till a big black dog came by and seemed to understand the matter entirely for he smelt of her face licked her hands and then lay down by her with such a friendly look in his brown eyes that poppy was quite comforted she told him her story patted his big head and then being fairly tired out laid her wet cheek on his soft back and fell fast asleep  it was quite dark when she woke but a lamp was lighted near by and standing under it was a man ringing a great bell poppy sat up and wondered if anybodys supper was ready the man had a paper and when people stopped at the sound of the bell he read in a loud voice  lost a little girl four years old curly brown hair blue eyes had on a white frock and green shoes calls herself poppy  he got no farther for a little voice cried out of the dark in a tone of surprise  why dats me  the people all turned to look and the big man put his bell in his pocket took her up very kindly and said hed carry her home  is it far away asked poppy with a little sob  yes my dear but i am going to give you some supper fust along of my little girl i live close by and when weve had a bite well go find your ma  poppy was so tired and hungry she was glad to find herself taken care of and let the man do as he liked he took her to a funny little house and his wife gave her bread and molasses on a new tin plate with letters all round the edge poppy thought it very fine and enjoyed her supper though the mans little girl stared at her all the time with eyes as blue as her mug  while she ate the man sent word to her father that she was found and when both papa and mamma came hurrying in all out of breath with joy there sat miss poppy talking merrily with her face well daubed with molasses her gown torn her hands very dirty and her shoesah the pretty new shoesall spoiled with mud and dust scratched and half worn out the buttons dull and the color quite gone no one cared for it that night for little runaway was kissed and petted and taken home to her own cosey bed as tenderly as if she had done nothing naughty and never frightened her parents out of their wits in her life  but the next daydear me what a sad time it was to be sure when poppy woke up there hung the spoilt shoes over the mantlepiece and as soon as she was dressed papa came in with a long cord one end of which he tied round poppys waist and the other to the arm of the sofa  im very sorry to have to tie you up like a little dog but i must or you will forget and run away again and make mamma ill  then he went away without his morning kiss and poppy was so very unhappy she could hardly eat her breakfast she felt better by and by and tried to play but the cord kept pulling her back she couldnt get to the window and when she heard mamma passing the door she tried to run and meet her but had to stop halfway for the cord jerked her over cousin fanny came up but poppy was so ashamed to be tied that she crept under the sofa and hid all day she was a prisoner and was a very miserable little girl but at night she was untied and when mamma took her in her lap for the first time that day poppy held her fast and sobbed very penitently  o mamma i drefful sorry i runned away fordive me one time more and i never will adain and she never did  two or three years after this poppy went to live in the country and tried some new pranks one day she went with her sister nelly to see a man plough for that sort of thing was new to her while the man worked she saw him take out a piece of something brown and bite off a bit  whats that asked poppy  tobaccer said the man  is it nice asked poppy  prime said the man  could you let me taste it asked curious poppy  it will make you sick said the man laughing  it doesnt make you sick id like to try said poppy nothing daunted  he gave her a piece and poppy ate it though it didnt taste good at all she did it because cy her favorite playfellow told her shed die if she did and tried to frighten her  you darsnt eat any more he said  yes i dare see if i dont and poppy took another piece just to show how brave she was silly little poppy  i aint sick and i shant die so now  and poppy pranced about as briskly as ever but the man shook his head nelly watched her anxiously and cy kept saying  aint you sick yet say  for a little while poppy felt all right but presently she grew rather pale and began to look rather pensive she stopped running and walked slower and slower while her eyes got dizzy and her hands and feet very cold  aint you sick now say repeated cy and poppy tried to answer oh dear no but a dreadful feeling came over her and she could only shake her head and hold on to nelly  better lay down a spell said the man looking a little troubled  i dont wish to dirty my clean frock said poppy faintly as she glanced over the wideploughed field and longed for a bit of grass to drop on she kept on bravely for another turn but suddenly stopped and quite regardless of the clean pink gown dropped down in a furrow looking so white and queer that nelly began to cry poppy lay a minute then turned to cy and said very solemnly  cy run home and tell my mother im dying  away rushed cy in a great fright and burst upon poppys mamma exclaiming breathlessly  o maam poppys been and ate a lot of tobacco and shes sick layin in the field and she says come quick cause shes dyin  mercy on us what will happen to that child next cried poor mamma who was used to poppys mishaps papa was away and there was no carriage to bring poppy home in so mamma took the little wheelbarrow and trundled away to get the suffering poppy  she couldnt speak when they got to her and only stopping to give the man a lecture mamma picked up her silly little girl and the procession moved off first came cy as grave as a sexton then the wheelbarrow with poppy white and limp and speechless all in a bunch then mamma looking amused anxious and angry then nelly weeping as if her tender heart was entirely broken while the man watched them with a grin saying to himself  twarnt my fault the child was a reglar fool to swaller it  poppy was dreadfully sick all night but next day was ready for more adventures and experiments she swung on the garret stairs and tumbled down nearly breaking her neck she rubbed her eyes with red peppers to see if it really would make them smart as cy said and was led home quite blind and roaring with pain she got into the pigsty to catch a young piggy and was taken out in a sad state of dirt she slipped into the brook and was half drowned broke a window and her own head swinging a little flatiron on a string dropped baby in the coalhod buried her doll and spoilt her cut off a bit of her finger chopping wood and broke a tooth trying to turn heels over head on a haycock these are only a few of her pranks but one was nearly her last  she wanted to go barefooted as the little country boys and girls did but mamma wasnt willing and poppy was much afflicted  it doesnt hurt cy and it wont hurt me just for a little while she said  say no more poppy i never wish to see you barefooted replied mamma  well you neednt ill go and do it in the barn muttered poppy as she walked away  into the barn she went and played country girl to her hearts content in spite of nellys warnings nelly never got into scrapes being a highly virtuous young lady but she enjoyed poppys pranks and wept over her misfortunes with sisterly fidelity  now ill be a bear and jump at you as you go by said poppy when they were tired of playing steamengine with the old winnowing machine so she got up on a beam and nelly with a peck measure on her head for a hat and a stick for a gun went bearhunting and banged away at the swallows the barrels and the hencoops till the bear was ready to eat her presently with a loud roar the bear leaped but nelly wasnt eaten that time for poppy cried out with pain  oh i jumped on a pitchfork and its in my foot take it out take it out  poor little foot there was a deep purple hole in the sole and the blood came and poppy fainted away and nelly screamed and mamma ran and the neighbors rushed in and there was such a flurry poppy was soon herself again and lay on the sofa with nelly and cy to amuse her  what did the doctor say to mamma in the other room about me whispered poppy feeling very important at having such a bustle made on her account nelly sniffed but said nothing cy however spoke up briskly  he says you might have lockjaw  is that bad asked poppy gravely  oh aint it though your mouth shuts up and you cant open it and you have fits and die  always said poppy looking scared and feeling of her mouth  most always i guess thats why your ma cried and nelly keeps kissin you  cy felt sorry but rather enjoyed the excitement and was sure that if any one ever could escape dying it would be poppy for she always came alive again after her worst mishaps she looked very solemn for a few minutes and kept opening and shutting her mouth to see if it wasnt stiff presently she said in a serious tone and with a pensive air  nelly ill give you my beadring i shant want it any more and cy may have the little horse he lost his tail but i put on the lambs tail and he is as good as ever i wish to give away my things fore i die and nelly wont you bring me the scissors  what for said nelly sniffing more than ever  to cut off my hair for mamma shell want it and i like to cut things  nelly got the scissors and poppy cut away all she could reach giving directions about her property while she snipped  i wish papa to have my pictures and my piece of poetry i made give baby my dolly and the quacking duck tell billy if he wants my collection of bright buttons he can have em and give hattie the yellow plaster dog with my love  here mamma came in with a poultice and couldnt help laughing though tears stood in her eyes as she saw poppys cropped head and heard her last wishes  i dont think i shall lose my little girl yet so we wont talk of it but poppy must keep quiet and let nelly wait on her for a few days  are fits bad mamma and does it hurt much to die asked poppy thoughtfully  if people are good while they live it is not hard to die dear said mamma with a kiss and poppy hugged her saying softly  then ill be very good so i wont mind if the jawlock does come  and poppy was goodoh dreadfully good for a week quite an angel was poppy so meek and gentle so generous and obedient you really wouldnt have known her she loved everybody forgave her playmates all their sins against her let nelly take such of her precious treasures as she liked and pensively hoped baby would remember her when she was gone she hopped about with a crutch and felt as if she was an object of public interest for all the old ladies sent to know how she was the children looked at her with respectful awe as one set apart and doomed to fits and cy continually begged to know if her mouth was stiff  poppy didnt die though she got all ready for it and felt rather disappointed when the foot healed the jaws remained as active as ever and the fits didnt come i think it did her good for she never forgot that week and though she was near dying several times after she never was so fit to go as she was then  burneys making jelly lets go and get our scrapings said poppy to nellie once when mamma was away  but burney was busy and cross and cooks are not as patient as mothers so when the children appeared each armed with a spoon and demanded their usual feast she wouldnt hear of it and ordered them off  but we only want the scrapings of the pan burney mamma always lets us have them when we help her make jelly dont she nelly said poppy trying to explain the case  yes and makes us our little potful too added nelly persuasively  i dont want your help so be off your ma can fuss with your pot if she chooses ive no time  i think burneys the crossest woman in the world its mean to eat all the scrapings herself isnt it nelly said poppy very loud as the cook shut the door in their faces never mind i know how to pay her she added in a whisper as they sat on the stairs bewailing their wrongs shell put her old jelly in the big closet and lock the door but we can climb the plum tree and get in at the window when she takes her nap  should we dare to eat any asked nelly timid but longing for the forbidden fruit  i should just as much as ever i like its mammas jelly and she wont mind i dont care for old cross burney said poppy sliding down the banisters by way of soothing her ruffled spirit  so when burney went to her room after dinner the two rogues climbed in at the window and each taking a jar sat on the shelf dipping in their fingers and revelling rapturously but burney wasnt asleep and hearing a noise below crept down to see what mischief was going on pausing in the entry to listen she heard whispering clattering of glasses and smacking of lips in the big closet and in a moment knew that her jelly was lost she tried the door with her key but sly poppy had bolted it on the inside and feeling quite safe defied burney from among the jellypots entirely reckless of consequences shortsighted poppy she forgot cy but burney didnt and sent him to climb in at the window and undo the door feeling hurt that the young ladies hadnt asked him to the feast cy hardened his heart against them and delivered them up to the enemy regardless of poppys threats and nellys prayers  poppy proposed it she broke the jar and i didnt eat much o burney dont hurt her please but let me splain it to mamma when she comes sobbed nelly as burney seized poppy and gave her a good shaking  you go wash your face miss nelly and leave this naughty naughty child to me said burney and took poppy kicking and screaming into the little library where sheoh dreadful to relategave her a good spanking and locked her up  mamma never whipped and poppy was in a great rage at such an indignity the minute she was left alone she looked about to see how she could be revenged a solar lamp stood on the table and poppy coolly tipped it over with a fine smash calling out to burney that shed have to pay for it that mamma would be very angry and that she poppy was going to spoil every thing in the room but burney was gone and no one came near her she kicked the paint off the door rattled the latch called burney a pig and cy a badder boy than the man who smothered the little princes in the tower poppy was very fond of that story and often played it with nelly and the dolls having relieved her feelings in this way poppy rested and then set about amusing herself observing that the spilt oil made the table shine she took her handkerchief and polished up the furniture as she had seen the maids do  now that looks nice and i know mamma will be pleased cause im so tidy she said surveying her work with pride when she had thoroughly greased every table chair pictureframe bookback and ornament in the room plenty of oil still remained and poppy finished off by oiling her hair till it shone finely and smeltdear me how it did smell if she had been a young whale it couldnt have been worse poppy wasnt particular about smells but she got some in her mouth and didnt like the taste there was no water to wash in and her hands face and pinafore were in a high state of grease she was rather lonely too for though mamma had got home she didnt come to let poppy out so the young rebel thought it was about time to surrender she could write pretty well and was fond of sending penitent notes to mamma after being naughty for mamma always answered them so kindly and was so forgiving that poppys naughtiest mood was conquered by them sooner than by any punishment and poppy kept the notes carefully in a little cover even after she was grown up there was pen ink and paper in the room so after various trials poppy wrote her note      dear mamma      i am sorry i took bernys gelli i have braked the lamp the oyl     maks a bad smel i think i wil bee sik if i stay here anny more     i love youyour trying to bee good      popy  when she had finished she lowered her note by a string and bobbed it up and down before the parlor window till nelly saw and took it in every one laughed over it for besides the bad spelling and the funny periods it was covered with oilspots blots and tear marks for poppy got tenderhearted toward the end and cried a few very repentant tears when she said i love you your tryingtobegood poppy  mamma went up at once and ordered no further punishment but a thorough scrubbing which poppy underwent very meekly though betsey put soap in her eyes pulled her hair and scolded all the time they were not allowed any jelly for a long while and cy teased poppy about her hairoil till the joke was quite worn out and even cross burney was satisfied with the atonement  when poppy was eight she got so very wild that no one could manage her but mamma and she was ill so poppy was sent away to grandpas for a visit now grandpa was a very stately old gentleman and every one treated him with great respect but poppy wasnt at all afraid and asked all manner of impolite questions  grandpa why dont you have any hair on the top of your heado grandpa you do snore so loud when you take napswhat makes you turn out your feet so when you walk and such things  if grandpa hadnt been the bestnatured old gentleman in the world he wouldnt have liked this but he only laughed at poppy especially when she spoke of his legs for he was rather proud of them and always wore long black silk stockings and told every one that the legs were so handsome an artist put them in a picture of general washington which was quite true as any one may see when they look at the famous picture in boston  well poppy behaved herself respectably for a day or two but the house was rather dull she missed nelly wanted to run in the street and longed to see mamma she amused herself as well as she could with picturebooks patchwork and the old cat but not being a quiet proper little rosamond sort of a child she got tired of hemming neat pockethandkerchiefs and putting her needle carefully away when she had done she wanted to romp and shout and slide down the banisters and riot about so when she couldnt be quiet another minute she went up into a great empty room at the top of the house and cut up all sorts of capers her great delight was to lean out of the window as far as she could and look at the people in the street with her head upside down it was very dangerous for a fall would have killed her but the danger was the fun and poppy hung out till her hands touched the ledge below and her face was as red as any real poppys  she was enjoying herself in this way one day when an old gentleman who lived near came home to dinner and saw her  what in the world is that hanging out of the colonels upper window said he putting on his spectacles bless my soul that child will kill herself hallo there little girl get in this minute he called to poppy flourishing his hat to make her see him  what for answered poppy staring at him without moving an inch  youll fall and break your neck screamed the old gentleman  oh no i shant returned poppy much flattered by his interest and hanging out still further  stop that instantly or ill go in and inform the colonel roared the old gentleman getting angry  i dont care shouted poppy and she didnt for she knew grandpa wasnt at home  little gipsy ill settle her muttered the old man bustling up to the steps and ringing the bell as if the house was on fire  no one was in but the servants and when hed told old emily what the matter was she went up to settle poppy but poppy was already settled demurely playing with her doll and looking quite innocent emily scolded and poppy promised never to do it again if she might stay and play in the big room being busy about dinner emily was glad to be rid of her and left her to go and tell the old gentleman it was all right  aint they crosspatches said poppy to her doll never mind dear you shall hang out if i cant i guess the old man wont order you in any way  full of this idea poppy took her longsuffering dolly and tying a string to her neck danced her out of the window now this dolly had been through a great deal her head had been cut off and put on again she had been washed buried burnt torn soiled and banged about till she was a mournful object poppy loved her very much for she was two feet tall and had once been very handsome so her trials only endeared her to her little mamma away she went skipping and prancing like mada funny sight for poppy had taken off her clothes and she hadnt a hair on her head  poppy went to another window of the room for this performance because in the opposite house lived five or six children and she thought they would enjoy the fun  so they did and so did the other people for it was a boardinghouse and all the people were at home for dinner they came to the windows and looked and laughed at dollys capers and poppy was in high feather at the success of her entertainment  all of a sudden she saw grandpa coming down the street hands behind his back feet turned out goldheaded cane under his arm and the handsome legs in the black silk stockings marching along in the most stately manner poppy whisked dolly in before grandpa saw her and dodged down as he went by this made the people laugh again and grandpa wondered what the joke was the minute he went in out flew dolly dancing more frantically than ever and the children shouted so loud that grandpa went to see what the matter was the street was empty yet there stood the people staring out and laughing yes they were actually looking and laughing at his house and he didnt see what there was to laugh at in that highly respectable mansion  he didnt like it and clapping on his hat he went out to learn what the matter was he looked over at the house up at the sky down at the ground and through the street but nothing funny appeared for poppy and dolly were hidden again and the old gentleman was puzzled he went in and sat down to watch feeling rather disturbed presently the fun began again the children clapped their hands the people laughed and every one looked over at the house in what he thought a very impertinent way this made him angry and out he rushed a second time saying as he marched across the street  if those saucy young fellows are making game of me ill soon stop it  up to the door he went gave a great pull at the bell and when the servant came he demanded why every one was laughing at his house one of the young men came and told him and asked him to come in and see the fun poppy didnt see grandpa go in for she hid and when she looked out he was gone so she boldly began the dancing but in the midst of a lively caper dolly went bounce into the garden below for the string fell from poppys hand when she suddenly saw grandpa at the window opposite laughing as heartily as any one at her prank  she stared at him in a great fright and looked so amazed that every one enjoyed that joke better than the other and poor poppy didnt hear the last of it for a long time  her next performance was to fall into the pond on the common she was driving hoop down the hill and went so fast she couldnt stop herself so splashed into the water hoop and all how dreadful it was to feel the cold waves go over her head shutting out the sun and air the ground was gone and she could find no place for her feet and could only struggle and choke and go down down with a loud roaring sound in her ears that would have been the end of poppy if a little black boy hadnt jumped in and pulled her out she was sick and dizzy and looked like a drowned kitten but a kind lady took her home in a carriage after that mishap grandpa thought he wouldnt keep her any longer for fear she should come to some worse harm so miss poppy was sent home much to her delight and much to mammas also for no matter where she went or how naughty she was mamma was always glad to see the little wanderer back and to forgive and forget all poppys pranks     vii  what the swallows did   a man lay on a pile of newmade hay in a great barn looking up at the swallows who darted and twittered above him he envied the cheerful little creatures for he wasnt a happy man though he had many friends much money and the beautiful gift of writing songs that everybody loved to sing he had lost his wife and little child and would not be comforted but lived alone and went about with such a gloomy face that no one liked to speak to him he took no notice of friends and neighbors neither used his money for himself nor others found no beauty in the world no happiness anywhere and wrote such sad songs it made ones heart ache to sing them  as he lay alone on the sweetsmelling hay with the afternoon sunshine streaming in and the busy birds chirping overhead he said sadly to himself  happy swallows i wish i were one of you for you have no pains nor sorrows and your cares are very light all summer you live gayly together and when winter comes you fly away to the lovely south unseparated still  neighbors do you hear what that lazy creature down there is saying cried a swallow peeping over the edge of her nest and addressing several others who sat on a beam near by  we hear mrs skim and quite agree with you that he knows very little about us and our affairs answered one of the swallows with a shrill chirp like a scornful laugh we work harder than he does any day did he build his own house i should like to know does he get his daily bread for himself how many of his neighbors does he help how much of the world does he see and who is the happier for his being alive  cares indeed cried another i wish hed undertake to feed and teach my brood much he knows about the anxieties of a parent and the little mother bustled away to get supper for the young ones whose bills were always gaping wide  sorrows we have too softly said the fourth swallow he would not envy me if he knew how my nest fell and all my children were killed how my dear husband was shot and my old mother died of fatigue on our spring journey from the south  dear neighbor dart he would envy you if he knew how patiently you bear your troubles how tenderly you help us with our little ones how cheerfully you serve your friends how faithfully you love your lost mate and how trustfully you wait to meet him again in a lovelier country than the south  as skim spoke she leaned down from her nest to kiss her neighbor and as the little beaks met the other birds gave a grateful and approving murmur for neighbor dart was much beloved by all the inhabitants of twittertown  i for my part dont envy him said gossip wing who was fond of speaking her mind men and women call themselves superior beings but upon my word i think they are vastly inferior to us now look at that man and see how he wastes his life there never was any one with a better chance for doing good and being happy and yet he mopes and dawdles his time away most shamefully  ah he has had a great sorrow and it is hard to be gay with a heavy heart an empty home so dont be too severe sister wing and the white tie of the little widows cap was stirred by a long sigh as mrs dart glanced up at the nook where her nest once stood  no my dear i wont but really i do get out of patience when i see so much real misery which that man might help if hed only forget himself a little its my opinion hed be much happier than he now is wandering about with a dismal face and a sour temper  i quite agree with you and i dare say hed thank any one for telling him how he may find comfort poor soul i wish he could understand me for i sympathize with him and would gladly help him if i could  and as she spoke kindhearted widow dart skimmed by him with a friendly chirp which did comfort him for being a poet he could understand them and lay listening well pleased while the little gossips chattered on together  i am so tied at home just now that i know nothing of what is going on except the bits of news skim brings me so i enjoy your chat immensely im interested in your views on this subject and beg youll tell me what youd have that man do to better himself said mrs skim settling herself on her eggs with an attentive air  well my dear ill tell you for ive seen a deal of the world and any one is welcome to my experience replied mrs wing in an important manner for she was proud of her views and very fond of talking in my daily flights about the place i see a great deal of poverty and trouble and often wish i could lend a hand now this man has plenty of money and time and he might do more good than i can tell if hed only set about it because he is what they call a poet is no reason he should go moaning up and down as if he had nothing to do but make songs we sing but we work also and are wise enough to see the necessity of both thank goodness  yes indeed we do cried all the birds in a chorus for several more had stopped to hear what was going on  now what i say is this continued mrs wing impressively if i were that man id make myself useful at once there is poor little will getting more and more lame every day because his mother cant send him where he can be cured a trifle of that mans money would do it and he ought to give it old father winter is half starved alone there in his miserable hovel and no one thinks of the good old man why dont that lazy creature take him home and care for him the little while he has to live pretty nell is working day and night to support her father and is too proud to ask help though her health and courage are going fast the man might make hers the gayest heart alive by a little help there in a lonely garret lives a young man studying his life away longing for books and a teacher the man has a library full and might keep the poor boy from despair by a little help and a friendly word he mourns for his own lost baby i advise him to adopt the orphan whom nobody will own and who lies wailing all day untended on the poorhouse floor yes if he wants to forget sorrow and find peace let him fill his empty heart and home with such as these and life wont seem dark to him any more  dear me how well you express yourself mrs wing its quite a pleasure to hear you and i heartily wish some persons could hear you it would do em a deal of good said mrs skim while her husband gave an approving nod as he dived off the beam and vanished through the open doors  i know it would comfort that man to do these things for i have tried the same cure in my small way and found great satisfaction in it began little madame dart in her soft voice but mrs wing broke in saying with a pious expression of countenance  i flew into church one day and sat on the organ enjoying the music for every one was singing and i joined in though i didnt know the air opposite me were two great tablets with golden letters on them i can read a little thanks to my friend the learned raven and so i spelt out some of the words one was love thy neighbor and as i sat there looking down on the people i wondered how they could see those words week after week and yet pay so little heed to them goodness knows i dont consider myself a perfect bird far from it for i know i am a poor erring fowl but i believe i may say i do love my neighbor though i am an inferior creature and mrs wing bridled up as if she resented the phrase immensely  indeed you do gossip cried dart and skim for wing was an excellent bird in spite of the good opinion she had of herself  thank you well then such being the known fact i may give advice on the subject as one having authority and if it were possible id give that man a bit of my mind  you have madam you have and i shall not forget it thank you neighbors and good night said the man as he left the barn with the first smile on his face which it had worn for many days  mercy on us i do believe the creature heard every thing we said cried mrs wing nearly tumbling off the beam in her surprise  he certainly did so im glad i was guarded in my remarks replied mrs skim laughing at her neighbors dismay  dear me dear me what did i say cried mrs wing in a great twitter  you spoke with more than your usual bluntness and some of your expressions were rather strong i must confess but i dont think any harm will come of it we are of too little consequence for our criticisms or opinions to annoy him said mrs dart consolingly  i dont know that maam returned mrs wing sharply for she was much ruffled and out of temper a cat may look at a king and a bird may teach a man if the bird is the wisest he may destroy my nest and take my life but i feel that i have done my duty and shall meet affliction with a firmness which will be an example to that indolent ungrateful man  in spite of her boasted firmness mrs wing dropped her voice and peeped over the beam to be sure the man was gone before she called him names and then flew away to discover what he meant to do about it  for several days there was much excitement in twittertown for news of what had happened flew from nest to nest and every bird was anxious to know what revenge the man would take for the impertinent remarks which had been made about him  mrs wing was in a dreadful state of mind expecting an assault and the destruction of her entire family every one blamed her her husband lectured the young birds chirped chatterbox chatterbox as she passed and her best friends were a little cool all this made her very meek for a time and she scarcely opened her bill except to eat  a guard was set day and night to see if any danger approached and a row of swallows might be seen on the ridgepole at all hours if any one entered the barn dozens of little black heads peeped cautiously over the edges of the nests and there was much flying to and fro with reports and rumors for all the birds in the town soon knew that something had happened  the day after the imprudent conversation a chimneyswallow came to call on mrs wing and the moment she was seated on the beam she began  my dear creature i feel for you in your trying positionindeed i do and came over at once to warn you of your danger  mercy on us what is coming cried mrs wing covering her brood with trembling wings and looking quite wild with alarm  be calm my friend and bear with firmness the consequences of your folly replied mrs sootyback who didnt like mrs wing because she prided herself on her family and rather looked down on chimneyswallows you know maam i live at the great house and am in the way of seeing and hearing all that goes on there no fire is lighted in the study now but my landlord still sits on the hearth and i can overhear every word he says last evening after my darlings were asleep and my husband gone out i went down and sat on the andiron as i often do for the fireplace is full of oak boughs and i can peep out unseen my landlord sat there looking a trifle more cheerful than usual and i heard him say in a very decided tone  ill catch them one and all and keep them here that is better than pulling the place down as i planned at first those swallows little know what they have done but ill show them i dont forget  on hearing this a general wail arose and mrs wing fainted entirely away madam sootyback was quite satisfied with the effect she had produced and departed saying loftily  im sorry for you mrs wing and forgive your rude speech about my being related to chimneysweeps one cant expect good manners from persons brought up in mud houses and entirely shut out from good society if i hear any thing more ill let you know  away she flew and poor mrs wing would have had another fit if they hadnt tickled her with a feather and fanned her so violently that she was nearly blown off her nest by the breeze they raised  what shall we do she cried  nothing but wait i dare say mrs sootyback is mistaken at any rate we cant get away without leaving our children for they cant fly yet let us wait and see what happens if the worst comes we shall have done our duty and will all die together  as no one could suggest any thing better mrs darts advice was taken and they waited on the afternoon of the same day dr banks a sandswallow who lived in a subterranean village over by the great sandbank looked in to see mrs wing and cheered her by the following bit of news  the man was down at the poorhouse today and took away little nan the orphan baby i saw him carry her to wills mother and heard him ask her to take care of it for a time he paid her well and she seemed glad to do it for will needs help and now he can have it an excellent arrangement i think bless me maam whats the matter your pulse is altogether too fast and you look feverish  no wonder the doctor looked surprised for mrs wing suddenly gave a skip and flapped her wings with a shrill chirp exclaiming as she looked about her triumphantly  now who was right who has done good not harm by what you call gossip who has been a martyr and patiently borne all kinds of blame injustice and disrespect yes indeed the man saw the sense of my words he took my advice he will show his gratitude by some good turn yet and if half a dozen poor souls are helped it will be my doing and mine alone  here she had to stop for breath and her neighbors all looked at one another feeling undecided whether to own they were wrong or to put mrs wing down every one twittered and chirped and made a great noise but no one would give up and all went to roost in a great state of uncertainty but the next day it became evident that mrs wing was right for major bumblebee came buzzing in to tell them that old daddy winters hut was empty and his white head had been seen in the sunny porch of the great house  after this the swallows gave in and as no harm came to them they had a jubilee in honor of the occasion mrs wing was president and received a vote of thanks for the good she had done and the credit she had bestowed upon the town by her wisdom and courage she was much elated by all this but her fright had been of service and she bore her honors more meekly than one would have supposed to be sure she cut mrs sootyback when they met assumed an injured air when some of her neighbors passed her and said i told you so a dozen times a day to her husband who got so many curtain lectures that he took to sleeping on the highest rafter pretending that the childrens noise disturbed him  all sorts of charming things happened after that and such a fine summer never was known before for not only did the birds rejoice but people also a good spirit seemed to haunt the town leaving help and happiness wherever it passed some unseen hand scattered crumbs over the barn floor and left food at many doors no dog or boy or gun marred the tranquillity of the birds insects and flowers who lived on the great estate no want care or suffering that love or money could prevent befell the poor folk whose cottages stood near the old house sunshine and peace seemed to reign there for its gloomy master was a changed man now and the happiness he earned for himself by giving it to others flowed out in beautiful blithe songs and went singing away into the world making him friends and bringing him honor in high places as well as low  he did not forget the wife and little child whom he had loved so well but he mourned no longer for cheerful daisies grew above their graves and he knew that he should meet them in the lovely land where death can never come so while he waited for that happy time to come he made his life a cheery songas every one may do if they will and went about dropping kind words and deeds as silently and sweetly as the sky drops sunshine and dew every one was his friend but his favorites were the swallows every day he went to see them carrying grain and crumbs hearing their chat sharing their joys and sorrows and never tiring of their small friendship for to them he thought he owed all the content now his  when autumn leaves were red and autumn winds blew cold the inhabitants of twittertown prepared for their journey to the south they lingered longer than usual this year feeling sorry to leave their friend but the fields were bare the frosts began to pinch and the young ones longed to see the world so they must go the day they started the whole flock flew to the great house to say goodby some dived and darted round and round it some hopped to and fro on the sere lawn some perched on the chimneytops and some clung to the window ledges all twittering a loving farewell  chirp dart and wing peeped everywhere and everywhere found something to rejoice over in a cosey room by a bright fire sat daddy winter and nells old father telling stories of their youth and basking in the comfortable warmth in the study surrounded by the books he loved was the poor young man happy as a king now and learning many things which no book could teach him for he had found a friend then down below was wills mother working like a bee for she was housekeeper and enjoyed her tasks as much as any motherbird enjoys filling the little mouths of her brood close by was pretty nell prettier than ever now for her heavy care was gone and she sung as she sewed thinking of the old father whom nothing could trouble any more  but the pleasantest sight the three gossips saw was the man with baby nan on his arm and will at his side playing in the once dreary nursery how they laughed and danced for will was up from his bed at last and hopped nimbly on his crutches knowing that soon even they would be unneeded little nan was as plump and rosy as a baby should be and babbled like a brook as the man went to and fro cradling her in his strong arms feeling as if his own little daughter had come back when he heard the baby voice call him father  ah how sweet it is cried mrs dart glad to see that he had found comfort for his grief  yes indeed it does ones heart good to see such a happy family added mrs skim who was a very motherly bird  i dont wish to boast but i will say that i am satisfied with my summers work and go south feeling that i leave an enviable reputation behind me and mrs wing plumed herself with an air of immense importance as she nodded and bridled from her perch on the windowsill  the man saw the three and hastened to feed them for the last time knowing that they were about to go gratefully they ate and chirped their thanks and then as they flew away the little gossips heard their friend singing his goodby      swallow swallow neighbor swallow       starting on your autumn flight     pause a moment at my window       twitter softly your goodnight     for the summer days are over       all your duties are well done     and the happy homes you builded       have grown empty one by one      swallow swallow neighbor swallow       are you ready for your flight     are all the feather cloaks completed       are the little caps all right     are the young wings strong and steady       for the journey through the sky     come again in early springtime       and till then goodby goodby     viii  little gulliver   up in the lighthouse tower lived davy with old dan the keeper most little boys would have found it very lonely but davy had three friends and was as happy as the day was long one of davys friends was the great lamp which was lighted at sunset and burnt all night to guide the ships into the harbor to dan it was only a lamp but to the boy it seemed a living thing and he loved and tended it faithfully every day he helped dan clear the big wick polish the brass work and wash the glass lantern which protected the flame every evening he went up to see it lighted and always fell asleep thinking no matter how dark or wild the night my good shine will save the ships that pass and burn till morning  davys second friend was nep the newfoundland who was washed ashore from a wreck and had never left the island since nep was rough and big but had such a loyal and loving heart that no one could look in his soft brown eyes and not trust him he followed davys steps all day slept at his feet all night and more than once had saved his life when davy fell among the rocks or got caught by the rising tide  but the dearest friend of all was a seagull davy found him with a broken wing and nursed him carefully till he was well then let him go though he was very fond of little gulliver as he called him in fun but the bird never forgot the boy and came daily to talk with him telling all manner of wild stories about his wanderings by land and sea and whiling away many an hour that otherwise would have been very lonely  old dan was davys unclea grim gray man who said little did his work faithfully and was both father and mother to davy who had no parents and no friends beyond the island that was his world and he led a quiet life among his playfellowsthe winds and waves he seldom went to the main land three miles away for he was happier at home he watched the seaanemones open below the water looking like fairyplants brilliant and strange he found curious and pretty shells and sometimes more valuable treasures washed up from some wreck he saw little yellow crabs ugly lobsters and queer horseshoes with their stiff tails sometimes a whale or a shark swam by and often sleek black seals came up to bask on the warm rocks he gathered lovely seaweeds of all kinds from tiny red cobwebs to great scalloped leaves of kelp longer than himself he heard the waves dash and roar unceasingly the winds howl or sigh over the island and the gulls scream shrilly as they dipped and dived or sailed away to follow the ships that came and went from all parts of the world  with nep and gulliver he roamed about his small kingdom never tired of its wonders or if storms raged he sat up in the tower safe and dry watching the tumult of sea and sky often in long winter nights he lay awake listening to the wind and rain that made the tower rock with their violence but he never was afraid for nep nestled at his feet dan sat close by and overhead the great lamp shone far out into the night to cheer and guide all wanderers on the sea  close by the tower hung the fogbell which being wound up would ring all night warningly one day dan found that something among the chains was broken and having vainly tried to mend it he decided to go to the town and get what was needed he went once a week usually and left davy behind for in the daytime there was nothing to do and the boy was not afraid to stay  a heavy fog is blowing up we shall want the bell tonight and i must be off at once i shall be back before dark of course so take care of yourself boy said dan  away went the little boat and the fog shut down over it as if a misty wall had parted davy from his uncle as it was dull weather he sat and read for an hour or two then fell asleep and forgot everything till neps cold nose on his hand waked him up it was nearly dark and hoping to find dan had come he ran down to the landingplace but no boat was there and the fog was thicker than ever  dan never had been gone so long before and davy was afraid something had happened to him for a few minutes he was in great trouble then he cheered up and took courage  it is sunset by the clock so ill light the lamp and if dan is lost in the fog it will guide him home said davy  up he went and soon the great star shone out above the blacktopped lighthouse glimmering through the fog as if eager to be seen davy had his supper but no dan came he waited hour after hour and waited all in vain the fog thickened till the lamp was hardly seen and no bell rung to warn the ships of the dangerous rocks poor davy could not sleep but all night long wandered from the tower to the door watching calling and wondering but dan did not come  at sunrise he put out the light and having trimmed it for the next night ate a little breakfast and roved about the island hoping to see some sign of dan the sun drew up the fog at last and he could see the blue bay the distant town and a few fishingboats going out to sea but nowhere was the islandboat with gray old dan in it and davys heart grew heavier and heavier as the day passed and still no one came in the afternoon gulliver appeared to him davy told his trouble and the three friends took counsel together  there is no other boat and i couldnt row so far if there was so i cant go to find dan said david sorrowfully  id gladly swim to town if i could but its impossible to do it with wind and tide against me ive howled all day hoping some one would hear me but no one does and im discouraged said nep with an anxious expression  i can do something for you and i will with all my heart ill fly to town if i dont see him in the bay and try to learn what has become of dan then ill come and tell you and we will see what is to be done next cheer up davy dear ill bring you tidings if any can be had with these cheerful words away sailed gulliver leaving nep and his master to watch and wait again  the wind blew hard and the broken wing was not quite well yet else gulliver would have been able to steer clear of a boat that came swiftly by a sudden gust drove the gull so violently against the sail that he dropped breathless into the boat and a little girl caught him before he could recover himself  oh what a lovely bird see his black cap his white breast dovecolored wings red legs and bill and soft bright eyes i wanted a gull and ill keep this one for i dont think he is much hurt  poor gulliver struggled pecked and screamed but little dora held him fast and shut him in a basket till they reached the shore then she put him in a lobster pota large wooden thing something like a cageand left him on the lawn where he could catch glimpses of the sea and watch the lighthouse tower as he sat alone in this dreadful prison if dora had known the truth she would have let him go and done her best to help him but she could not understand his speech as davy did for very few people have the power of talking with birds beasts insects and plants to her his prayers and cries were only harsh screams and when he sat silent with drooping head and ruffled feathers she thought he was sleepy but he was mourning for davy and wondering what his little friend would do  for three long days and nights he was a prisoner and suffered much the house was full of happy people but no one took pity upon him ladies and gentlemen talked learnedly about him boys poked and pulled him little girls admired him and begged his wings for their hats if he died cats prowled about his cage dogs barked at him hens cackled over him and a shrill canary jeered at him from the pretty pagoda in which it hung high above danger in the evening there was music and the poor birds heart ached as the sweet sounds came to him reminding him of the airier melodies he loved through the stillness of the night he heard the waves break on the shore the wind came singing up from the sea the moon shone kindly on him and he saw the waterfairies dancing on the sand but for three days no one spoke a friendly word to him and he pined away with a broken heart  on the fourth night when all was quiet little gulliver saw a black shadow steal across the lawn and heard a soft voice say to him  poor bird youll die if yer stays here so ise gwine to let yer go specs little missyll scold dreffle but moppetll take de scoldin for yer hi dere you is peart nuff now kase yous in a hurry to go but jes wait till i gits de knots out of de string dat ties de door and den away you flies  but dear kind moppet wont you be hurt for doing this why do you care so much for me i can only thank you and fly away  as gulliver spoke he looked up at the little black face bent over him and saw tears in the childs sad eyes but she smiled at him and shook her fuzzy head as she whispered kindly  i dont want no tanks birdie i loves to let you go kase yous a slave like i was once and its a dreffle hard ting i knows i got away and i means you shall ise watched you deary all dese days and i tried to come fore but dey didnt give me no chance  do you live here i never see you playing with the other children said the gull as moppets nimble fingers picked away at the knots  yes i lives here and helps de cook you didnt see me kase i never plays de chilen dont like me  why not asked gulliver wondering  ise black said moppet with a sob  but thats silly in them cried the bird who had never heard of such a thing color makes no difference the peeps are gray the seals black and the crabs yellow but we dont care and are all friends it is very unkind to treat you so havent you any friends to love you dear  nobody in de world keres fer me dey sold me way from my mammy when i was a baby and ise knocked roun eber since de oder chilen has folks to lub an kere fer em but moppets got no friends and here the black eyes grew so dim with tears that the poor child couldnt see that the last knot was out  gulliver saw it and pushing up the door flew from his prison with a glad cry and hopping into moppets hand looked into the little dark face with such grateful confidence that it cleared at once and the brightest smile it had worn for months broke over it as the bird nestled its soft head against her cheek saying gently  im your friend dear i love you and i never shall forget what you have done for me tonight how can i thank you before i go  for a minute moppet could only hug the bird and cry for these were the first kind words she had heard for a long time and they went straight to her lonely little heart  o my deary ise paid by dem words and i dont want no tanks jes lub me and come sometimes to see me ef you can its so hard livin in dis yere place i dont tink ill bar it long i wish i was a bird to fly away or a oyster safe in de mud and free to do as is a mind  i wish you could go and live with davy on the island he is so kind so happy and as free as the wind cant you get away moppet whispered gulliver longing to help this poor friendless little soul he told her all his story and they agreed that he should fly at once to the island and see if dan was there if not he was to come back and moppet would try to get some one to help find him when this was done davy and dan were to take moppet if they could and make her happy on the island full of hope and joy gulliver said goodby and spread his wings but alas for the poor bird he was too weak to fly for three days he had hardly eaten any thing had found no salt water to bathe in and had sat moping in the cage till his strength was all gone  what shall i do what shall i do he cried fluttering his feeble wings and running to and fro in despair  hush birdie ill take kere ob you till yous fit to fly i knows a nice quiet little cove down yonder where no one goes and dare you kin stay till yous better ill come and feed you and you kin paddle and rest and try your wings safe and free honey  as moppet spoke she took gulliver in her arms and stole away in the dim light over the hill down to the lonely spot where nothing went but the winds and waves the gulls and little moppet when hard words and blows made heart and body ache here she left the bird and with a loving goodnight crept home to her bed in the garret feeling as rich as a queen and much happier for she had done a kind thing and made a friend  next day a great storm came the wind blew a hurricane the rain poured and the sea thundered on the coast if he had been well gulliver wouldnt have minded at all but being sick and sad he spent an anxious day sitting in a cranny of the rock thinking of davy and moppet it was so rough even in the cove that he could neither swim nor fly so feeble was he and could find no food but such trifles as he could pick up among the rocks at nightfall the storm raged fiercer than ever and he gave up seeing moppet for he was sure she wouldnt come through the pelting rain just to feed him so he put his head under his wing and tried to sleep but he was so wet and weak so hungry and anxious no sleep came  what has happened to davy alone on the island all this while he will fall ill with loneliness and trouble the lamp wont be lighted the ships will be wrecked and many people will suffer o dan dan if we could only find you how happy we should be  as gulliver spoke a voice cried through the darkness  is you dere honey and moppet came climbing over the rocks with a basket full of such bits as she could get poor birdie is you starvin here jes go at dis and joy yourself deres fish and tings i tink youd like how is you now dear  better moppet but its so stormy i cant get to davy and i worry about him began gulliver pecking away at his supper but he stopped suddenly for a faint sound came up from below as if some one called help help  hi whats dat said moppet listening  davy davy called the voice  its dan hurrah weve found him and gulliver dived off the rock so reckless that he went splash into the water but that didnt matter to him and he paddled away like a little steamer with all the engines in full blast down by the seaside between two stones lay dan so bruised and hurt he couldnt move and so faint with hunger and pain he could hardly speak as soon as gulliver called moppet scrambled down and fed the poor man with her scraps brought him rainwater from a crevice near by and bound up his wounded head with her little apron then dan told them how his boat had been run down by a ship in the fog how he was hurt and cast ashore in the lonely cove how he had lain there half dead for no one heard his shouts and he couldnt move how the storm brought him back to life when he was almost gone and the sound of moppets voice told him help was near  how glad they all were then moppet danced for joy gulliver screamed and flapped his wings and dan smiled in spite of pain to think he should see davy again he couldnt understand gulliver but moppet told him all the story and when he heard it he was more troubled for the boy than for himself  what will he do he may get killed or scared or try to come ashore is the lamp alight he cried trying to move and falling back with a moan of pain  gulliver flew up to the highest rock and looked out across the dark sea yes there it wasthe steady star shining through the storm and saying plainly all is well  thank heaven if the lamp is burning davy is alive now how shall i get to him said dan  never you fret massa moppetll see to dat you jes lay still till i comes deres folks in de house asll tend to you ef i tells em who and where you is  off she ran and soon came back with help dan was taken to the house and carefully tended moppet wasnt scolded for being out so late and in the flurry no one thought of the gull next morning the cage was found blown over and every one fancied the bird had flown away dora was already tired of him so he was soon forgotten by all but moppet  in the morning it was clear and gulliver flew gladly to the tower where davy still watched and waited with a pale face and heavy heart for the three days had been very hard to bear and but for nep and shine he would have lost his courage entirely gulliver flew straight into his bosom and sitting there told his adventures while davy laughed and cried and nep stood by wagging his tail for joy while his eyes were full of sympathy the three had a very happy hour together and then came a boat to carry davy ashore while another keeper took charge of the light till dan was well  nobody ever knew the best part of the story but moppet davy and gulliver other people didnt dream that the boys pet gull had any thing to do with the finding of the man or the good fortune that came to moppet while dan lay sick she tended him like a loving little daughter and when he was well he took her for his own he did not mind the black skin he only saw the loneliness of the child the tender heart the innocent white soul and he was as glad to be a friend to her as if she had been as blithe and pretty as dora  it was a happy day when dan and davy moppet gulliver and nep sailed away to the island for that was still to be their home with stout young ben to help  the sun was setting and they floated through waves as rosy as the rosy sky a fresh wind filled the sail and ruffled gullivers white breast as he sat on the masthead crooning a cheery song to himself dan held the tiller and davy lay at his feet with nep bolt upright beside him but the happiest face of all was moppets kneeling at the bow she leaned forward with her lips apart her fuzzy hair blown back and her eyes fixed on the island which was to be her home like a little black figurehead of hope she leaned and looked as the boat flew on bearing her away from the old life into the new  as the sun sunk out shone the lamp with sudden brightness as if the island bade them welcome dan furled the sail and drifting with the tide they floated in till the waves broke softly on the shore and left them safe at home     ix  the whales story   freddy sat thinking on the seat under the trees it was a wide white seat about four feet long sloping from the sides to the middle something like a swing and was not only comfortable but curious for it was made of a whales bone freddy often sat there and thought about it for he was very much interested in it and nobody could tell him any thing of it except that it had been there a long time  poor old whale i wonder how you got here where you came from and if you were a good and happy creature while you lived said freddy patting the old bone with his little hand  it gave a great creak and a sudden gust of air stirred the trees as if some monster groaned and sighed then freddy heard a strange voice very loud yet cracked and queer as if some one tried to talk with a broken jaw  freddy ahoy called the big voice ill tell you all about it for you are the only person who ever pitied me or cared to know any thing about me  why can you talk asked freddy very much astonished and a little frightened  of course i can for this is a part of my jawbone i should talk better if my whole mouth was here but im afraid my voice would then be so loud you wouldnt be able to hear it i dont think any one but you would understand me any way it isnt every one that can you know but you are a thoughtful little chap with a lively fancy as well as a kind heart so you shall hear my story  thank you i should like it very much if you would please to speak a little lower and not sigh for your voice almost stuns me and your breath nearly blows me away said freddy  ill try but its hard to suit my tone to such a mite or to help groaning when i think of my sad fate though i deserve it perhaps said the bone more gently  were you a naughty whale asked freddy  i was proud very proud and foolish and so i suffered for it i dare say you know a good deal about us i see you reading often and you seem a sensible child  no i havent read about you yet and i only know that you are the biggest fish there is replied freddy  the bone creaked and shook as if it was laughing and said in a tone that showed it hadnt got over its pride yet  youre wrong there my dear we are not fishes at all though stupid mortals have called us so for a long time we cant live without air we have warm red blood and we dont lay eggsso we are not fishes we certainly are the biggest creatures in the sea and out of it why bless you some of us are nearly a hundred feet long our tails alone are fifteen or twenty feet wide the biggest of us weigh five hundred thousand pounds and have in them the fat bone and muscle of a thousand cattle the lower jaw of one of my family made an arch large enough for a man on horseback to ride under easily and my cousins of the spermfamily usually yield eighty barrels of oil  gracious me what monsters you are cried freddy taking a long breath while his eyes got bigger and bigger as he listened  ah you may well say so we are a very wonderful and interesting family all our branches are famous in one way or another finbacks sperms and rights are the largest then come the norwhals the dolphins and porpoiseswhich last i dare say youve seen  yes but tell me about the big ones please which were you cried freddy  i was a right whale from greenland the sperms live in warm places but to us the torrid zone is like a sea of fire and we dont pass it our cousins do and go to the east indies by way of the north pole which is more than your famous parrys and franklins could do  i dont know about that but id like to hear what you eat and how you live and why you came here said freddy who thought the whale rather inclined to boast  well we havent got any teethour branch of the family and we live on creatures so small that you could only see them with a microscope yes you may stare but its true my dear the roofs of our mouths are made of whalebone in broad pieces from six to eight feet long arranged one against the other so they make an immense sieve the tongue which makes about five barrels of oil lies below like a cushion of white satin when we want to feed we rush through the water which is full of the little things we eat and catch them in our sieve spurting the water through two holes in our heads then we collect the food with our tongue and swallow it for though we are so big our throats are small we roam about in the ocean leaping and floating feeding and spouting flying from our enemies or fighting bravely to defend our young ones  have you got any enemies i shouldnt think you could have you are so large said freddy  but we have and many toothree who attack us in the water and several more that men use against us the killer the swordfish and the thrasher trouble us at home the killer fastens to us and wont be shaken off till he has worried us to death the swordfish stabs us with his sword and the thrasher whips us to death with his own slender but strong and heavy body then men harpoon us shoot or entrap us and make us into oil and candles and seats and stiffening for gowns and umbrellas said the bone in a tone of scorn  freddy laughed at the idea and asked how about candles i know about oil and seats and umbrellas but i thought candles were made of wax  i cant say much on that point i only know that when a sperm whale is killed they make oil out of the fat part as they do of ours but the sperms have a sort of cistern in their heads full of stuff like cream and rosecolored they cut a hole in the skull and dip it out and sometimes get sixteen or twenty barrels this is made into what you call spermaceti candles we dont have any such nonsense about us but the sperms always were a lightheaded set  here the bone laughed in a cracked sort of roar which sent freddy flying off the seat on to the grass where he stayed laughing also though he didnt see any joke  i beg your pardon child it isnt often that i laugh for ive a heavy heart somewhere and have known trouble enough to make me as sad as the sea is sometimes  tell me about your troubles i pity you very much and like to hear you talk said freddy kindly  unfortunately we are very easily killed in spite of our size and have various afflictions besides death we grow blind our jaws are deformed sometimes our tails with which we swim get hurt and we have dyspepsia  freddy shouted at that for he knew what dyspepsia was because at the seaside there were many sickly people who were always groaning about that disease  its no laughing matter i assure you said the whales bone we suffer a great deal and get thin and weak and miserable ive sometimes thought thats the reason we are blue  perhaps as you have no teeth you dont chew your food enough and so have dyspepsia like an old gentleman i know said freddy  thats not the reason my cousins the sperms have teeth and dyspepsia also  are they blue  no black and white but i was going to tell you my troubles my father was harpooned when i was very young and i remember how bravely he died the rights usually run away when they see a whaler coming not from cowardiceoh dear nobut discretion the sperms stay and fight and are killed off very fast for they are a very headstrong family we fight when we cant help it and my father died like a hero they chased him five hours before they stuck him he tried to get away and dragged three or four boats and sixteen hundred fathoms of line from eight in the morning till four at night then they got out another line and he towed the ship itself for more than an hour there were fifteen harpoons in him he chewed up a boat pitched several men overboard and damaged the vessel before they killed him ah he was a father to be proud of  freddy sat respectfully silent for a few minutes as the old bone seemed to feel a great deal on the subject presently he went on again  the sperms live in herds but the rights go in pairs and are very fond of one another my wife was a charming creature and we were very happy till one sad day when she was playing with our childa sweet little whaleling only twelve feet long and weighing but a tonmy son was harpooned his mamma instead of flying wrapped her fins round him and dived as far as the line allowed then she came up and dashed at the boats in great rage and anguish entirely regardless of the danger she was in the men struck my son in order to get her and they soon succeeded but even then in spite of her suffering she did not try to escape but clung to little spouter till both were killed alas alas  here the poor bone creaked so dismally freddy feared it would tumble to pieces and bring the story to an end too soon  dont think of those sorrowful things he said tell me how you came to be here were you harpooned  not i for ive been very careful all my life to keep out of the way of danger im not like one of my relations who attacked a ship gave it such a dreadful blow that he made a great hole the water rushed in and the vessel was wrecked but he paid dearly for that prank for a few months afterward another ship harpooned him very easily finding two spears still in him and a wound in his head i forgot to mention that the sperms have fine ivory teeth and make ambergrisa sort of stuff that smells very nice and costs a great deal i give you these little facts about my family as you seem interested and its always well to improve the minds of young people  you are very kind but will you be good enough to tell about yourself said freddy again for the bone seemed to avoid that part of the story as if he didnt want to tell it  well if i must i must but im sorry to confess what a fool ive been you know what coral is dont you  no said freddy wondering why it asked  then i must tell you i suppose there is a bit in the house therethat rough white stony stuff on the table in the parlor its full of little holes you know well those holes are the front doors of hundreds of little polypes or coral worms who build the great branches of coral and live there they are of various shapes and colorssome like stars some fine as a thread and blue or yellow others like snails and tiny lobsters some people say the real coralmakers are shaped like little oblong bags of jelly closed at one end the other open with six or eight little feelers like a star all around it the other creatures are boarders or visitors these are the real workers and when they sit in their cells and put out their feelers they make all manner of lovely colors under the watercrimson green orange and violet but if they are taken up or touched the coral people go in doors and the beautiful hues disappear they say there are many coral reefs and islands built by these industrious people in the south seas but i cant go there to see and i am contented with those i find in the northern latitudes i knew such a community of coral builders and used to watch them long ago when they began to work it was a charming spot down under the sea for all manner of lovely plants grew there splendid fishes sailed to and fro wonderful shells lay about crimson and yellow prawns long gliding green worms and purple seaurchins were there when i asked the polypes what they were doing and they answered building an island i laughed at them for the idea that these tiny soft atoms could make any thing was ridiculous you may roar but youll see that we are right if you live long enough said they our family have built thousands of islands and long reefs that the sea cant get over strong as it is that amused me immensely but i wouldnt believe it and laughed more than ever  it does seem very strange said freddy looking at the branch of coral which he had brought out to examine  doesnt it and isnt it hard to believe i used to go now and then to see how the little fellows got on and always found them hard at it for a long while there was only a little plant without leaves growing slowly taller and taller for they always build upward toward the light by and by the small shrub was a tree flyingfish roosted in its branches seacows lay under its shadow and thousands of jolly little polypes lived and worked in its white chambers i was glad to see them getting on so well but still i didnt believe in the island story and used to joke them about their ambition they were very goodnatured and only answered me wait a little longer friend right i had my own affairs to attend to so for years at a time i forgot the coralworkers and spent most of my life up greenland way for warm climates dont agree with my constitution when i came back after a long absence i was astonished to see the tree grown into a large umbrellashaped thing rising above the water seaweed had washed up and clung there seabirds had made nests there landbirds and the winds had carried seeds there which had sprung up trunks of trees had been cast there by the sea lizards insects and little animals came with the trees and were the first inhabitants and behold it was an island  what did you say then asked freddy  i was angry and didnt want to own that i was wrong so i insisted that it wasnt a real island without people on it wait a little longer answered the polypes and went on building broader and broader foundations i flounced away in a rage and didnt go back for a great while i hoped something would happen to the coral builders and their island but i was so curious that i couldnt keep away and on going back there i found a settlement of fishermen and the beginning of a thriving town now i should have been in a towering passion at this if in my travels i hadnt discovered a race of little creatures as much smaller than polypes as a mouse is smaller than an elephant i heard two learned men talking about diatoms as they sailed to labrador and i listened they said these people lived in both salt and fresh water and were found in all parts of the world they were a glassy shell holding a soft goldenyellow substance and that they were so countless that banks were made of them and that a town here in these united states was founded on them they were the food of many little seaanimals who in turn fed us big creatures and were very interesting and wonderful i saved up this story and when the polypes asked if they hadnt done what they intended i told them i didnt think it so very remarkable for the tiny diatoms made cities and were far more astonishing animals than they i thought that would silence them but they just turned round and informed me that my diatoms were plants not animalsso my story was all humbug then i was mad and couldnt get over the fact that these little rascals had done what we the kings of the sea couldnt do i wasnt content with being the biggest creature there i wanted to be the most skilful also i didnt remember that every thing has its own place and use and should be happy in doing the work for which it was made i fretted over the matter a long while and at last decided to make an island myself  how could you asked freddy  i had my plans and thought them very wise ones i was so bent on outdoing the polypes that i didnt much care what happened and so i went to work in my clumsy way i couldnt pile up stones or build millions of cells so i just made an island of myself i swam up into the harbor yonder one night covered my back with seaweed and lay still on the top of the water in the morning the gulls came to see what it was and pecked away at the weeds telling me very soon that they knew what i was after and that i couldnt gull them all the people on shore turned out to see the wonder also for a fisherman had carried the tidings and every one was wild to behold the new island after staring and chattering a long while boats came off to examine the mystery loads of scientific gentlemen worked away at me with microscopes hammers acids and all sorts of tests to decide what i was and kept up such a fire of long words that i was most dead they couldnt make up their minds and meanwhile news of the strange thing spread and every sort of person came to see me the gulls kept telling them the joke but they didnt understand and i got on capitally every night i dined and fed and frolicked till dawn then put on my seaweeds and lay still to be stared at i wanted some one to come and live on me then i should be equal to the island of the polypes but no one came and i was beginning to be tired of fooling people when i was fooled myself an old sailor came to visit me he had been a whaler and he soon guessed the secret but he said nothing till he was safely out of danger then he got all ready and one day as i lay placidly in the sun a horrible harpoon came flying through the air and sunk deep into my back i forgot every thing but the pain and dived for my life alas the tide was low the harborbar couldnt be passed and i found hundreds of boats chasing me till i was driven ashore down there on the flats big and strong as we are once out of water and we are perfectly helpless i was soon despatched and my bones left to whiten on the sand this was long ago and one by one all my relics have been carried off or washed away my jawbone has been used as a seat here till its worn out but i couldnt crumble away till id told some one my story remember child pride goeth before a fall  then with a great creak the bone tumbled to pieces and found a peaceful grave in the long green grass     x  a strange island   one day i lay rocking in my boat reading a very famous book which all children know and love and the name of which ill tell you by and by so busily was i reading that i never minded the tide and presently discovered that i was floating out to sea with neither sail nor oar at first i was very much frightened for there was no one in sight on land or sea and i didnt know where i might drift to but the water was calm the sky clear and the wind blew balmily so i waited for what should happen  presently i saw a speck on the sea and eagerly watched it for it drew rapidly near and seemed to be going my way when it came closer i was much amazed for of all the queer boats i ever saw this was the queerest it was a great wooden bowl very cracked and old and in it sat three grayheaded little gentlemen with spectacles all reading busily and letting the boat go where it pleased now right in their way was a rock and i called out sir sir take care  but my call came too late crash went the bowl out came the bottom and down plumped all the little gentlemen into the sea i tried not to laugh as the books wigs and spectacles flew about and urging my boat nearer i managed to fish them up dripping and sneezing and looking like drowned kittens when the flurry was over and they had got their breath i asked who they were and where they were going  we are from gotham maam said the fattest one wiping a very wet face on a very wet handkerchief we were going to that island yonder we have often tried but never got there its always so and i begin to think the thing cant be done  i looked where he pointed and sure enough there was an island where i had never seen one before i rubbed my eyes and looked again yes there it wasa little island with trees and people on it for i saw smoke coming out of the chimney of a queerlyshaped house on the shore  what is the name of it i asked  the little old gentleman put his finger on his lips and said with a mysterious nod  i couldnt tell you maam its a secret but if you manage to land there you will soon know  the other old men nodded at the same time and then all went to reading again with the water still dropping off the ends of their noses this made me very curious and as the tide drifted us nearer and nearer i looked well about me and saw several things that filled me with a strong desire to land on the island the odd house i found was built like a highheeled shoe and at every window i saw childrens heads some were eating broth some were crying and some had nightcaps on i caught sight of a distracted old lady flying about with a ladle in one hand and a rod in the other but the house was so full of children even up to the skylightout of which they popped their heads and nodded at me that i couldnt see much of the mamma of this large family one seldom can you know  i had hardly got over my surprise at this queer sight when i saw a cow fly up through the air over the new moon that hung there and come down and disappear in the woods i really didnt know what to make of this but had no time to ask the old men what it meant for a cat playing a fiddle was seen on the shore a little dog stood by listening and laughing while a dish and a spoon ran away over the beach with all their might if the boat had not floated up to the land i think i should have swam therei was so anxious to see what was going on for there was a great racket on the island and such a remarkable collection of creatures it was impossible to help staring  as soon as we landed three other gentlemen came to welcome the ones i had saved and seemed very glad to see them they appeared to have just landed from a tub in which was a drum rubadubdubbing all by itself one of the new men had a white frock on and carried a large knife the second had dough on his hands flour on his coat and a hotlooking face the third was very greasy had a bundle of candles under his arm and a ball of wicking half out of his pocket the six shook hands and walked away together talking about a fair and left me to take care of myself  i walked on through a pleasant meadow where a pretty little girl was looking sadly up at a row of sheeps tails hung on a tree i also saw a little boy in blue asleep by a haycock and another boy taking aim at a cocksparrow who clapped his wings and flew away presently i saw two more little girls one sat by a fire warming her toes and when i asked what her name was she said pleasantly  polly flinders maam  the other one sat on a tuft of grass eating something that looked very nice but all of a sudden she dropped her bowl and ran away looking very much frightened  whats the matter with her i asked of a gay young frog who came tripping along with his hat under his arm  miss muffit is a fashionable lady and afraid of spiders madam also of frogs and he puffed himself angrily up till his eyes quite goggled in his head  and pray who are you sir i asked staring at his white vest green coat and fine cravat  excuse me if i dont give my name maam my false friend the rat got me into a sad scrape once and rowley insists upon it that a duck destroyed me which is all gammon maamall gammon  with that the frog skipped away and i turned into a narrow lane which seemed to lead toward some music i had not gone far when i heard the rumbling of a wheelbarrow and saw a little man wheeling a little woman along the little man looked very hot and tired but the little woman looked very nice in a smart bonnet and shawl and kept looking at a new gold ring on her finger as she rode along under her little umbrella i was wondering who they were when down went the wheelbarrow and the little lady screamed so dismally that i ran away lest i should get into troublebeing a stranger  turning a corner i came upon a very charming scene and slipped into a quiet nook to see what was going on it was evidently a wedding and i was just in time to see it for the procession was passing at that moment first came a splendid cockadoodle all in black and gold like a herald blowing his trumpet and marching with a very dignified step then came a rook in black like a minister with spectacles and white cravat a lark and bullfinch followedfriends i suppose and then the bride and bridegroom miss wren was evidently a quakeress for she wore a sober dress and a little white veil through which her bright eyes shone the bridegroom was a military man in his scarlet uniforma plump boldlooking bird very happy and proud just then a goldfinch gave away the bride and a linnet was bridesmaid the ceremony was very fine and as soon as it was over the blackbird thrush and nightingale burst out in a lovely song  a splendid dinner followed at which was nearly every bird that flies so you may imagine the music there was they had currantpie in abundance and cherrywine which excited a cuckoo so much that he became quite rude and so far forgot himself as to pull the bride about this made the groom so angry that he begged his friend the sparrow to bring his bow and arrow and punish the ruffian but alas sparrow had also taken a drop too much he aimed wrong and with a dreadful cry mr robin sank dying into the arms of his wife little jane  it was too much for me and taking advantage of the confusion that followed i left the tragical scene as fast as possible  a little farther on i was shocked to see a goose dragging an old man down some steps that led to a little house  dear me whats the matter here i cried  he wont say his prayers screamed the goose  but perhaps he was never taught said i  its never too late to learn hes had his chance he wont be pious and good so away with him dont interfere whatever you do hold your tongue and go about your business scolded the goose who certainly had a dreadful temper  i dared say no more and when the poor old man had been driven away by this foul proceeding i went up the steps and peeped in for i heard some one crying and thought the cross bird perhaps had hurt some one else a little old woman stood there wringing her hands in great distress while a small dog was barking at her with all his might  bless me the fashions have got even here thought i for the old woman was dressed in the latest styleor rather she had overdone it sadly for her gown was nearly up to her knees and she was nearly as ridiculous an object as some of the young ladies i had seen at home she had a respectable bonnet on however instead of a straw saucer and her hair was neatly put under a capnot made into a knob on the top of her head  my dear soul whats the trouble said i quite touched by her tears  lud a mercy maam ive been to market with my butter and eggsfor the price of both is so high one can soon get rich nowadaysand being tired i stopped to rest a bit but fell asleep by the road somebodyi think its a rogue of a peddler who sold me wooden nutmegs and a clock that wouldnt go and some pans that came to bits the first time i used themsomebody cut my new gown and petticoat off all round in the shameful way you see i thought i never should get home for i was such a fright i actually didnt know myself but thinks i my doggy will know me and then i shall be sure im i and not some boldfaced creature in short skirts but oh maam doggy dont know me and i aint myself and i dont know what to do  hes a foolish little beast so dont mind him but have a cup of tea and go to bed you can make your gown decent tomorrow and if i see the tricksy peddler ill give him a scolding  this seemed to comfort the old woman though doggy still barked  my next neighbor has a dog who never behaves in this way she said as she put her teapot on the coals hes a remarkable beast and youd better stop to see him as you pass maam hes always up to some funny prank or other  i said i would and as i went by the next house i took a look in at the window the closet was empty i observed but the dog sat smoking a pipe looking as grave as a judge  where is your mistress asked i  gone for some tripe answered the dog politely taking the pipe out of his mouth and adding i hope the smoke doesnt annoy you  i dont approve of smoking said i  sorry to hear it said the dog coolly  i was going to lecture him on this bad habit but i saw his mistress coming with a dish in her hand and fearing she might think me rude to peep in at her windows i walked on wondering what we were coming to when even fourlegged puppies smoked  at the door of the next little house i saw a marketwagon loaded with vegetables and a smart young pig just driving it away i had heard of this interesting family and took a look as i passed by a second tidy pig sat blowing the fire and a third was eating roastbeef as if he had just come in from his work the fourth i was grieved to see looked very sulky for it was evident he had been naughty and so lost his dinner the little pig was at the door crying to get in and it was sweet to see how kindly the others let him in wiped his tears tied on his bib and brought him his bread and milk i was very glad to see these young orphans doing so well and i knew my friends at home would enjoy hearing from them  a loud scream made me jump and the sudden splash of water made me run along without stopping to pick up a boy and girl who came tumbling down the hill with an empty pail bumping their heads as they rolled smelling something nice and feeling hungry i stepped into a large room near bya sort of eatinghouse i fancy for various parties seemed to be enjoying themselves in their different ways a small boy sat near the door eating a large pie and he gave me a fine plum which he had just pulled out at one table was a fat gentleman cutting another pie which had a dark crust through which appeared the heads of a flock of birds all singing gayly  theres no end to the improvements in cooking and no accounting for tastes i added looking at a handsomelydressed lady who sat near eating bread and honey  as i passed this party i saw behind the ladys chair a maid with a clothespin in her hand and no nose she sobbingly told me a bird had nipped it off and i gave her a bit of courtplaster which i fortunately had in my pocket  another couple were dividing their meat in a queer way for one took all the fat and the other all the lean the next people were odder still for the man looked rather guilty and seemed to be hiding a threepeck measure under his chair while he waited for his wife to bring on some cold barleypudding which to my surprise she was frying herself i also saw a queer moonstrucklooking man inquiring the way to norridge and another man making wry faces over some plumpudding with which he had burnt his mouth because his friend came down too soon  i ordered peaseporridge hot and they brought it cold but i didnt wait for any thing else being in a hurry to see all there was to be seen on this strange island feeling refreshed i strolled on passing a jolly old gentleman smoking and drinking while three fiddlers played before him as i turned into a road that led toward a hill a little boy riding a dapplegray pony and an old lady on a white horse with bells ringing somewhere trotted by me followed by a little girl who wished to know where she could buy a penny bun i told her the best were at newmarchs in bedford street and she ran on much pleased but im afraid she never found that best of bakeshops i was going quietly along when the sound of another horse coming made me look round and there i saw a dreadful sighta wild horse tearing over the ground with fiery eyes and streaming tail on his back sat a crazy man beating him with a broom a crazy woman was behind him with her bonnet on wrong side before holding one crazy child in her lap while another stood on the horse a third was hanging on by one foot and all were howling at the top of their voices as they rushed by i scrambled over the wall to get out of the way and there i saw more curious sights two blind men were sitting on the grass trying to see two lame men who were hobbling along as hard as they could and near by a bull was fighting a bee in the most violent manner this rather alarmed me and i scrambled back into the road again just as a very fine lady jumped over a barberrybush near by and a gentleman went flying after with a ring in one hand and a stick in the other  what very odd people they have here i thought close by was a tidy little house under the hill and in it a tidy little woman who sold things to eat being rather hungry in spite of my porridge i bought a baked apple and a cranberrypie for she said they were good and i found she told the truth as i sat eating my pie some dogs began to bark and by came a troop of beggars some in rags and some in old velvet gowns a drunken grenadier was with them who wanted a pot of beer but as he had no money the old woman sent him about his business  on my way up the hill i saw a little boy crying over a dead pig and his sister who seemed to be dead also i asked his name and he sobbed out johnny pringle maam and went on crying so hard i could do nothing to comfort him while i stood talking to him a sudden gust of wind blew up the road and down came the bough of a tree and to my surprise a cradle with a baby in it also the baby screamed dreadfully and i didnt know how to quiet it so i ran back to the old woman and left it with her asking if that was the way babies were taken care of there  bless you my dear its ma is making pattycakes and put it up there to be out of the way of tom tinkers dog ill soon hush it up said the old woman and trotting it on her knee she began to sing      hey my kitten my kitten     hey my kitten my deary  feeling that the child was in good hands i hurried away for i saw something was going on upon the hilltop when i got to the hilltop i was shocked to find some people tossing an old woman in a blanket i begged them to stop but one of the men who i found was a welchman by the name of taffy told me the old lady liked it  but why does she like it i asked in great surprise  tom the pipers son will tell you its my turn to toss now said the man  why you see maam said tom she is one of those dreadfully nice old women who are always fussing and scrubbing and worrying people to death with everlastingly cleaning house now and then we get so tired out with her that we propose to her to clean the sky itself she likes that and as this is the only way we can get her up we toss till she sticks somewhere and then leave her to sweep cobwebs till she is ready to come back and behave herself  well that is the oddest thing i ever heard i know just such an old lady and when i go home ill try your plan it seems to me that you have a great many queer old ladies on this island i said to another man whom they called peter and who stood eating pumpkin all the time  well we do have rather a nice collection but you havent seen the best of all we expect her every minute and margery daw is to let us know the minute she lights on the island replied peter with his mouth full  lights said i you speak as if she flew  she rides on a bird hurrah the old sweeper has lit now the cobwebs will fly dont hurry back shouted the man and a faint faroff voice answered i shall be back again by and by  the people folded up the blanket looking much relieved and i was examining a very odd house which was built by an ancient king called boggen when margery daw a dirty little girl came up the hill screaming at the top of her voice  shes come shes come  every one looked up and i saw a large white bird slowly flying over the island on its back sat the nicest old woman that ever was seen all the others were nothing compared to her she had a pointed hat on over her cap a red cloak highheeled shoes and a crutch in her hand she smiled and nodded as the bird approached and every one ran and nodded and screamed welcome welcome mother  as soon as she touched the ground she was so surrounded that i could only see the top of her hat for hundreds and hundreds of little children suddenly appeared like a great flock of birdsrosy happy pretty children but all looked unreal and among them i saw some who looked like little people i had known long ago  who are they i asked of a bonny lass who was sitting on a cushion eating strawberries and cream  they are the phantoms of all the little people who ever read and loved our mothers songs said the maid  what did she write i asked feeling very queer and as if i was going to remember something  songs that are immortal and you have them in your hand replied the bonny maid smiling at my stupidity  i looked and there on the cover of the book i had been reading so busily when the tide carried me away i saw the words mother gooses melodies i was so delighted that i had seen her i gave a shout and tried to get near enough to hug and kiss the dear old soul as the swarm of children were doing but my cry woke me and i was so sorry to find it all a dream     xi  fancys friend   it was a wagon shaped like a great square basket on low wheels and drawn by a stout donkey there was one seat on which miss fairbairn the governess sat and all round her leaning over the edge of the basket were children with little wooden shovels and baskets in their hands going down to play on the beach away they went over the common through the stony lane out upon the wide smooth sands all the children but one immediately fell to digging holes and making ponds castles or forts they did this every day and were never tired of it but little fancy made new games for herself and seldom dug in the sand she had a garden of seaweed which the waves watered every day she had a palace of pretty shells where she kept all sorts of little watercreatures as fairy tenants she had friends and playmates among the gulls and peeps and learned curious things by watching crabs horseshoes and jellyfishes and every day she looked for a mermaid  it was of no use to tell her that there were no mermaids fancy firmly believed in them and was sure she would see one some day the other children called the seals mermaids and were contented with the queer shiny creatures who played in the water lay on the rocks and peeped at them with soft bright eyes as they sailed by fancy was not satisfied with sealsthey were not pretty and graceful enough for herand she waited and watched for a real mermaid on this day she took a breezy run with the beachbirds along the shore she planted a pretty red weed in her garden and let out the waterbeetles and snails who had passed the night in her palace then she went to a rock that stood near the quiet nook where she played alone and sat there looking for a mermaid as the tide came in for it brought her many curious things and it might perhaps bring a mermaid  as she looked across the waves that came tumbling one over the other she saw something that was neither boat nor buoy nor seal it was a queerlooking thing with a wild head a long waving tail and something like arms that seemed to paddle it along the waves tumbled it about so fancy could not see very well but the longer she looked the surer she was that this curious thing was a mermaid and she waited eagerly for it to reach the shore nearer and nearer it came till a great wave threw it upon the sand and fancy saw that it was only a long piece of kelp torn up by the roots she was very much disappointed but all of a sudden her face cleared up she clapped her hands and began to dance round the kelp saying  ill make a mermaid myself since none will come to me  away she ran higher up the beach and after thinking a minute began her work choosing a smooth hard place she drew with a stick the outline of her mermaid then she made the hair of the brown marshgrass growing near by arranging it in long locks on either side the face which was made of her prettiest pink and white shellsfor she pulled down her palace to get them the eyes were two gray pebbles the neck and arms of larger white shells and the dress of seaweedred green purple and yellow very splendid for fancy emptied her garden to dress her mermaid  people say that mermaids always have tails and i might make one out of this great leaf of kelp but it isnt pretty and i dont like it for i want mine to be beautiful so i wont have any tail said fancy and put two slender white shells for feet at the lower edge of the fringed skirt she laid a wreath of little starfish across the brown hair a belt of small orangecrabs round the waist buttoned the dress with violet snailshells and hung a tiny white pebble like a pearl in either ear  now she must have a glass and a comb in her hand as the song says and then she will be done said fancy looking about her well pleased  presently she found the skeleton of a little fish and his backbone made an excellent comb while a transparent jellyfish served for a glass with a frame of cockleshells round it placing these in the hands of her mermaid and some red coral bracelets on her wrists fancy pronounced her done and danced about her singing      my pretty little mermaid       oh come and play with me     ill love you ill welcome you       and happy we shall be  now while she had been working the tide had crept higher and higher and as she sung one wave ran up and wet her feet  oh what a pity i didnt put her farther up cried fancy the tide will wash her all away and i meant to keep her fresh and show her to aunt fiction my poor mermaidi shall lose her but perhaps she will be happier in the sea so i will let her go  mounting her rock fancy waited to see her work destroyed but the sea seemed to pity her and wave after wave came up without doing any harm at last one broke quite over the mermaid and fancy thought that would be the end of her but no instead of scattering shells stones and weeds the waves lifted the whole figure without displacing any thing and gently bore it back into the sea  good by good by cried fancy as the little figure floated away then as it disappeared she put her hands before her facefor she loved her mermaid and had given all her treasures to adorn her and now to lose her so soon seemed hardand fancys eyes were full of tears another great wave came rolling in but she did not look up to see it break and a minute after she heard steps tripping toward her over the sand still she did not stir for just then none of her playmates could take the place of her new friend and she didnt want to see them  fancy fancy called a breezy voice sweeter than any she had ever heard but she did not raise her head nor care to know who called the steps came quite close and the touch of a cold wet hand fell on her own then she looked up and saw a strange little girl standing by her who smiled showing teeth like little pearls and said in the breezy voice  you wanted me to play with you so i came  who are you asked fancy wondering where she had seen the child before  im your mermaid said the child  but the water carried her away cried fancy  the waves only carried me out for the sea to give me life and then brought me back to you answered the new comer  but are you really a mermaid asked fancy beginning to smile and believe  i am really the one you made look and see if im not and the little creature turned slowly round that fancy might be sure it was her own work  she certainly was very like the figure that once lay on the sandonly she was not now made of stones and shells there was the long brown hair blowing about her face with a wreath of starry shells in it her eyes were gray her cheeks and lips rosy her neck and arms white and from under her striped dress peeped little bare feet she had pearls in her ears coral bracelets a golden belt and a glass and comb in her hands  yes said fancy drawing near you are my little mermaid but how does it happen that you come to me at last  dear friend answered the waterchild you believed in me watched and waited long for me shaped the image of the thing you wanted out of your dearest treasures and promised to love and welcome me i could not help coming and the sea that is as fond of you as you are of it helped me to grant your wish  oh im glad im glad dear little mermaid what is your name cried fancy kissing the cool cheek of her new friend and putting her arms about her neck  call me by my german cousins pretty namelorelei answered the mermaid kissing back as warmly as she could  will you come home and live with me dear lorelei asked fancy still holding her fast  if you will promise to tell no one who and what i am i will stay with you as long as you love and believe in me as soon as you betray me or lose your faith and fondness i shall vanish never to come back again answered lorelei  i promise but wont people wonder who you are and if they ask me what shall i say said fancy  tell them you found me on the shore and leave the rest to me but you must not expect other people to like and believe in me as you do they will say hard things of me will blame you for loving me and try to part us can you bear this and keep your promise faithfully  i think i can but why wont they like you said fancy looking troubled  because they are not like you dear answered the mermaid with salt tears in her soft eyes they have not your power of seeing beauty in all things of enjoying invisible delights and living in a world of your own your aunt fiction will like me but your uncle fact wont he will want to know all about me will think im a little vagabond and want me to be sent away somewhere to be made like other children i shall keep out of his way as much as i can for im afraid of him  ill take care of you lorelei dear and no one shall trouble you i hear miss fairbairn calling so i must go give me your hand and dont be afraid  hand in hand the two went toward the other children who stopped digging and stared at the new child miss fairbairn who was very wise and good but rather prim stared too and said with surprise  why my dear where did you find that queer child  down on the beach isnt she pretty answered fancy feeling very proud of her new friend  she hasnt got any shoes on so shes a beggar and we mustnt play with her said one boy who had been taught that to be poor was a very dreadful thing  what pretty earrings and bracelets shes got said a little girl who thought a great deal of her dress  she doesnt look as if she knew much said another child who was kept studying so hard that she never had time to dig and run and make dirtpies till she fell ill and had to be sent to the seaside  whats your name and who are your parents asked miss fairbairn  ive got no parents and my name is lorelei answered the mermaiden  you mean luly mind your pronunciation child said miss fairbairn who corrected every one she met in something or other where do you live  i havent got any home now said lorelei smiling at the ladys tone  yes you have my home is yours and you are going to stay with me always cried fancy heartily she is my little sister miss fairbairn i found her and im going to keep her and make her happy  your uncle wont like it my dear and miss fairbairn shook her head gravely  aunt will and uncle wont mind if i learn my lessons well and remember the multiplication table all right he was going to give me some money so i might learn to keep accounts but ill tell him to keep the money and let me have lorelei instead  oh how silly cried the boy who didnt like bare feet  no she isnt for if shes kind to the girl maybe shell get some of her pretty things said the vain little girl  keeping accounts is a very useful and important thing i keep mine and mamma says i have great arthmetical talent added the pale child who studied too much  come children its time for dinner fancy you can take the girl to the house and your uncle will do what he thinks best about letting you keep her said miss fairbairn piling them into the basketwagon  fancy kept lorelei close beside her and as soon as they reached the great hotel where they all were staying with mothers and fathers uncles or aunts she took her to kind aunt fiction who was interested at once in the friendless child so mysteriously found she was satisfied with the little she could discover and promised to keep herfor a time at least  we can imagine all kinds of romantic things about her and by and by some interesting story may be found out concerning her i can make her useful in many ways and she shall stay  as aunt fiction laid her hand on the mermaids head as if claiming her for her own uncle fact came stalking in with his notebook in his hand and his spectacles on his nose now though they were married these two persons were very unlike aunt fiction was a graceful picturesque woman who told stories charmingly wrote poetry and novels was very much beloved by young folks and was the friend of some of the most famous people in the world uncle fact was a grim grave decided man whom it was impossible to bend or change he was very useful to every one knew an immense deal and was always taking notes of things he saw and heard to be put in a great encyclopædia he was making he didnt like romance loved the truth and wanted to get to the bottom of every thing he was always trying to make little fancy more sober wellbehaved and learned for she was a freakish dreamy yet very lovable and charming child aunt fiction petted her to her hearts content and might have done her harm if uncle fact had not had a hand in her education for the lessons of both were necessary to her as to all of us  well well well who is this he said briskly as he turned his keen eyes and powerful glasses on the new comer  aunt fiction told him all the children had said but he answered impatiently  tut tut my dear i want the facts of the case you are apt to exaggerate and fancy is not to be relied on if the child isnt a fool she must know more about herself than she pretends now answer truly luly where did you come from  but the little mermaid only shook her head and answered as before fancy found me on the beach and wants me to stay with her ill do her no harm please let me stay  she has evidently been washed ashore from some wreck and has forgotten all about herself her wonderful beauty her accent and these ornaments show that she is some foreign child said aunt fiction pointing to the earrings  nonsense my dear those are white pebbles not pearls and if you examine them you will find that those bracelets are the ones you gave fancy as a reward for so well remembering the facts i told her about coral said the uncle who had turned lorelei round and round pinched her cheek felt her hair and examined her frock through the glasses which nothing escaped  she may stay and be my little playmate maynt she ill take care of her and we shall be very happy together cried fancy eagerly  one cant be sure of that till one has tried you say you will take care of her have you got any money to pay her board and buy her clothes asked her uncle  no but i thought youd help me answered fancy wistfully  never say youll do a thing till you are sure you can said uncle fact as he took notes of the affair thinking they might be useful by and by ive no objection to your keeping the girl if after making inquiries about her she proves to be a clever child she can stay awhile and when we go back to town ill put her in one of our charity schools where she can be taught to earn her living can you read luly  no said the mermaid opening her eyes  can you write and cipher  what is that asked lorelei innocently  dear me what ignorance cried uncle fact  can you sew or tend babies asked aunt fiction gently  i can do nothing but play and sing and comb my hair  i see i seesome handorgan mans girl well im glad you keep your hair smooththats more than fancy does said uncle fact  let us hear you sing whispered his little niece and in a voice as musical as the sound of ripples breaking on the shore lorelei sung a little song that made fancy dance with delight charmed aunt fiction and softened uncle facts hard face in spite of himself  very well very well indeed you have a good voice ill see that you have proper teaching and by and by you can get your living by giving singinglessons he said turning over the leaves of his book to look for the name of a skilful teacher for he had lists of every useful person place and thing under the sun  lorelei laughed at the idea and fancy thought singing for gold not love a hard way to get ones living  inquiries were made but nothing more was discovered and neither of the children would speak so the strange child lived with fancy and made her very happy the other children didnt care much about her for with them she was shy and cold because she knew if the truth was told they would not believe in her fancy had always played a good deal by herself because she never found a mate to suit her now she had one and they enjoyed each other very much lorelei taught her many things besides new games and aunt fiction was charmed with the pretty stories fancy repeated to her while uncle fact was astonished at the knowledge of marine plants and animals which she gained without any books lorelei taught her to swim like a fish and the two played such wonderful pranks in the water that people used to come down to the beach when they bathed in return fancy tried to teach her friend to read and write and sew but lorelei couldnt learn much though she loved her little teacher dearly and every evening sung her to sleep with beautiful lullabies  there was a great deal of talk about the curious stranger for her ways were odd and no one knew what to make of her she would eat nothing but fruit and shellfish and drink nothing but salt water she didnt like tight clothes but would have run about in a loose green robe with bare feet and flying hair if uncle fact would have allowed it morning noon and night she plunged into the seano matter what the weather might be and she would sleep on no bed but one stuffed with dried seaweed she made lovely chains of shells found splendid bits of coral and dived where no one else dared to bring up wonderful plants and mosses people offered money for these things but she gave them all to fancy and aunt fiction of whom she was very fond it was curious to see the sort of people who liked both fancy and her friendpoets artists delicate thoughtful children and a few old people who had kept their hearts young in spite of care and time and trouble dashing young gentlemen fine young ladies worldlyminded and moneyloving men and women and artificial unchildlike children the two friends avoided carefully and these persons either made fun of them neglected them entirely or seemed to be unconscious that they were alive the others they knew at a glance for their faces warmed and brightened when the children came they listened to their songs and stories joined in their plays and found rest and refreshment in their sweet society  this will do for a time as fancy is getting strong and not entirely wasting her days thanks to me but our holiday is nearly over and as soon as i get back to town ill take that child to the ragged refuge and see what they can make of her said uncle fact who was never quite satisfied about lorelei because he could find out so little concerning her he was walking over the beach as he said this after a hard days work on his encyclopædia he sat down on a rock in a quiet place and instead of enjoying the lovely sunset he fell to studying the course of the clouds the state of the tide and the temperature of the air till the sound of voices made him peep over the rock fancy and her friend were playing there and the old gentleman waited to see what they were about both were sitting with their little bare feet in the water lorelei was stringing pearls and fancy plaiting a crown of pretty green rushes  i wish i could go home and get you a string of finer pearls than these said lorelei but it is too far away and i cannot swim now as i used to do  i must look into this the girl evidently knows all about herself and can tell if she chooses muttered uncle fact getting rather excited over this discovery  never mind the pearls id rather have you dear said fancy lovingly tell me a story while we work or sing me a song and ill give you my crown  ill sing you a little song that has got what your uncle calls a moral to it said lorelei laughing mischievously then in her breezy little voice she sang the story of  the rock and the bubble          oh a bare brown rock           stood up in the sea         the waves at its feet           dancing merrily          a little bubble           came sailing by         and thus to the rock           did it gayly cry          ho clumsy brown stone           quick make way for me         im the fairest thing           that floats on the sea          see my rainbowrobe           see my crown of light         my glittering form           so airy and bright          oer the waters blue           im floating away         to dance by the shore           with the foam and spray          now make way make way           for the waves are strong         and their rippling feet           bear me fast along          but the great rock stood           straight up in the sea         it looked gravely down           and said pleasantly          little friend you must           go some other way         for i have not stirred           this many a long day          great billows have dashed           and angry winds blown         but my sturdy form           is not overthrown          nothing can stir me           in the air or sea         then how can i move           little friend for thee          then the waves all laughed           in their voices sweet         and the seabirds looked           from their rocky seat          at the bubble gay           who angrily cried         while its round cheek glowed           with a foolish pride          you shall move for me           and you shall not mock         at the words i say           you ugly rough rock          be silent wild birds           why stare you so         stop laughing rude waves           and help me to go          for i am the queen           of the ocean here         and this cruel stone           cannot make me fear          dashing fiercely up           with a scornful word         foolish bubble broke           but rock never stirred          then said the seabirds           sitting in their nests         to the little ones           leaning on their breasts          be not like bubble           headstrong rude and vain         seeking by violence           your object to gain          but be like the rock           steadfast true and strong         yet cheerful and kind           and firm against wrong          heed little birdlings           and wiser youll be         for the lesson learned           today by the sea  well to be sure the song has got a moral if that silly fancy only sees it said uncle fact popping up his bald head again as the song ended  i thank you thats a good little song for me but lorelei are you sorry you came to be my friend cried fancy for as she bent to lay the crown on the others head she saw that she was looking wistfully down into the water that kissed her feet  not yet while you love me i am happy and never regret that i ceased to be a mermaid for your sake answered lorelei laying her soft cheek against her friends  how happy i was the day my playmermaid changed to a real one said fancy i often want to tell people all about that wonderful thing and let them know who you really are then theyd love you as i do instead of calling you a little vagabond  few would believe our story and those that did would wonder at menot love me as you do they would put me in a cage and make a show of me and i should be so miserable i should die so dont tell who i am will you said lorelei earnestly  never cried fancy clinging to her but my deary what will you do when uncle sends you away from me as he means to do as soon as we go home i can see you sometimes but we cannot be always together and there is no ocean for you to enjoy in the city  i shall bear it if i can for your sake if i cannot i shall come back here and wait till you come again next year  no no i will not be parted from you and if uncle takes you away ill come here and be a mermaid with you cried fancy  the little friends threw their arms about each other and were so full of their own feelings that they never saw uncle facts tall shadow flit across them as he stole away over the soft sand poor old gentleman he was in a sad state of mind and didnt know what to do for in all his long life he had never been so puzzled before  a mermaid indeed he muttered i always thought that child was a fool and now im sure of it she thinks she is a mermaid and has made fancy believe it ive told my wife a dozen times that she let fancy read too many fairy tales and wonderbooks her head is full of nonsense and she is just ready to believe any ridiculous story that is told her now what on earth shall i do if i put luly in an asylum fancy will break her heart and very likely they will both run away if i leave them together luly will soon make fancy as crazy as she is herself and i shall be mortified by having a niece who insists that her playmate is a mermaid bless my soul how absurd it all is  aunt fiction had gone to town to see her publishers about a novel she had written and he didnt like to tell the queer story to any one else so uncle fact thought it over and decided to settle the matter at once when the children came in he sent fancy to wait for him in the library while he talked alone with lorelei he did his best but he could do nothing with hershe danced and laughed and told the same tale as before till the old gentleman confessed that he had heard their talk on the rocks then she grew very sad and owned that she was a mermaid this made him angry and he wouldnt believe it for an instant but told her it was impossible and she must say something else  lorelei could say nothing else and wept bitterly when he would not listen so he locked her up and went to fancy who felt as if something dreadful was going to happen when she saw his face he told her all he knew and insisted that lorelei was foolish or naughty to persist in such a ridiculous story  but uncle i really did make a mermaid and she really did come alive for i saw the figure float away and then lorelei appeared said fancy very earnestly  its very likely you made a figure and called it a mermaid it would be just the sort of thing youd do said her uncle but it is impossible that any coming alive took place and i wont hear any such nonsense you didnt see this girl come out of the water for she says you never looked up till she touched you she was a real child who came over the beach from somewhere and you fancied she looked like your figure and believed the silly tale she told you it is my belief that she is a sly bad child and the sooner she is sent away the better for you  uncle fact was so angry and talked so loud that fancy felt frightened and bewildered and began to think he might be right about the mermaid part though she hated to give up the little romance  if i agree that she is a real child wont you let her stay uncle she said forgetting that if she lost her faith her friend was lost also  ah then you have begun to come to your senses have you and are ready to own that you dont believe in mermaids and such rubbish cried uncle fact stopping in his tramp up and down the room  why if you say there never were and never can be any i suppose i must give up my fancy but im sorry sighed the child  thats my sensible girl now think a minute my dear and you will also own that it is best to give up the child as well as the mermaid said her uncle briskly  oh no we love one another and she is good and i cant give her up cried fancy  answer me a few questions and ill prove that she isnt good that you dont love her and that you can give her up said uncle fact and numbered off the questions on his fingers as he spoke  didnt luly want you to deceive us and every one else about who she was  yes sir  dont you like to be with her better than with your aunt or myself  yes sir  hadnt you rather hear her songs and stories than learn your lessons  yes sir  isnt it wrong to deceive people to love strangers more than those who are a father and mother to you and to like silly tales better than useful lessons  yes sir  very well then dont you see that if luly makes you do these wrong and ungrateful things she is not a good child nor a fit playmate for you  fancy didnt answer for she couldnt feel that it was so though he made it seem so when uncle fact talked in that way she always got confused and gave up for she didnt know how to argue he was right in a certain way but she felt as if she was right also in another way though she could not prove it so she hung her head and let her tears drop on the carpet one by one  uncle fact didnt mean to be unkind but he did mean to have his own way and when he saw the little girls sad face he took her on his knee and said more mildly  do you remember the story about the german lorelei who sung so sweetly and lured people to death in the rhine  yes uncle and i like it answered fancy looking up  well my dear your lorelei will lead you into trouble if you follow her suppose she is what you think hera mermaid it is her delight to draw people into the water where of course they drown if she is what i think hera sly bad child who sees that you are very simple and who means to get taken care of without doing any thing usefulshe will spoil you in a worse way than if you followed her into the sea ive got no little daughter of my own and i want to keep you as safe and happy as if you were mine i dont like this girl and i want you to give her up for my sake will you fancy  while her uncle said these things all the beauty seemed to fall away from her friend all the sweetness from their love and all her faith in the little dream which had made her so happy mermaids became treacherous unlovely unreal creatures and lorelei seemed like a naughty selfish child who deceived her and made her do wrong things her uncle had been very kind to her all her life and she loved him was grateful and wanted to show that she was by pleasing him but her heart clung to the friend she had made trusted and loved and it seemed impossible to give up the shadow even though the substance was gone she put her hands before her face for a moment then laid her arms about the old mans neck and whispered with a little sob  ill give her up but youll be kind to her because i was fond of her once  as the last word left fancys lips a long sad cry sounded through the room lorelei sprung in gave her one kiss and was seen to run swiftly toward the beach wringing her hands fancy flew after but when she reached the shore there was nothing to be seen but the scattered pebbles shells and weeds that made the mock mermaid floating away on a receding wave  do you believe now cried fancy weeping bitterly as she pointed to the wreck of her friend and turned reproachfully toward uncle fact who had followed in great astonishment  the old gentleman looked well about him then shook his head and answered decidedly  no my dear i dont its an odd affair but ive no doubt it will be cleared up in a natural way sometime or other  but there he was mistaken for this mystery never was cleared up other people soon forgot it and fancy never spoke of it yet she made very few friends and though she learned to love and value uncle fact as well as aunt fiction she could not forget her dearest playmate year after year she came back to the seaside and the first thing she always did was to visit the place where she used to play and stretch her arms toward the sea crying tenderly  o my little friend come back to me  but lorelei never came again   the
