instant dickory was there 403     kate bonnet     chapter i  two young people a ship and a fish   the month was september and the place was in the neighbourhood of bridgetown in the island of barbadoes the seventeenth century was not seventeen years old but the girl who walked slowly down to the river bank was three years its senior she carried a fishingrod and line and her name was kate bonnet she was a brightfaced quickmoving young person and apparently did not expect to catch many fish for she had no basket in which to carry away her finny prizes nor apparently did she have any bait except that which was upon her hook and which had been affixed there by one of the servants at her home not far away in fact mistress kate was too nicely dressed and her gloves were too clean to have much to do with fish or bait but she seated herself on a little rock in a shady spot not far from the water and threw forth her line then she gazed about her a little up the river and a good deal down the river  it was truly a pleasant scene which lay before her eyes not half a mile away was the bridge which gave this english settlement its name and beyond the river were woods and cultivated fields with here and there a little bit of smoke for it was growing late in the afternoon when smoke meant supper beyond all this the land rose from the lower ground near the river and the sea in terrace after terrace until the upper stretches of its woodlands showed clear against the evening sky  but mistress kate bonnet now gazed steadily down the stream beyond the town and the bridge and paid no more attention to the scenery than the scenery did to her although one was quite as beautiful as the other  there was a bunch of white flowers in the hat of the young girl not a very large one and not a very small one but of such a size as might be easily seen from the bridge had any one happened to be crossing about that time and in fact as the wearer of the hat and the white flowers still continued to gaze at the bridge she saw some one come out upon it with a quick buoyant step and then she saw him stop and gaze steadily up the river at this she turned her head and her eyes went out over the beautiful landscape and the wide terraces rising above each other towards the sky  it is astonishing how soon after this a young man dressed in a brown suit and very pleasant to look upon came rapidly walking along the river bank this was master martin newcombe a young englishman not two years from his native land and now a prosperous farmer on the other side of the river  it often happened that master newcombe at the close of his agricultural labours would put on a good suit of clothes and ride over the bridge to the town to attend to business or to social duties as the case might be but sometimes not willing to encumber himself with a horse he walked over the bridge and strolled or hurried along the river bank this was one of the times in which he hurried he had been caught by the vision of the bunch of white flowers in the hat of the girl who was seated on the rock in the shade  as master newcombe stepped near his spirits rose as they had not always risen as he approached mistress kate for he perceived that although she held the handle of her rod in her hand the other end of it was lying on the ground not very far away from the bait and the hook which it was very plain had not been in the water at all she must have been thinking of something else besides fishing he thought but he did not dare to go on with that sort of thinking in the way he would have liked to do it he had not too great a belief in himself though he was very much in love with kate bonnet  is this the best time of day for fishing master newcombe she said without rising or offering him her hand for my part i dont believe it is  he smiled as he threw his hat upon the ground let me put your line a little farther out and so saying he took the rod from her hand and stepped between her and the bait which must have been now quite hot from lying so long in a bit of sunshine he rearranged the bait and threw the line far out into the river then he gave her the rod again he seated himself on the ground nearby  this is the second time i have been over the bridge today he said and this morning very early i saw for the first time your fathers ship which was lying below the town it is a fine vessel so far as i can judge being a landsman  yes said she and i have been on board of her and have gone all over her and have seen many things which are queer and strange to me but the strangest thing about her to my mind being a landswoman is that she should belong to my father there are many things which he has not which it would be easy to believe he would like to have but that a ship with sails and anchors and hatchways should be one of these things it is hard to imagine  young newcombe thought it was impossible to imagine but he expressed himself discreetly  it must be that he is going to engage in trade he said has he not told you of his intentions  not much said she he says he is going to cruise about among the islands and when i asked him if he would take me he laughed and answered that he might do so but that i must never say a word of it to madam bonnet for if she heard of it she might change his plans  the wicked young man found himself almost wishing that the somewhat badtempered madam bonnet might hear of and change any plan which might take her husbands daughter from this town especially in a vessel for vessels were always terribly tardy when any one was waiting for their return and besides it often happened that vessels never came back at all  i shall take a little trip with him even if we dont go far it would be ridiculous for my father to own a ship and for me never to sail in her  that would not be so bad said master martin feeling that a short absence might be endured moreover if a little pleasure trip were to be made it was reasonable enough to suppose that other people not belonging to the bonnet family might be asked to sail as guests  what my father expects to trade in said she contemplatively gazing before her i am sure i do not know it cannot be horses or cattle for he has not enough of them to make such a venture profitable and as to sugarcane or anything from his farm i am sure he has a good enough market here for all he has to sell certainly he does not produce enough to make it necessary for him to buy a ship in order to carry them away  it is opined said martin by the people of the town that major bonnet intends to become a commercial man and to carry away to the other islands and perhaps to the old country itself the goods of other people  now that would be fine said mistress kate her eyes sparkling for i should then surely go with him and would see the world and perhaps london and her face flushed with the prospect  martins face did not flush but if your fathers ship sailed on a long voyage he said with a suspicion of apprehension he would not sail with her he would send her under the charge of others  the girl shook her head when she sails said she he sails in her if you had heard him talking as i have heard him you would not doubt that and if he sails i sail  martins soul grew quite sad there were very good reasons to believe that this dear girl might sail away from bridgetown and from him she might come back to the town but she might not come back to him  mistress kate said he looking very earnestly at her do you know that such speech as this makes my heart sink you know i love you i have told you so before if you were to sail away i care not to what port this world would be a black place for me  that is like a lover she exclaimed a little pertly it is like them all every man of them they must have what they want and they must have it no matter who else may suffer  he rose and stood by her  but i dont want you to suffer he said do you think it would be suffering to live with one who loved you who would spend his whole life in making you happy who would look upon you as the chief thing in the world and have no other ambition than to make himself worthy of you  she looked up at him with a little smile  that would doubtless be all very pleasant for you she said and in order that you might be pleased you would have her give up so much that is the way with men now here am i born in the very end of the last century and having had consequently no good out of that and with but seventeen years in this century and most of it passed in girlhood and in school and now when the world might open before me for a little here you come along and tell me all that you would like to have and that you would like me to give up  but you should not think said he and that was all he said for at that moment kate bonnet felt a little jerk at the end of her line and then a good strong pull  i have a fish she cried and sprang to her feet then with a swoop she threw into the midst of the weeds and wild flowers a struggling fish which martin hastened to take from the hook  a fine fellow he cried and he has arrived just in time to make a dainty dish for your supper  ah no she said winding the line about her rod if i were to take that fish to the house it would sorely disturb madam bonnet she would object to my catching it she would object to having it prepared for the table she would object to having it eaten when she had arranged that we should eat something else no i will give it to you master newcombe i suppose in your house you can cook and eat what you please  yes said he but how delightful it would be if we could eat it together  meaning said she that i should never eat other fish than those from this river no sir that may not be i have a notion that the first foreign fish i shall eat will be found in the island of jamaica for my father said that possibly he might first take a trip there where lives my mothers brother whom we have not seen for a long time but as i told you before nobody must know this and now i must go to my supper and you must take yours home with you  and i am sure it will be the sweetest fish he said that was ever caught in all these waters but i beg before you go you will promise me one thing  promise you said she quite loftily  yes he answered tell me that no matter where you go you will not leave bridgetown without letting me know of it  i will not indeed said she and if it is to jamaica we go perhaps my fatherbut no i dont believe he will do that he will be too much wrapped up in his ship to want for company to whom he must attend and talk  ah there would be no need of that said newcombe with a lovers smile  she smiled back at him  goodnight she said and see to it that you eat your fish tonight while it is so fresh then she ran up the winding path to her home  he stood and looked after her until she had disappeared among the shrubbery after which he walked away  i should have said more than i did he reflected seldom have i had so good a chance to speak and urge my case it was that confounded ship her mind is all for that and not for me     chapter ii  a fruitbasket and a friend   major stede bonnet the father of kate whose mother had died when the child was but a year old was a middleaged englishman of a fair estate in the island of barbadoes he had been an officer in the army was well educated and intelligent and now in vigorous middle life had become a confirmed country gentleman his herds and his crops were to him the principal things on earth with the exception of his daughter for although he had married for the second time there were a good many things which he valued more than his wife and it had therefore occasioned a good deal of surprise and more or less small talk among his neighbours that major bonnet should want to buy a ship but he had been a soldier in his youth and soldiers are very apt to change their manner of living and so if major bonnet had grown tired of his farm and had determined to go into commercial enterprises it was not perhaps a very amazing thing that a military man who had turned planter should now turn to be something else  madam bonnet had heard of the ship although she had not been told anything about her stepdaughter taking a trip in her and if she had heard she might not have objected she had regarded in an apparently careless manner her husbands desire to navigate the sea for no matter to what point he might happen to sail his ship would take him away from barbadoes and that would very well suit her she was getting tired of major bonnet she did not believe he had ever been a very good soldier she was positively sure that he was not a good farmer and she had the strongest kind of doubt as to his ability as a commercial man but as this new business would free her from him at least for a time she was well content and although she should feel herself somewhat handicapped by the presence of kate she did not intend to allow that young lady to interfere with her plans and purposes during the absence of the head of the house so she went her way saying nothing derisive about the nautical life except what she considered it necessary for her to do in order to maintain her superior position in the household  major bonnet was now very much engaged and a good deal disturbed for he found that projected sailing even in ones own craft is not always smooth sailing he was putting his vessel in excellent order and was fitting her out generously in the way of stores and all manner of nautical needfuls not forgetting the guns necessary for defence in these somewhat disordered times and his latest endeavours were towards the shipping of a suitable crew seafaring men were not scarce in the port of bridgetown but major bonnet now entitled to be called captain was very particular about his crew and it took him a long time to collect suitable men  as he was most truly a landsman knowing nothing about the sea or the various intricate methods of navigating a vessel thereupon he was compelled to secure a real captainone who would be able to take charge of the vessel and crew and who would do and have done in a thoroughly seamanlike manner what his nominal skipper should desire and ordain  this absolutely necessary personage had been secured almost as soon as the vessel had been purchased before any of the rest of the crew had signed ships articles and it was under his general supervision that the storing and equipment had been carried on his name was sam loftus he was a big man with a great readiness of speech there were perhaps some things he could not do but there seemed to be nothing that he was not able to talk about as has been said the rest of the crew came in slowly but they did come and major bonnet told his daughter that when he had secured four more men it was his intention to leave port  and sail for jamaica she exclaimed  oh yes he said with an affectionate smile and i will leave you with your uncle delaplaine where you can stay while i make some little cruises here and there  and so i am really to go she exclaimed her eyes sparkling  really to go said he  and what may i pack up she asked thinking of her stepmother  not much he said not much we will be able to find at spanish town something braver in the way of apparel than anything you now possess it will be some days before we sail and i shall have quietly conveyed on board such belongings as you need  she was very happy and she laughed  yours will be an easily laden ship said she for you take in with you no great store of goods for traffic but i suppose you design to pick up your cargo among the islands where you cruise and at a less cost perchance than it could be procured here  yes yes he said you have hit it fairly my little girl you have hit it fairly  new annoyances now began to beset major bonnet what his daughter had remarked in pleasantry the people of the town began to talk about unpleasantly here was a goodsized craft about to set sail with little or no cargo but with a crew apparently much larger than her requirements but not yet large enough for the desires of her owner to be sure as major bonnet did not know anything about ships he was bound to do something odd when he bought one and set forth to sail upon her but there were some odd things which ought to be looked into and there were people who advised that the attention of the colonial authorities should be drawn to this ship of their farmer townsman major bonnet had such a high reputation as a good citizen that there were few people who thought it worth while to trouble themselves about his new business venture but a good many disagreeable things came to the ears of sam loftus who reported them to his employer and it was agreed between them that it would be wise for them to sail as soon as they could even if they did not wait for the few men they had considered to be needed  early upon a cloudy afternoon major bonnet and his daughter went out in a small boat to look at his vessel the sarah williams which was then lying a short distance below the town  now kate said the good major bonnet when they were on board i have fitted up a little room for you below which i think you will find comfortable enough during the voyage to jamaica i will take you with me when i return to the house and then you can make up a little package of clothes which it will be easy to convey to the river bank when the time shall come for you to depart i cannot now say just when that time will arrive it may be in the daytime or it may be at night but it will be soon and i will give you good notice and i will come up the river for you in a boat but now i am very busy and i will leave you to become acquainted with the sarah williams which for a few days will be your home i shall be obliged to row over to the town for perhaps half an hour but ben greenway will be here to attend to anything you need until i return  ben greenway was a scotchman who had for a long time been major bonnets most trusted servant he was a good farmer was apt at carpenter work and knew a good deal about masonry a few months ago any one living in that region would have been likely to say if the subject had been brought up that without ben greenway major bonnet could not get along at all not even for a day for he depended upon him in so many ways and yet now the master of the estate was about to depart for nobody knew how long and leave his faithful servant behind the reason he gave was that ben could not be spared from the farm but people in general and ben in particular thought this very poor reasoning any sort of business which made it necessary for major bonnet to separate himself from ben greenway was a very poor business and should not be entered upon  the deck of the sarah williams presented a lively scene as kate stood upon the little quarterdeck and gazed forward the sailors were walking about and sitting about smoking talking or coiling things away there were people from the shore with baskets containing fruit and other wares for sale and all stirring and new and very interesting to miss kate as she stood with her ribbons flying in the river breeze  who is that young fellow she said to ben greenway who was standing by her the one with the big basket it seems to me i have seen him before  oh ay said ben he has been on the farm that is dickory charter whose father was drowned out fishing a few years ago he is a good lad an boards all ships comin in or goin out to sell his wares for his mither leans on him now having no ither  the youth who seemed to feel that he was being talked about now walked aft and held up his basket he was a handsome youngster lightly clad and barefooted and although not yet full grown of a strong and active build kate beckoned to him and bought an orange  an how is your mither dickory said ben  right well i thank you said he and gazed at kate who was biting a hole in her orange  then as he turned and went away having no reason to expect to sell anything more kate remarked to ben that is truly a finelooking young fellow he walks with such strength and ease like a deer or a cat  that comes from no wearin shoes said ben but as for me i would like better to wear shoes an walk mair stiffly  now there came aft a sailor who touched his cap and told ben greenway that he was wanted below to superintend the stowing some cases of the captains liquors so kate left to herself began to think about what she should pack into her little bundle she would make it very small for the fewer things she took with her the more she would buy at spanish town but the contents of her package did not require much thought and she soon became a little tired staying there by herself and therefore she was glad to see young dickory with his orangebasket walking aft  i dont want any more oranges she said when he was near enough but perhaps you may have other fruit  he came up to her and put down his basket i have bananas but perhaps you dont like them  oh yes i do she answered  but without offering to show her the fruit dickory continued theres one thing i dont like and thats the men on board your ship  what do you mean she asked amazed  speak lower he said and as he spoke he bethought himself that it might be well to hold out towards her a couple of bananas  theyre a bad hard lot of men he said i heard that from more than one person you ought not to stay on this ship  and what do you know about it mr impudence she asked with brows uplifted i suppose my father knows what is good for me  but he is not here said dickory  kate looked steadfastly at him he did not seem as ruddy as he had been and then she looked out upon the forward deck and the thought came to her that when she had first noticed these men it had seemed to her that they were indeed a rough hard lot kate bonnet was a brave girl but without knowing why she felt a little frightened  your name is dickory isnt it she said  he looked up quickly for it pleased him to hear her use his name indeed it is he answered  well dickory said she i wish you would go and find ben greenway i should like to have him with me until my father comes back  he turned and then stopped for an instant he said in a clear voice i will go and get the shilling changed and then he hurried away  he was gone a long time and kate could not understand it surely the sarah williams was not so big a ship that it would take all this time to look for ben greenway but he did come back and his face seemed even less ruddy than when she had last seen it he came up close to her and began handling his fruit  i dont want to frighten you he said but i must tell you about things i could not find ben greenway and i asked one of the men about him feigning that he owed me for some fruit and the man looked at another man and laughed and said that he had been sent for in a hurry and had gone ashore in a boat  i cannot believe that said kate he would not go away and leave me  dickory could not believe it either and could offer no explanation  kate now looked anxiously over the water towards the town but no father was to be seen  now let me tell you what i found out said dickory you must know it these men are wicked robbers i slipped quietly among them to find out something with my shilling in my hand ready to ask somebody to change if i was noticed  well what next laying her hand on his arm  oh dont do that he said quickly better take hold of a banana i spied that big sam who is sailingmaster and a blackheaded fellow taking their ease behind some boxes smoking and i listened with all sharpness and sam he said to the other onenot in these words but in language not fit for you to hearwhat he would like to do would be to get off on the next tide and when the other fellow asked him why he didnt go then and leave the foolmeaning your fatherto go back to his farm big sam answered with a good many curses that if he could do it he would drop down the river that very minute and wait at the bar until the water was high enough to cross but that it was impossible because they must not sail until your father had brought his cashbox on board it would be stupid to sail without that cashbox  dickory said she i am frightened i want to go on shore and i want to see my father and tell him all these things  but there is no boat said dickory every boat has left the ship  but you have one said she looking over the side  it is a poor little canoe he answered and i am afraid they would not let me take you away i having no orders to do so  kate was about to open her mouth to make an indignant reply when he exclaimed but here comes a boat from the town perhaps it is your father  she sprang to the rail no it is not she exclaimed it holds but one man who rows  she stood without a word watching the approaching boat dickory doing the same but keeping himself out of the general view the boat came alongside and the oarsman handed up a note which was presently brought to kate by big sam young dickory charter having in the meantime slipped below with his basket  a note from your father mistress bonnet said the sailingmaster and as she read it he stood and looked upon her  my father tells me said kate speaking decidedly but quietly that he will come on board very soon but i do not wish to wait for him i will go back to the town i have affairs which make it necessary for me to return immediately tell the man who brought the note that i will go back with him  big sam raised his eyebrows and his face assumed a look of trouble  it grieves me greatly mistress bonnet he said but the man has gone he was ordered not to wait here  shout after him cried kate call him back  sam stepped to the rail and looked over the water he is too far away he said but i will try and then he shouted but the man paid no attention and kept on rowing to shore  i thought it was too far he said but your father will be back soon he sent that message to me and now fair mistress what can we do for you shall it be that we send you some supper or as your cabin is ready would you prefer to step down to it and wait there for your father  no said she i will wait here for my father i want nothing  so with a bow he strode away and presently dickory came back she drew near to him and whispered dickory she said what shall i do shall i scream and wave my handkerchief perhaps they may see and hear me from the town  no said dickory i would not do that the night is coming on and the sky is cloudy and besides if you make a noise those fellows might do something  oh dickory what shall i do  you must wait for your father he said he must be here soon and the moment you see him call to him and make him take you to shore you should both of you get away from this vessel as soon as you can  for a moment the girl reflected dickory said she i wish you would take a message for me to master martin newcombe he may be able to get here to me even before my father arrives  dickory charter knew mr newcombe and he had heard what many people had talked about that he was courting major bonnets daughter the day before dickory would not have cared who the young planter was courting but this evening even to his own surprise he cared very much he was intensely interested in kate and he did not desire to help martin newcombe to take an interest in her besides he spoke honestly as he said and who would there be to take care of you no indeed i will not leave you  then row to the town said she and have a boat sent for me  he shook his head no he said i will not leave you  her eyes flashed you should do what you are commanded to do and in her excitement she almost forgot to whisper  he shook his head and left her     chapter iii  the two clocks   it was already beginning to grow dark she sat and she sat she waited and she waited and at last she wept but very quietly her father did not come ben greenway was not there and even that charter boy had gone a man came aft to her a mildfaced elderly man with further offers of refreshment and an invitation to go below out of the night air but she would have nothing and as she sadly waited and gently wept it began to grow truly dark presently as she sat one arm leaning on the rail she heard a voice close to her ear and she gave a great start  it is only dickory whispered the voice  then she put her head near him and was glad enough to have put her arms around his neck  i have heard a great deal more whispered dickory these men are dreadful they do not know what keeps your father although they have suspicions which i could not make out but if he does not come on board by ten oclock they will sail without him and without his cashbox  and what of me she almost cried what of me  they will take you with them said he thats the only thing for them to do but dont be frightened dont tremble you must leave this vessel  but how she said  oh i will attend to that he answered if you will listen to me and do everything i tell you we cant go until it is dark but while it is light enough for you to see things i will show you what you must do now look down over the side of the vessel  she leaned over and looked down he was apparently clinging to the side with his head barely reaching the top of the rail  do you see this bit of ledge i am standing on he asked could you get out and stand on this holding to this piece of rope as i do  yes said she i could do that  then still holding to the rope could you lower yourself down from the ledge and hang to it with your hands  and drop into your boat said she yes i could do that  no said he not drop into my boat it would kill you if you fell into the boat you must drop into the water  she shuddered and felt like screaming  but it will be easy to drop into the water you cant hurt yourself and i shall be there my boat will be anchored close by and we can easily reach it  drop into the water said poor kate  but i will be there you know said dickory  she looked down upon the ledge and then she looked below it to the water which was idly flapping against the side of the vessel  is it the only way said she  it is the only way he answered speaking very earnestly you must not wait for your father from what i hear i fear he has been detained against his will by nine oclock it will be dark enough  and what must i do she said feeling cold as she spoke  listen to every word he answered this is what you must do you know the sound of the bell in the tower of the new church  oh yes said she i hear it often  and you will not confound it with the bell in the old church  oh no said she it is very different and generally they strike far apart  yes said he the old one strikes first and when you hear it it will be quite dark and you can slip over the rail and stand on this ledge as i am doing then keep fast hold of this rope and you can slip farther down and sit on the ledge and wait until the clock of the new church begins to strike nine then you must get off the ledge and hang by your two hands when you hear the last stroke of nine you must let go and drop i shall be there  but if you shouldnt be there dickory couldnt you whistle couldnt you call gently  no said dickory if i did that their sharp ears would hear and lanterns would be flashed on us and perhaps things would be cast down upon us that would be the quickest way of getting rid of you  but dickory she said after a moments silence it is terrible about my father and ben greenway why dont they come back whats the matter with them  he hesitated a little before answering  from what i heard i think there is some trouble on shore and thats the reason why your father has not come for you as soon as he expected but he thinks you safe with ben greenway now what we have to do is to get away from this vessel and then if she sails and leaves your father and ben greenway it will be a good thing these fellows are rascals and no honest person should have to do with them but now i must get out of sight or somebody will come and spoil everything  big sam did come aft and told kate he thought she would come to injury sitting out in the night air but she would not listen to him and only asked him what time of night it was he told her that it was not far from nine and that she would see her father very soon and then he left her  it would have been a terrible thing if he had come at nine she said to herself then she sat very still waiting for the sound of the old clock  dickory charter had not told miss kate bonnet all that he had heard when he was stealthily wandering about the ship he had slipped down into the chains near a porthole on the other side of which big sam and the blackhaired man were taking supper and he heard a great deal of talk among other things he heard a bit of conversation which when expurgated of its oaths and unpleasant expressions was like this  you are sure you can trust the men said blackhair  oh yes replied the other theyre all right  then why dont you go now at any time officers may be rowing out here to search the vessel  and well they might for what needs an old farmer with an empty vessel a crew of seventy men and ten guns he is in trouble you may wager your life on that or he would be coming to see about his girl  and what will you do about her  oh shell not be in the way answered big sam with a laugh if he doesnt take her off before i sail thats his business if i am obliged to leave port without his cashbox i will marry his daughter and become his soninlawi dont doubt we can find a parson among all the rascals on boardthen perhaps he will think it his duty to send me drafts to the different ports i touch at  at this good joke both of them laughed  but i dont want to go without his cashbox continued big sam and i will wait until hightide which will be about ten oclock it would be unsafe to miss that for i must not be here tomorrow morning but the longboat will be here soon i told roger to wait until halfpast nine and then to come aboard with old bonnet or without him if he didnt show himself by that time  but after all said the blackhaired man the main thing is will the men stand by you  you neednt fear them said the other with an aggravated oath i know every rascal of them  now then said dickory charter to himself as he slipped out of the chains she goes overboard if i have to pitch her over  nothing had he heard about ben greenway he did not believe that the scotchman had deserted his young mistress even had he been sent for to go on shore in haste would he leave without speaking to her more than that he would most likely have taken her with him  but dickory could not afford to give much thought to ben greenway although a good friend to both himself and his mother he was not to be considered when the safety of mistress kate bonnet was in question  the minutes moved slowly very slowly indeed as kate sat listening for the sound of the old clock and at the same time listening for the sound of approaching footsteps  it was now so dark that she could not have seen anybody without a light but she could hear as if she had possessed the ears of a cat  she had ceased to expect her father she was sure he had been detained on shore how she knew not but she did know he was not coming  presently the old clock struck one twoin a moment she was climbing over the rail in the darkness she missed the heavy bit of rope which dickory had showed her but feeling about she clutched it and let herself down to the ledge below her nerves were quite firm now it was necessary to be so very particular to follow dickorys directions to the letter that her nerves were obliged to be firm she slipped still farther down and sat sideways upon the narrow ledge so narrow that if the vessel had rolled she could not have remained upon it  there she waited  then there came sharper and clearer out of the darkness in the direction of the town the first stroke of nine oclock from the tower of the new church before the second stroke had sounded she was hanging by her two hands from the ledge she hung at her full length she put her feet together she hoped that she would go down smoothly and make no splash threefourfivesixseveneightnineand she let her fingers slip from the ledge down she went into the darkness and into the water not knowing where one ended and the other began her eyes were closed but they might as well have been open there was nothing for her to see in all that blackness down she went as if it were to the very bottom of black air and black water and then suddenly she felt an arm around her  dickory was there  she felt herself rising and dickory was rising still with his arm around her in a moment her head was in the air and she could breathe now she felt that he was swimming with one arm and both legs instinctively she tried to help him for she had learned to swim they went on a dozen strokes or more with much labour until they touched something hard  my boat said dickory in the lowest of whispers take hold of it  kate did so and he moved from her she knew that he was clambering into the boat although she could not see or hear him soon he took hold of her under her arms and he lifted with the strength of a young lion yet so slowly so warily that not a drop of water could be heard dripping from her garments and when she was drawn up high enough to help herself he pulled her in still warily and slowly then he slipped to the bow and cast off the rope with which the canoe had been anchored it was his only rope but he could not risk the danger of pulling up the bit of rock to which the other end of it was fastened then with a paddle worked as silently as if it had been handled by an indian the canoe moved away farther and farther into the darkness  is all well with you said dickory thinking he might now safely murmur a few words  all well she murmured back except that this is the most uncomfortable boat i ever sat in  i expect you are on my orange basket he said perhaps you can move it a little  now he paddled more strongly and then he stopped  where shall i take you mistress bonnet he asked a little louder than he had dared to speak before  kate heaved a sigh before she answered she had been saying her prayers  i dont know you brave dickory she answered but it seems to me that you cant see to take me anywhere everything is just as black as pitch one way or another  but i know the river he said with light or without it i have gone home on nights as black as this will you go to the town  i would not know where to go to there she answered and in such a plight  then to your home said he but that will be a long row and you must be very cold  she shuddered but not with cold if her father had been at home it would have been all right but her stepmother would be there and that would not be all right she would not know what to say to her  oh dickory she said i dont know where to go  i know where you can go he said beginning to paddle vigorously i will take you to my mother she will take care of you tonight and give you dry clothes and tomorrow you may go where you will     chapter iv  on the quarterdeck   as the time approached when big sam intended to take the sarah williams out of port it seemed really necessary that mistress kate bonnet should descend from the exposed quarterdeck and seek shelter from the night air in the captains cabin or in her own room and as she had treated him so curtly at his last interview with her he sent the elderly man with the mild countenance to tell her that she really must go below for that he big sam felt answerable to her father for her health and comfort but when the elderly man and his lantern reached the quarterdeck there was no mistress kate there and during the rapid search which ensued there was no mistress kate to be found on the vessel  big sam was very much disturbed she must have jumped overboard but what a wild young woman to do that upon such little provocation for how should she know that he was about to run away with her fathers vessel  this is a bad business he said to the blackhaired man and who would have thought it  i see not that said black paul nor why you should trouble yourself about her she is gone and you are well rid of her had she stayed aboard with us every ship in the colony might have been cruising after us before tomorrows sun had gone down  but this did not quiet the cowardly soul of big sam  now i shall tell you said he exactly what happened a little before dark she went ashore in a boat which was then leaving the ship i allowed her to do this because she was very much in earnest about it and talked sharply and also because i thought the town was the best place for her since it was growing late and her father did not seem to be coming now if the old man comes on board thats what happened but if he does not come on board the devil and the fishes know what happened and they may talk about it if they like but if any man says anything to old bonnet except as i have ordered then the fishes shall have another feast  and now what i have to say to you said black paul is that you should get away from here without waiting for the tide if one of these rascals drops overboard and swims ashore he may get a good reward for news of the murder committed on this vessel and there isnt any reason to think so far as i know that the sarah williams can sail any faster than two or three other vessels now in the harbour  theres sense in all that said big sam as he walked forward but he suddenly stopped hearing not very far away the sound of oars  now began the body and soul of big sam to tremble if the officers of the law having disposed of captain bonnet had now come to the ship he had no sufficient tale to tell them about the disappearance of mistress kate bonnet nor could he resist for why should the crew obey his orders they had not yet agreed to receive him as their captain and so far they had done nothing to set themselves against the authorities it was a bad case for big sam  but now the ship was hailed and the voice which hailed it was that of captain bonnet and the soul of big sam upheaved itself  in a few minutes bonnet was on board with a big box and the crew of the longboat speaking rapidly he explained to big sam the situation of affairs the authorities of the port had indeed sadly interfered with him they had heard reports about the unladen vessel and the big crew and although they felt loath to detain and to examine a fellowtownsman hitherto of good report they did detain him and they did examine him and they would have gone immediately to the ship had it not been so dark  but under the circumstances they contented themselves with the assurance of the respectable mr bonnet that he would appear before them the next morning and give them every opportunity of examining his most respectable ship having done this they retired to their beds and the respectable bonnet immediately boarded his vessel  now cried captain bonnet where is my daughter i hope that ben greenway has caused her to retire to shelter  your daughter exclaimed big sam before any one else could speak she is not here it was still early twilight when she told me she would wait no longer and desired to be sent ashore in a boat this request of course i immediately granted feeling bound thereto as she was your daughter and that i was in a measure under her orders  captain bonnet stood knitting his brows  well well he presently cried with an air of relief it is better so her home is the best place for her as matters have turned out and now said he turning to big sam call the men together and set them to quick work pull up your anchors and do whatever else is necessary to free the ship then let us away we must be far out of sight of this island before tomorrows sunrise  as big sam passed black paul he winked and whispered the old fool is doing exactly what i would have done if he hadnt come aboard this suits my plan as if he were trying his best to please me  in a very short time the cable was slipped for big sam had no notion of betraying the departure of the vessel by the creaking of a capstan and with the hoisting of a few sails and no light aboard except the shaded lamp at the binnacle the sarah williams moved down the river and out upon the sea  and when are you going to take the command in your hands asked black paul of big sam  tomorrow some time was the answer but i must first go around among the men and let them know whats coming  and how about ben greenway has the old man asked for him yet  no said the other he thinks of course that the scotchman has gone ashore with the young woman what else could he do being a faithful servant tomorrow i shall set greenway free and let him tell his own tale to his master but i shall tell my tale first and then he can speak or not speak as he chooses it will make no difference one way or another  soon after dawn the next morning captain bonnet was out of his hammock and upon deck he looked about him and saw nothing but sea sea sea  big sam approached him i forgot to tell you said he that yesterday i shut up that scotchman of yours for from his conduct i thought that he had some particular reason for wanting to go on shore and fearing that if he did so he would talk about this vessel and so make worse the trouble i was sure you were in i shut him up as a matter of precaution and forgot to mention him to you last night  you stupid blockhead roared mr bonnet how like an ass you have acted not for a bag of gold would i have taken ben greenway on this cruise and not for a dozen bags would i have deprived my family of his care and service you ought to be thrown into the sea ben greenway here of all men in the world ben greenway here  i only thought to do you a service said big sam  service shouted the angry bonnet but as it was of no use to say anything more upon this subject he ordered the sailingmaster to send to him first ben greenway and then to summon to him no matter where they might be or what they might be doing the whole crew  the other surprised at this order objected that all of the men could not leave their posts but bonnet overruled him  send me the whole of them every man jack the fellow at the wheel will remain here and steer as for the rest the ship will take care of itself for a space  what can that old fool of a farmer intend to do said big sam as he went away he is like a child with a toy and wants to see his crew in a bunch  presently came ben greenway in a smothered rage  an i suppose sir said he without salutation that ye have gien orders about the care o the cows and the lot o poultry that i engaged to send to the town today  dont mention cows or poultry to me cried bonnet i am a more angry man than you are ben greenway and as soon as i have time to attend to it i shall look into this matter of your shutting up and shall come down upon the wrongdoers like sheeted lightning  what a fearful rage yere in master bonnet said ben i never saw the like o it if yere really angrier than i am i willna revile leavin it to ye to do the revilin wha are so much better qualified an so it wasna accident that i was shut up in the ships pantry leavin mistress kate to gang hame by hersel an to come out this mornin findin the ship at sea an ye in command  say no more ben cried bonnet i am more sorry to see you here than if you were any other man i know in this world but i cannot put you off now nor can i talk further about it being very much pressed with other matters now here comes my crew  ben greenway retired a little leaning against the rail  an this is his crew he muttered a lot o unkempt wild beasts it strikes me mayhap he has gathered them togither to convert their souls an he is about to preach his first sermon to them  now all the mariners of the sarah williams were assembled aft and captain bonnet was standing on his quarterdeck looking out upon them he was dressed in a naval uniform to which was added a broad red sash in his belt were two pairs of big pistols and a stout sword hung by his side he folded his arms he knitted his brows and he gazed fiercely about to see if any one were absent although if any one had been absent he would not have known it his eyes flashed his cheeks were flushed and it was plain enough to all that he had something important to say  my men he cried in a stalwart voice which no one there had ever heard him use before my men look upon me and you will not see what you expect to see here is no planter no dealer in horses and fat cattle no grower of sugarcane instead of that he yelled drawing his sword and flourishing it above his head instead of that i am pirate bonnet the new terror of the sea you my men my brave men you are not the crew of the good merchantman the sarah williams you are pirates all you are the pirate crew of the pirate ship revenge that is now the name of this vessel on which you sail and you are all pirates who henceforth shall sail her  now look aloft every man of you and you will see a skull and bones under which you sail under which you fight under which you gain great riches in coins in golden bars and in fine goods fit for kings and queens  as he spoke every rascal raised his eyes aloft and there sure enough floated the black flag with the skull and bonesthe terrible jolly roger of the spanish main and which bonnet himself had hoisted before he called together his crew  for the most part the men were astounded and looked blankly the one upon the other they knew they had been shipped to sail upon some illegal cruise and that they were to be paid high wages by the wealthy bonnet but that this worthy farmer should be their pirate captain had never entered their minds they naturally supposing that their future commander would not care to show himself at barbadoes and that he would be taken on board at some other port  as for big sam he was more than astoundedhe was stupefied he had well known the character of the ship from the time that bonnet had taken him into his service and he it was who had mainly managed the fittingup of the vessel and the shipping of her crew he did not know whom bonnet intended to command the ship but from the very beginning he had intended to command her himself but he had been too late he had not gone among the men as he had expected to do soon after setting sail and here this country bumpkin had taken the wind out of his sails and had boldly announced that he himself was the captain of the pirate ship revenge  the men now began to talk among themselves and as bonnet still stood his sword clutched in his hand and his chest heaving with the excitement of his own speech there arose from the crew a cheer some of them had known a little about stede bonnet and some of them scarcely anything at all except that he was able to pay them good wages now he had told them that he was a pirate captain and each of them knew that he himself was a pirate or was waiting for the chance to become one  and so they cheered and their captains chest heaved higher and the soul of the luckless big sam collapsed for he knew that after that cheer there was no chance for him at least not now  now go my boys shouted bonnet back to your places every one of you and fall to your duty and in honour of that black flag which floats above you each one of you shall drink a glass of grog  with another shout the crew hurried forward and stede bonnet stood upon the quarterdeck the pirate captain of the pirate ship revenge  and now stepped up to his master that good presbyterian ben greenway  an ye call yoursel a pirate sir said he an ye go forth upon the sea to murder an to rob an to prepare your soul for hell  mr bonnet winked a little  you speak strongly ben said he but that might have been expected from a man of your fashion of thinking but let me tell you again my good ben greenway that i was no party to your being on this vessel even now when my soul swells within me with the pride of knowing that i am a sovereign of the seas and that i owe no allegiance to any man or any government and that my will is my law and is the law of every man upon this vesseleven now ben greenway it grieves me to know that you are here with me but the first chance i get i shall set you ashore and have you sent home thou art not cut out for a pirate and as no other canst thou sail with me  ben greenway looked at him steadfastly  master stede bonnet said he ye are no more fit to be a bloody pirate than i am ye oversee your plantation weel although i hae often been persuaded that ye knew no as much as ye think ye do ye provide weel for your family although ye tak no the pleasure therein ye might hae taen had ye been content wi ane wife as the holy scriptures tell us is enough for ony mon an ye hae sufficient judgment to tak the advice o a judgmatical mon about your lands an your herds but when it comes to your cain yoursel a pirate captain it is enough to make a deceased person chuckle by the absurdity o it  ben greenway exclaimed major bonnet i dont like your manner of speech  o course ye dont cried ben an i didna expect ye to like it but it is the solemn truth for a that  i dont want any of your solemn truths said bonnet and as soon as i get a chance i am going to send you home to your barnyard and your cows  no so fast master bonnet no so fast answered ben i hae taen care o ye for mony years i hae kept ye out o mony a bad scrape both in buyin an sellin an i am sure ye never wanted takin care o mair than ye do now an im just here to tell ye that i am no goin back to barbadoes till ye do an that i am goin to stand by ye through your bad luck and through your good luck in your sin an in your repentance  illustration if you talk to me like that i will cut you down where you stand  ben greenway cried captain bonnet as he waved his sword in the air if you talk to me like that i will cut you down where you stand you forget that you are not talking to a country gentleman but to a pirate a pirate of the seas  ben grinned but seeing the temper his master was in thought it wise to retire     chapter v  an unsuccessful errand   for what seemed a very long time to kate bonnet dickory charter paddled bravely through the darkness she was relieved of the terror and the uncertainty which had fallen upon her during the past few hours and she was grateful to the brave young fellow who had delivered her from the danger of sailing out upon the sea with a crew of wicked scoundrels who were about to steal her fathers ship and her heart should have beaten high with gratitude and joy but it did not she was very cold and she knew not whither young dickory was taking her she did not believe that in all that darkness he could possibly know where he was going at any moment that dreadful ship might loom up before them and lights might be flashed down upon them but all of a sudden the canoe scraped grounded and stopped  what is that she cried  it is our beach said dickory and almost at that moment there came a call from the darkness beyond  dickory cried a womans voice is that you  it is my mother said the boy she has heard the scraping of my keel  then he shouted back it is dickory please show me a light mother  jumping out dickory pulled the canoe high up the shelving shore and then he helped kate to get out it was not an easy job for she could see nothing and floundered terribly but he seemed to like it and half led half carried her over a considerable space of uneven ground until he came to the door of a small house where stood an elderly woman with a lantern  dickory dickory shouted the woman what is that you are bringing home is it a great fish  it is a young woman said the boy but she is as wet as a fish  woman cried good dame charter what mean you dickory is she dead  not dead mother charter said kate who now stood unassisted in the light of the lantern but in woeful case and more like to startle you than if i were the biggest fish i am mistress kate bonnet just out of the river between here and the town no i will not enter your house i am not fit i will stand here and tell my tale  dickory shouted dame charter take the lantern and run to the kitchen cabin where yell make a fire quickly  away ran dickory and standing in the darkness kate bonnet told her tale it was not a very satisfactory tale for there was a great part of it which kate herself did not understand but it sufficed at present for the good dame who had known the girl when she was small and who was soon busily engaged in warming her by her fire refreshing her with food and in fortifying her against the effects of her cold bath by a generous glass of rum made the good woman earnestly asserted from sugarcane grown on master bonnets plantation  early the next morning came dickory from the kitchen where he had made a fire before that he had been catching some fish and on a rude bench by the house door he saw kate bonnet when he perceived her he laughed but as she also laughed it was plain she was not offended  this pretty girl was dressed in a large blue gown belonging to the stout dame charter and which was quite as much of a gown as she had any possible need for her head was bare for she had lost her hat and she wore neither shoes nor stockings those articles of apparel having been so shrunken by immersion as to make it impossible for her to get them on  thy mother is a good woman said kate and i am so glad you did not take me to the town i dont wonder you gaze at me i must look like a fright  dickory made no answer but by the way in which he regarded her she knew that he saw nothing frightful in her face  you have been very good to me said she rising and making a step towards him but suddenly stopping on account of her bare feet and i wish i could tell you how thankful i am to you you are truly a brave boy dickory the bravest i have ever known  his brows contracted why do you call me a boy he interrupted i am nineteen years old and you are not much more than that  she laughed and her white teeth made him ready to fall down and worship her  you have done as much said she as any man could do and more  then she held out her hand and he came and took it  truly you are a man she said and looking steadfastly into his face she added how very very much i owe you  he didnt say anything at all this dickory just stood and looked at her as many a one has been before he was more grateful for the danger out of which he had plucked the fair young woman than she was thankful for the deliverance  just then dame charter called them to breakfast when they were at the table they talked of what was to be done next and as above everything else miss kate desired to know where her father was and why he hadnt come aboard the sarah williams dickory offered to go to the town for news  i hate to ask too much after all you have done said the girl but after you have seen my father and told him everything for he must be in sore trouble would you mind rowing to our house and bringing me some clothes madam bonnet will understand what i need and she too will want to know what has become of me  of course i will do that cried dickory grateful for the chance to do her service  and if you happen to see mr newcombe in the town will you tell him where i am  now dickory gave no signs of gratitude for a chance to do her service but his mother spoke quickly enough  of course he will tell master newcombe said she and anybody else you wish should know  in ten minutes dickory was in his canoe paddling to the town when he was out of the little inlet on the shore of which lay his mothers cottage he looked far up and down the broad river but he could see nothing of the good ship sarah williams  i am glad they have gone said dickory to himself and may they never come back again it is a pity that major bonnet should lose his ship but as things have turned out it is better for him to lose it than to have it  when he had fastened his canoe to a little pier in the town with a rope which he borrowed having now none of his own dickory soon heard strange news the man who owned the rope told him that major bonnet had gone off in his vessel which had sailed out of the harbour in the night showing no light and although many people had talked of this strange proceeding nobody knew whether he had gone of his own free will or against it  of course it was against his will cried dickory the ship was stolen and they have stolen him with it the wretches the beasts and then he went up into the town  some men were talking at the door of a bakers shop and the baker himself a stout young man came out  oh yes said he we know now what it means the good major bonnet has gone off pirating he thinks he can make more money that way than by attending to his plantation the townspeople suspected him last night and now they know what he is  at this moment master dickory jumped upon the baker and both went down when dickory got up the baker remained where he was and it was plain enough to everybody that the nerves and muscles of even a vigorous young man were greatly weakened by the confined occupation of a baker  dickory now went further to ask more and he soon heard enough the respectable major bonnet had gone away in his own ship with a savage crew far beyond the needs of the vessel and if he had not gone pirating what had he gone for and to this question dickory replied every time he went because he was taken away he would not give up his faith in kate bonnets father  and greenway the people said why should they take him he is of no good on a ship  on this dickorys heart fell further he had been troubled about the scotchman but had tried not to think of him  the scoundrels have stolen them both with the vessel he said and as he spoke his soul rose upward at the thought of what he had done for kate and as that had been done what mattered it after all what had happened to other people  five minutes afterward a man came running through the town with the news that old bonnets daughter miss kate had also gone away in the ship she was not at home she was not in the town  that settles it said some people the blackhearted rascal he has gone of his own accord and he has taken greenway and his fair young daughter with him  and what do you think of that said some to the doubter dickory  i dont believe a word of it said he and not wishing on his own responsibility to tell what he knew of mistress kate bonnet he rowed up the river towards the bonnet plantation to carry her message on his way whom should he see hurrying along the road by the river bank coming towards the town and looking hot and worried but mr martin newcombe at the sight of the boat he stopped  ho young man he cried you are from the town has anything fresh been heard about major bonnet and his daughter  now here was the best and easiest opportunity of doing the third thing which kate had asked him to do but his heart did not bound to do it he sat and looked at the man on the river bank  dont you hear me cried newcombe has anybody heard further from the bonnets  dickory still sat motionless gazing at newcombe he didnt want to tell this man anything he didnt want to have anything to do with him he hesitated but he could not forget the third thing he had been asked to do and who had asked him to do it whatever happened he must be loyal to her and her wishes and so he said with but little animation in his voice major bonnets daughter did not go with him  instantly came a great cry from the shore where is she where is she come closer to land and tell me everything  this was too much dickory did not like the tone of the man on shore who had no right to command him in that fashion  i have no time to stop now said he i am carrying a message to madam bonnet  and so he paddled away somewhat nearer the middle of the river  martin newcombe was wild he ran and he bounded on his way to the bonnet house he called and he shouted to dickory but apparently that young person was too far away to hear him when the canoe touched the shore almost at the spot where the fair kate had been fishing with a hook lying in the sun newcombe was already there  tell me he cried tell me about miss kate bonnet what has befallen her if she did not go with her father where is she now  i have come said dickory sturdily as he fastened his boat with the borrowed rope with a message for madam bonnet and i cannot talk with anybody until i have delivered it  madam bonnet saw the two persons hurrying towards her house and she came out in a fine fury to meet them  have you heard from my runaway husband she cried and from his daughter i am ashamed to hear news of them but i suppose i am in duty bound to listen  dickory did not hesitate now to tell what he knew or at least part of it  your daughter said he  she is not my daughter cried the lady thank heaven i am spared that disgrace and from what hidingplace does she and her sire send me a message  dickorys face flushed  i bring no message from a hidingplace he said nor any from your husband he went to sea in his ship but mistress kate bonnet left the vessel before it sailed and her clothes having been injured by water she sent me for what a young lady in her station might need supposing rightly that you would know what that might be  indeed i do cried madam bonnet what she needs are the clouts of a fishgirl and a stick to her back besides  madam cried newcombe but she heeded him not she was growing more angry  a fine creature she is exclaimed the lady to run away from my house in this fashion and treat me with such contumely and then to order me to send her her fine clothes to deck herself for the eyes of strangers  but young man cried newcombe where is she tell that without further delay where is she  i dont care where she is interrupted madam bonnet it matters not to me whether she is in the town or sitting waiting for her finery on the bridge if she didnt go with her father cowardly sneak that he is that gives her less reason to stay away all night from her home and send her orders to me in the morning no i will have none of that if my husbands daughter wants anything of me let her come here and ask for it first giving me the reason of her shameful conduct  madam cried newcombe i cannot listen to such speech such  then stop your ears with your thumbs she exclaimed and you will not hear it  then turning to dickory now go you and tell the young woman who sent you here she must come in sackcloth and ashes if she can get them and she must tell me her tale and her fathers tale without a lie mixed up in them and when she has done this and has humbly asked my pardon for the foul affront she has put upon me then it will be time enough to talk of fine clothes and fripperies  newcombe now expostulated with much temper but dickory gave him little chance to speak  i carry no such message as that he said do you truly mean that you deny the young lady the apparel she needs and that i am to tell her that  get away from here cried madam bonnet with her face in a blaze i send her no message at all and if she comes here on her knees i shall spurn her if it suit me  if dickory had waited a little he might have heard more but he did not wait he quickly turned and away he went in his boat and away went martin newcombe after him but as the younger man was barefooted the other one could not keep up with him and the canoe was pushed off before he reached the waters edge  stop you young rascal cried newcombe where is kate bonnet stop and tell me where she is  troubled as he was at the tale he was going to tell dickory laughed aloud and he paddled down the river as few in that region had ever paddled before  madam bonnet went into her house and if she had met a maidservant it might have been bad for that poor woman she was not troubled about kate she knew the young man to be dickory charter and she was quite sure that her stepdaughter was in his mothers cottage why she happened to be there and what had become of the recreant bonnet the equally recreant young woman could come and tell her whenever she saw fit     chapter vi  a pair of shoes and stockings   the tide was running down and dickory made a swift passage to the town seeing on the pier the man from whom he had borrowed the rope he stopped to return him his property and thinking that the good people of the town should know that no matter what had befallen major bonnet his daughter had not gone with him and was safe among friends he mentioned these facts to the man but with very few details being in a hurry to return with his message  before he turned into the inlet dickory was called from the shore and to his surprise he saw his mother standing on the bank in front of a mass of bushes which concealed her from her house  come here dickory she said and tell me what you have heard  her son told his doleful tale  i fear me mother he said that major bonnets ship has gone on some secret and bad business and that he is mixed up in it else why did he desert his daughter and if he intended to take her with him that was worse  i dont know dickory said good dame charter reflectively we must not be too quick to believe harm of our fellowbeings it does look bad as the townspeople thought that major bonnet should own such a ship with such a strange crew but he is a man who knows his own business and may have had good reason for what he has done he might have been sailing out to some foreign part to bring back a rich cargo and needed stout men to defend it from the pirates that he might meet with on the seas  but his daughter mother said dickory how could he have left her as he did that was shameful and even you must admit it  not so fast dickory said she there are other ways of looking at things than the way in which we look at them he had intended to take mistress kate on a little trip she told me that herself and most likely having changed his mind on account of the suspicions in the town he sent word to her to return to her home which message she did not get  dickory considered  yes mother he said it might have been that way but i dont believe that he went of his own accord and i dont believe that he would take ben greenway with him i think mother that they were both stolen with the ship  that might be said his mother but we have no right to take such a view of it and to impart it to his daughter if he went away of his own accord everything will doubtless be made right and we shall know his reasons for what he has done it is not for us to make up our minds that major bonnet and good ben greenway have been carried off by wicked men for this would be sad indeed for that fair girl to believe so remember dickory that it is our duty always to think the best of everything and now i will go through the underbrush to the house and when you get there yourself you must tell your story as if you had not told it to me  before dickory had reached his mothers cottage mistress kate bonnet came running to meet him and she did not seem to be the same girl he had left that morning her clothes had been dried and smoothed even her hat which had been found in the boat had been made shapely and wearable and its ribbons floated in the breeze dickory glanced at her feet and as he did so a thrill of strange delight ran through him he saw his own sunday shoes with silver buckles and he caught a glimpse of a pair of brown stockings which he knew went always with those shoes  i am quite myself again she said noticing his wide eyes and your mother has been good enough to lend me a pair of your shoes and stockings mine are so utterly ruined and i could not walk barefooted  dickory was so filled with pride that this fair being could wear his shoes and that she was wearing them that he could only mumble some stupid words about being so glad to serve her and she wise girl said nothing about the quantities of soft cottonwool which dame charter had been obliged to stuff into the toes before they would stay upon the small feet they covered  but my father cried kate what of him where is he  now dame charter was with them her eyes hard fixed upon her son  dickory mindful of those eyes told her what he had to tell saying as little as possible about major bonnetbecause of course all that he knew about him was mere hearsaybut dilating with much vigour upon the shameful conduct of madam bonnet for the young lady ought surely to know what sort of a woman her fathers wife really was and what she might expect if she should return to her house he could have said even more about the interview with the angry woman but his mothers eyes were upon him  kate heard everything without a word and then she burst into tears  my father she sobbed carried away or gone away and one is as bad as the other  dickory said dame charter go cut some wood there is none ready for the kitchen  dickory went away not sorry for he did not know how to deport himself with a young lady whose heart was so sorely tried he might have discovered a way if he had been allowed to do so but that would not have been possible with his mother present but in spite of her sorrow his heart sang to him that she was wearing his shoes and stockings then he cheerfully brought down his axe upon the wood for the dinners cooking  dame charter led the weeping girl to the bench and they talked long together there was no optimist in all the british colonies nor for that matter in those belonging to france or spain or even to the dutch who was a more conscientious follower of her creed than dame charter she sat by kate and she talked to her until the girl stopped sobbing and began to see for herself that her father knew his own business and that he had most certainly sent her a message to go on shore which had not been delivered  as to poor ben greenway the good woman was greatly relieved that her son had not mentioned him and she took care not to do it herself she did not wish to strain her optimism kate having so much else upon her mind never thought of this good man  when dickory came back he first looked to see if kate still wore his shoes and stockings and then he began to ask what there was that he might now do he would go again to the town if he might be of use but kate had no errand for him there dickory had told her how he had been with mr newcombe at her home and therefore there was no need of her sending him another message  i dont know where to go or where to send she said simply i am lost and that is all of it  oh no cried dame charter not that you are with good friends and here you can stay just as long as you like  indeed she can said dickory as if he were making a response in church  his mother looked at him and said nothing and then she took kate out into a little grove behind the house to see if she could find some ripe oranges  it was a fair property although not large which belonged to the widow charter her husband had been a thriving man although a little inclined to speculations in trade which were entirely out of his line and when he met his death in the sea he left her nothing but her home and some inconsiderable land about it dickory had been going to a grammarschool in the town and was considered a fair scholar but with his fathers death all that stopped and the boy was obliged to go to work to do what he could for his mother and ever since he had been doing what he could without regard to appearances thinking only of the money  but on sunday when he rowed his mother to church he wore good clothes being especially proud of his buckled shoes and his long brown hose which were always of good quality  they were eating dinner when oars were heard on the river and in a moment a boat swung around into the inlet in the stern sat master martin newcombe and two men were rowing  now dickory charter swore in his heart although he was not accustomed to any sort of blasphemy and as miss kate gazed eagerly through the open window our young friend narrowly scrutinized her face to see if she were glad or not she was glad that was plain enough and he went out sullenly to receive the arriving interloper  when they were all standing on the shore kate did not think it worth while to ask master newcombe how he happened to know where she was but the young man waited for no questions he went on to tell his story when he related that it was a man fishing on a pier who had told him that young mistress kate bonnet was stopping with dame charter kate wondered greatly for as dickory had met master newcombe what need had there been for the latter to ask questions about her of a stranger but she said nothing and dickory growled in his soul that he had ever spoken to the man on the pier except to thank him for the rope he had borrowed  martin newcombes story went on and he told that having been extremely angered by the conduct and words of madam bonnet he had gone into the town and made inquiries hoping to hear something of the whereabouts of mistress kate and having done so by means of the very obliging person on the pier he had determined that the daughter of major bonnet should have her rights and he had gone to his own lawyer who assured him that being a person of recognised respectability possessing property he was fully authorized knowing the wishes of mistress kate bonnet to go to her stepmother and demand that those wishes be complied with and if this very reasonable request should be denied then the lawyer would take up the matter himself and would see to it that reasonable raiment and the necessities of a young lady should not be withheld from her  with these instructions newcombe had gone to madam bonnet and had found that much disturbed lady in a state of partial collapse which had followed her passion of the morning and who had declared that nothing in the world would please her better than to get rid of her husbands daughter and never see her again and if the creature needed clothes or anything else which belonged to her a maid should pack them up and anybody who pleased might take them to any place provided she heard no more about them or their owner  in all this she spoke most truthfully for she hated her stepdaughter both because she was a fine young woman and much regarded by her father and because she had certain rights to the estate of said father which his present wife did not wish to recognise or even to think about so martin newcombe was perfectly welcome to take away such things as would render it unnecessary for the girl to now return to the home in which she had been born martin had brought the box and here he was  it was not long before newcombe and the lady of his love were walking away through the little plantation in order that they might speak by themselves dickory looked after them and frowned but he bravely comforted himself by thinking that he had been the one into whose arms she had dropped through the blackness of the night and the blackness of the water knowing in her heart that he would be there ready for her and also by the thought that it was his shoes and stockings that she wore dame charter saw this frown on her sons face but she did not guess the thoughts which were in his mind     chapter vii  kate plans   it was nearly an hour before kate and mr newcombe returned and when they came back they did not look happy dickory observed their sad visages but the sight did not make him sad kate took dame charter by the hand and led her to the bench  you have been so kind to me she said that i have almost come to look upon you as a mother even though i have known you such a little while and i want to tell you what i have been talking about and what i think i am going to do  mr newcombe now stood by and dickory also his mother was not quite sure that this was the right place for him but as he had already done so much for the young lady there was perhaps no reason why he should be debarred from hearing what she had to say  this gentleman said kate indicating martin newcombe sympathizes with me very greatly in my present unfortunate position having no home to which i can go and having no relative belonging to this island but my father who is sailing upon the seas i know not where and therefore in his great kindness has offered to marry me and to take me to his home which thereafter would be my home and in which i should have all comforts and rights  now dickorys face was like the sky before a shower his mother saw it out of the corner of her eye but the others did not look at him  this was very kind and very good continued kate  not at all not at all interrupted master newcombe except that it was kind and good to myself for there is nothing in this world which you need and want as much as i need and want you  at this dickorys brow grew darker  i believe all you say said kate for i am sure you are an honest and a true man but as i told you i cannot marry you for even had i made up my mind on the subject which i have not i could not marry any one at such a time as this not knowing my fathers will upon the subject or where he is  the sun broke out on dickorys countenance without a shower his mother noticed the change  but as i must do something kate went on a plan came to me while mr newcombe was talking to me and i have been thinking of it ever since and now as i speak i am becoming fully determined in regard to it that is if i can carry it out it often happens she said with a faint smile that when people ask advice they become more and more strengthened in their own opinion my opinion and i may say my plan is this when my father told me he was going away in his ship he agreed to take me with him on a little voyage leaving me with my mothers brother at the island of jamaica not far from spanish town in purposing this he thought no doubt that it would be far better for me to be with my own blood if his voyage should be long rather than to live with one who is no relative of mine and does not wish to act like one this then being my fathers intention which he was prevented by reasons which i know not of from carrying out i shall carry it out myself with all possible dispatch and go to my uncle in jamaica by the earliest vessel which sails from this port not only as this is my natural refuge in my trouble but as my father intended to go there when he thought of having me with him it may be a part of his plan to go there any way even though i be not with him and so i may see him and all may be well  clouds now settled heavily on the faces of each of the young men and even the ordinarily bright sky of dame charter became somewhat overcast although in her heart she did not believe that anybody in this world could have devised a better plan under the circumstances than this forsaken mistress kate bonnet  now there is my plan said kate with something of cheerfulness in her voice if it so be i can carry it out do either of you know glancing at the young men impartially but apparently not noticing the bad weather if in a reasonable time a vessel will leave here for jamaica  dickory knew well but he would not answer kate had no right to put such a thing upon him newcombe however did not hesitate it is very hard for me to say he made reply but there is a merchantman the king and queen which sails from here in three days for jamaica i know this for i send some goods and i wish mistress bonnet that i could say something against your sailing in her but i cannot for since you will not let me take care of you your uncle is surely the best one in the world to do it and as to the vessel i know she is a safe one  but you could not go sailing away in any vessel by yourself cried dame charter no matter how safe she may be  oh no cried kate and the more we talk about our plan the more fully it reveals itself to me in all its various parts i am going to ask you to go with me my dear dame charter and as she spoke she seized both of the hands of the other i have funds of my own which are invested in the town and i can afford the expense surely my good friend you will not let me go forth alone and all unused to travel leaving me safely with my uncle you could return when the ship came back to bridgetown  dame charter turned upon the girl a look of kind compassion but at the same time she knit her brows  right glad would i be to do that for you she said but i cannot go away and leave my son who has only me  take him with you cried kate two women travelling to unknown shores might readily need a protector and if not there are so many things which he might do think of it my dear dame charter to my uncles home in jamaica is the only place to which i can go and if you do not go with me how can i go there  dame charter now shed tears but they were the tears of one good woman feeling for the misfortunes of another  i will go with you my dear young lady she said and i will not leave you until you are in your uncles care and as to my boy here  now dickory spoke from out of the blazing noontide of his countenance  oh i will go he cried i do so greatly want to see jamaica  without being noticed his mother took him by the hand she did not know what he might be tempted to say next  mr newcombe stood very doleful and well he might for if his ladylove went away in this fashion there was good reason to suppose that he might never see her again but kate said no word to comfort himfor how could she in this companyand began to talk rapidly about her preparations  i suppose until the ship shall sail i may stay with you addressing dame charter  stay here exclaimed the good dame of course you can stay here we are like one family now and we will all go on board ship together  kate walked to the boat with mr newcombe he having offered to undertake her business in town and at her fathers house and to see the owners of the king and queen in regard to passage  dickory stood radiant speaking to no one master martin newcombe was the lover of mistress kate bonnet but he dickory was going with her to jamaica  the following days fled rapidly longvisaged martin newcombe whose labours in behalf of his lady were truly labours of love as their object was to help her to go where his eyes could no longer feast upon her and from which place her voice would no longer reach him went with a bitter taste in his mouth to visit madam bonnet to endeavour to persuade her to deliver to her stepdaughter such further belongings as that young lady was in need of  that forsaken person was found to be only too glad to comply with this request hoping earnestly that neither the property nor its owner should ever again be seen by her she was in high spirits believing that she was a much better manager of the plantation than her eccentric husband had ever been and she had already engaged a man to take the place of ben greenway who had been a sore trouble to her these many years she was buoyed up and cheered by the belief that the changes she was making would be permanent and that she would live and die the owner of the plantation she alone in all bridgetown and vicinity had no doubts whatever in regard to her husbands sailing from barbadoes in his own ship and with a redundancy of rascality below its decks the respectability and good reputation of major bonnet did not blind her eyes she had heard him talk about the humdrum life on shore and the reckless glories of the brave buccaneers but she had never replied to these remarks fearing that she might feel obliged to object to them and she did not tell him how in late years she had heard him talk in his sleep about standing with brandished sword on the deck of a pirate ship it was her dream that his dreams might all come true  so kates baggage was put on board the king and queen a very humble vessel considering her sounding name and dame charters few belongings were conveyed to the vessel in dickorys canoe the cottage being left in charge of a poor and wellpleased neighbour  when the day came for sailing our friends with not a few of the townspeople were gathered upon the deck where kate at first looked about for dickory not recognising at the moment the welldressed young fellow who had taken his place his sunday costume became him well and he was so bravely decked out in the matter of shoes and stockings that kate did not recognise him  to every one mistress kate bonnet made clear that she was going to her uncles house in jamaica where she expected to meet her father and many were the good wishes bestowed upon her when the time drew near when the anchor should be heaved kate withdrew to one side with mr newcombe you must believe said she kindly that everything between us is just as it was when we used to sit on the shady bank and look out over the ripples of the river there will be waves instead of ripples for us to look over now but there will be no change either the one way or the other  then they shook hands fervently more than that would have been unwarrantable  the king and queen dropped down the stream and master newcombe stood sadly on the pier while kate bonnet waved her handkerchief to him and to her friends dame charter sat and smiled at the town she was leaving and at the long stretches of the river before her she knew not to what future she was going but her heart was uplifted at the thought that a new life was opening before her son in her little cottage and in her little fields there was no future for him and now to what future might he not be sailing  as for dickory he knew no more of his future than the seabirds knew what was going to happen to them he cared no more for his future than the clouds cared whether they were moving east or west his life was like the sparkling air in which he moved and breathed he stood upon the deck of the vessel with the wind filling the sails above while at a little distance stood kate bonnet her ribbons floating in the breeze he would have been glad to sing aloud but he knew that that would not be proper in the presence of the ladies and the captain and so he let his heart do his singing which was not heard except by himself     chapter viii  ben greenway is convinced that bonnet is a pirate   but how in the name o common sense did ye ever think o becomin a pirate master bonnet said ben greenway as they stood together yere so little fitted for a wicked life  out upon you ben greenway exclaimed the captain beginning to stride up and down the little quarterdeck i will let you know that when the time comes for it i can be as wicked as anybody  i doubt that said ben sturdily would ye cut down an murder the innocent would ye drive them upon an unsteady plank an make them walk into the sea could ye raise thy great sword upon the widow an the orphan  no more of this disloyal speech shouted bonnet or i will put you upon a wavering plank and make you walk into the sea  now greenway laughed  an if ye did he said ye would next jump upon the plank yoursel an slide swiftly into the waves that ye might save your old friend an servant knowin he canna swim  ben greenway said bonnet folding his arms and knitting his brows i will not suffer such speech from you i would sooner have on board a presbyterian parson  an a happier fate couldna befall ye said ben for ye need a parson mair than ony mon i know  bonnet looked at him for a moment  you think so said he  indeed i do said ben with unction  there now cried bonnet i told you ben that i could be wicked upon occasion and now you have acknowledged it upon my word i can be wickeder than common as you shall see when good fortune helps us to overhaul a prize  the revenge had been at sea for about a week and all had gone well except she had taken no prizes the crew had been obedient and fairly orderly and if they made fun of their farmercaptain behind his back they showed no disrespect when his eyes were upon them the fact was that the most of them had a very great respect for him as the capitalist of the ships company  big sam had early begun to sound the temper of the men but they had not cared to listen to him good fare they had and generous treatment and the less they thought of bonnet as a navigator and commander the more they thought of his promises of rich spoils to be fairly divided with them when they should capture a spanish galleon or any wellladen merchantman bound for the marts of europe in fact when such good luck should befall them they would greatly prefer to find themselves serving under bonnet than under big sam the latter was known as a greedy scoundrel who would take much and give little being inclined moreover to cheat his shipmates out of even that little if the chance came to him even black paul who was an old comrade of big samthe two having done much wickedness togetherpaid no heed to his present treasons  let the old fool alone he said we fare well and our lives are easy having three men to do the work of one so say i let us sail on and make merry with his good rum his moneychest is heavy yet  thats what im thinking of said the sailingmaster why should i be coursing about here looking for prizes with that chest within reach of my very arm whenever i choose it  black paul grinned and said to himself it is your arm old sam that i am afraid of then aloud no let him go let us profit by our good treatment as long as it lasts and then we will talk about the moneybox  thus big sam found that his time had not arrived and he swore in his soul that his old shipmate would some day rue that he had not earlier stood by him in his treacherous schemes  so all went on without open discontent and bonnet having sailed northward for some days set his course to the southeast with some hundred and fifty eyes wide open for the sight of a heavysailing merchantman  one morning they sighted a brig sailing southward but as she was of no great size and not going in the right direction to make it probable that she carried a cargo worth their while they turned westward and ran towards cuba had captain bonnet known that his daughter was on the brig which he thus disdained his mind would have been far different but as it was not knowing anything more than he could see and not understanding much of that he kept his westerly course and on the next day the lookout sighted a goodsized merchantman bearing eastward  now bounded every heart upon the swiftly coursing vessel of the planterpirate there were men there who had shared in the taking of many a prize who had shared in the blood and the cruelty and the booty and their brawny forms trembled with the old excitement of the seachase but no mans blood ran more swiftly no mans eyes glared more fiercely than those of captain bonnet as he strapped on his pistols and felt of his swordhilt  ah ye needna glare so said ben greenway close at his side ye are no pirate an ye canna make yoursel believe ye are ane an that ye shall see when the guns begin to roar an the swordblades flash better get below an let ane o these hairy scoundrels descend into hell in your place  captain bonnet turned with rage upon ben greenway but the latter having spoken his mind and given his advice had retired  now came big sam tis an english brig he said most likely from jamaica homeward bound she should be a good prize  bonnet winced a little at this he would have preferred to begin his career of piracy by capturing some foreign vessel leaving english prizes for the future when he should have become better used to his new employment but sensitiveness does not do for pirates and in a moment he had recovered himself and was as bold and bloodyminded as he had been when he first saw the now rapidly approaching vessel all nations were alike to him now and he belonged to none  fire some guns at her he shouted to big sam and run up the jolly roger let the rascals see what we are  the rascals saw down came their flag and presently their vessel was steered into the wind and lay to  shall we board her cried big sam  ay board her shouted back the infuriated bonnet run the revenge alongside get out your grapplingirons and let every man with sword and pistols bound upon her deck  the merchantman now lay without headway gently rolling on the sea down came the sails of the revenge while her motion grew slower and slower as she approached her victim had captain bonnet been truly sailing the revenge he would have run by with sails all set for not a thought had he for the management of his own vessel so intent he was upon the capture of the other but fortunately big sam knew what was necessary to be done in a nautical manoeuvre of this kind and his men did not all stand ready with their swords in their hands to bound upon the deck of the merchantman but there were enough of pirate bonnets crew crowded alongside the rail of the vessel to inspire terror in any peaceable merchantman and this one although it had several carronades and other guns upon her deck showed no disposition to use them the odds against her being far too great  at the very head of the long line of ruffians upon the deck of the revenge stood ben greenway and although he held no sword and wore no pistol his eyes flashed as brightly as any glimmering blade in the whole ships company  the two vessels were now drawing very near to each other men with grapplingirons stood ready to throw them and the bow of the wellsteered pirate had almost touched the side of the merchantman when with a bound of which no one would have considered him capable the good ben greenway jumped upon the rail and sprang down upon the deck of the other vessel this was a hazardous feat and if the scotchman had known more about nautical matters he would not have essayed it before the two vessels had been fastened together ignorance made him fearless and he alighted in safety on the deck of the merchantman at the very instant when the two vessels having touched separated themselves from each other for the space of a yard or two  there was a general shout from the deck of the pirate at this performance of ben greenway nobody could understand it captain bonnet stood and yelled  what are you about ben greenway have you gone mad without sword or pistol youll be  the astonished bonnet did not finish his sentence for his power of speech left him when he saw ben greenway hurry up to the captain of the merchantman who was standing unarmed with his crew about him and warmly shake that dumfounded skipper by the hand in their surprise at what they beheld the pirates had not thrown their grapnels at the proper moment and now the two vessels had drifted still farther apart  presently ben greenway came hurrying to the side of the merchantman dragging its captain by the hand  master bonnet master bonnet he cried this is your old friend abner marchand o our town an this is his good ship the amanda i knew her when i first caught sight o her figurehead havin seen it so often at her pier at bridgetown an so now that ye know wha it is that ye hae inadvertently captured ye may ca off your men an bid them sheathe their frightful cutlasses  at this a roar arose from the pirates who having thrown some of their grapplingirons over the gunwale of the merchantman were now pulling hard upon them to bring the two vessels together and captain bonnet shouted back at ben what are you talking about you drivelling idiot havent you told mr marchand that i am a pirate  indeed i hae no cried ben for i dont believe ye are are at least no to your friends an neebours  to this bonnet made a violent reply but it was not heard the two vessels had now touched and the crowd of yelling pirates had leaped upon the deck of the amanda bonnet was not far behind his men and sword in hand he rushed towards the spot where stood the merchant captain with his crew hustling together behind him as there was no resistance there was so far no fighting and the pirates were tumbling over each other in their haste to get below and find out what sort of a cargo was carried by this easy prize  captain marchand held out his hand goodday to you friend bonnet he said i had hoped that you would be one of the first friends i should meet when i reached port at bridgetown but i little thought to meet you before i got there  bonnet was a little embarrassed by the peculiarity of the situation but his heart was true to his new career  friend marchand he said i see that you do not understand the state of affairs and ben greenway there should have told you the moment he met you i am no longer a planter of barbadoes i am a pirate of the sea and the jolly roger floats above my ship i belong to no nation my hand is against all the world you and your ship have been captured by me and my men and your cargo is my prize now what have you got on board where do you hail from and whither are you bound  captain marchand looked at him fixedly  i sailed from london with a cargo of domestic goods for kingston thence having disposed of most of my cargo i am on my way to bridgetown where i hope to sell the remainder  your goods will never reach bridgetown cried bonnet they belong now to my men and me  what cried ben greenway ye speak wiout sense or reason hae ye forgotten that this is mr abner marchand your fellowvestryman an your senior warden an to him do ye talk o takin awa his goods an legal chattels  bonnet looked at greenway with indignation and contempt  now listen to me he yelled to the devil with the vestry and da the scotchmans eyes and mouth were so rounded with horror that bonnet stopped and changed his form of expressionconfound the senior warden i am the pirate bonnet and regard not the church of england  nor your friends interpolated ben  nor friends nor any man shouted bonnet  abner marchand i am sorry that your vessel should be the first one to fall into my power but that has happened and there is no help for it my men are below ransacking your hold for the goods and treasure it may contain when your cargo or what we want of it is safe upon my ship i shall burn your vessel and you and your men must walk the plank  at this dreadful statement ben greenway staggered backward in speechless dismay  yes cried bonnet that shall i do for there is naught else i can do and then you shall see you doubting greenway whether i am a pirate or no  to all this captain marchand said not a word but at this moment a womans scream was heard from below and then there was another scream from another woman captain marchand started  your men have wandered into my cabin he exclaimed and they have frightened my passengers shall i go and bring them up major bonnet they will be better here  ay ay cried the pirate captain surprised that there should be female passengers on board and marchand followed by ben greenway disappeared below  confound women passengers said bonnet to himself that is truly a bit of bad luck  in a few minutes marchand was back bringing with him a middleaged and somewhat pudgy woman very pale a younger woman of exceeding plainness and sobbing steadfastly and also an elderly man evidently an invalid and wearing a long dressinggown  these said captain marchand are master and madam ballinger and daughter of york in england who have been sojourning in jamaica for the health of the gentleman but are now sailing with me to barbadoes hoping the air of our good island may be more salubrious for the lungs  captain bonnet had never been in the habit of speaking loudly before ladies but he now felt that he must stand by his character  you cannot have heard he almost shouted that i am the pirate bonnet and that your vessel is now my prize  at this the two ladies began to scream vigorously and the form of the gentleman trembled to such a degree that his cane beat a tattoo upon the deck  yes continued bonnet when my men have stripped this ship of its valuables i shall burn her to the waters edge and having removed you to my vessel i shall shortly make you walk the plank  here the younger lady began to stiffen herself out as if she were about to faint in the arms of captain marchand who had suddenly seized her but her great curiosity to hear more kept her still conscious mrs ballinger grew very red in the face  that cannot be she cried you may do what you please with our belongings and with captain marchands ship but my husband is too sick a man to walk a plank you have not noticed perchance that his legs are so feeble that he could scarce mount from the cabin to the deck it would be impossible for him to walk a plank and as for my daughter and myself we know nothing about such a thing and could not out of sheer ignorance  for a moment a shadow of perplexity fell upon captain bonnets face he could readily perceive that the infirm mr ballinger could not walk a plank or even mount one unless some one went with him to assist him and as to his wife she was evidently a termagant and having sailed his ship and floated his jolly roger in order to get rid of one termagant he was greatly annoyed at being brought thus face to face with another he stood for a moment silent the old gentleman looked as if he would like to go down to his cabin and cover up his head with his blanket until all this commotion should be over the daughter sobbed as she gazed about her taking in every point of this most novel situation and the mother with dilated nostrils still glared  in the midst of all this varying disturbance captain marchand stood quiet and unmoved apparently paying no attention to any one except his old neighbour and fellowvestryman stede bonnet upon whose face his eyes were steadily fixed  ben greenway now approached the pirate captain and led him aside  let your men make awa wi the cargo as they pleasei doubt if it be more than odds an ends for such are the goods they bring to bridgetownan let them cast off an go their way an ye an i will return to bridgetown in the amanda an a may yet be weel this bit o folly bein forgotten  it might have been supposed that bonnet would have retaliated upon the scotchman for thus advising him in the very moment of triumph to give up his piratical career and to go home quietly to his plantation but instead of that he paused for a moments reflection  ben greenway said he there is good sense in what you say in truth i cannot bring myself to put to death my old friend and neighbour and his helpless passengers as for the ship it will do me no more good burned than unburned and there is another thing ben greenway which i would fain do and it just came into my mind i will write a letter to my wife and one to my daughter kate there is much which i wish them to know and which i have not yet been able to communicate i will allow the amanda to go on her way and i will send these two letters by her captain they shall be ready presently and you ben stand by these people and see that no harm comes to them  at this moment there were loud shouts and laughter from below and captain marchand came forward  friend bonnet he said your men have discovered my store of spirits in a short time they will be drunk and it will then be unsafe for these my passengers bid them i pray you to convey the liquors aboard your ship  well said cried bonnet i would not lose those spirits and stepping forward he spoke to big sam who had just appeared on deck and ordered the casks to be conveyed on board the revenge  the latter laughed but said ay ay sir  returning to captain marchand bonnet said i will now step on board my ship and write some letters which i shall ask you to take to bridgetown with you i shall be ready by the time the rest of your cargo is removed  oh dont do that cried ben there is surely pen an paper here close to your hand go down to captain marchands cabin an write your letters  no no cried bonnet i have my own conveniences and with that he leaped on board the revenge  thats a chance gone said ben greenway to captain marchand a good chance gone if we could hae kept him on board here an down in your cabin i might hae passed the word to that big miscreant the sailingmaster to cast off an get awa wi that wretched crowd the scoundrels will be glad to steal the ship an it will be the salvation o master bonnet if they do it  if thats the case said captain marchand why should we resort to trickery if his men want his ship and dont want him why cant we seize him when he comes on board with his letters and then let his men know that they are free to go to the devil in any way they please then we can convey major bonnet to his home to repentance perhaps and a better life  thats good said ben but no to punishment ye an i could testify that his head is turned but that when kindness to a neebour is concerned his heart is all right  ay ay said the captain i could swear to that and now we must act together when i put my hand on him you do the same and give him no chance to use his sword or pistols  the captain of the pirates sat down in his wellfurnished little room to write his letters and the noise and confusion on deck the swearing and the singing and the shouting to be heard everywhere did not seem to disturb him in the least he was a man whose mind could thoroughly engage itself with but one thing at a time and the fact that his men were at work sacking the merchantman did not in the least divert his thoughts from his pen and paper  so he quietly wrote to his wife that he had embraced a pirates life that he never expected to become a planter again and that he left to her the enjoyment and management of his estate in barbadoes he hoped that his absence having now relieved her of her principal reason for discontent with her lot she would become happy and satisfied and would allow those about her to be the same he expected to send ben greenway back to her to help take care of her affairs but if she should need further advice he advised her to speak to master newcombe  the letter to his daughter was different it was very affectionate he assured her of his sorrow at not being able to take her with him and to leave her at jamaica and he urged her at the earliest possible moment to go to her uncle and to remain there until she heard from him or saw himthe latter being probable as he intended to visit jamaica as soon as he could even in disguise if this method were necessary he alluded to the glorious career upon which he was entering and in which he expected some day to make a great name for himself of which he hoped she would be proud  when these letters were finished bonnet hurried to the side of the vessel and looked upon the deck of the amanda  captain marchand and greenway had been waiting in anxious expectation for the return of bonnet and wondering how in the world a man could bring his mind to write letters at such a time as this  take these letters ben he said leaning over the rail and give them to captain marchand  ben greenway at first declined to take the letters which bonnet held out to him but the latter now threw them at his feet on the deck and running forward he soon found himself in a violent and disorderly crowd who did not seem to regard him at all booty and drink were all they cared for presently came big sam giving orders and thrusting the men before him he had not been drinking and was in full possession of his crafty senses  throw off the grapnels exclaimed big sam and get up the foresel and then he perceived bonnet with a scowl upon his face big sam muttered i thought you were on the merchantman but no matter shove her off i say or ill break your heads  the grapnels were loosened the few men who were on duty shoved desperately the foresail went up and the two vessels began to separate but they were not a foot apart when with a great rush and scramble ben greenway left the merchantman and tumbled himself on board the revenge  bonnet rushed up to him you scoundrel you rascal ben greenway what do you mean i intended you to go back to bridgetown on that brig can i never get rid of you  no till ye give up piratin said ben with a grin ye may split open my head an throw overboard my corpse but my live body stays here as long as ye do  with a savage growl bonnet turned away from his faithful adherent things were getting very serious now and he could waste no time on personal quarrels great holes and splits had been discovered in the heads of the barrels of spirits and the precious liquor was running over the decks this was the work of the sagacious big sam who had the strongest desire to get away from the amanda before the pirate crew became so drunk that they could not manage the vessel he was a deep man that big sam and at this moment although he said nothing about it he considered himself the captain of the pirate ship which he sailed  for a time bonnet hurried about not knowing what to do some of the men were quarrelling about the booty others trying to catch the rum as it flowed from the barrels others howling out of pure devilishness and no one paying him any respect whatever big sam was giving orders a few sober men were obeying him and captain stede bonnet with his faithful servant ben greenway seemed to be entirely out of place amid this horrible tumult  i told ye said ben ye had better stayed on board that merchantman an gone back like a christian to your ain hame an family it will be no safe place for ye or for me neither when that blackhearted scoundrel o a big sam gets time to attend to ye  blackhearted inquired bonnet but without any surprise in his voice  ay said ben if theres onything blacker than his heart only satan himsel ever looked at it it was to be sailin this ship on his own account that hes had in his villainous soul ever since he came on board an i can tell ye master bonnet that it wont be long now before hes doin it i had me eye on him when he was on board the amanda an i saw that the scoundrel was goin to separate the ships  that was my will said bonnet although i did not order it  ben gave a little grunt ay said he hopin to leave me behind just as he was hopin to leave ye behind but neither o ye got your wills an itll be the deil thatll have a hand in the next leavin behind thats likely to be done  bonnet made no reply to these remarks having suddenly spied black paul  look here said he stepping up to that sombrehued personage can you sail a ship  the other looked at bonnet in astonishment i should say so said he i have commanded vessels before now  here then said bonnet i want a sailingmaster i am not satisfied with this big sam i am no navigator myself but i want a better man than that fellow to sail my ship for me  black paul looked hard at him but made no answer  he thinks he is sailing the ship for himself said bonnet and it would be a bad day for you men if he did  that indeed would it said black paul a closefisted scoundrel as i know him to be  quick then said bonnet now youre my sailingmaster and after this when we divide the prizes you take the same share that i do as to these goods from the amanda i will have no part at all i give them all to you and the rest divided according to rule  go you now among the men and speak first to such as have taken the least liquor let them know that it was big sam that broke in the hogsheads which but for that would have been sold and divided go quickly and get about you a halfdozen good fellows  yere gettin wickeder and wickeder said ben when black paul had hurried away the deil himsel couldna hae taught ye a craftier trick than that weel ye kenned that that black fellow would fain serve under a freehanded fool than a stingy knave ay sir your educations progressin  at this moment big sam came hurrying by not wishing to excite suspicion bonnet addressed him a question but instead of answering the burly pirate swore at him ill attend to your business said he as soon as i have my sails set then ill give you two leatherheaded landsmen all the hoisting and lowering youll ever ask for then with another explosion of oaths he passed on  bonnet and ben stood waiting with much impatience and anxiety but presently came black paul with a party of brawny pirates following him  come now said bonnet walking boldly aft towards big sam who was still cursing and swearing right and left bonnet stepped up to him and touched him on the arm look ye said he youre no longer sailingmaster on this ship i dont like your ways or your fashions step forward then and go to the focastle where you belong this good mariner pointing to black paul will take your place and sail the revenge  big sam turned and stood astounded staring at bonnet he spoke no word but his face grew dark and his great eyebrows were drawn together his mouth was half open as if he were about to yell or swear then suddenly his right hand fell upon the hilt of his cutlass and the great blade flashed in the air he gave one bound towards bonnet and in the same second the cutlass came down like a stroke of lightning but bonnet had been a soldier and had learned how to use his sword the cutlass was caught on his quick blade and turned aside at this moment black paul sprung at big sam and seized him by the sword arm while another fellow taking his cue grabbed him by the shoulder  now some of you fellows shouted bonnet seize him by the legs and heave him overboard  this order was obeyed almost as soon as it was given four burly pirates rushed big sam to the bulwarks and with a great heave sent him headforemost over the rail in the next instant he had disappearedgone passed out of human sight or knowledge  now then mr paulnot knowing your other name  which it is bittern said the other  you are now sailingmaster of this ship and when things are straightened out a bit you can come below and sign articles with me  ay ay sir said black paul and calling to the men he gave orders that they go on with the setting of the maintopsail  now truly said ben i believe that yere a pirate  bonnet looked at him much pleased i told you so my good ben i knew that the time would come when you would acknowledge that i am a true pirate after this you cannot doubt it any more  never again master bonnet said ben greenway gravely shaking his head never again                                       the brig amanda with full sails and an empty hold bent her course eastward to the island of barbadoes and the next morning when the drunken sailors on board the revenge were able to look about them and consider things they found their vessel speeding towards the coast of cuba and sailed by black paul bittern     chapter ix  dickory sets forth   mr felix delaplaine merchant and planter of spanish town the capital of jamaica occupied a commodious house in the suburbs of the town twelve miles up the river from kingston the seaport which establishment was somewhat remarkable from the fact that there were no women in the family madam delaplaine had been dead for several years and as her husbands fortune had steadily thriven he now found himself possessor of a home in which he could be as independent and as comfortable as if he had been the president and sole member of a club  being of a genial disposition and disposed to look most favourably upon his possessions and surrounding conditions mr delaplaine had come to be of the opinion that his lot in life was one in which improvement was not to be expected and scarcely to be desired he had been perfectly happy with his wife and had no desire to marry another who could not possibly equal her and having no children he continually thanked his happy stars that he was free from the troubles and anxieties which were so often brought upon fathers by their sons and their daughters  into this quiet and selfsatisfied life came one morning a great surprise in the shape of a beautiful young woman who entered his office in spanish town and who stated to him that she was the daughter of his only sister and that she had come to live with him there was an elderly dame and a young man in company with the beautiful visitor but mr delaplaine took no note of them with his nieces hands in his own gazing into the face so like that young face in whose company he had grown from childhood to manhood mr delaplaine saw in a flash that since the death of his wife until that moment he had never had the least reason to be content with the world or to be satisfied with his lot this was his sisters child come to live with him  when mr delaplaine sufficiently recovered his ordinary good sense to understand that there were other things in this world besides the lovely niece who had so suddenly appeared before him he remembered that she had a father and many questions were asked and answered and he was told who dame charter was and why her son came with her then the uncle and the niece walked into the garden and there talked of major bonnet little did kate know upon this subject and nothing could her uncle tell her but in many and tender words she was assured that this was her home as long as she chose to live in it and that it was the most fortunate thing in the world that dame charter had come with her and could stay with her had this not been so where could he have found such a guardian angel such a chaperon for this tender niece as for the young man it was such rare good luck that he had been able to accompany the two ladies and give them his protection he was just the person mr delaplaine believed who would be invaluable to him either on the plantation or in his countinghouse in any case here was their home and here too was the home of his brotherinlaw bonnet whenever he chose to give up his strange fancy for the sea it was not now to be thought of that kate or her father or either one of them should go back to barbadoes to live with the impossible madam bonnet  if her fathers vessel were in the harbour and he were here with them or even if she had had good tidings from him kate bonnet would have been a very happy girl for her present abode was vastly different from any home she had ever known her uncles house on the highlands beyond the town lay in a region of cooler breezes and more bracing air than that of barbadoes books and music and the general air of refinement recalled her early life with her mother and with the exception of the anxiety about her father there were no clouds in the bright blue skies of kate bonnet but this anxiety was a cloud and it was spreading                                       when the amanda moved away from the side of the pirate vessel revenge she hoisted all sail and got away over the sea as fast as the prevailing wind could take her when she passed the bar below bridgetown and came to anchor captain marchand immediately lowered a boat and was rowed up the river to the recent residence of major stede bonnet and there he delivered two lettersone to the wife of that gentleman and the other for his daughter then the captain rowed back and went into the town where he annoyed and nearly distracted the citizens by giving them the most cautious and expurgated account of the considerate and friendly manner in which the amanda had been relieved of her cargo by his old friend and fellowvestryman major bonnet  captain marchand had been greatly impressed by the many things which ben greenway had said about his masters present most astounding freak and hoping in his heart that repentance and a suitable reparation might soon give this hitherto estimable man an opportunity to return to his former place in society he said as little as he could against the name and fame of this once respected fellowcitizen when he communicated with the english owners of his now departed cargo he would know what to say to them but here safe in harbour with his vessel and his passengers he preferred to wait for a time before entirely blackening the character of the man who had allowed him to come here like the faithful ben greenway he did not yet believe in stede bonnets piracy  madam bonnet read her letter and did not like it in fact she thought it shameful then she opened and read the letter to her stepdaughter this she did not like either and she put it away in a drawer she would have nothing to do with the transmission of such an epistle as this most abominable when contrasted with the scurrilous screed he had written to her                                       day after day passed on and kate bonnet arose each morning feeling less happy than on the day before but at last a letter came brought by a french vessel which had touched at barbadoes this letter was to kate from martin newcombe it was a loveletter a very earnest ardent loveletter but it did not make the young girl happy for it told her very little about her father the heart of the lover was so tender that he would say nothing to his lady which might give her needless pain he had heard what captain marchand had told and he had not understood it and could only half believe it kate must know far more about all this painful business than he did for her fathers letter would tell her all he wished her to know therefore why should he discuss that most distressing and perplexing subject which he knew so little about and which she knew all about so he merely touched upon major bonnet and his vessel and hoped that she might soon write to him and tell him what she cared for him to know what she cared for him to tell to the people of bridgetown and what she wished to repose confidentially to his honour but whatever she chose to say to him or not to say to him he would have her remember that his heart belonged to her and ever would belong no matter what might happen or what might be said for good or for bad on the sea or the land by friends or enemies  this was a rarely good loveletter but it plunged kate into the deepest woe and dickory saw this first of all he had brought the letter and for the second time he saw tears in her eyes the absence of news of major bonnet was soon known to the rest of the family and then there were other tears it was perfectly plain even to dame charter that things had been said in bridgetown which mr newcombe had not cared to write  no dame charter said kate i cannot talk to you about it my uncle has already spoken words of comfort but neither you nor he know more than i do and i must now think a little for myself if i can  so saying she walked out into the grounds to a spot at a little distance where dickory stood reflectively gazing out over the landscape  dickory said the girl my mind is filled with horrible doubts i have heard of the talk in bridgetown before we left and now here is this letter from mr newcombe from which i cannot fail to see that there must have been other talk that he considerately refrains from telling me  he should not have written such a letter exclaimed dickory hotly he might have known it would have set you to suspecting things  you dont know what you are talking about you foolish boy said she it is a very proper letter about things you dont understand  she stepped a little closer to him as if she feared some one might hear her dickory said she he did not put that thing into my mind it was there already that was a dreadful ship dickory and it was filled with dreadful men if he had not intended to go with them he would not have put himself into their power and if he had not intended to be long away he would not have planned to leave me here with my uncle  you ought not to think such a thing as that for one minute cried dickory i would not think so about my mother no matter what happened  she smiled slightly as she answered i would my father were a mother and then i need not think such things but dickory if he had but written to me and in all this time he might have written knowing how i must feel  dickory stood silent his bosom heaving suddenly he turned sharply towards her of course he has written said he but how could his letter come to you we know not where he has sailed and besides who could have told him you had already gone to your uncle but the people at bridgetown must know things i believe that he has written there  why do you believe that she asked eagerly with one hand on his arm  i think it said dickory his cheeks a little ruddier in their brownness because there is more known there than master newcombe chose to put into his letter if he has not written how should they know more  she now looked straight into his eyes and as he returned the gaze he could see in her pupils his head and his straw hat with the clear sky beyond  dickory she said if he wrote to anybody he also wrote to me and that letter is still there  that is what i believe said he and i have been believing it  then why didnt you say so to me you wretched boy cried kate you ought to have known how that would have comforted me if i could only think he has surely written my heart would bound no matter what his letter told but to be utterly dropped that i cannot bear  you have not been dropped he exclaimed and you shall know it kate i am going  nay nay she exclaimed you must not call me that  but you call me dickory he said  true but you are so much younger  younger he exclaimed in a tone of contempt not for the speaker but for the word she had spoken eleven months  she laughed a little laugh her nature was so full of it that even now she could not keep it back  you must have been making careful computation she said but it does not matter you must not call me kate and i shall keep on calling you dickory i could not help it now where is it you were about to say you were going  if you think me old enough said he i am going to barbadoes in the king and queen she sails tomorrow i shall find out about everything and i shall get your letter then i shall come back and bring it to you  dickory she exclaimed and her eyes glowed  there was silence for some moments and then he spoke for it was necessary for him to say something although he would have been perfectly content to stand there speechless so long as her eyes still glowed  if i dont go said he it may be long before you hear from him having written he will wait for an answer  she thought of no difficulties no delays no dangers how happy you have made me dickory she said it is this dreadful ignorance these fearful doubts of which i ought to be ashamed but if i get his letter if i know he has not deserted me  you shall get it he cried and you shall know  dickory said she you said that exactly as you spoke when you told me that if i let myself drop into the darkness you would be there  and you shall find me there now said he always if you need me you shall find me there  dame charter had been standing and watching this interview her foolish motherly heart filled with the brightest most unreasonable dreams and why should she not dream even if she knew her dreams would never come true in a few short weeks that dickory boy had grown to be a man and what should not be dreamed about a man  as kate ran by the open door towards her uncles apartments dame charter rose up surprised  what have you been saying to her dickory she exclaimed do you know something we have not heard have you been giving her news of her father  no said the son who had so lately been a boy i have no news to give her but i am going to get news for her  she looked at him in amazement then she exclaimed you  yes he said there is no one else and besides i would not want any one else to do it i am going to bridgetown in the brig which brought us here it is a little sail and when i get there i will find out everything no matter what has happened it will break her heart to think that her father deserted her without a word i dont believe he did it and i shall go and find out  but dickory she said with anxious upraised face how can you get back do you know of any vessel that will be sailing this way  he laughed  get back if i go alone dear mother you may be sure i shall soon get back craft of all kinds sail one way or another and there are many ways in which i can get back not thought of in ordinary passage when any kind of a vessel sails from jamaica i can get on board of her whether she takes passengers or not i can sleep on a bale of goods or on the bare deck i can work with the crew if need be oh you need not doubt that i shall speedily come back  they talked long together this mother and this son and it was her golden dreams for him that made her invoke heavens blessings upon him and tell him to go she knew too that it was wise for her to tell him to go and to bless him for it would have been impossible to withstand him so set was he in his purpose  i tell you dame charter said mr delaplaine an hour later this son of yours should be a great credit and pride to you and he will be i stake my word upon it  he is now said the good woman quietly  i have been pondering in my brain said he what i should do to relieve my niece of this burden of anxiety which is weighing upon her i could see no way for letters would be of no use not knowing where to send them and it would be dreary indeed to sit and wait and sigh and dream bad dreams until chance throws some light upon this grievous business and here steps up this young fellow and settles the whole matter when he comes back dame charter i shall do well for him i shall put him in my countinghouse for although doubtless he would fain live his young life in the fields and under the open sky he will find the countinghouse lies on the road to fortune and good fortune he deserves  if that loving mother could have composed this speech for master delaplaine to make she could not have suited it better to her desires  when the king and queen was nearly ready to sail dickory charter having been detained by mr delaplaine who wished the young man to travel as one of importance and plentiful resources hurried to the house to take his final instructions from mistress kate bonnet in whose service he was now setting forth it might have been supposed by some that no further instructions were necessary but how could dickory know that he was right kate met him before he reached the house  i am so glad to see you again before you sail she said one thing was forgotten you may see my father his cruise may be over and he may be even now preparing for me to come back to bridgetown if this be so urge him rather to come here i had not thought of your seeing him dickory and i did not write to him but you will know what to say you have heard that woman talk of me and you well know i cannot go back to my old home  oh i will say all that he exclaimed it will be the same thing as if you had written him a long letter and now i must run back for the boat is ready to take me down the river to the port  dickory said she and she put out her handhe had never held that hand beforeyou are so true dickory you are so noble you are going it was in her mind to say you are going as my knighterrant but she deemed that unsuitable and she changed it toyou are going to do so much for me  she stopped for a moment and then she said you know i told you you should not call me kate being so much younger but as you are so much younger you may kiss me if you like  like     chapter x  captain christopher vince   it was truly surprising to see the change which came over the spirits of our young kate bonnet when she heard that the king and queen had sailed from kingston port she was gay she was talkative she sang songs she skipped in the paths of the garden one might have supposed she was so happy to get rid of the young man on the brig which had sailed away and yet the news she might hear when that young man came back was likely to be far worse than any misgivings which had entered her mind kates high spirits delighted her uncle this child of his sister had grown more lovely than even her mother had ever been  now came days of delight which kate had never dreamed of she had not known that there were such shops in spanish town which although a youngish town had already drawn to itself the fashion and the needs of fashion of that prosperous colony with dame charter and often also with her uncle in company this bright young girl hovered over fair fabrics which were spread before her circled about jewels gems and feathers and revelled in tender colours as would a butterfly among the blossoms dipping and tasting as she flew  there were some fine folk in spanish town and with this pleasant society of the capital mr delaplaine renewed his previous intercourse and kate soon learned the pleasures of a colonial social circle whose attractions brought from afar had been warmed into a more cheerful glow in this bright west indian atmosphere  to add to the brilliancy of the new life into which kate now entered there came into the port an english corvettethe badgerfor refitting from this welcome manofwar there flitted up the river to spanish town gallant officers young and older and in their flitting they flitted into the drawingroom of the rich merchant delaplaine and there were some of them who soon found that there were no drawingrooms in all the town where they could talk with walk with and perchance dance with such a fine girl as mistress kate bonnet  kate greatly fancied gallant partners whether for walking or talking or dancing and among such those which came from the corvette in the harbour pleased her most  those were not bright days for dame charter do what she would her optimism was growing dim and what helped to dim it was kates gaiety it did not comfort her at all when kate told her that she was so lighthearted because she knew that dickory would bring her good news  truly too many fine young men here thought dame charter while dickory is away and all of them together are not worth a curl on his head  but although her dreams were dimmed she did not cease dreaming a stouthearted woman was dickorys mother  but it was not long before there were other people thereabout who began to feel that their prospects for present enjoyment were beginning to look a little dim for captain christopher vince having met mistress kate bonnet at an entertainment at the governors house was greatly struck by this young lady each officer of the badger who saw their captain in company with the fair one to whom their gallant attentions had been so freely offered now felt that in love as well as in accordance with the regulations of the service he must give place to his captain moreover when that captain took upon himself the very next day to call at the residence of mr delaplaine and repeated the visit upon the next day and the following the crestfallen young fellows were compelled to acknowledge that there were other houses in the town where it might be better worth their while to spend their leisure hours  captain vince was not a man to be lightly interfered with whether he happened to be engaged in the affairs of mars or cupid he was of a resolute mind and of a person more than usually agreeable to the female eye he was about forty years of age of an excellent english family and with good expectations he considered himself an admirable judge of women but he had never met one who so thoroughly satisfied his aesthetic taste as this fair niece of the merchant delaplaine she had beauty she had wit she had culture and the fair fabrics of spanish town shops gave to her attractions a setting which would have amazed and entranced master newcombe or our good dickory the soul of captain vince was fired and each time he met kate and talked with her the fire grew brighter  he had never considered himself a marrying man but that was because he had never met any one he had cared to marry now things were changed here was a girl he had known but for a few days and already in his imagination he had placed her in the drawingrooms of the english home he hoped soon to inherit more beautiful and even more like a princess than any noble dame who was likely to frequent those rooms in fancy he had seen her by his side walking through the shaded alleys of his grand old gardens he had looked proudly upon her as she stood by him in the assemblages of the great in fact he had fallen suddenly and absolutely in love with her when he was away from her he could not quite understand this condition of things but when he was with her again he understood it all he loved her because it was absolutely impossible for him to do anything else  naturally captain vince was very agreeable to mistress kate for she had never seen such a handsome man taking into consideration his uniform and his bearing and had never talked with one who knew so well what to say and how to say it comparing him with the young officers who had been so fond of making their way to her uncles house she was glad that they had ceased to be such frequent visitors  the soul of mr delaplaine was agitated by the admiration of his niece which captain vince took no trouble to conceal the worthy merchant would gladly have kept kate with him for years and years if she would have been content to stay but this could not be expected and if she married from what other quarter could come such a brilliant match as this what his brotherinlaw might think about it he did not care if kate should choose to wed the captain such an eccentric and untrustworthy person should not be permitted to interfere with the destiny that now appeared to open before his daughter these thoughts were not so idle as might have been supposed for the captain had already said things to the merchant in which the circumstances of the former were made plain and his hopes foreshadowed if the captain were not prepared to leave the service this rich merchant thought why should not he make it possible for him to do so for the sake of his dear niece  with these high ambitions in his mind the happily agitated mr delaplaine did not hesitate to say some playful words to kate concerning the captain of the badger and these having been received quietly he was emboldened to go on and say some other words more serious  then kate looked at him very steadfastly and remarked but uncle you have forgotten master newcombe  the good delaplaine made no answer for his emotions made it impossible for him to do so but rising he went out and at a little distance from the house he damned master newcombe  days passed on and the captains attentions did not wane mr delaplaine who was a man of honour expecting it in others made up his mind that something decisive must soon be said while kate began greatly to fear that something decisive might soon be said she was in a difficult position she was not engaged to martin newcombe but had believed she might be the whole affair involved a question which she did not want to consider and still the captain came every day generally in the afternoon or evening  but one morning he made his appearance coming to the house quite abruptly  i am glad to find you by yourself said he for i have some awkward news  kate looked at him surprised  i have just been ordered on duty he continued and the order is most unwelcome a brig came in last night and brought letters and the governor sent for me this morning i have just left him the cruise i am about to take may not be a long one but i cannot leave port without coming here to you and speaking to you of something which is nearer to my heart than any thought of service or in fact of anything else  speaking to my uncle you mean said kate now much disturbed for she saw in the captains eyes what he wished to talk of  away with uncles he exclaimed we can speak with them byandbye now my words are for you you may think me hasty but we gentlemen serving the king cannot afford to wait and so without other pause i say sweet mistress kate i love you better than i have ever loved woman better than i can ever love another nay do not answer i must tell you everything before you reply and to the pale girl he spoke of his family his prospects and his hopes in the warmest colours he laid before her the life and love he would give her then he went quickly on this is but a little matter which is given to my charge and it may not engage me long i am going out in search of a pirate and i shall make short work of him the shorter having such good reason to get quickly back  in fact he is not a real pirate anyway being but a country gentleman tiring of his rural life and liking better to rob burn and murder on the high seas he has already done so much damage that if his evil career be not soon put an end to good people will be afraid to voyage in these waters so i am to sail in haste after this fellow bonnet but before  kates face had grown so white that it seemed to recede from her great eyes he is my father said she but i had not heard until now that he is a pirate  the captain started from his chair what he cried your father yes i see it did not strike me until this instant that the names are the same  kate rose and as she spoke her voice was not full and clear as it was wont to be he is my father she said but he sailed away without telling me his errand but now that i know everything i must if she had intended to say she must go she changed her mind and even came closer to the still astounded captain you say that you will make short work of his vessel do you mean that you will destroy it and will you kill him   illustration he is my father said kate  captain vince looked down upon her his face filled with the liveliest emotions my dear young lady he said and then he stopped as if not knowing what words to use but as he looked into her eyes fixed upon his own and waiting for his answer his love for her took possession of him and banished all else kill him he exclaimed never he shall be as safe in my hands as if he were walking in his own fields kill your father dearest loving you as i do that would be impossible i may take the rascals who are with him i may string them up to the yardarm or i may sink their pirate ship with all of them in it but your father shall be safe trust me for that he shall come to no harm from me  she stepped a little way from him and some of her colour came back for some moments she looked at him without speaking as if she did not exactly comprehend what he had said  yes my dear he continued i must crush out that piratical crew for such is my duty as well as my wish but your father i shall take under my protection so have no fear about him i beg you with his ship and his gang of scoundrels taken away from him he can no longer be a pirate and you and i will determine what we shall do with him  you mean said kate speaking slowly that for my sake you will shield my father from the punishment which will be dealt out to his companions  he smiled and his face beamed upon her what blessed words he exclaimed yes for your sake for your sweet dear sake i will do anything and as for this matter i assure you there are so many ways  you mean she interrupted that for my sake you will break your oath of office that you will be a traitor to your service and your king that for my sake you will favour the fortunes of a pirate whom you are sent out to destroy mean it if you please but you will not do it i love my father and would fain do anything to save him and myself from this great calamity but i tell you sir that for my sake no man shall do himself dishonour  without power to say another word nor to keep back for another second the anguish which raged within her she fled like a bird and was gone  the captain stretched out his arms as if he would seize her he rushed to the door through which she had passed but she was gone he followed her shouting to the startled servants who came he swore and demanded to see their mistress he rushed through rooms and corridors and even made as if he would mount the stairs presently a woman came to him and told him that under no circumstances could mistress bonnet now be seen  but he would not leave the house he called for writing materials but in an instant threw down the pen again he called a servant and sent a message which was of no avail dame charter would have gone down to him but kate was in her arms for several minutes the furious officer stood by the chair in which kate had been sitting he could not comprehend the fact that this girl had discarded and had scorned him and yet her scorn had not in the least dampened the violence of his love as she stood and spoke her last bitter words the grandeur of her beauty had made him speechless to defend himself  he seized his hat and rushed from the house hot and with blazing eyes he appeared in the countingroom of mr delaplaine and there to that astounded merchant he told with brutal cruelty of his orders to destroy the pirate bonnet his nieces father and then he related the details of his interview with that niece herself  mr delaplaines countenance at first shocked and pained grew gradually sterner and colder presently he spoke i will hear no more such words captain vince he said regarding the members of my family you say my niece knows not what fortune she trifles with i think she does and when she told you she would not accept the offer of your dishonour i commend her every word  captain vince frowned black as night and clapped his hand to his swordhilt but the pale merchant made no movement of defence and the captain striking his clinched fist against the table dashed from the room before he reached his ship he had sworn a solemn oath he vowed that he would follow that pirate ship he would kill burn destroy annihilate but out of the storm and the fire he would pick unharmed the father of the girl who had entranced him and had spurned him he laughed savagely as he thought of it with that dolt of a father in his hands a man wearing always around his neck the hangmans noose he would hold the card which would give him the game what mistress kate bonnet might say or do what she might like or might not like what her ideas about honour might be or might not be it would be a very different thing when he her imperious lover should hold the end of that noose in his hand she might weep she might rave but come what would she was the mans daughter and she would be lady vince  so he went on board the badger and he cursed and he commanded and he raged and his officers and his men when the hurried violence of his commands gave them a chance to speak to each other muttered that they pitied that pirate and his crew when the badger came up with them  clouds settled down upon the home of mr delaplaine there were no visitors there was no music there seemed to be no sunshine the beautiful fabrics the jewels and the feathers were seen no more it was kate of the broken heart who wandered under the trees and among the blossoms and knew not that there existed such things as cooling shade and sweet fragrance she could not be comforted for although her uncle told her that he had had information that her fathers ship had sailed northward and that it was therefore likely that the corvette would not overtake him she could not forget that whatever of good or evil befell that father he was a pirate and he had deserted her  so they said but little the uncle and the niece who sorrowed quietly  dame charter was in a strange state of mind during the frequent visits of captain vince she had been apprehensive and troubled and her only comfort was that the badger had merely touched at this port to refit and that she must soon sail away and take with her her captain the good woman had begun to expect and to hope for the return of dickory but later she had blessed her stars that he was not there he was a fiery boy her brave son but it would have been a terrible thing for him to become involved with an officer in the navy a man with a long keen sword  now that the captain had raged himself away from the delaplaine house her spirits rose and her great fear was that the corvette might not leave port before the brig came in if dickory should hear of the things that captain had saidbut she banished such thoughts from her mind she could not bear them  after some days the corvette sailed and the governor spoke well of the diligence and ardour which had urged captain vince to so quickly set out upon his path of duty  when dickory comes back said dame charter to kate he may bring some news to cheer your poor heart things get so twisted in the telling  kate shook her head dickory cannot tell me anything now she said that i care to know knowing so much my father is a pirate and a kings ship has gone out to destroy him and what could dickory tell me that would cheer me  but dame charters optimism was beginning to take heart again and to spread its wings  ah my dear you dont know what good things do in this life continually crop up a letter from your father possibly withheld by that wicked madam bonnetwhich is what dickory and i both thinkor some good words from the town that your father has sold his ship and is on his way home nobody knows what good news that dickory may bring with him  the poor girl actually smiled she was young and in the heart of youth there is always room for some good news or for the hope of them  but the smile vanished altogether when she went to her room and wrote a letter to martin newcombe in this letter which was a long one she told her lover how troubled she had been that she had nothing now to ask him about the bad news he had in his kindness forborne to tell her and that when he saw dickory charter he might say to him from her that there was no need to make any further inquiries about her father she knew enough and far too muchmore most likely than any one in bridgetown knew then she told him of captain vince and the dreadful errand of the corvette badger  having done this kate became as brave as any captain of a british manofwar and she told her lover that he must think no more of her it was not for him to pay court to the daughter of a pirate and so she blessed him and bade him farewell  when she had signed and sealed this letter she felt as if she had torn out a chapter of her young life and thrown it upon the fire     chapter xi  bad weather   when dickory charter sailed away from the island of jamaica his reason had it been called upon would have told him that he had a good stout brig under him on which there were people and ropes and sails and something to eat and drink but in those moments of paradise he did not trouble his reason very much and lived in an atmosphere of joy which he did not attempt to analyze but was content to breathe as if it had been the common air about him he was going away from every one he loved and yet never before had he been so happy in going to any one he loved he cared to talk to no one on board but in company with his joy he stood and gazed westward out over the sea  he was but little younger than she was and yet that difference so slight had lifted him from things of earth and had placed him in that paradise where he now dwelt  so passed on the hours so rolled the waves and so moved the king and queen before the favouring breeze  it was on the second day out that the breeze began to be less favouring and there were signs of a storm and in spite of his preoccupied condition dickory was obliged to notice the hurried talk of the officers about him he occupying a point of vantage on the quarterdeck presently he turned and asked of some one if there was likelihood of bad weather the mate to whom he had spoken said somewhat unpleasantly bad weather enough i take it as we may all soon know but it is not wind or rain there is bad weather for you do you see that  dickory looked and saw far away but still distinct a vessel under full sail with a little black spot floating high above it  he turned to the man for explanation and what is that he said  it is a pirate ship said the other his face hardening as he spoke and it will soon be firing at us to heave to  at that moment there was a flash at the bow of the approaching vessel a little smoke and then the report of a cannon came over the water  without further delay the captain and crew of the king and queen went to work and hove to their brig  young dickory charter also hove to he did not know exactly why but his dream stopped sailing over a sea of delight they stood motionless their sails flapping in the wind  pirates he thought to himself cold shivers running through him is this brig to be taken am i to be taken am i not to go to barbadoes to bridgetown her home am i not to take her back the good news which will make her happy are these things possible  he stared over the water he saw the swiftly approaching vessel he could distinguish the skull and bones upon the black flag which flew above her  these things were possible and his heart fell but it was not with fear dickory charter was as bold a fellow as ever stood on the deck in a sea fight but his heart fell at the thought that he might not be going to her old home and that he might not sail back with good news to her  as the swiftsailing pirate ship sped on ben greenway came aft to captain bonnet and a grievous grin was on the scotchmans face  good greetins to ye master bonnet said he yere truly good to your old friends an neebours an pass them not by even when your pockets are burstin wi spanish gold  a minute before this captain stede bonnet had been in a very pleasant state of mind it was only two days ago that he had captured a spanish ship from which he got great gain including considerable stores of gold everything of value had been secured the tall galleon had been burned and its crew had been marooned on a barren spot on the coast of san domingo the spoils had been divided at least every man knew what his share was to be and the officers and the crew of the revenge were in a wellcontented state of mind in fact captain bonnet would not have sailed after a little brig certainly unsuited to carry costly cargo had it not been that his piratical principle made it appear to him a point of conscience to prey upon all mercantile craft little or big which might come in his way thus it was that he was sailing merrily after the king and queen when ben greenway came to him with his disturbing words  what mean you cried bonnet know you that vessel  ay weel said ben it is the king and queen bound doubtless for bridgetown i tell ye master bonnet that it was a great deal o trouble an expense ye put yersel to when ye went into your present line o business on this ship ye could have stayed at hame where she is owned an wi these fine fellows that ye have gathered thegither ye might have robbed your neebours right an left wiout the trouble o goin to sea  ben greenway roared the captain i will have no more of this is it not enough for me to be annoyed and worried by these everlasting ships of bridgetown which keep sailing across my bows no matter in what direction i go without hearing your jeers and sneers regarding the matter i tell you ben greenway i will not have it i will not suffer these paltry vessels filled perhaps with the grocers and cloth dealers from my own town to interfere thus with the bold career that i have chosen i tell you ben greenway ill make an example of this one i am a pirate and i will let them know itthese fellows in their floating shops it will be a fair and easy thing to sink this tub without more ado id rather meet three spanish ships even had they naught aboard than one of these righteous craft commanded by my most respectable friends and neighbours  black paul the sailingmaster had approached and had heard the greater part of these remarks  better board her and see what she carries said he before we sink her the men have been talking about her and many of them favour not the trouble of marooning those on board of her so say most of us lets get what we can from her and then quickly rid ourselves of her one way or another  tis well cried bonnet we can riddle her hull and sink her  wi the neebours on board asked greenway  captain bonnet scowled blackly  ben greenway he shouted it would serve you right if i tied you hand and foot and bundled you on board that brig after we have stripped her if haply she have anything on board we care for  an then sink her asked the scotchman  ay sink her replied bonnet thus would i rid myself of a man who vexes me every moment that i lay my eyes on him and moreover it would please you for you would die in the midst of those friends and neighbours you have such a high regard for that would put an end to your cackle and there would be no gossip in the town about it  the sailingmaster now came aft the vessel had been put about and was slowly approaching the brig shall we make fast asked black paul if we do we shall have to be quick about it the sea is rising and that clumsy hulk may do us damage  for a moment captain bonnet hesitated he was beginning to learn something of the risks and dangers of a nautical life and here was real danger if the two vessels ran nearer each other suddenly he turned and glared at greenway make fast he cried savagely make fast if it be only for a minute  do ye think in your heart asked the scotchman grimly that yere pirate enough for that     chapter xii  face to face   with her head to the wind the pirate vessel revenge bore down slowly upon the king and queen now lying to and awaiting her the stiff breeze was growing stiffer and the sea was rising the experienced eye of paul bittern the sailingmaster of the pirate now told him that it would be dangerous to approach the brig near enough to make fast to her even for the minute which captain bonnet cravedthe minute which would have been long enough for a couple of sturdy fellows to toss on board the prize that exasperating human indictment ben greenway  we cannot do it shouted black paul to bonnet we shall run too near her as it is shall we let fly at short range and riddle her hull  captain bonnet did not immediately answer the situation puzzled him he wanted very much to put the scotchman on board the brig and after that he did not care what happened but before he could speak there appeared on the rail of the king and queen holding fast to a shroud the figure of a young man who put his hand to his mouth and hailed  throw me a line throw me a line  such an extraordinary request at such a time naturally amazed the pirates and they stood staring as they crowded along the side of their vessel  if you are not going to board her shouted dickory again throw me a line  filled with curiosity to know what this strange proceeding meant black paul ordered that a line be thrown and in a moment a tall fellow seized a coil of light rope and hurled it through the air in the direction of the brig but the rope fell short and the outer end of it disappeared beneath the water now the spirit of black paul was up if the fellow on the brig wanted a line he wanted to come aboard and if he wanted to come aboard he should do so so he seized a heavier coil and swinging it around his head sent it with tremendous force towards dickory who made a wild grab at it and caught it  although a comparatively light line it was a long one and the slack of it was now in the water so that dickory had to pull hard upon it before he could grasp enough of it to pass around his body he had scarcely done this and had made a knot in it before a lurch of the brig brought a strain on the rope and he was incontinently jerked overboard  the crew of the merchantman who had not had time to comprehend what the young fellow was about to do would have grasped him had he remained on the rail a moment longer but now he was gone into the sea and working vigorously with his legs and arms was endeavouring to keep his head above water while the pirates at the other end of the rope pulled him swiftly towards their vessel  great was the excitement on board the revenge why should a man from a merchantman endeavour alone to board a vessel which flew the jolly roger did he wish to join the crew had they been illtreating him on board the brig was he a criminal endeavouring to escape from the officers of the law it was impossible to answer any of these questions and so the swarthy rascals pulled so hard and so steadily upon the line that the knot in it which dickory had not tied properly became a slipknot and the poor fellows breath was nearly squeezed out of him as he was hauled over the rough water when he reached the vessels side there was something said about lowering a ladder but the men who were hauling on the line were in a hurry to satisfy their curiosity so up came dickory straight from the water to the rail and that proceeding so increased the squeezing that the poor fellow fell upon the deck scarcely able to gasp when the rope was loosened the halfdrowned and almost breathless dickory raised himself and gave two or three deep breaths but he could not speak despite the fact that a dozen rough voices were asking him who he was and what he wanted  with the water pouring from him in streams and his breath coming from him in puffs he looked about him with great earnestness  suddenly a man rushed through the crowd of pirates and stooped to look at the person who had so strangely come aboard then he gave a shout it is dickory charter he cried dickory charter the son o old dame charter ye dickory an how in the name o all thats blessed did ye come here master bonnet master bonnet he shouted to the captain who now stood by it is young dickory charter of bridgetown he was on board this vessel before we sailed wi mistress kate an me the last time i saw her he was wi her  what exclaimed bonnet with my daughter  ay ay said greenway it must have been a little before she went on shore  young man cried bonnet stooping towards dickory when did you last see my daughter do you know anything of her  the young man opened his mouth but he could not yet do much in the way of speaking but he managed to gasp i come from her i am bringing you a message  a message from kate shouted bonnet now in a state of wild excitement here you greenway lift up the other arm and we will take him to my cabin quick man quick man he must have some spirits and dry clothes make haste now a message from my daughter  if thats so said greenway as he and bonnet hurried the young man aft yed better no be in too great haste to get his message out o him or yell kill him wi pure recklessness  bonnet took the advice and before many minutes dickory was in dry clothes and feeling the inspiriting influence of a glass of good old rum now came black paul wanting to know if he should sink the brig and be done with her for they couldnt lie by in such weather  dont you fire on that ship yelled bonnet dont you dare it for all i know my daughter may be on board of her  at this dickory shook his head no said he she is not on board  then let her go cried bonnet i have no time to fool with the beggarly hulk let her go i have other business here and now sir addressing dickory what of my daughter you have got your breath now tell me quickly what is your message from her when did you sail from bridgetown did she expect me to overhaul that brig how in the name of all the devils could she expect that  come come now master bonnet exclaimed the scotchman ye are talkin o your daughter the good an beautiful mistress kate an no matter whether ye are a pirate or no ye must keep a guard on your tongue an if ye think she knew where to find ye ye must consider her an angel an no to be spoken o in the same breath as deils  i didnt sail from bridgetown said dickory and your daughter is not there i come from jamaica where she now is and was bound to bridgetown to seek news of you hoping that you had returned there  which if he had said ben who found it very difficult to keep quiet ye would hae been under the necessity o givin your message to his bones hangin in chains  bonnet looked savagely at ben but he had no time even to curse  jamaica he cried how did she get there tell me quickly sirtell me quickly do you hear  dickory was now quite recovered and he told his story not too quickly and with much attention to details even the account of the unusual manner in which he and kate had disembarked from the pirate vessel was given without curtailment nor with any attention to the approving grunts of ben greenway when he came to speak of the letter which mr newcombe had written her and which had thrown her into such despair on account of its shortcomings captain bonnet burst into a fury of execration  and she never got my letter he cried and knew not what had happened to me it is that wife of mine that cruel wildcat i sent the letter to my house thinking of course it would find my daughter there for where else should she be  an a maist extraordinary wise mon ye were to do that said ben greenway for ye might hae known if ye had ever thought o it at all that the place where your wife was was the place where your daughter couldna be an ye no wi her if ye had spoke to me about it it would hae gone to mr newcombe an then yed hae known that shed be sure to get it  at this a slight cloud passed over dickorys face and in spite of the misfortunes which had followed upon the nondelivery of her fathers letter he could not help congratulating himself that it had not been sent to the care of that man newcombe he had not had time to formulate the reasons why this proceeding would have been so distasteful to him but he wanted martin newcombe to have nothing to do with the good or bad fortune of mistress kate whose champion he had become and whose father he had found and to whom he was now talking face to face  the three talked for a long time during which black paul had put the vessel about upon her former course and was sailing swiftly to the north as dickory went on bonnet ceased to curse but over and over blessed his brotherinlaw as a good man and one of the few worthy to take into his charge the good and beautiful stede bonnet had always been very fond of his daughter and now as it became known to him into what desperate and direful condition his reckless conduct had thrown her he loved her more and more and grieved greatly for the troubles he had brought upon her  but itll be all right now he cried shes with her good uncle who will show her the most gracious kindness both for her mothers sake and for her own and i will see to it that she be not too heavy a charge upon him  as for ye dickory exclaimed greenway yere a brave boy an will yet come to be an honour to yer mithers declining years an to the memory o your father but how did ye ever come to think o boardin this nest o seadeils an at such risk to your life  i did it said dickory simply because mistress kates father was here and i was bound to come to him wherever i should find him for that was my main errand they told me on the brig that it was captain bonnets ship that was overhauling us and i vowed that as soon as she boarded us i would seek him out and give him her message and when i heard that the sea was getting too heavy for you to board us i determined to come on board if i could get hold of a line  young man cried bonnet rising to his full height and swelling his chest i bestow upon you a fathers blessing more than thatand as he spoke he pulled open a drawer of a small lockerheres a bag of gold pieces and when you take my answer you shall have another like it  but dickory did not reach out his hand for the money nor did he say a word  dont be afraid cried bonnet if you have any religious scruples i will tell you that this gold i did not get by piracy it is part of my private fortune and came as honestly to me as i now give it to you  but dickory did not reach out his hand  now up spoke ben greenway look ye boy said he as long as theres a chance left o gettin honest gold on board this vessel i pray ye seize it an if yere afraid o this gold thinkin it may be smeared wi the blood o fathers an the tears o mithers ill tell ye ane thing an that is that master bonnet hasna got to be so much o a pirate that he willna tell the truth so ill tak the money for ye dickory an ill keep it till yere ready to tak it to your mither an i hope that will be soon     chapter xiii  captain bonnet goes to church   the pirate vessel revenge was now bound to the coast of the carolinas and virginia and perhaps even farther north if her wicked fortune should favour her the growing commerce of the colonies offered great prizes in those days to the piratical cruisers which swarmed up and down the atlantic coast to lie over for a time off the coast of charles town was captain bonnets immediate object and to get there as soon as possible was almost a necessity  the crew of desperate scoundrels whom he had gathered together had discovered that their captain knew nothing of navigation or the management of a ship and there were many of them who believed that if black paul had chosen to turn the vessels bows to the coast of south america bonnet would not have known that they were not sailing northward thus they had lost all respect for him and their conduct was kept within bounds only by the cruel punishments which he inflicted for disobedience or general bad conduct and which were rendered possible by the dissensions and bad feelings among the men themselves one clique or faction being always ready to help punish another consequently the landsman pirate would speedily have been tossed overboard and the command given to another had it not been that the men were not at all united in their opinions as to who that other should be  there was also another very good reason for bonnets continuance in authority he was a good divider and so far had been a good provider if he should continue to take prizes and to give each man under him his fair share of the plunder the men were likely to stand by him until some good reason came for their changing their minds so with floggings and irons on deck and below and with fair winds filling the sails above the revenge kept on her way and in spite of the curses and quarrels and threats which polluted the air through which the stout ship sailed there was always goodnatured companionship wherever the captain dickory and ben greenway found themselves together there seemed to be no end to the questions which bonnet asked about his daughter and when he had asked them all he began over again and dickory made answer as he had done before  the young fellow was growing very anxious at this northern voyage and when he asked questions they always related to the probability of his getting back to jamaica with news from the father of mistress kate bonnet the captain encouraged the hopes of an early return and vowed to dickory that he would send him to spanish town with a letter to his daughter just as soon as an opportunity should show itself  when the revenge reached the mouth of charles town harbour she stationed herself there and in four days captured three wellladen merchantmen two bound outward and one going in from england  thus all went well and with willing hands to man her yards and a proudly strutting captain on her quarterdeck the pirate ship renewed her northward course and spread terror and made prizes even as far as the new england coast and if dickory had had any doubts that the late reputable planter of bridgetown had now become a veritable pirate he had many opportunities of setting himself right bonnet seemed to be growing proud of his newly acquired taste for rapacity and cruelty merchantmen were recklessly robbed and burned their crews and passengers even babes and women being set on shore in some desolate spot to perish or survive the pirate cared not which and if resistance were offered bloody massacres or heartless drownings were almost sure to follow and as his men coveted spoils and delighted in cruelty he satisfied them to their hearts content  i tell you dickory charter said he one day when you see my daughter i want you to make her understand that i am a real pirate and not playing at the business shes a brave girl my daughter kate and what i do she would have me do well and not halfheartedly to make her ashamed of me and then there is my brotherinlaw delaplaine i dont believe that he had a very high opinion of me when i was a plain farmer and planter and i want him to think better of me now a bold fearless pirate cannot be looked upon with disrespect  dickory groaned in his heart that this man was the father of kate  turning southward rounding the cape of delaware the revenge ran up the bay seeking some spot where she might take in water casting anchor before a little town on the coast of new jersey here while some of the men were taking in water others of the crew were allowed to go on shore their captain swearing to them that if they were guilty of any disorder they should suffer for it on my vessel he swore i am a pirate but when i go on shore i am a gentleman and every one in my service shall behave himself as a gentleman i beg of you to remember that  agreeable to this principle captain bonnet arrayed himself in a fine suit of clothes and without arms excepting a genteel sword and carrying a cane he landed with ben greenway and dickory and proceeded to indulge himself in a promenade up the main street of the town  the citizens of the place terrified and amazed at this bold conduct of a vessel fearlessly flying a black flag with the skull and bones could do nothing but await their fate the women and children and many of the men hid themselves in garrets and cellars and those of the people who were obliged to remain visible trembled and prayed but captain stede bonnet walked boldly up the righthand side of the main street waving his cane in the air as he spoke to the people assuring them that he and his men came on an errand of business seeking nothing but some fresh water and an opportunity to stretch their legs on solid ground  if you have meat and drink he cried bestow it freely upon my men tired of the unsavoury food on shipboard and if they transgress the laws of hospitality then i their captain shall be your avenger we want none of your goods or money having enough in our wellladen vessel to satisfy all your necessities if ye have them and to feel it not  the men strolled along the street swarmed into the two little taverns soon making away with their small stores of ale and spirits and accepting everything eatable offered them by the shivering citizens but as to violence there was none for every man of the rascally crew bore enmity against most of the others and held himself ready for a chance to report a shipmate or to break his head  black paul was a powerful aid in the preservation of order among the disorderly conflicts between factions of the crew were greatly feared by him for the schemes which happy chance had caused to now revolve themselves in his master mind would have been sadly interfered with by want of concord among the men of the revenge  captain bonnet followed at a short distance by dickory and ben was interested in everything he saw a man of intelligence and considerable reading it pleased him to note the peculiarities of the people of a country which he had never visited the houses the shops and even the attire of the citizens were novel and well worthy of his observation he looked over garden walls he gazed out upon the fields which were visible from the upper end of the street and when he saw a man who was able to command his speech he asked him questions  there was a little church standing back from the thoroughfare its door wide open and this was an instant attraction to the pirate captain who opened the gate of the yard and walked up to it  that i should ever again see master stede bonnet goin into a church was something i didna dream o dickory said ben greenway it will be a meeracle an i doubt if he dares to pass the door wi his sins an his plunders on his head  but captain bonnet did pass the door reverentially removing his hat if not his crimes as he entered in but few ways it resembled the houses of worship to which he had been accustomed in his earlier days and he gazed eagerly from side to side as he slowly walked up the central aisle dickory was about to follow him but he was suddenly jerked back by the scotchman who forcibly drew him away from the door  look ye whispered ben speaking quickly under great excitement look ye dickory heaven has sent us our chance hes in there safe an sound an the good angels will keep his mind occupied ill quietly close the door an turn the key then ill slip around to the back an if there be anither door there ill stop it some way if it be not already locked now dickory boy make your heels fly i noticed before we got here that some o the men were makin their way to the boats dash ye amang them dickory an tell them that the day theyve been longin for ever since they set foot on the vessel has now come their captain is a prisoner an they are free to hurry on board their vessel an carry awa wi them a their vile plunder  what exclaimed dickory speaking so earnestly that the scotchman pulled him farther away from the church do you mean that you would leave captain bonnet here by himself in a foreign town  no a bit o it said ben ill stay wi him an so will you now run dickory  ben exclaimed the other you dont know what you are talking about captain bonnet would be seized and tried as a pirate his blood would be on your head ben  i canna talk about that now said ben impatiently ye think too much o the mans body dickory an i am considerin his soul  and i am considering his daughter said dickory fearlessly do you suppose i am going to help to have her father hanged and with these words he made a movement towards the door  the eager scotchman seized him dickory bethink yoursel said he i dont want to hang him i want to save him body an soul we will get him awa from here after the ship has gone he will be helpless then he canna be a pirate a minute longer an he will give up an do what i tell him we can leave before there is ony talk o trial or hangin run dickory run yere sinfully losin time think o his soul dickory its his only chance  with a great jerk dickory freed himself from the grasp of the scotchman  it is kate bonnet i am thinking of he exclaimed and with that he bolted into the church  the captain was examining the little pulpit haste ye haste ye cried dickory your men are all hurrying to the boats they will leave you behind if they can thats what they are after  illustration haste ye haste ye cried dickory they will leave you behind  bonnet turned quickly he took in the situation in a second with a few bounds he was out of the church nearly overturning ben greenway as he passed him without a word he ran down the street his cane thrown away and his drawn sword in his hand  dickorys warning had not come a minute too soon one boat full of men was pulling towards the ship and others were hurrying in the direction of an empty boat which awaited them at the pier bonnet with dickory close at his heels ran with a most amazing rapidity while greenway followed at a little distance scarcely able to maintain the speed  what means this cried bonnet now no longer a gentleman but a savage pirate and as he spoke he thrust aside two of the men who were about to get into the boat and jumped in himself what means this he thundered  black paul answered quietly i was getting the men on board he said so as to save time and i was coming back for you  bonnet glared at his sailingmaster but he did not swear at him he was too useful a man but in his heart he vowed that he would never trust paul bittern again and that as soon as he could he would get rid of him  but when he reached the ship three men out of each boats crew selected at random to represent the rest were tied up and flogged the blows being well laid on by scoundrels very eager to be brutal even to their own shipmates  ah dickory dickory cried ben greenway as they were sailing down the bay ye have loaded your soul wi sin this day i fear yell never rise from under it whatever vile deeds that major bonnet may henceforth be guilty o yell be responsible for them a dickory for every ane o them  hes bad enough ben said the other and its many a wicked deed he may do yet but i am going to carry news of him to his daughter if i can and whats more i am not going to stay behind and be hanged even if it is in such good company as major bonnet and you ben greenway  whatever should happen on the rest of that voyage whether the wellintentioned treachery of ben greenway or the secret villainies of the crew should prevail whether disaster or success should come to the planter pirate dickory charter resolved in his soul that a message from her father should go to kate bonnet and that he should carry it                                       the spirits of dickory rose very much as the bow of the revenge was pointed southward every mile that the pirate vessel sailed brought him nearer to the delivery of his messagea message which while it told of her fathers wicked career still told her of his safety and of his steadfast affection for her indirectly the bringing of such a message and the story of how the bearer brought it might have another effect which although he had no right to expect was never absent from dickorys soul this ardent young lover did not believe in master martin newcombe he had no good reason for not believing in him but his want of faith did not depend upon reason if lovers reasoned too much it would be a sad world for many of them  when the revenge stopped in her progress towards the heavenly island of jamaica or at least that island which was the abode of an angel and anchored off charles town harbour south carolina dickory fumed and talked impatiently to his friend ben greenway why a man even though he were a pirate and therefore of an avaricious nature should want more booty when his vessel was already crowded with valuable goods he could not imagine  but ben greenway could very easily imagine when the spirit o sin is upon ye said the scotchman the more an more wicked yere likely to be an ye must no forget dickory that every new crime he commits an a the property he steals an a the unfortunate people he maroons will hae to be answered for by ye dickory when the time comes for ye to stand up an say what ye hae got to say about your ain sins if ye had stood by me an helped to cut him short in his nefarious career he might now be beginnin a new life in some small coastin vessel bound for barbadoes  dickory gave an impatient kick at the mast near which he was standing it would have been more likely said he that before this he would have begun a new life on the gallows with you and me alongside of him and how do you suppose you would have got rid of the sin on your soul when you thought of his orphan daughter in jamaica  your thoughts are too much on that daughter snapped greenway an no enough on her fathers soul  i am tired of her fathers soul said dickory i wonder what new piece of mischief they are going to do here there are no ships to be robbed  dickory did not know very much or care very much about the sea and its commerce and some ships to be robbed soon made their appearance one was a large merchantman with a full cargo and the other was a bark northward bound in ballast the acquisition of the latter vessel put a new idea into captain bonnets head the revenge was already overloaded and he determined to take the bark as a tender to relieve him of a portion of his cargo and to make herself useful in the business of marooning and such troublesome duties  being now commander of two vessels which might in time increase to a little fleet captain bonnets ideas of his own importance as a terror of the sea increased rapidly on the revenge he was more despotic and severe than ever before while the villain who had been chosen to command the tender because he had a fair knowledge of navigation was informed that if he kept the bark more than a mile from the flagship he would be sunk with the vessel and all on board the loss of the bark and some men would be nothing compared to the maintenance of discipline quoth the planter pirate  bonnets ambition rose still higher and higher he was not content with being a relentless pirate bloody if need be but he longed for recognition for a position among his fellowterrors of the sea which should be worthy of a truly wicked reputation a pirate bold he would consort with pirates bold so he set sail for the gulf of honduras then a great rendezvous for piratical craft of many nations if the father of kate bonnet had captured and burned a dozen ships and had forced every sailor and passenger thereupon to walk a plank he would not have sinned more deeply in the eyes of dickory charter than he did by thus ruthlessly inhumanly hardheartedly and altogether shamefully ignoring and pitilessly passing by that island on which dwelt an angel his own daughter  but bonnet declared to the young man that it would now be dangerous for him and his ship to approach the harbour of kingston generally the resort of british menofwar but in the waters of honduras he could not fail to find some quiet merchant ship by which he could send a message to his daughter ay and in whichand the pirates eye glistened with parental joy as this thought came into his mindhe might disguised as a plain gentleman make a visit to mistress kate and to his good brotherinlaw delaplaine  so dickory was now to be satisfied and even to admit that there might be some good common sense in these remarks of that most uncommon pirate captain bonnet  so the revenge with her tender sailed southward through the fair westindian waters and by the fair westindian isles to join herself to the piratical fleet generally to be found in the waters of honduras     chapter xiv  a girl to the front   the days were getting very long at spanish town although there were no more hours of sunlight than was usual at the season and even the optimism of dame charter was scarcely able to brighten her own soul much less that of kate bonnet who had almost forgotten what it was to be optimistic poor mr delaplaine whose life had begun to cheer up wonderfully since the arrival of his niece and her triumphant entry into the society of the town became more gloomy than he had been since the months which followed the death of his wife over and over did he wish that his brotherinlaw bonnet had long since been shut up in some place where his eccentricities could do no harm to his fellowcreatures especially to his most lovely daughter  mistress kate bonnet was not a girl to sit quietly under the tremendous strain which bore upon her after the departure of the badger how could she be contented or even quiet at any moment when at that moment that heartless captain vince might have his sword raised above the head of her unfortunate father  uncle she said i cannot bear it any longer i must do something  but my dear he asked looking down upon her with infinite affection what can you do we are here upon an immovable island and your father and captain vince are sailing upon the sea nobody knows where  i thought about it all last night said kate and this is what i will do i will go to the governor i will tell him all about my father i do not think it will be wrong even to tell him why i think his mind has become unsettled for if that woman in bridgetown has behaved wickedly her wickedness should be known then i will ask him to give me written authority to take my father wherever i may find him and to bring him here where it shall be decided what shall be done with him and i am sure the decision will be that he must be treated as a man whose mind is not right and who should be put somewhere where he can have nothing to do with ships  this was all quite childish to mr delaplaine but for kates dear sake he treated her scheme seriously  but tell me my dear said he how are you going to find your father and in what way can you bring him back here with you  the first thing to do said kate is to hire a ship i know that my little property will yield me money enough for that as for bringing him back thats for me to do with my arms around his neck he cannot be a pirate captain and think of it uncle if my arms are not soon around his neck it may be the hangmans rope which will be there that is if he is not killed by that revengeful captain vince  mr delaplaine was troubled far more than he had yet been his sorrowing niece believed that there was something which might be done for her father but he her practical uncle did not believe that anything could be done and even if this were possible he did not wish to do it if by some unheardof miracle his niece should be enabled to carry out her scheme she could not go alone and thoughts of sailing upon the sea and the dangers from pirates storms and wrecks were very terrible to the quiet merchant he could not encourage this nightborn scheme of his niece  but there is one thing i can do cried kate and i must do it this very day i must go to the governors house and i pray you uncle that you will go with me i must tell him about my father i must make him do something which shall keep that captain vince from sailing after him and killing him how i wish i had thought of all this before but it did not come to me  it was not half an hour after that when kate and her uncle entered the grounds of the governors mansion     chapter xv  the governor of jamaica   the governor of jamaica was much interested in the visit of kate bonnet whom he saw alone in a room adjoining the public apartments he had met her two or three times before and had been forced to admit that the young girls of barbadoes must be pretty and piquant in an extraordinary degree and he had not wondered that his friend captain vince should have spoken of her in such an enthusiastic manner  but now she was different her sorrow had given her dignity and had added to her beauty she quickly told her tale and he started upright in his chair as he heard it  do you mean he exclaimed that that pirate after whom i sent the badger is your father it amazes me the similarity of names did not strike me i never imagined any connection between you and the captain of that pirate ship  thats what captain vince said when i last saw him remarked kate  it must have astounded him to know it exclaimed the governor and i wonder knowing it that he consented to obey my orders and had i been in his place i would have preferred to be dismissed from the service rather than to sail after your father and to destroy him if i had known what i know now my orders to captain vince would have been very different from what they were i would have told him to capture your father and to bring him here to me it cannot be that he is in his right mind  now kate was weeping the terrible words destroy him and the assurance that if she had thought sooner of appealing to the governor much misery or at least the thought of misery might have been spared her so affected her that she could not control herself  the governor did not attempt to console her her sorrow was natural and it was her right  when she looked up again she spoke about what she had come to ask him for the authority to bring back her father wherever she might find him and to defend him from the attacks of all persons whoever they might be until she reached jamaica and then she told him how she would seek for her father on every sea  the governor sat and pondered the father of such a girl should be saved from the terrible fate awaiting him if the thing could possibly be done and yet what a difficult almost hopeless thing it was to do to find a pirate a fierce and bloody pirate and bring him back unharmed to his daughters arms and to reasonable restraint  he spoke earnestly what you propose he said you cannot do it would be impossible for you to find your father and if you did no matter who might be with you and no matter how successful you might be with him his crew would not let him go but there is one thing which might be done the badger will report at different stations and her course and present cruising ground might be discovered thus i might send a despatch to captain vince ordering him not to harm your father but to take him prisoner and to bring him here to be dealt with  kate sprang to her feet  an order to captain vince she exclaimed an order to withhold his hand from my father ah sir your goodness is great this is far more than i had dared to expect when i last saw captain vince he left me in a great rage but knowing that he would respect your order i would dare his rage if his revengeful hand should be withheld from my father i would fear nothing  i beg you to be seated said the governor and let me assure you that in offering to send this order to captain vince i do not in the least expect you to take it but there is one thing i do not understand why should the captain have left you in a great rage perhaps i have not a right to ask this but it seems to me to have some bearing upon his alacrity in setting forth in pursuit of the revenge  i fear said kate that this may be true i do not deem it improper for me to say to you sir that captain vince made me an offer of marriage and that in order to induce me to accept it he offered should he come up with the revenge to spare my father and to let him go free visiting the punishment he was sent to inflict upon the rest of the people in the ship  i am surprised said the governor to hear you say that such an action would have been direct disobedience to his orders it would have been disloyalty which not even the possession of your fair hand could justify and you refused his offer  that did i said kate her face flushing at the recollection of the unpleasant interview with the captain i cared not for him and even had i i would not have consented to wed a man who offered me his dishonour as a bribe for doing so not even for my fathers life would i become the bride of such a one  well spoken mistress bonnet exclaimed the governor your heart though a tender is a stout one but this you tell me of captain vince is very bad he is a vindictive man and will have what he wants even without regard to the means by which he may get it i am glad to know what you have told me mistress bonnet and if i had known it betimes i would not have sent in pursuit of your father a man whose anger had been excited against his daughter but now i shall despatch orders to captain vince which shall be very exact and peremptory after he has received them he will not dare to harm your father and would cause him to be brought here as i command  from my heart i thank you sir cried kate give me the orders and i will take them or i will  nay nay said the governor such offices are not for you but i will give the matter my present attention on any day a vessel may enter the port with news of the badger and on any day a vessel may clear from kingston possibly for bridgetown where i imagine the badger will first touch rely upon me my dear young lady my order shall go to captain vince by the very earliest opportunity  kate rose and thanked him warmly this is much to do your excellency for one poor girl she said  it is but little to do said the governor and that girl be yourself  with that he rose offered kate his arm and conducted her to her uncle  when mr delaplaine was made acquainted with the result of the interview both his gratitude and surprise were great he comprehended far better than kate could the extent of the favour which the governor had offered to bestow it was indeed extraordinary to commute what was really a sentence of death against a notorious and dangerous pirate for the sake of a beautiful and pleading woman an ambitious idea shot through the merchants brain the governor was a widower he had met kate before was there any other lady on the island better fitted to preside over the gubernatorial household but although a man of high position could not wed the daughter of a pirate a pirate evidently of an unsound mind could be adjudged demented as he truly was and thus the shadow of his crime be lifted from him this was a great deal to think in a very short time but the good merchant did it and the fervour of his thankfulness was greatly increased by his rapid reflections  as they were on their way home kates eyes were bright and her step lighter than it had been of late now uncle said she you know we shall not wait for any chance ship which may take the governors despatch we shall engage a swift vessel ourselves by which the orders may be carried and uncle when that ship sails i must go in her  you cried mr delaplaine you go in search of the badger and captain vince that can never  but remember uncle cried kate it is just as likely that i shall meet my fathers ship as any other and then we can snap our fingers at all orders and all captains my father shall be brought here and the good governor will make him safe and free him as he best knows how from the terrible straits into which his disturbed reason has led him  her uncle would not darken kates bright hopes illfounded though he thought them to look into those sparkling eyes again was a joy of which he would not deprive himself if he could help it  suppose he should capture our vessel she exclaimed what a grand thing it would be for him all unknowing to spring upon our deck and instantly be captured by me after that there would be no more pirates life for him  when dame charter heard what had happened at the governors house and had listened to the recital of kates glowing schemes her eyes did not immediately glisten with joy  if you go mistress kate said she in search of your father or that wicked captain vince i go with you but i cannot go without my dickory it is full time to expect his return although as he was to depend upon so many chances before he could come back his absence may with good reason continue longer and i could not have him come back and find his mother gone no man knows where for in such a quest what man could know  oh dickory will be here soon cried kate any ship which comes sailing towards the harbour may bring him  the governor of jamaica was a man of great experience and with a fairly clear insight into the ways of the wicked when kate and her uncle had left him and he paced the floor with the memory of the beautiful eyes of the pirates daughter as they had been uplifted to his own he felt assured that he could see rightly into the designs of the unscrupulous captain vince of what avail would it be for him to kill the father of the girl who had rejected him it would be an atrocious but temporary triumph scarcely to be considered but to capture that father to disregard the laws of the service and the orders of his superiors which he had already proposed to do to communicate with kate and to hold up before her terrorstricken eyes the life of her father to be ended in horror or enjoyed in peace as she might decidethat would be vince as the governor knew him  the governor knew well his man and those were the designs and intentions of captain christopher vince of his majestys corvette the badger     chapter xvi  a question of etiquette   proudly sailed the revenge and her attendant bark into the waters of honduras gulf and proudly stood captain stede bonnet upon his quarterdeck dressed in a handsome uniform which might have been that of a captain or admiral in the royal navy one hand caressed his ornate swordhilt while the other was thrust into the bosom of his giltembroidered coat a newly fashioned jolly roger in which the background was very black and the skull and crossbones ghastly white flew from his masthead  as night came on there could be seen twinkling far away upon the horizon a beacon light which in those days was kept burning for the benefit of the piratical craft which made a rendezvous of the waters off belize then the commercial centre for the vessels of the free companions having supposed in his unnautical mind that his entrance into the gulf of honduras meant the end of his present voyage and not wishing to lower his own feeling of importance by asking too many questions of his inferiors captain bonnet had bedecked himself a day too soon and there were some jeers and sneers among his crew when he descended to his cabin to take off his fine clothes but his selfcomplacency was well armoured and he did not hear the jokes of which he was the subject especially by the little clique of which black paul was the centre but the sailingmaster knew his business and the revenge was safely though slowly sailed among the coralreefs and islands until she dropped anchor off belize early in the morning the now dignified and pompous captain bonnet of that terror of the seas the pirate craft revenge again arrayed himself in a manner befitting his position and stationed himself on the quarterdeck where he might be seen by the eyes of all the crews of the other pirate vessels anchored about them and by the glasses of their officers  apart from a general desire to show himself in the ranks of his fellowpirates and to receive from them the respect which was due to a man of his capabilities and general merits stede bonnet had a particular reason for his visit to this port and for surrounding himself with all the pomp and circumstance of high piratical rank he had been informed that a great man a hero and chief among his fellowsin fact the dean of the piratical faculty and known as blackbeard the most desperate and reckless of all the pirates of the daywas now here  to meet this most important searobber and to receive from him the hand of fellowship had been bonnets desire and ambition since he had heard that it was possible  the morning was advanced and the revenge was rolling easily at her anchorage but bonnet was somewhat uncertain as to the next step he ought to take he wanted to see blackbeard as soon as possible but it would certainly be a breach of etiquette entirely inconsistent with his present position for him to go to see him he was the latest comer and thought it was the part of blackbeard to make the first visit  paul bittern now came aft the men are getting very restless he said they want to go on shore theyd all go if id let em  captain bonnet gave his sailingmaster a lofty glare  if i should let them you mean sir i am sorry i cannot break you of the habit of forgetting that i command this ship well sir you may tell them that they cannot go i am expecting a visit from the renowned blackbeard now in this port and i wish to welcome him with all respect and a full crew  black paul smiled disagreeably i will tell you sir that you cannot keep these men on board much longer with the town of belize within a row of half a mile theyve been at sea too long for that therell be a mutiny sir if i go forward with that message of yours it will be prudent to let some of them go ashore now and others later in the day i will go in the first boat and see to it that the men come back with me and by the way it would not be a bad thing if i touch at blackbeards vessel and inform him that you are here i dont suppose he knows the revenge nor her captain neither  i doubt that bittern said bonnet i doubt it very much i assure you that i am known from one end of this coast to the other and captain blackbeard is not an ignorant man so you can go ashore and take some of the men stopping at blackbeards ship and by the way i want you to go by that bark of ours and give her the old black roger i used to fly i forgot to send it to her and a man might as well not own and command two vessels if he get not the credit of it  when black paul had gone to execute his orders ben greenway heaved a heavy sigh now i begin to fear master bonnet that the day o your salvation has really gone by when ye not only murder an rob upon the high seas but keep consort with other murderers an robbers then i fear ye are indeed lost but i shall stand by ye master bonnet i shall stand by ye an if ever i find there is the least bit o ye to be snatched from the flames ill snatch it  i dont like that sort of talk ben greenway cried bonnet especially at this time when my soul swells with content at the success which has crowned my undertakings this blackbeard is a valiant man and a great one but it is my belief that when we have sat down to compare our notes it will be found that i have captured as many cargoes burned as many ships and marooned as many people in my last cruise as he has  so i suppose said ben that ye think ye hae achieved the right to sink deeper into hell than he can ever hope to do  bonnet made no answer but turned away the scotchman was becoming more and more odious to him every day but he would not quarrel on this most auspicious morning he must keep his mind unruffled and his head high he had his own plans about greenway he was not far from barbadoes and when he left the harbour of belize it would be of advantage to his peace of mind as well as to the comfort of a faithful old servant if he should anchor for a little while in the river below the town and put ben greenway on shore  ben gave no further reason for quarrelling he was greatly dejected but he had sworn to himself to stand by his old master no matter what might happen and when he took an oath he meant what he swore  dickory charter was in much worse case than ben greenway he was not much of a geographical scholar but he knew that the gulf of honduras was not really very far from the island of jamaica where dwelt waited and watched mistress kate bonnet and his mother if he had known that during the voyage down from the atlantic coast the revenge had sailed through the windward passage running in some of her long tacks within less than a days sail of jamaica he would have chafed fumed and fretted even more than he did now  captain bonnet he cried if you could but let me go on shore i might surely find some vessel bound to kingston or to any place upon the island of jamaica from which spot i could make my way on foot even if it were on the opposite end thus i could take messages and letters from you to your daughter and mr delaplaine and ease the minds both of them and my mother all of whom must now be in most doleful plight not knowing anything about you or hearing anything from me and this for so long a time then you could remain here with no feelings of haste until you had disposed of your cargoes and had finished your business  captain bonnet stood loftily with a smile of benignity upon his face it is a clever plan said he and you are a good fellow dickory but your scheme though well intentioned is unsound i have too much regard for you to trust you in any vessel sailing from belize to kingston where there are often naval vessels going from this port you would be as likely to be strung up to the yardarm as to be allowed to go ashore be patient then my good fellow when my affairs are settled here the revenge may run up to the coast of jamaica where you may be put off at some quiet spot and all may happen as you have planned my good dickory even now i am writing a letter hoping for some such opportunity of sending it to my daughter  dickory sighed in despair it might take a month or more before kates father could settle his affairs and how long how long it had been since his soul had been reaching itself out towards kate and his mother  when the sailingmaster set out in the longboat crowded with men he stopped at the bark but did not go too near for fear that some of the crew might jump into his already overloaded boat  you are to run up this rag cried black paul to clip the fellow in command and so saying he handed up the old jolly roger on the blade of an oar our noble admiral fears that if you do not that you may be captured by some of these good vessels lying hereabout  clip roared out with a laugh i will attend to the capture as soon as i get out of reach of his guns which he will not dare to use here i take it but i want you to know and him to know that were not goin to stay on board and in sight of the town if you go ashore so go we  stay where ye are till orders come to ye shouted black paul if ye want to keep the cat off your backs and as he rowed away the men on the bark gave him a cheer and proceeded to lower two boats  from nearly every pirate ship in the anchorage the proceedings of the newly arrived vessels had been watched no one wanted to board them or in any way to interfere with them until it was found out what they intended to do the revenge was a stranger in that harbour although her fame was known on not a few pirate decks but if she came to belize to fraternize with the other pirate vessels there gathered together why didnt she do it no idea of importance and dignity which his position imposed upon captain stede bonnet entered their piratical minds when the longboat put forth from the revenge a good deal of interest was excited in the anchored vessels the great blackbeard himself stood high upon his deck and surveyed the strangers through a glass  the men in the sailingmasters boat rowed steadily towards blackbeards vessel bittern knew it well for he had seen it before and had even had the honour so to speak of having served for a short time under the master pirate of that day  as soon as the boat was near enough blackbeard hailed it in a tremendous voice and ordered the stranger to pull up and make fast this being done a rope ladder was lowered and bittern mounted to the deck being assisted in his passage over the side by a tremendous pull given by blackbeard  the great pirate seemed to be in high good spirits and very glad to see his visitor blackbeard was a large man wide and heavy and the first impression conveyed by his personality was that of hair and swarthiness an untrimmed black beard lay upon his chest and his long hair hung in masses from under his slouched hat his eyes were dark and sparkling and gleamed like beacon lights from out a midnight sky the sleeves of his shirt were rolled up and his arms seemed almost as hairy as his head two pairs of pistols were stuck into his belt and a great cutlass was conveniently tucked up by his side  ho ho he cried black paul and where do you come from and what are you doing here and what is the name of that vessel with the brandnew roger has she just gone into the business that she decks herself out so fine come now sit here and have some brandy and tell me what is the meaning of these two vessels coming into the harbour and what you have to do with them  bittern was delighted to know that his old commander remembered him and was ready enough to talk with him for that was the errand he had come upon  but captain said he i am afraid to wander away from the gunwale for if i have not my eye upon them my men will be rowing to the town before i know it they are mad to be on shore  blackbeard made no answer he stepped to the side of the vessel and looked over let go he shouted to the man who held the boats rope and you rascals row out a dozen strokes from my vessel and keep your boat there and if you move an oar towards the town i will sink you with that he ordered two small guns to be trained upon the boat  the boats crew did not hesitate one second in obeying these orders they knew by whom they were given and there was no man in the great body of free companions who would disobey an order given by blackbeard they rowed to the position assigned them and sat quietly looking into the mouths of the two cannon which were pointed towards them  now then said blackbeard turning to bittern i think theyll stay there till they get some other order  between frequent sips at the cup of brandy bittern told the story of the revenge and blackbeard listened with many an oath and many a pound upon his massive knee by his mighty fist  oh i have heard of him he cried i have heard of him he has played the devil along the atlantic coast he must he a great fellow thiswhat did you say his name was  bonnet said the other  blackbeard laughed that suits him well he must have clapped his name over the eyes of many a merchant captain where did he sail before he hoisted the jolly roger  at this bittern laughed he never sailed anywhere he is no seaman and if he were not rich enough to pay others to do his navigatin for him he would have run his vessel upon the first sandbar on his way from bridgetown to the sea but he pays some good mariner to sail his revenge and he now pays me i am in fact the captain of his vessel  you mean cried blackbeard that he knows nothing of navigation  not a whit replied the other he doesnt know the backstays from the taffrail it was only yesterday that he thought he was already in the port of belize and dressed himself up like a fightingcock to meet you  to meet me roared blackbeard what does he want to meet me for and why dont he come and do it instead of sending you  not he said bittern he is a great man if not a sailor he knows what is politeness on shipboard and as he is the last comer you must be the first caller he is all dressed up now hoping that you will row over to the revenge as soon as you know that he is its commander  the hairy pirate leaned back and laughed in loud explosions  he is a rare man truly he exclaimed this captain nightcap of yours  bonnet interrupted bittern  well one is as good as the other cried blackbeard and he be well clothed if it be of the right colour and you started out with him to sail his ship you rascal thats a piece of impudence almost as great as his own  bittern did not much like this speech and wanted to explain that since he had served under blackbeard he had commanded vessels himself but he restrained himself and told how sam loftus had been tumbled overboard for running afoul his captain and how he had been appointed to his place  now blackbeard laughed again with a great pound upon his knee he is a man after my own heart he shouted be he sailor or no sailor this nightcap commander of yours i know i shall love him and springing to his feet and uttering a resounding oath he swore that he would visit his new brother that afternoon  now away with you cried blackbeard and tell sir nightcap  bonnet interrupted bittern  well bonnet or cap it matters not to me row straight back to your ship and let him know that i shall be there and shall expect to be received with admirals honours  bittern looked somewhat embarrassed but captain he said my men are on their way to the town and i fear me they will rebel if i tell them they cannot now go there  in saying this the sailingmaster spoke not only for his men but for himself he was very anxious to go ashore he had business there he wanted to see who were in the place and what was going on before bonnet should go to the town  what cried blackbeard putting his head down like a charging bull i order you to row back to your vessel and take my message and if you do it not i will sink you all in a bunch into your boat sir and waste not another minute if you are not able to command your men i will keep you here and give them a coxswain who can  without another word bittern scuffled over the side and his boat being brought up he dropped into it  now men he said i have a message from captain blackbeard to the revenge bend to it as i steer that way  give my pious regards to your sir nightcap shouted blackbeard and then in a still higher tone he yelled to them that if they disobeyed their coxswain and turned their bow shoreward he would sink them all to the unsounded depths of hades without a protest the men pulled vigorously towards the revenge while black paul considering it a new affront to be called coxswain when he was in reality captain earnestly sent blackbeard to the same regions to which he had just referred     chapter xvii  an ornamented beard   it was about the middle of the afternoon when a large boat well filled was seen approaching the revenge from blackbeards vessel as soon as it had become known that this chief of all pirates of that day this edward thatch of england was really coming on board the revenge not one word was uttered among the crew on the subject of going ashore although they had been long at sea the shore could wait when blackbeard was coming even to look upon this doughty desperado would be an honour and a joy to the brawny scoundrels who made up the crew of the revenge  it might have been supposed that everything upon captain bonnets vessel had been made ready for the expected advent of blackbeard but nothing seemed good enough nothing seemed as effectively placed and arranged as it might have been and with execrations and commands bonnet hurried here and there making everything if possible more shipshape than it had been before  stay you two in the background he said to ben greenway and dickory you are both landsmen and you dont count in a ceremony such as this is going to be station your men as i told you bittern and man the yards when it is time  captain bonnet in his brave uniform and wearing a cocked hat with a feather his hand upon his swordhilt stood up tall and stately when the boat was made fast and the great pirates head appeared above the rail six cannon roared a welcome and bonnet stepped forward hand extended and hat uplifted  the instant blackbeards feet touched the deck he drew from their holsters a pair of pistols and fired them in the air  now then he shouted we are even salute for salute for my pistols are more than equal to the cannon of any other man how goes it with you sir nightcapbonnet i mean and with that he clasped the hand reached out to him in a bonecrushing grasp  his fingers aching and his brain astonished bonnet could not comprehend what sort of a man it was who stood before him with hair purposely dishevelled with his hat more slouched than usual with his beard divided into tails each tied with a differentcoloured ribbon with half a dozen pistols strung across his breast with other pistols and a knife or two stuck into his belt with his great sword by his side and his eyes gleaming brighter than ever and a general expression both in face and figure of an aggressive impudence blackbeard stood on his stout legs clothed in rough red stockings and gazed about him but the captain of the revenge did not forget his manners he welcomed blackbeard with all courtesy and besought him to enter his poor cabin  blackbeard laughed poor cabin say you but ill tell you this one thing my valiant captain cap you have not a poor vessel not a poor vessel i swear that to you my brave captain i swear that  then with no attention to bonnets invitation captain blackbeard strolled about the deck examining everything cursing this and praising that and followed by captain bonnet black paul and a crowd of admiring pirates  ben greenway bowed his head and groaned i doubt if master bonnet will ever go to the deil as i feared he would for now has the deil come to him oh dickory dickory this master o mine was a worthy mon an a good ane when i first came to him an a that i hae i owe to him for i was in sad case dickory very sad case but now that he has apollyon for his teacher hell cease to know righteousness altogither  dickory was angry and out of spirits he is a vile poltroon this master of yours said he consorting with these bloody pirates and leaving his daughter to pine away her days and nights within a little sail of him while he struts about at the heel of a dirty freebooter dressed like a monkey he doesnt deserve the daughter he possesses oh that i could find a ship that would take me back to jamaica and i would take you too ben greenway for it is a foul shame that a good man should spend his days in such vile company  ben shook his head ill stand by master bonnet he said until the day comes when i shall bid him fareweel at the door o hell i can go no farther than that dickory no farther than that  from forecastle to quarterdeck from bowsprit to taffrail blackbeard scrutinized the revenge  what mean you dog he said to bittern bonnet being at a little distance you tell me he is no mariner this is a brave ship and well appointed  ay ay said the sailingmaster it has the neatness of his kitchen or his storehouses but if his cables were coiled on his yardarms or his anchor hung up to dry upon the main shrouds he would not know that anything was wrong it was big sam loftus who fitted out the revenge and i myself have kept everything in good order and shipshape ever since i took command  command growled blackbeard for a charge of powder i would knock in the side of your head for speaking with such disrespect of the brave sir nightcap  the supper in the cabin of the revenge was a better meal than the voracious blackbeard had partaken of for many a year if indeed he had ever sat down to such a sumptuous repast before him was food and drink fit for a stout and hungry seafaring man and there were wines and dainties which would have had fit place upon the table of a gentleman  blackbeard was in high spirits and tossed off cup after cup and glass after glass of the choicest wine and the most fiery spirits he clapped his wellmannered host upon the back as he shouted some fragment of a wild seasong  and who is this he cried as they rose from the table and he first caught sight of ben greenway is this your chaplain he looks as sanctimonious as an empty rum cask and that baby boy there what do you keep him for are they for sale i would like to buy the boy and let him keep my accounts i warrant he has enough arithmetic in his head to divide the prizemoneys among the men  he is no slave said bonnet he came to this vessel to bring me a message from my daughter but he is an illbred stripling and can neither read nor write  then lets kill him cried blackbeard and drawing his pistol he sent a bullet about two inches above dickorys head  at this the men who had gathered themselves at every available point set up a cheer never before had they beheld such a magnificent and reckless miscreant  dickory did not start or move but he turned very pale and then he reddened and his eyes flashed blackbeard swore at him a great approbative oath a brave boy he cried and fit to carry messages if for nothing else and what is this nonsense about a daughter said he to bonnet we abide no such creatures in the ranks of the free companions we drown them like kittens before we hoist the jolly roger  when blackbeards boat left the ships side the departing chieftain fired his pistols in the air as long as their charges lasted while the motley desperadoes of the revenge gave him many a parting yell then all the boats of the revenge were lowered and every man who could crowd into them left their ship for the shore black paul tried to restrain them for he feared to leave the revenge too weakly manned she having such a valuable cargo but his orders and shouts were of no avail and despairing of stopping them the sailingmaster went with them and as they pulled wildly towards the town the men of one boat shouted to another and that one to another hurrah for our captain the brave sir nightcap hurrah hurrah hurrah  the dirty satan exclaimed dickory as he gazed after blackbeards boat i would kill him if i could  say not so dickory said captain bonnet speaking gravely that great pirate is not a man of breeding and he speaks with disesteem alike of friend and enemy but he is the famous blackbeard and we must treat him with honour although he pays us none  i had deemed said greenway calmly that ye were goin to be the maist unholy sinner that ever blackened this fair earth but not only did ye tell a pious lie for the sake o good dickory but compared wi that monstrosity ye are a saint graved in marble master bonnet a white and shapely saint                                       blackbeards boat was not rowed to his vessel but his men pulled steadily shoreward  with the wild crew of the revenge fresh from sea and their appetites whetted for jovial riot and with blackbeard his warpaint on to lead them into every turbulent excess there were wild times in the town of belize that night     chapter xviii  i have no right i am a pirate   as has been made plain captain bonnet of the revenge was a punctilious man when the rules of society were concerned be that society official hightoned or piratical thus it was a positive duty in his mind to return blackbeards visit on the next day but until afternoon he was not able to do so on account of the difficulty of getting a sober and decently behaved boats crew who should row him over  black paul the sailingmaster had returned to his vessel early in the morning feeling the necessity of keeping watch over the cargo but most of the men came over much later while some of them did not come at all  bonnet was greatly inclined to punish with an unwonted severity this breach of rules but black paul assured him that it was always the custom for the crew of a newly arrived vessel to go ashore and have a good time and that if they were denied this privilege they would be sure to mutiny and he might be left without any crew at all bonnet grumbled and swore but as he was aware there were several things concerning a nautical life with which he was not familiar he determined to let pass this trespass  dressed in his finest clothes and even better than the day before he was followed into the boat by ben greenway who vowed his captain should never travel without his chaplain who if his words were considered would be the most valuable officer on the vessel  come then greenway said bonnet you have troubled me so much on my own vessel that now perchance you may be able to do me some service on that of another anyway i should like to have at least one decent person in my train who an you come not will be wholly missing and dickory may come too if he like it  but dickory did not like it he hated the big black pirate and cared not if he should never see him again so he stayed behind  when bonnet mounted to the deck of blackbeards vessel he found there a very different pirate captain from the one who had called upon him the day before there were no tails to the great black beard there were few pistols visible and captain bonnets host received him with a certain saltsoaked sunbrowned hairy and brawny hospitality which did not sit badly upon him there was meat there was drink and then the two captains and greenway walked gravely over the vessel followed by a hundred eyes and before long by many a coarse and jeering laugh which bonnet supposed were directed at sturdy ben greenway deeming it quite natural though improper that the derision of these rough fellows should be excited by the appearance among them of a prim and sedate scotch presbyterian  but that crew of miscreants had all heard of the derisive title which had been given to bonnet and now they saw without the slightest difficulty how little he knew of the various nautical points to which blackbeard continually called his attention  the vessel was dirty it was illappointed there was an air of reckless disorder which showed itself everywhere but apart from his evident distaste for dirt and griminess the captain of the revenge seemed to be very well satisfied with everything he saw when he passed a small gun pointed across the deck and with a nightcap hung upon a capstan bar thrust into its muzzle there was such a great laugh that bonnet looked around to see what the imprudent greenway might be doing  many were the nautical points to which blackbeard called his guests attention and many the questions the grim pirate asked but in almost all cases of the kind the tall gentleman with the cocked hat replied that he generally left those things to his sailingmaster being so much occupied with matters of more import  although he found no fault and made no criticisms bonnet was very much disgusted such a disorderly vessel such an apparently lawless crew excited his most severe mental strictures and although the great blackbeard was today a very wellbehaved person bonnet could not understand how a famous and successful captain should permit his vessel and his crew to get into such an unseamanlike and disgraceful condition on board the revenge as his sailingmaster had remarked there was the neatness of his kitchen and his storehouses and although he did not always know what to do with the nautical appliances which surrounded him he knew how to make them look in good order but he made few remarks favourable or otherwise and held himself loftier than before with an air as if he might have been an admiral entire instead of resembling one only in clothes and with ceremonious and even condescending politeness followed his host wherever he was led above decks or below  ben greenway had gone with his master about the ship with much of the air of one who accompanies a good friend to the place of execution regardless of gibes or insults whether they were directed at bonnet or himself he turned his face neither to the right nor to the left and apparently regarded nothing that he heard but while endeavouring to listen as little as possible to what was going on around him he heard a great deal but strange to say the railing and scurrility of the pirates did not appear to have a depressing influence upon his mind in fact he seemed in somewhat better spirits than when he came on board  whatever he may do whatever he may say an whatever he may swear said the scotchman to himself he is no like ane of these try as he may he canna descend so low into the blackness o evil as these sons o perdition although he has done evil beyond a poor mortals computation he walks like a king amang them even that blackbeard striving to be decent for an hour or two knows a superior when he meets him  when they had finished the tour of the vessel blackbeard conducted his guest to his own cabin and invited him to be seated by a little table bonnet sat down placing his highplumed cocked hat upon the bench beside him he did not want anything more to eat or to drink and he was in fact quite ready to take his leave the vessel had not pleased him and had given him an idea of the true pirates life which he had never had before on the revenge he mingled little with the crew scarcely ever below decks and his own quarters were as neat and commodious as if they were on a fine vessel carrying distinguished passengers dirt and disorder if they existed were at least not visible to him  but although he had no desire ever to make another visit to the ship of the great blackbeard he would remember his position and be polite and considerate now that he was here moreover the savage desperado of the day before dressed like a monkey and howling like an indian seemed now to be endeavouring to soften himself a little and to lay aside some of his savage eccentricities in honour of the captain of that fine ship the revenge so clothed in a calm dignity bonnet waited to hear what his host had further to say  blackbeard seated himself on the other side of the table on which he rested his massive arms behind him ben greenway stood in the doorway for a few moments blackbeard sat and gazed at bonnet and then he said look ye stede bonnet do you know you are now as much out of place as a red herring would be at the top of the mainmast  bonnet flushed i fear captain blackbeard he said i very much fear me that you are right this is no place for me i have paid my respects to you and now if you please i will take my leave i have not been gratified by the conduct of your crew but i did not expect that their captain would address me in such discourteous words and with this he reached out his hand for his hat  blackbeard brought down his hand heavily upon the table  sit where you are he exclaimed i have that to say to you which you shall hear whether you like my vessel my crew or me you are no sailor stede bonnet of bridgetown and you dont belong to the free companions who are all good men and true and can sail the ships they command you are a defrauder and a cheat you are nothing but a landsman a ploughtail sugarplanter  at this insult bonnet rose to his feet and his hand went to his sword  sit down roared blackbeard an you do not listen to me ill cut off this parley and your head together sit down sir  bonnet sat down pale now and trembling with rage he was not a coward but on board this ship he must give heed to the words of the desperado who commanded it  you have no right continued blackbeard to strut about on the quarterdeck of that fine vessel the revenge you have no right to hoist above you the jolly roger and you have no right to lie right and left and tell people you are a pirate a pirate forsooth you are no pirate a pirate is a sailor and you are no sailor you are no better than a blind man led by a dog if the dog breaks away from him he is lost and if the sailingmasters you pick up one after another break away from you you are lost it is a cursed shame stede bonnet and it shall be no longer at this moment by my own right and for the sake of every man who sails under the jolly roger i take away from you the command of the revenge  now bonnet could not refrain from springing to his feet take from me the revenge he cried my own vessel bought with my own money and how say you i am not a pirate from massachusetts down the coast into these very waters i have preyed upon commerce i have taken prizes i have burned ships i have made my name a terror  now his voice grew stronger and his tones more angry  not a pirate he cried go ask the galleons and the merchantmen i have stripped and burned go ask their crews now wandering in misery upon desert shores if they be not already dead and by what right i ask do you come to such an one as i am and declare that having put me in the position of a prisoner on your ship you will take away my own  blackbeard gazed at him with halfclosed eyes a malicious smile upon his face  i have no right he said i need no right i am a pirate  at these words bonnets legs weakened under him and he sank down upon the bench as he did so he glanced at ben greenway as if he were the only person on earth to whom he could look for help but to his amazement he saw before him a face almost jubilant and beheld the scotchman his eyes uplifted and his hands clasped as if in thankful prayer     chapter xix  the new first lieutenant   when the boat of the revenge was pulled back to that vessel bonnet did not go in it it was blackbeard who sat in the stern and held the tiller while one of his own men sat by him  when blackbeard stepped on deck he announced much to the delight of the crew and the consternation of paul bittern that the revenge now belonged to him and that all the crew who were fit to be kept on board such a fine vessel would be retained and that he himself for the present at least would take command of the ship would haul down that brandnew bit of womans work at the masthead and fly in its place his own black ragged jolly roger dreaded wherever seen upon the sea at this a shout went up from the crew the heart of every scoundrel among them swelled with joy at the idea of sailing fighting and pillaging under the bloody blackbeard  but the sailingmaster stood aghast he had known very well what was going to happen he had talked it all over in the town with blackbeard he had drunk in fiery brandy to the success of the scheme and he had believed without a doubt that he was to command the revenge when bonnet should be deposed and now where was he where did he stand  trembling a little he approached blackbeard and as for me he asked am i to command your old vessel  you roared blackbeard making as if he would jump upon him you you may fall to and bend your back with the others in the forecastle or you can jump overboard if you like my quartermaster richards now commands my old vessel presently i shall go over and settle things on that bark but first i shall step down into the cabin and see what rare good things sir nightcap the sugarplanter has prepared for me  with this he went below followed by the man he had brought with him  it was dickory half dazed by what he had heard who now stepped up to paul bittern the latter his countenance blacker than it had ever been before first scowled at him but in a moment the ferocity left his glance  oho he said heres a pretty pickle for me and you as well as for bonnet and the scotchman  do you suppose exclaimed dickory that what he says is true that he has stolen this ship from captain bonnet and that he has taken it for his own  suppose sneered the other i know it he has stolen from me as well as from bonnet i should have commanded this ship and i had made all my plans to do it when i got here  then you are as great a rascal said dickory as that vile pirate down below  just as great said bittern the only difference being that he has won everything while i have lost everything  what are we to do asked dickory i cannot stay here and i am sure you will not want to now while he is below can we not slip overboard and swim ashore i am sure i could do it  black paul grinned grimly but where should we swim to he said on the coast of honduras there is no safety for a man who flees from blackbeard but keep your tongue close he is coming  the moment blackbeard put his foot upon the deck he began to roar out his general orders  i go over to the bark he said and shall put my mate here in charge of her after that i go to my own vessel and when i have settled matters there i will return to this fine ship where i shall strut about the quarterdeck and live like a prince at sea now look ye youngster what is your name  charter replied dickory grimly  well then charter the pirate continued i shall leave you in charge of this vessel until i come back which will be before dark  me exclaimed dickory in amazement  yes you said the pirate i am sure you dont know anything about a ship any more than your master did but he got on very well and so may you and now remember your head shall pay for it if everything is not the same when i come back as it is now  thereupon this man of piratical business was rowed to the bark quite satisfied that he left behind him no one who would have the power to tamper with his interests he knew the crew having bound most of them to him on the preceding night and he trusted every one of them to obey the man he had set over them and no other as dickory would have no orders to give there would be no need of obedience and black paul would have no chance to interfere with anything                                       when bonnet had been left by blackbeardwho having said all he had to say hurried up the companionway to attend to the rest of his plansthe stately naval officer who had so recently occupied the bench by the table shrunk into a frightened farmer gazing blankly at ben greenway  think you ben he said in half a voice that this is one of that mans jokes i have heard that he has a fearful taste for horrid jokes  the scotchman shook his head joke master bonnet he exclaimed it is no joke he has taen your ship from ye he has taen from ye your sword your pistols an your wicked black flag an he has made evil impossible to ye he has taen from ye the shame an the wretched wickedness o bein a pirate think o that master bonnet ye are no longer a pirate that most devilish o all demons has presarved the rest o your life from the dishonour an the infamy which ye were labourin to heap upon it ye are a poor mon now master bonnet that beelzebub will strip from ye everything ye had all your riches shall be his ye can no longer afford to be a pirate ye will be compelled to be an honest mon an i tell ye that my soul lifteth itsel in thanksgivin an my heart is happier than it has been since that fearsome day when ye went on board your vessel at bridgetown  ben said bonnet it is hard and it is cruel that in this the time of my great trouble you turn upon me i have been robbed i have been ruined my life is of no more use to me and you ben greenway revile me while that i am prostrate  revile said the scotchman i glory i rejoice ye hae been converted ye hae been changed ye hae been snatched from the jaws o hell moreover master bonnet my soul was rejoiced even before that master deil came to set ye free from your toils to look upon ye an see that although ye called yoursel a pirate ye were no like ane o these blackhearted cutthroats ye were never as wicked master bonnet as ye said ye were  you are mistaken groaned bonnet i tell you ben greenway you are mistaken i am just as wicked as i ever was and i was very wicked as you should admit knowing what i have done oh ben ben is it true that i shall never go on board my good ship again  and with this he spread his arms upon the table and laid his head upon them he felt as if his career was ended and his heart broken ben greenway said no more to comfort him but at that moment he himself was the happiest man on the caribbean sea he seated himself in the little dirty cabin and his soul saw visions he saw his master deprived of all his belongings and with them of every taint of piracy and put on shore accompanied of course by his faithful servant he saw a ship sail perhaps soon perhaps later for jamaica he saw the blithe mistress kate her soul no longer sorrowing for an erring father come on board that vessel and sail with him for good old bridgetown he saw everything explained everything forgotten he saw before the dear old family a life of happinessperhaps he saw the funeral of madam bonnetand better than all he saw the pirate dead the good man revived again  to be sure he did not see dickory charter returning to his old home with his mother for he could not know what blackbeard was going to do with that young fellow but as dickory had thought of him when he had escaped with kate from the revenge so thought he now of dickory there were so many other important things which bore upon the situation that he was not able even to consider the young fellow  it did not take very long for a man of practical devilishness such as blackbeard was to finish the business which had called him away and he soon reappeared in the cabin  ho there good sir nightcapan i may freely call you that since now i own you uniform cocked hat title and everything elsedont cry yourself to sleep like a baby when its toys are taken away from it but wake up i have a bit of liking for you and i believe that that is because you are clean not having that virtue myself i admire it the more in others and i thank you from my inmost soulwherever that may befor having provided such comely quarters and such fair accommodations for me while i shall please to sail the revenge but i shall not condemn you to idleness and cankering thoughts my bold blusterer my terror of the sea my harrier of the coast my flaunter of the jolly roger washed clean in the tub with soap i shall give you work to do which shall better suit you than the troublesome trade youve been trying to learn you write well and read i know that my good sir nightcap and moreover you are a fair hand at figures i have great work before me in landing and selling the fine cargoes you have brought me and in counting and dividing the treasure you have locked in your ironbound chests and you shall attend to all that my reformed cutthroat my regenerated searobber you shall have a room of your own where you can take off that brave uniform and where you can do your work and keep your accounts and so shall be happier than you ever were before feeling that you are in your right place  to all this stede bonnet did not answer a word he did not even raise his head  and now for you my chaplain said blackbeard suddenly turning toward ben greenway what would you like would it suit you better to go overboard or to conduct prayers for my pious crew  i would stay wi my master said the scotchman quietly  the pirate looked steadily at greenway oho said he you are a sturdy fellow and have a mind to speak from being so stiff yourself you may be able to stiffen a little this rag of a master of yours and help him to understand the work he has to do which he will bravely do i ween when he finds that to be my clerk is his career ha ha sir nightcap the pirate of the pen and ink  deeply sunk these words into stede bonnets heart but he made no sign  when blackbeard went back to the revenge he took with him all of his own effects which he cared for and he also took the expirates uniform cocked hat and sword i may have use for them he said and my clerk can wear common clothes like common people  when her new commander reached the revenge dickory immediately approached him and earnestly besought him that he might be sent to join captain bonnet and ben greenway they are my friends said dickory and i have none here and i have brought a message to captain bonnet from his daughter and it is urgently necessary that i return with one from him to her i must instantly endeavour to find a ship which is bound for jamaica and sail upon her i have nothing to do with this ship having come on board of her simply to carry my message and it behooves me that i return quickly to those who sent me else injury may come of it  i like your speech my boy i like your speech cried blackbeard and he roared out a big laugh urgently necessary you must do this you must do that it is so long since i have heard such words that they come to me like wine from a cool vault  at this dickory flushed hot but he shut his mouth  you are a brave fellow cried blackbeard and above the common you are above the common there is that in your eye that could never be seen in the eye of a sugarplanter you will make a good pirate  pirate cried dickory losing all sense of prudence i would sooner be a wild beast in the forest than to be a pirate  blackbeard laughed loudly a good fellow a brave fellow he cried no man who has not the soul of a pirate within him could stand on his legs and speak those words to me sail to jamaica to carry messages to girls never you shall stay with me you shall be a pirate you shall be the head of all the pirates when i give up the business and take to sugarplanting ha ha when i take to sugarplanting and merrily make my own good rum  dickory was dismayed but captain blackbeard he said with more deference than before i cannot  cannot shouted the pirate you lie you can say not cannot to me you can do anything i tell you and do it you shall and now i am going to put you in your place and see that you hold it and fill it an if you please me not you carry no more messages in this world nor receive them charter i now make you the first officer of the revenge under me you cannot be mate because you know nothing of sailing a ship and besides no mate nor any quartermaster is worthy to array himself as i shall array you i make you first lieutenant and you shall wear the uniform and the cocked hat which sir nightcap hath no further use for  with that he went forward to speak to some of the men leaving dickory standing speechless with the expression of an infuriated idiot black paul stepped up to him  how now youngster said the exsailingmaster first officer eh if you look sharp you may find yourself in fine feather  no i will not answered dickory i will have nothing to do with this black pirate i will not serve under him i will not take charge of anything for him i am ashamed to talk with him to be on the same ship with him i serve good people the best and noblest in the world and i will not enter any service under him  hold ye hold ye said black paul you will not serve the good people you speak of by going overboard with a bullet in your head think of that youngster it is a poor way of helping your friends by quitting the world and leaving them in the lurch  at this moment blackbeard returned and when he saw bittern he roared at him out of that you seacat and if i see you again speaking to my lieutenant ill slash your ears for you in the next boat which leaves this ship i shall send you to one of the others i will have no sneaking schemer on board the revenge get ye forad get ye forad or i shall help ye with my cutlass  and the man who had safely brought two good ships richly laden into the harbour of belize and who had given blackbeard the information which made him understand the character of captain bonnet and how easy it would be to take possession of his person and his vessels and who had done everything in his power to enable the blackhearted pirate to secure to himself bonnets property and crews and who had only asked in return an actual command where before he had commanded in fact though not in name fled away from the false confederate to whom he had just given wealth and increased prestige  the last words of the unfortunate bittern sunk quickly and deeply into the heart of dickory if he should really go overboard with a bullet in his brain farewell to kate bonnet farewell to his mother he was yet a very young man and it had been but a little while since he had been wandering barefooted over the ships at bridgetown selling the fruit of his mothers little farm since that he had loved and lived so long that he could not calculate the period and now he was a man and stood trembling at the point where he was to decide to begin life as a pirate or end everything before blackbeard had turned his lowering visage from his retreating benefactor dickory had decided that whatever might happen he would not of his own freewill leave life and fair kate bonnet  and so you are to be my first lieutenant said blackbeard his face relaxing i am glad of that there was nothing needed on this ship but a decent man i have put one on my old vessel and if there were another to be found in the gulf of honduras id clap him on that goodly bark now sir down to your berth and don your naval finery youre always to wear it youre not fit to wear the clothes of a real sailor and i have no landsmans toggery on this ship  dickory bowedhe could not speakand went below when next he appeared on deck he wore the excaptain bonnets uniform and the tall plumed hat  it is for kates sweet sake he said to himself as he mounted the companionway for her sake id wear anything id do anything if only i may see her again  when the new first lieutenant showed himself upon the quarterdeck there was a general howl from the crew and peal after peal of derisive laughter rent the air  then blackbeard stepped quietly forward and ordered eight of the jeerers to be strung up and flogged  i would like you all to remember said the master pirate that when i appoint an officer on this ship there is to be no sneering at him nor any want of respect and it strikes me that i shall not have to say anything more on the subjectto this precious crew at any rate  the next day lively times began on board the two rich prizes which the pirate blackbeard had lately taken there had been scarcely more hard work and excitement cursing and swearing when the rich freight had been taken from the merchantmen which had originally carried it poor bonnets pen worked hard at lists and calculations for blackbeard was a practical man and not disposed to loose and liberal dealings with either his men or the tradefolk ashore  at times the troubled and harassed mind of the former captain of the revenge would have given way under the strain had not ben greenway stayed bravely by him who although a slow accountant was sure and a great help to one who in these times of hurry and flurry was extremely rapid and equally uncertain blackbeard was everywhere anxious to complete the unloading and disposal of his goods before the weather changed but wherever he went he remembered that upon the quarterdeck of his fine new ship the revenge there was one who knowing nothing of nautical matters was above all suspicion of nautical interferences and who although having no authority represented the most powerful nautical commander in all those seas     chapter xx  one north one south   if our dear kate bonnet had really imagined in her inexperienced mind that it would be a matter of days and perhaps weeks to procure a vessel in which she with her uncle and good dame charter could sail forth to save her father she was wonderfully mistaken not a freefooted vessel of any class came into the harbour of kingston sloops and barks and ships in general arrived and departed but they were all bound by one contract or another and were not free to sail away here and there for a short time or a long time at the word of a maidens will  mr delaplaine was a rich man but he was a prudent one and he had not the money to waste in wild rewards even if there had been an opportunity for him to offer them kate was disconcerted disappointed and greatly cast down  the vengeful badger was scouring the seas in search of her father commissioned to destroy him and eager in his hot passion to do it and here was she with a respite for that father if only she were able to carry it  day after day kate waited for notice of a craft not only one which might bring dickory back but one which might carry her away  the optimism of dame charter would not now bear her up the load which had been put upon it was too big everything about her was melancholy and depressed and dickory had not come back so many things had happened since he went away and so many days had passed and she had entirely exhausted her plentiful stock of very good reasons why her son had not been able to return to her  the governor was very kind frequently he came to the delaplaine mansion and always he brought assurances that although he had not heard anything from captain vince there was every reason to suppose that before long he would find some way to send him his commands that captain bonnet should not be injured but should be brought back safely to jamaica  and then kate would say with tears in her eyes but your excellency we cannot wait for that we must go we must deliver ourselves your message to the captain of the badger who else will do it and we cannot trust to chance while we are trusting and hoping my father may die  at such moments mr delaplaine would sometimes say in his heart not daring to breathe such thoughts aloud and what could be better than that he should die and be done with it he is a thorn in the side of the young the good and the beautiful and as long as he lives that thorn will rankle  moreover not only did the good merchant harbour such a wicked thought but dame charter thought something of the very same kind though differently expressed if he had never been born she would say to herself how much better it would have been but then the thought would come crowding in how bad that would have been for dickory and for the plans she was making for him  in the midst of all this uncertainty this anxiety this foreboding almost this despair there came a sunburst which lighted up the souls of these three good people which made their eyes sparkle and their hearts swell with thankfulness this happiness came in the shape of a letter from martin newcombe  the letter was a long one and told many things the first part of it kate read to herself and kept to herself for in burning words it assured her that he loved her and would always love her and that no misfortune of her own nor wrongdoings of others could prevent him from offering her his most ardent and unchangeable affection moreover he begged and implored her to accept that affection to accept it now that it might belong to her forever happiness he said seemed opening before her he implored her to allow him to share that happiness with her the rest of the letter was read most jubilantly aloud it told of news which had come to newcombe from honduras gulf great news wonderful news which would make the heart sing major bonnet was at belize he had given up all connection with piracy and was now engaged in mercantile pursuits this was positively true for the person who had sent the news to bridgetown had seen major bonnet and had talked to him and had been informed by him that he had given up his ship and was now an accountant and commission agent doing business at that place  the sender of this great news also stated that ben greenway was with major bonnet working as his assistantand here dame charter sat openmouthed and her heart nearly stopped beatingyoung dickory charter had also been in the port and had gone away but was expected ere long to return  kate stood on her tiptoes and waved the letter over her head  to belize my dear uncle to belize if we cannot get there any other way we must go in a boat with oars we must fly we must not wait perhaps he is seeking in disguise to escape the vengeance of the wicked vince but that matters not we know where he is we must fly uncle we must fly  the opportunities for figurative flying were not wanting there were no vessels in the port which might be engaged for an indeterminate voyage in pursuit of a british manofwar but there was a goodly sloop about to sail in ballast for belize before sunset three passages were engaged upon this sloop  kate sat long into the night her letter in her hand here was a lover who loved her a lover who had just sent to her not only love but life a lover who had no intention of leaving her because of her overshadowing sorrow but who had lifted that sorrow and had come to her again ay more she knew that if the sorrow had not been lifted he would have come to her again  the governor of jamaica was a man of hearty sympathies and these worked so strongly in him that when kate and her uncle came to bring him the good news he kissed her and vowed that he had not heard anything so cheering for many a year  i have been greatly afraid of that vince he said although i did not mention it i have been greatly afraid of him he is a terrible fellow when he is crossed and so hotheaded that it is easy to cross him there were so many chances of his catching your father and so few chances of my orders catching him but it is all right now you will be able to reach your father before vince can possibly get to him even should he be able to do him injury in his present position your father my dear must have been as mad as a march hare to embark upon a career of a pirate when all the time his heart was really turned to ways of peace to planting to mercantile pursuits to domestic joys  here now was to be a voyage of conquest no matter what his plans were no matter what he said no matter what he might lose or how he might suffer by being taken into captivity and being carried away major stede bonnet late of bridgetown and still later connected with some erratic voyages upon the high seas was to be taken prisoner by his daughter and carried away to spanish town where the actions of his disordered mind were to be condoned and where he would be safe from all vengeful vinces and from all temptations of the flaunting skull and bones  it was a bright morning when with a fair wind upon her starboard bow the sloop belinda bearing the jubilant three sailed southward on her course to the coast of honduras and it was upon that same morning that the good ship revenge bearing the pirate blackbeard and his handsomely uniformed lieutenant sailed northward the same fair wind upon her port bow     chapter xxi  a projected marriage   strange as it may appear dickory charter was not a very unhappy young fellow as he stood in his fine uniform on the quarterdeck of the revenge the fresh breeze ruffling his brown curls when he lifted his heavy cocked hat  true he was leaving behind him his friends captain bonnet and ben greenway with whom the wayward blackbeard would allow no word of leavetaking true he was going he knew not where and in the power of a man noted the new world over for his savage eccentricities and true he might soon be sailing hour by hour farther and farther away from the island on which dwelt the angel katethat angel kate and his mother but none of these considerations could keep down the glad feeling that he was going that he was moving moreover in answer to one of his impassioned appeals to be set ashore at jamaica blackbeard had said to him that if he should get tired of him he did not see at that moment any reason why he should not put him on board some convenient vessel and have him landed at kingston  dickory did not believe very much in the blackbearded pirate with his wild tricks and inhuman high spirits but jamaica lay to the east and he was going eastward  incited perhaps by the possession of a fine ship manned by a crew picked from his old vessel and from the men who had formed the crew of the revenge blackbeard was in better spirits than was his wont and so far as his nature would allow he treated dickory with fair goodhumour but no matter what happened his unrestrained imagination never failed him having taken the fancy to see dickory always in full uniform he allowed him to assume no other clothes he was always in naval fulldress and cocked hat and his duties were those of a private secretary  the only shrewd thing i ever knew your sir nightcap to do he said was to tell me you could not read nor write he spoke so glibly that i believed him had it not been so i should have sent you to the town to help with the shore end of my affairs and then you would have been there still and i should have had no admiral to write my log and straighten my accounts  sometimes in his quieter moods when there was no provocation to send pistolballs between two sailors quietly conversing or to perform some other demoniac trick blackbeard would talk to dickory and ask all manner of questions some of which the young man answered while some he tried not to answer thus it was that the pirate found out a great deal more about dickorys life hope and sorrows than the young fellow imagined that he made known he discovered that dickory was greatly interested in bonnets daughter and wished above all other things in this world to get to her and to be with her  this was a little out of the common run of things among the brotherhood it was their fashion to forget so far as they were able the family ties which already belonged to them and to make no plans for any future ties of that sort which they might be able to make such a thing amused the generally rampant blackbeard but if this dickory boy whom they had on board really did wish to marry some one the idea came into the crafty mind of blackbeard that he would like to attend to that marrying himself it pleased him to have a finger in every pie and now here was a pie in the fingering of which he might take a novel interest  this renowned desperado this bloody cutthroat this merciless pirate possessed a homea quiet little english home on the cornwall coast where the cheerful woods and fields stretched down almost in reach of the sullen sea here dwelt his wife quiet mistress thatch and here his brawny daughter seldom a word came to this rural home from the father burning and robbing sinking and slaying out upon the western seas but from the stores of pelf which so often slipped so easily into his great arms and which so often slipped just as easily out of them came now and then something to help the brawn grow upon his daughters bones and to ease the labours of his wife  eliza thatch bore no resemblance to a houri her hair was red her face was freckled she had enough teeth left to do good eating with when she had a chance and her step shook the timbers of her little home  her father had heard from her a little while ago by a letter she had had conveyed to belize his parental feelings notwithstanding he had told bonnet he knew no such sentiments were stirred when he had finished her letter he would have been well pleased to burn a vessel and make a dozen passengers walk the plank as a memorial to his girl but this not being convenient it had come to him that he would marry the wench to the gaily bedecked young fellow he had captured and it filled his reckless heart with a wild delight he drew his cutlass and with a great oath he drove the heavy blade into the top of the table and he swore by this mark that his grand plan should be carried out  he would sail over to england this would be a happy chance for his vessel was unladen and ready for any adventure he would drop anchor in the quiet cove he knew of he would go ashore by night he would be at home again to be at home again made him shout with profane laughter the little home he remembered would be so ridiculous to him now he would see again his poor little trembling wifeshe must be gray by nowand he was sure that she would tremble more than ever she did when she heard the great sea oaths which he was accustomed to pour forth now and his daughter she must be a strapping wench by this time he was sure she could stand a slap on the back which would kill her mother  yes there should be a wedding a fine wedding and good old rum should water the earth and he would detail a boats crew of jolly good fellows from the revenge to help make things uproarious this charter boy and eliza should have a house of their own with plenty of moneyhe had more funds in hand than ever in his life beforeand his respectable soninlaw should go to london and deposit his fortune in a bank it would be royal fun to think of him and eliza highly respectable and with money in the bank a quart of the best rum could scarcely have made blackbeard more hilarious than did this glorious notion he danced among his crew he singed beards he whacked with capstan bars he pushed men down hatchways he was in lordly spirits and his crew expected some great adventure some startling piece of deviltry  of course he did not keep his great design from dickoryit was too glorious too transcendent he took his young admiral into his cabin and laid before him his dazzling future  dickory sat speechless almost breathless as he listened he could feel himself turn cold had any one else been talking to him in this strain he would have shouted with laughter but people did not laugh at blackbeard  when the pirate had said all and was gazing triumphantly at poor dickory the young man gasped a word in answer he could not accept this awful fate without as much as a wave of the hand in protest  but sir said he if  blackbeards face grew black he bent his head and lowered upon the pale dickory then with a tremendous blow he brought down his fist upon the table  if eliza will not have you he roared if that girl will not take you when i offer you to her if she or her mother as much as winks an eyelash in disobedience of my commands i will take them by the hair of their heads and i will throw them into the sea if she will not have you he repeated roaring as if he were shouting through a speaking trumpet in a storm if i thought that youngster i would burn the house with both of them in it and the rum i had bought to make a jolly wedding should be poured on the timbers to make them blaze let no notions like that enter your mind my boy if she disobeys me i will cook her and you shall eat her disobey me and he swore at such a rate that he panted for fresh air and mounted to the deck  it was not a time for dickory to make remarks indicating his disapproval of the proposed arrangement  as the revenge sailed on over sunny seas or under lowering clouds dickory was no stranger to the binnacle and the compass always told him that they were sailing eastward he had once asked blackbeard where they now were by the chart but that gracious gentleman of the midnight beard had given him oaths for answers and had told him that if the captain knew where the ship was on any particular hour or minute nobody else on that ship need trouble his head about it but at last the course of the revenge was changed a little and she sailed northward then dickory spoke with one of the mildest of the mates upon the subject of their progress and the man made known to him that they were now about halfway through the windward passage dickory started back he knew something of the geography of those seas  why then he cried we have passed jamaica  of course we have said the man and if it had not been for dickorys uniform he would have sworn at him     chapter xxii  blade to blade   when the corvette badger sailed from jamaica she moved among the islands of the caribbean sea as if she had been a modern vessel propelled by a steamengine that which represented a steamengine in this case was the fiery brain of captain christopher vince of his majestys navy more than winds more than currents this brain made its power felt upon the course and progress of the vessel  calling at every port where information might possibly be gained hailing every sloop or ship or fishingsmack which might have sighted the pirate ship revenge with a constant lookout for a black flag captain vince kept his engine steadily at work  but it was not in pursuit of a ship that the swift keel of the badger cut through the sea this way and that now on a long course now doubling back again like a hound fancying he has got the scent of a hare then raging wildly when he finds the scent is false it was in pursuit of a woman that every sail was spread that the lookout swept the sea and that the hot brain of the captain worked steadily and hard this english manofwar was on a cruise to make kate bonnet the bride of its captain the heart of this naval lover was very steady it was fixed in its purpose nothing could turn it aside vinces plans were welldigested he knew what he wanted to do he knew how he was going to do it  in the first place he would capture the man bonnet all the details of the action were arranged to that end then with kates father as his prisoner he would be master of the situation  there was nothing noble about this craftily elaborated design but then there was nothing noble about captain vince he was a strong hater and a strong lover and whether he hated or loved nothing good or bad must stand in his way with the life or death the misery or the happiness of the father in his hands he knew that he need but beckon to the daughter she might come slowly but she would come she was a grand woman but she was a woman she might resist the warm plea of love but she could not resist the cold commands of that cruel figure of death who stood behind the lover  captain bonnet was returning from his visit to the new england coast picking up bits of profit here and there as fortune befell him when captain vince first heard that the revenge had gone northward the news was circumstantial and straightforward and was not to be doubted vince raged upon his quarterdeck when he found out how he had been wasting time northward now was pointed the bow of the badger and the vengeful vince felt as if his prey was already in his hands if bonnet had sailed up the atlantic coast he was bound to sail down again it might be a long cruise there might be impatient waitings at the mouths of coves and rivers where the pirates were accustomed to take refuge or refit but the light of the eyes of kate bonnet were worth the longest pursuit or the most impatient waiting  so steadily sailed the corvette badger up the long atlantic coast and she passed the capes of the delaware while captain bonnet was examining the queer pulpit in the little bayside town where his ship had stopped to take in water  at the various ports of the northern coast where the revenge had sailed back and forth outside the badger boldly entered and the tales she heard soon turned her back again to sail southward down the long atlantic coast but the heart of christopher vince never failed the vision of kate bonnet as he had seen her standing with glorious eyes denouncing him as he should see her when with bowed head and proffered hand she came to him as all should see her when in her clearcut beauty she stood beside him in his ancestral home never left him  off the port of charles town south carolina the badger lay and waited and soon from an outgoing bark the news came to captain vince that several weeks before the pirate bonnet of the revenge had taken an english ship as she was entering port and had then sailed southward southward now sailed the badger and as there was but little wind captain vince swore with an unremitting diligence  it was a quiet morning and the badger was nearing the straits of florida when a sail was reported almost due south  up came captain vince with his glass and after a long long look and another and another during which the two vessels came slowly nearer and nearer each other the captain turned to his first officer and said quietly she flies the skull and bones shes the first of those hellish pirates that we have yet met on this most unlucky cruise  if we could send her with her crew on board ten times to the bottom said the other she would not pay us what her vile fraternity has cost us but these pirate craft know well the difference between a spanish galleon and a british manofwar and they will always give us a wide berth  but this one will not said the captain  then again he looked long and earnestly through his glass send aft the three men who know the revenge said he  presently the men came aft and one by one they went aloft and soon came the report vouched for by each of them  the sail ahead is the pirate revenge  now all redness left the face of captain vince he was as pale as if he had been afraid that the pirate ship would capture him but every man on his vessel knew that there was no fear in the soul or the body of the captain of the badger quickly came his orders clear and sharp everything had been gone over before but everything was gone over again the corvette was to bear down upon the pirate her cannongreat guns for those days and which could soon have disabled if they had not sunk the smaller vesselwere muzzled and told to hold their peace the manofwar was to bear down upon the pirate and to capture her by boarding there was to be no broadside no timbersplitting cannon balls  the wind was light and in favour of the corvette and slowly the two vessels diminished the few miles between them but there was enough wind to show the royal colours on the badger  he is a bold fellow that pirate said some of the naval men and he will wait and fight us  he will wait and fight us said some of the others because he cannot get away in this wind he is at our mercy  captain vince stood and gazed over the water sometimes with his glass and sometimes without it here now was the end of his fuming his raging his long and untiring search all the anxious weariness of long voyaging all the impatience of watching all the irritation of waiting had gone the notorious vessel in which the father of kate bonnet had made himself a terror and a scourge was now almost within his reach the beneficent vessel by which the father of kate bonnet should give to him his lifes desire was so near to him that he could have sent a musket ball into her had he chosen to fire it was so near to him that he could now with his glass read the word revenge on her bow his brows were knit his jaws were set tight his muscles hardened themselves with energy  again the orders were passed that when the men of the corvette boarded the pirate they were to cut down the rascals without mercy and not one of them was to draw sword or pistol against the pirate captain he would be attended to by their commander  vince knew the story of stede bonnet he knew that early in life he had been in the army and that it was likely that he understood the handling of a sword but he knew also that he himself was one of the best swordsmen in the royal navy he yearned to cross blades with the man whose blood should not be shed whose life should be preserved throughout the combat as if he were a friend and not a foe who should surrender to him his sword and give to him his daughter  theyre a brave lot those bloody rascals said one of the men of the badger  theyve a fool of a captain said another he knows not the difference between a british manofwar and a spanish galleon but we shall teach him that  slowly they came together the revenge and the badger the bow of one pointed east and the bow of the other to the west from neither vessel there came a word the low waves could be heard flapping against their sides suddenly there rang out from the manofwar the order to make fast the grapnels flew over the bulwarks of the pirate and in a moment the two vessels were as one then with a great shout the men of the badger leaped and hurled themselves upon the deck of the revenge and upon that deck and from behind bulwarks there rose yelling and howling and roaring the picked men of two pirate crews quick furious and strong as tigers the hate of man in their eyes and the love of blood in their hearts like a wave of massacre they threw themselves against the drilled masses of the badgers crew and with yells and oaths and curses and cries the battle raged  with a sudden dash the captain of the manofwar plunged through the ranks of the combatants and stood upon the middle of the deck his quick eyes shot here and there wherever he might be he sought the captain of the pirate ship in an instant a huge man bounded aft and made one long step towards him vast in chest and shoulder and with mighty limbs fieryeyed hairy horribly fantastic blackbeard stood with great head lowered for the charge  a sugarplanter was the swift thought of vince  are you the captain of this ship he shouted  i am cried the other and with a curse like bursting thunder the pirate came on and his blade crossed that of captain vince  forward and amidships surged the general fight men plunged swords fell blood flowed feet slipped upon the deck and roars of blasphemy and pain rose above the noise of battle but farther aft the two captains in a space by themselves cut thrust and trampled whirling around each other dashing from this side and that ever with keen eyes firmly fixed ever with strong arms whirling down and upward now one man felt the keen cut of steel and now the other the blood ran upon rich uniform or stained rough cloth and leather it was a fight as if between a lioness and a tigress their dead cubs nearby  as most men in the navy knew captain vince was a most dangerous swordsman in duel or in warfare no man yet had been able to stand before him with skilled arm and eye and with every muscle of his body trained his sword sought a vital spot in his opponent there was no thought now in the mind of vince about disarming the pirate and taking him prisoner this terrible wild beast this hairy monster must be killed or he himself must die through the whirl and clash and hot breath of battle he had been amazed that kate bonnets father should be a man like this  the pirate his eyes now shrunken into his head where they glowed like coals his breath steaming like a volcano and his tremendous muscles supple and quick as those of a cat met his antagonist at every point and with every lunge and thrust and cut forced him to guard  now vince shut himself in his armour of trained defence this bounding lion must be killed but the deathstroke must be cunningly delivered and until in his hot rage the pirate should forget his guard vince must shield himself  never had the great blackbeard met so keen a swordsman he howled with rage to see the english captain still vigorous agile warding every stroke blackbeard was now a wild beast of the sea he fought to kill for naught else not even his own life with a yell he threw himself upon captain vince whose sword passed quick as lightning through the brawny masses of his left shoulder with one quick step the pirate pressed closer to vince thus holding the imprisoned blade which stuck out behind his body and with a tremendous blow of his right fist in which he held the heavy brazen hilt of his sword he dashed his enemy backward to the ground the fall drew the blade from the shoulder of blackbeard whose great right arm went up whose sword hissed in the air and then came down upon the prostrate vince another stroke and the english captain lay insensible and still  with the scream of a maddened indian blackbeard sprung into the air and when his feet touched the deck he danced he would have hewn his victim into pieces he would have scattered him over the decks but there was no time for such recreations forward the battle raged with tremendous fury and into the midst of it dashed blackbeard  from the companionway leading to the captains cabin there now appeared a pale young face it was that of dickory charter who had been ordered by blackbeard before the two vessels came together to shut himself in the cabin and to keep out of the broil swearing that if he made himself unfit to present to eliza he would toss his disfigured body into the sea entirely unarmed and having no place in the fight dickory had obeyed but the spirit of a young man which burned within him led him to behold the greater part of the conflict between blackbeard and the english captain being a young man he had shut his eyes at the end of it but when the pirate had left he came forth quietly the fight raged forward and here he was alone with the fallen figure on the deck  as dickory stood gazing downward in awein all his life he had never seen a corpsethe man he had supposed dead opened his eyes for a moment and gazed with dull intelligence and then he gasped for rum dickory was quickly beside him with a tumbler of spirits and water which raising the fallen mans head he gave him in a few moments the eyes of captain vince opened wider and he stared at the young man in naval uniform who stood above him who are you he said in a low voice but distinct an english officer  no said dickory i am no officer and no pirate i am forced to wear these clothes  and then his natural and selfish instincts pushing themselves before anything else dickory went on oh sir if your men conquer these pirates will you take me but as he spoke he saw that the wounded man was not listening to him his halfclosed eyes turned towards him and he whispered  more spirits  illustration take that he feebly said and swear that it shall be delivered  dickory dashed into the cabin halffilled a tumbler with rum and gave it to vince presently his eyes recovered something of their natural glow and with contracted brow he fixed them upon the stream of blood which was running from him over the deck  suddenly he spoke sharply young fellow he said some paper and a pen a pencil anything quick  dickory looked at him in amazement for a moment and then he ran into the cabin soon returning with a sheet of paper and an english pencil  the eyes of captain vince were now very bright and a nervous strength came into his body he raised himself upon his elbow he clutched at the paper and clapping it upon the deck began to write quickly his pencil moved already he was feeling that his rumgiven strength was leaving him but several pages he wrote and then he signed his name folding the sheet he stopped for a moment feeling that he could do no more but gathering together his strength in one convulsive motion he addressed the letter  take that he feebly said and swear  that it shall be  delivered  i swear said dickory as on his knees he took the bloodsmeared letter he hastily slipped it into the breast of his coat and then he was barely able to move quick enough to keep the englishmans head from striking the deck  how now sounded a harsh growl at his ear get you into your cabin or you will be hurt it is not time yet for the fleecing of corpses i am choking for a glass of brandy get in and stay there  in another minute blackbeard refreshed was running aft the cut through his shoulder bleeding but entirely forgotten  there was no fighting now upon the deck of the revenge the conflict raged but it had been transferred to the badger the sailors of the manofwar had fought valiantly and stoutly even impetuously but their enemiespicked men from two pirate crewshad fought like wiremuscled devils ablaze with fury they had cut down the badgers men piling them upon their own fallen comrades they had followed the brave fellows with oaths cutlasses and pistols as little at a time and fighting all the while they slowly clambered back into their own ship the pirates had thrown their grapnels over the bulwarks of the manofwar they had followed cut by cut shot by shot until they now stood upon the badger fighting with the same fury that they had just fought upon the bloodsoaked revenge blackbeard was not yet with themwhatever happened blackbeard must be refreshedbut now he sprang into the enemys shipthat fine british manofwar the corvette badger which had so bravely sailed down upon his ship to capture herand led the carnage  they were tough men those british seamen tough in heart tough in arms and body they fought above decks and they fought below and they laid many a pirate scoundrel dead but they had met a foe which was too strong for thema pack of brawny hairy desperadoes picked from two pirate crews the first officer now commanding panting bleeding and torn groaned as he saw that his men could fight no longer and he surrendered the badger to the pirates  the great blackbeard yelled with delight when had any other captain sailing under the jolly roger captured a british manofwar a firstclass corvette of the royal navy his frenzied joy was so intense that he was on the point of cutting down the officer who was offering him his sword but he withheld his hand  go somebody and fetch me a glass of his majestys rum he cried and i will drink to his perdition  the door of a locker was smashed the spirits were brought and the great blackbeard was again refreshed  standing on the quarterdeck where but an hour or two before captain christopher vince had stood commanding his fine corvette as she sailed down upon her pirate enemy blackbeard had brought before him all the survivors of the badgers crew  well youre a lot of damnable knaves said he and you have cost me many a good man this day but my crew will now be shorthanded and if any or all of you will turn pirate and ship with me i will let bygones pass but if any of you choose not that overboard you go i will have no unwilling rascals in my crew  all but one of the men of the badger downcast wounded panting with thirst and loving life agreed to become pirates and to ship on board the revenge  the first mate would not break his oath of allegiance to the king and he went overboard     chapter xxiii  the address of the letter   there was hard and ghastly work that day when the revenge was cleared after action and there was lively and interesting work on board the badger when blackbeard and his officers went over the captured vessel to discover what new possessions they had won  at first blackbeard had thought to establish himself upon the corvette and abandon the revenge it would have been such a grand thing to scourge the seas in a british manofwar with the jolly roger floating over her but this would have been too dangerous the combined naval force of england in american waters would have been united to put down such presumption so the wary pirate curbed his ambition  everything portable and valuable was stripped from the badgerher guns would have been taken had it been practicable to ship them to the revenge in a rising seaand then she was scuttled fired and cast off and with her dead on board she passed out of commission in the royal navy  during the turmoil the horror and the bringing aboard of pillage dickory charter had kept close below deck his face in his hands and his heart almost broken it is so easy for young hearts to almost break  when he had seen the british ship come sailing down upon them hope had sprung up brightly in his heart now there was a chance of his escaping from this hell of the waves when the revenge should be taken he would rush to the british captain or any one in authority and tell his tale it would be believed he doubted not even his uniform would help to prove he was no pirate he would be taken away he would reach jamaica he would see kate he would carry to her the great news of her father after that his life could take care of itself  but now the blackness of darkness was over everything those who were to have been his friends had vanished the ship which was to have given him a new life had disappeared forever he was on board the pirate ship bound for the shores of englandhorrible shores to himbound to the shores of england and to blackbeards eliza  he was not a fool this dickory he had no unwarrantable and romantic fears that in these enlightened days one man could say to another go you and marry the woman i have chosen for you there was nothing silly or cowardly about him but he knew blackbeard  not one ray of hope thrust itself through his hands into his brain hope had gone gone to the bottom and he was on his stormtossed way to the waters of another continent  but in the midst of his despair dickory never thought of freeing himself by a sudden bound of the world and his woes so long as kate should live he must live even if it were to prove to himself and to himself only how faithful to her he could be  it was dark when men came tumbling below throwing themselves into hammocks and bunks and dickory prepared to turn in if sleep should come and without dreams it would be greater gain than bags of gold as he took off his coat the letter of the english captain dropped from his breast until then he had forgotten it but now he remembered it as a sacred trust the dull light of the lantern barely enabled him to discern objects about him but he stuck the letter into a crack in the woodwork where in the morning he would see it and take proper care of it  soon sleep came but not without dreams he dreamed that he was rowing kate on the river at bridgetown and that she told him in a low sweet voice with a smile on her lips and her eyes tenderly upturned that she would like to row thus with him forever  early in the morning through an open porthole the light of the eastern sun stole into this abode of darkness and sin and threw itself upon the redstained letter sticking in the crack of the woodwork presently dickory opened his eyes and the first thing they fell upon was that letter on the side of the folded sheet he could see the superscription boldly but irregularly written miss kate bonnet kingston ja  dickory sat upright his eyes hardfixed and burning how long he sat he knew not how long his brain burned inwardly as his eyes burned outwardly he knew not the noise of the watch going on deck roused him and in a moment he had the letter in his hands  all that day dickory charter was worth nothing to anybody blackbeard swore at him and pushed him aside the young fellow could not even count the doubloons in a bag  go to cried the pirate blacker and more fantastically horrible than ever for his bare left shoulder was bound with a scarf of silk and his great arm was streaked and bedabbled with his blood you are the most cursed coward i have met with in all my days at sea so frightened out of your wits by a lively brush as that of yesterday too scared to count gold never saw i that before one might be too scared to pray but to count gold ha ha and the bold pirate laughed a merry roar he was in good spirits he had captured and sunk an english manofwar sunk her with her english ensign floating above her how it would have overjoyed him if all the ships little and big that plied the spanish main could have seen him sink that manofwar he was a merry man that morning the great blackbeard triumphant in victory glowing with the kings brandy and with so little pain from that cut in his shoulder that he could waste no thought upon it  but eliza will like it well continued the merry pirate she will lead you with a string be you bold or craven and the less you pull at it the easier it will be for my brave girl ah she will dance with joy when i tell her what a frightened rabbit of a husband it is that i give her now get away somewhere and let your face rid itself of its paleness and should you find a dead man lying where he has been overlooked come and tell me and i will have him put aside you must not be frightened any more or eliza may find that you have not left even the spirit of a rabbit  all day dickory sat silent his misery pinned into the breast of his coat miss kate bonnet kingston jaand this on a letter written in the dying moments of an english captain a high and mighty captain who must have loved as few men love to write that letter his lifes blood running over the paper as he wrote and could a man love thus if he were not loved that was the terrible question  sometimes his mind became quiet enough for him to think coherently then it was easy enough for him to understand everything kate had been a long time in jamaica she had met many people she had met this man this noble handsome man dickory had watched him with glowing admiration as he stood up before blackbeard fighting like the champion of all good against the hairy monster who struck his blows for all that was base and wicked  how dickorys young heart had gone out in sympathy and fellowship towards the brave english captain how he had hoped that the next of his quick sharp lunges might slit the black heart of the pirate how he had almost wept when the noble englishman went down and now it made him shudder to think his heart had stood side by side with the heart of kates lover he had sworn to deliver the letter of that lover and he would do it more cruel than the bloodiest pirate was the fate that forced him thus to bear the deathwarrant of his own young life     chapter xxiv  belize   there were not many captains of merchantmen in the early part of the eighteenth century who cared to sail into the gulf of honduras that body of water being such a favourite resort of pirates  but no such fears troubled the mind of the skipper of the brig belinda which was now making the best of her way towards the port of belize she was a sturdy vessel and carried no prejudices sometimes she was laden with goods bought from the pirates and destined to be sold to honest people and again she carried commodities purchased from those who were their legal owners and intended for the use of the bold rascals who sailed under the jolly roger then as now it was impossible for thieves to steal all the commodities they desired some things must be bought thus serving the pirates as well as honest traders the sloop belinda feared not to sail the gulf of honduras or to cast anchor by the town of belize  as the good ship approached her port kate bonnet kept steadfastly on deck during most of the daylight her eyes searching the surface of the water for something which looked like her fathers ship the revenge true mr newcombe had written her that major bonnet had given up piracy and was now engaged in commercial business in the town but still if she should see the revenge the sight would be of absorbing interest to her she was a girl of quick observation and good memory but the town came in view and she had seen no vessel which reminded her of the revenge  as soon as the anchor was dropped kate wished to go on shore but her uncle would not hear of that he must know something definite before he trusted kate or himself in such a lawless town as belize the captain who was going ashore could make inquiries and kate must wait  in a little room at the back of a large low storehouse not far from the pier sat stede bonnet and his faithful friend and servitor ben greenway the storehouse was crowded with goods of almost every imaginable description and even the room back of it contained an overflow of bales boxes and barrels at a small table near a window sat the scotchman and bonnet the latter reading from some roughly written lists descriptions and quantities of goods the value of each item being estimated by the canny scotchman who set down the figures upon another list presently bonnet put down his papers and heaved a heavy sigh which sigh seemed to harmonize very well with his general appearance he carried no longer upon him the countenance of the bold officer who in uniform and flowing feather trod the quarterdeck of the revenge but bore the expression of a man who knew adversity yet was not able to humble himself under it he was bent and borne down although not yet broken had he been broken he could better have accommodated himself to his present case his clothes were those of the common class of civilian and there was that about him which indicated that he cared no more for neatness or good looks  ben greenway he said this is too much now have i reached the depth in my sorrow at which all my strength leaves me i cannot read these lists  the scotchman looked up is there no light enow he asked  light said bonnet there is no light anywhere all is murkiness and gloom the goods which you have been lately estimating are all my own taken from my own ship by that arch traitor and chief devil blackbeard i have read the names of them to you and i have remembered many of them and i have not weakened but now comes a task which is too great for me these things which follow were all intended for my daughter kate silks and satins and cloth of gold ribbons and fine linen laces and ornaments all these i selected for my dear daughter and by day and by night i have thought of her apparelled in fine raiment more richly dressed than any lady in barbadoes my daughter my beautiful my proud kate and now what has it all come to all these are gone basely stolen from me by that blackbeard  ben greenway looked up wha stole from ye he said what ye had already stolen from its rightful owners an think ye he continued that your honest daughter kate would deign to array hersel in stolen goods no matter how rich they might happen to be an think ye she could hold up her head if the good people o bridgetown could point at her an say look at the thiefs daughter how fine she is an think ye that mr martin newcombe would tak into his house an hame a wife wha hadna come honestly by her clothes i tell ye master bonnet that ye should exalt your soul in thankfulness that ye are no longer a dishonest mon an that whatever raiment your daughter may now wear no a sleeve or button o it was purloined an stolen by her father  ben greenway exclaimed bonnet striking his hand upon the table you will drive me so mad that i cannot read writing these things are bad enough and you need not make them worse  bless heaven said the scotchman your conscience is wakin an the time may come if it is kept workin when ye will forget your plunder an your blude your wicked vanity your cruelty an your dishonesty an mak yoursel worthy o a good daughter an a quiet hame an more than that i will tak leave to add o the faithful services o a steadfast friend  i cannot forget them ben said bonnet speaking without anger the more you talk about my sins the more i long to do them all over again the more you say about my vanity and pride the more i yearn to wear my uniform and wave my naked sword ay to bring it down with blood upon its blade i am very wicked greenway you never would admit it and you do not admit it now but i am wicked and i could prove it to you if fortune would give me opportunity and captain bonnet sat up very straight in his chair and his eyes flashed as they very often had flashed as he trod the deck of the revenge  at this moment there was a knock at the door and the captain of the belinda came in  goodday sir said that burly seaman and this is captain bonnet i am sure for i have seen him before though garbed in another fashion and i come to bring you news i have just arrived at this port in my sloop and i bring with me from kingston your daughter mistress kate bonnet her uncle mr delaplaine and a good dame named charter  stede bonnet turned pale as he had never turned pale before  my daughter he gasped my daughter kate  yes said the captain she is on my ship yearning and moaning to see you  from kingston murmured bonnet  yes said the other and on fire to see you since she heard you were here  master bonnet exclaimed ben greenway rising we must hasten to that vessel perhaps this good captain will now tak us there in his boat  bonnet fixed his eyes upon the floor ben greenway he said i cannot how i have longed to see my daughter and how time and again and time and again i have pictured our meeting i have seen her throw herself into the arms of that noble officer her father i have heard her bathed in filial tears forgive me everything because of the proud joy with which she looked on me and knew i was her father greenway i cannot go i have dropped too low and i am ashamed to meet her  ashamed that ye are honest cried the scotchman ashamed that sin nae longer besets ye an that ye are lifted above the thief an the cutpurse master bonnet master bonnet in good truth i am ashamed o ye  very well said the captain of the belinda i have no time to waste if you will not go to her she een must come to you i will send my boat for her and the others and you shall wait for them here  i will not wait exclaimed bonnet i dont dare to look into her eyes behold these clothes consider my mean employment shall i abash myself before my daughter  master bonnet exclaimed greenway hastily stepping to the doorway through which the captain had departed ye shallna tie yoursel to the skirts o the deil ye shallna run awa an hide yoursel from your daughter wha seeks in tears an groans for her unworthy father sit down master bonnet an wait here until your good daughter comes  the belindas captain had intended to send his boat back to his vessel but now he determined to take her himself this was such a strange situation that it might need explanation  kate screamed when he made known his errand what she cried my father in the town and did he not come back with you is he sick is he wounded is he in chains  and my dickory cried dame charter was he not there has he not yet returned to the town it must now be a long time since he went away  i know not anything more than i have told you said the captain and if mr delaplaine and the two ladies will get into my boat i will quickly take you to the town and show you where you may find captain bonnet and learn all you wish to know  and dickory cried dame charter my son dickory did they give you no news of him  come along come along said the captain my men are waiting in the boat i asked no questions but in ten minutes you can ask a hundred if you like  when the little party reached the town it attracted a great deal of attention from the rough roisterers who were strolling about or gambling in shady places when the captain of the belinda mentioned here and there that these newcomers were the family of blackbeards factor who now had charge of that pirates interests in the town no one dared to treat the elderly gentleman the pretty young lady or the rotund dame with the slightest disrespect the name of the great pirate was a safe protection even when he who bore it was leagues and leagues away  at the door of the storehouse ben greenway stood waiting he would have hurried down to the pier had it not been that he was afraid to leave bonnet afraid that this shamefaced expirate would have hurried away to hide himself from his daughter and his friends kate running forward grasped the scotchman by both hands  and where is he she cried  he is in there said ben pointing through the storeroom to the open door at the back in an instant she was gone  and dickory cried dame charter oh ben greenway tell me of my boy  they went inside and greenway told everything he knew which was very much although it was not enough to comfort the poor mothers heart who could not readily believe that because dickory had sailed away with a great and powerful pirate that eminent man would be sure to bring him back in safety but as greenway really believed this his words made some impression on the good dames heart she could see some reason to believe that blackbeard having now so much property in the town might make a short cruise this time and that any day the revenge with her dear son on board might come sailing into port  with his face buried in his folded arms which rested on the table stede bonnet received his daughter at first she did not recognise him never having seen him in such mean apparel but when he raised his head she knew her father closing the door behind her she folded him in her arms after a little leaving the window they sat together upon a bale of goods which happened to be a rug from the orient of wondrous richness which bonnet had reserved for the floor of his daughters room  never my dear he said did i dream you would see me in such plight i blush that you should look at me  blush she exclaimed her own cheeks reddening and you an honest man and no longer a freebooter and rover of the sea my heart swells with pride to think that your life is so changed  bonnet sadly shook his head  ah he said you dont know you cannot understand what i feel kate he exclaimed with sudden energy i was a man among men a chief over many i was powerful i was obeyed on every side i looked the bold captain that i was my brave uniform and my sword betokened the rank i held and kate you can never know the pride and exultation with which i stood upon my quarterdeck and scanned the sea master of all that might come within my vision how my heart would swell and my blood run wild when i beheld in the distance a proud ship her sails all spread her colours flying heavily laden hastening onward to her port how i would stretch out my arm to that proud ship and say let down those sails drop all those flaunting flags for you are mine i am greater than your captain or your king if i give the command down you go to the bottom with all your people all your goods all your banners and emblazonments down to the bottom never to be seen again  illustration kate and her father in the warehouse  kate shuddered and began to cry oh father she exclaimed dont say that surely you never did such things as that  no said he speaking more quietly not just like that but i could have done it all had it pleased me and it was this sense of power that made my heart beat so proudly i took no life kate if it could be helped and when i had stripped a ship of her goods i put her people upon shore before i burned her  kate bowed her head in her hands and of all this you are proud my father you are proud of it  indeed am i daughter said he and had you seen me in my glory you would have been proud of me perhaps yet  in an instant she had clapped her hand over his mouth you shall not say it she exclaimed i have seized upon you and i shall hold you no more freebooters life for you no more blood no more fire i shall take you away with me not to bridgetown for there is no happiness for either of us there but to spanish town there with my uncle we shall all be happy together you will forget the sea and its ships you will again wander over your fields and i shall be with you you shall watch the waving crops you shall ride with me as you used to ride to view your vast herds of cattlethose splendid creatures their great heads uplifted their nostrils to the breeze  truly my kate said bonnet that was a great sight there were no cattle finer on the island than were mine  and so shall they be again my father said kate her arms around his neck  it was then that ben greenway knocked upon the door  stede bonnets mind had been so much excited by what he had been talking about that he saluted his brotherinlaw and dame charter without once thinking of his clothes they looked upon him as if he were some unknown foreigner a person entirely removed from their customary sphere  was this the once respectable stede bonnet asked dame charter to herself did such a man marry my sister thought mr delaplaine they might have been surprised had they met him as a pirate but his appearance as a pirates clerk amazed them  towards the end of the day mr delaplaine and his party returned to the belinda for there was no fit place for them to lodge in the town although urged by all stede bonnet would not accompany them when persuasion had been exhausted ben greenway promised kate that he would be responsible for her fathers appearance the next day feeling safe in so doing for even should bonnets shame return there was no likely way in which he could avoid his friends     chapter xxv  wise mr delaplaine   early in the next forenoon kate and her companions prepared to make another visit to the town naturally she wanted to be with her father as much as possible and to exert upon him such influences as might make him forget in a degree the socalled glories of his pirate life and return with her and her uncle to spanish town where she believed this misguided man might yet surrender himself to the rural joys of other days nay more he and she might hope for still further happiness in a jamaica home for madam bonnet would not be there  as she came up from below impatient to depart kate noticed getting over the side a gentleman who had just arrived in a small boat he was tall and goodlooking and very handsomely attired in a rich suit such as was worn at that day by french and spanish noblemen a sword with an elaborate hilt was by his side and on his head a high cocked hat there was fine lace at his wrists and bosom and he wore silk stockings and silver buckles on his shoes  kate started at meeting here a stranger and in such an elaborate attire she had read of the rich dress of men of rank in europe but her eyes had never fallen upon such a costume the gentleman advanced quickly towards her holding out his hand she shrank back what did it mean  then in a second she saw her fathers face this fine gentleman this dignified and graceful man was indeed stede bonnet  he had been so thoroughly ashamed of his mean attire on the preceding day that he had determined not again to meet his daughter and mr delaplaine in such vulgar guise so from the resources of the storehouses he had drawn forth a superb suit of clothes sent westward for the governor of one of the french colonies he excused himself for taking it from blackbeards treasurehouse not only on account of the demands of the emergency but because he himself had taken it before from a merchantman  father cried kate what has happened to you i never saw such a fine gentleman  bonnet smiled with complacency and removed his cocked hat  i always endeavour my dear said he to dress myself according to my station yesterday not expecting to see you i was in a sad plight i would have preferred you to meet me in my naval uniform but as that is now to say the least inconvenient and as i reside on shore in the capacity of a merchant or business man i attire myself to suit my present condition ah my good brotherinlaw i am glad to see you i may remark he added graciously shaking hands with dame charter that i left my faithful scotchman in our storehouse in the town it being necessary for some one to attend to our possessions there otherwise i should have brought him with me my good dame charter for i am sure you would have found his company acceptable he is a faithful man and an honest one although i am bound to say that if he were less of a presbyterian and more of a man of the world his conversation might sometimes be more agreeable  mr delaplaine regarded with much earnestness and no little pleasure his transformed brotherinlaw hope for the future now filled his heart if this crackbrained sugarplanter had really recovered from his mania for piracy and had a fancy for legitimate business his new station might be better for him than any he had yet known sugarplanting was all well enough and suitable to any gentleman provided madam bonnet were not taken with it she would drive any man from the paths of reason unless he possessed an uncommonly strong brain and he did not believe that such a brain was possessed by his brotherinlaw bonnet the good mr delaplaine rubbed his hands together in his satisfaction such a gentleman as this would be welcome in his countinghouse even if he did but little his very appearance would reflect credit upon the establishment dame charter kept in the background she had never been accustomed to associate with the aristocracy but she did not forget that a cat may look at a king and her eyes were very good  there were always little cracks in his skull she said to herself my husband used to tell me that major bonnet is quick at changing from one thing to another and it needs sharp wits to follow him  after a time major bonnet proposed a row upon the harbourhe had brought a large boat with four oarsmen for this purpose mr delaplaine objected a little to this fearing the presence of so many pirate vessels but bonnet loftily set aside such puerile objections  i am the business representative of the great blackbeard he said the most powerful pirate in the world you are safer here than in any other port on the american coast  when they were out upon the water moving against the gentle breeze bonnet disclosed the object of his excursion i am going to take you said he to visit some of the noted pirate ships which are anchored in this harbour there are vessels here which are quite famous and commanded by renowned brethren of the coast i think you will all be greatly interested in these and under my convoy you need fear no danger  dame charter and kate screamed in their fright and mr delaplaine turned pale visit pirate ships he cried rather i would have supposed that you would keep away from them as far as you could for myself i would have them a hundred miles distant if it were possible  bonnet laughed loftily it will be visits of ceremony that we shall pay and with all due ceremony shall we be received pull out to that vessel he said to the oarsmen then turning to the others he remarked that sloop is the dripping blade commanded by captain sorby whose name strikes terror throughout the spanish main ay and in other parts of the ocean i can assure you for he has sailed northward nearly as far as i have but he has not yet rivalled me i know him having done business with him on shore he is a most portentous person as you will soon see  oh father cried kate dont take us there it will kill us just to look upon such dreadful pirates i pray you turn the boat  oh if dickory were here gasped dame charter he would turn the boat himself he would never allow me to be taken among those awful wretches  mr delaplaine said nothing it was too late to expostulate but he trembled as he sat  i cannot turn back my dear said bonnet even if i would for the great sorby is now on deck and looking at us as we approach  as the boat drew up by the side of the dripping blade the renowned sorby looked down over the side he was a redheaded man his long hair and beard dyed yellow in some places by the sun he was grievous to look upon and like to create in the mind of an imaginative person the image of a sunburned devil on a holiday  goodday to you goodday sir bonnet cried the pirate captain come on board come on board all of you wife daughter father if such they be well let down ladders and i shall feast you finely  nay nay good captain sorby replied bonnet with courteous dignity my family and i have just stopped to pay you our respects they have all heard of your great prowess for i have told them they may never have a chance again to look upon another of your fame  heaven grant it said dame charter in her heart if i get out of this i stay upon dry land forever  i grieve that my poor ship be not honoured by your ladies said sorby but i admit that her decks are scarcely fit for the reception of such company it is but today that we have found time to cleanse her deck from the stain and disorder of our last fight having lately come into harbour that was a great fight sir bonnet we lay low and let the fellows board us but not one of them went back again ha ha not one of them went back again good ladies  every pirate face on board that illconditioned sloop now glared over her rail their eyes fixed upon the goodly company in the little boat their horrid hair and beards stained and mattedit would have been hard to tell by what  oh father father panted kate please row away what if they should now jump down upon us  goodday goodday my brave captain sorby said bonnet we must een row away we have other craft to visit but would first do honour to you and your bold crew  captain sorby lifted high his great bespattered hat and every grinning demon of the crew waved hat or rag or pail or cutlass and set up a discordant yell in honour of their departing visitors  oh go not to another father pleaded kate her pale face in tears visit no more of them i pray you  ay truly keep away from them said mr delaplaine i am no coward but i vow to you that i shall die of fright if i come close to another of those floating hells  and these said kate to herself her eyes fixed out over the sea these are his friends his companions the wretches of whom he is so proud  there are no more vessels like that in port said bonnet thats the most celebrated sloop those we shall now call upon are commanded by men of milder mien some of them you could not tell from plain merchantmen were you not informed of their illustrious careers  if you go near another pirate ship cried dame charter i shall jump overboard i cannot help it  row back to the belinda brotherinlaw said mr delaplaine in a strong hard voice your tour of pleasure is not fit for tenderhearted women nor i grant it for gentlemen of my station  there are other ships whose captains i know said bonnet and where you would have been well received but if your nerves are not strong enough for the courtesies i have to offer we will return to the belinda  when safe again on board their vessel after the sudden termination of their projected tour of calls on pirates kate took her father aside and entered into earnest conversation with him while mr delaplaine much ruffled in his temper although in general of a most mild disposition said aside to dame charter he is as mad as a march hare what other parent on this earth would convey his fair young daughter into the society of these vile wild beasts which in his eyes are valiant heroes we must get him back with us dame charter we must get him back and if he cannot be constrained by love and goodwill to a decent and a christian life we must shut him up and if his daughter weeps and raves we must een stiffen our determination and shut him up it shall be my purpose now to hasten the return of the brig theres room enough for all and he and the scotchman must go back with us the governor shall deal with him and whether it be on my estate or behind strong bars he shall spend the rest of his days upon the island of jamaica and so know the sea no more  he was very much roused this good merchant and when he was roused he was not slow to act  the captain of the belinda was very willing to make a profitable voyage back to jamaica but his vessel must be well laden before he could do this goods enough there were at belize for that purpose for blackbeards supplies were all for sale and his chief clerk bonnet had the selling of them so all parties being likeminded the belinda soon began to take on goods for kingston  stede bonnet superintended everything he was a good man of business and knew how to direct people who might be under him there was a great stir at the storehouse and almost blithely ben greenway worked day and night to make out invoices and to prepare goods for shipment  bonnet wore no more the clothes in which his daughter had first seen him after so long and drear a parting on deck or on shore in storehouse or on the streets of belize he was the fine gentleman with the silk stockings and the tall cocked hat  one day a fellow fresh from his bottle forgetting the respect which was due to fine clothes and to blackbeards factor called out to bonnet what now sir nightcap how call you that thing you have on your head  in an instant a sword was whipped from its scabbard and a practised hand sent its blade through the arm of the jester who presently fell backward bonnet wiped his sword upon the fellows sleeve and advising him to get up and try to learn some manners coolly walked away  after that fine clothes were not much laughed at in belize for even the most disrespectful ruffians desired not the thrust of a quick blade nor the illwill of that most irascible pirate blackbeard  a few days before it was expected that the belinda would be ready to sail bonnet came on board his mind full of an important matter calling mr delaplaine and kate aside he said i have been thinking a great deal lately about my scotchman ben greenway in the first place he is greatly needed here for many of blackbeards goods will remain in the storehouse and there should be some competent person to take care of them and to sell them should opportunity offer besides that he is a great annoyance to me and i have long been trying to get rid of him when i left bridgetown i had not intended to take him with me and his presence on board my ship was a mere accident since then he has made himself very disagreeable  what cried kate would you be willing that we should all sail away and leave poor ben greenway in this place by himself among these cruel pirates  hell represent blackbeard said bonnet and no one will harm him and moreover this enforced stay may be of the greatest benefit to him he has a good head for business and he may establish himself here in a very profitable fashion and go back to barbadoes if he so desires in comfortable circumstances all we have to do is to slip our anchor and sail away at some moment when he is busy in the town i will leave ample instructions for him and he shall have money  father it would be shameful said kate  mr delaplaine said nothing he was too angry to speak but he made up his mind that ben greenway should be apprised of bonnets intentions of running away from him and that such a wicked design should be thwarted this brotherinlaw of his was a worse man than he had thought him he was capable of being false even to his best friend he might be mad as a march hare but truly he was also as sly and crafty as a fox in any month in the year  wise mr delaplaine  the very next morning there came a letter from stede bonnet to his daughter kate in which he told her that it was absolutely impossible for him to return to the humdrum and stupid life of sugarplanting and cattleraising having tasted the glories of a pirates career he could never again be contented with plain country pursuits so he was off and away the bounding sea beneath him and the brave jolly roger floating over his head he would not tell his dear daughter where he was gone or what he intended to do for she would be happier if she did not know he sent her his warmest love and desired to be most kindly remembered to her uncle and to dame charter he would make it his business that a correspondence should be maintained between him and his dear kate and he hoped from time to time to send her presents which would help her to know how constantly he loved her he concluded by admitting that what he had said about ben greenway was merely a blind to turn their suspicions from his intended departure if his good brotherinlaw out of kindness to the scotchman had brought him to the belinda and had insisted on keeping him there it would have made his bonnets secret departure a great deal easier  kate had never fainted in her life but when she had finished this letter she went down flat on her back  leaving his niece to the good offices of dame charter mr delaplaine breathing hotly went ashore accompanied by the captain when they reached the storehouse they found it locked with the key in the custody of a shopkeeper nearby they soon heard what had happened to blackbeards business agent he had gone off in a piratical vessel which had sailed for somewhere in the middle of the night and moreover it was believed that the scotchman who worked for him had gone with him for he had been seen running towards the water and afterward taking his place among the oarsmen in a boat which went out to the departing vessel  may that unholy vessel be sunk as soon as it reaches the open sea was the deadly desire which came from the heart of mr delaplaine but the wish had not formed itself into words before the good merchant recanted i totally forgot that faithful scotchman he sighed     chapter xxvi  dickory stretches his legs   there were jolly times on board the swift ship revenge as she sped through the straits of florida on her way up the atlantic coast the skies were bright the wind was fair and the warm waters of the gulf stream helped to carry her bravely on her way but young dickory charter with the bloodstained letter of captain vince tucked away in the lining of his coat ate so little tossed about so much in his berth turned so pale and spoke so seldom that the bold captain blackbeard declared that he should have some medicine  i shall not let my fine lieutenant suffer for want of drugs he cried and when i reach charles town i shall send ashore a boat and procure some and if the citizens disturb or interfere with my brave fellows ill bombard the town there will be medicine to take on one side or the other i swear and loud and ready were the oaths he swore  a pirate who carries with him an intended soninlaw is not likely if he be of blackbeards turn of mind to suffer all his family plans to be ruined for the want of a few drugs  when dickory heard what the captain had to say on this subject his heart shrank within him he had never taken medicine and he had never seen blackbeards daughter but the one seemed to him almost as bad as the other and the thought of the cool waves beneath him became more attractive than ever before but that thought was quickly banished for he had a duty before him and not until that was performed could he take leave of this world once so bright to him  an island with palmtrees slowly rose on the horizon and off this island it was that after a good deal of tacking and closehauling the revenge lay to to take in water far better water than that which had been brought from belize  do you want to go ashore in the boat boy said blackbeard really mindful of the health of this projected member of his family it may help your appetite to use your legs  dickory did not care to go anywhere but he had hardly said so when a revulsion of feeling came upon him and turning away so that his face might not be noticed he said he thought the land air might do him good while the men were at work carrying their pails from the wellknown spring to the waterbarrels in the boat dickory strolled about to view the scenery for it could never have been expected that a first lieutenant in uniform should help to carry water at first the scenery did not appear to be very interesting and dickory wandered slowly from here to there then sat down under a tree presently he rose and went to another tree a little farther away from the boat and the men at the spring here he quietly took off his shoes and his stockings and having nothing else to do made a little bundle of them listlessly tying them to his belt then he rose and walked away somewhat brisker but not in the direction of the boat he did not hurry but even stopped sometimes to look at things but he still walked a little briskly and always away from the boat he had been so used this child of outdoor life to going about the world barefooted that it was no wonder that he walked briskly being relieved of his encumbering shoes and stockings  after a time he heard a shout behind him and turning saw three men of the boats crew upon a little eminence calling to him then he moved more quickly always away from the boat and with his head turned he saw the men running towards him and their shouts became louder and wilder then he set off on a good run and presently heard a pistol shot this he knew was to frighten him and make him stop but he ran the faster and soon turned the corner of a bit of woods then he was away at the top of his speed making for a jungle of foliage not a quarter of a mile before him shouts he heard and more shots but he caught sight of no pursuers urged on even as they were by the fear of returning to the ship without dickory they could not expect to match in their heavy boots the staglike speed of this barefooted bounder  after a time dickory stopped running for his path always straight away so far as he could judge from the landingplace became very difficult in the forest there were streams sometimes narrow and sometimes wide and how deep he knew not so that now he jumped now he walked on fallen trees sometimes he crossed water and marsh by swinging himself from the limbs of one tree to those of another this was hard work for a young gentleman in a naval uniform and cocked hat but it had to be done and when the hat was knocked off it was picked up again with its feathers dripping  dickory was going somewhere although he knew not whither and he had solemn business to perform which he had sworn to do and therefore he must have fit clothes to wear not only in which to travel but in which to present himself suitably when he should accomplish his mission all these things dickory thought of and he picked up his cocked hat whenever it dropped he would have been very hungry had he not bethought himself to fill his pockets with biscuits before he left the vessel and as to fresh water there was no lack of that     chapter xxvii  a girl who laughed   it was towards nightfall of the day on which dickory had escaped from the pirates at the spring that he found himself on a piece of high ground in an open place in the forest and here he determined to spend the night with his dirk he cut a quantity of palmetto leaves and made himself a very comfortable bed on which he was soon asleep fearing no pirates  in the morning he rose early from his green couch ate the few biscuits which were left in his pockets and putting on his shoes and stockings started forth upon what might have been supposed to be an aimless tramp  but it was not aimless dickory had a most wholesome dread of that indomitable apostle of cruelty and wickedness the pirate blackbeard he believed that it would be quite possible for that savage being to tie up his beard in tails to blacken his face with powder to hang more pistols from his belt and around his neck and swear that the revenge should never leave her anchorage until her first lieutenant had been captured and brought back to her so he had an aim and that was to get away as far as possible from the spot where he had landed on the island  he did not believe that his pursuers if there were any upon his track could have travelled in the night for it had been pitchy black and as he now had a good start of them he thought he might go so far that they would give up the search then he hoped to be able to keep himself alive until he was reasonably sure that the revenge had hoisted anchor and sailed away when it was his purpose to make his way back to the spring and wait for some other vessel which would take him away  with his shoes on he travelled more easily although not so swiftly and after an hour of very rough walking he heard a sound which made him stop instantly and listen at first he thought it might be the wind in the trees but soon his practised ear told him that it was the sound of the surf upon the beach without the slightest hesitation he made his way as quickly as possible towards the sound of the sea  in less than half an hour he found himself upon a stretch of sand which extended from the forest to the sea and upon which the waves were throwing themselves in long crested lines with a cry of joy he ran out upon the beach and with outstretched arms he welcomed the sea as if it had been an old and welltried friend  but dickorys gratitude and joy had nothing to found itself upon the sea might far better have been his enemy than his friend for if he had thought about it the sandy beach would have been the road by which a portion of the pirates men would have marched to cut off his flight or they would have accomplished the same end in boats  but dickory thought of no enemy and his heart was cheered he pressed on along the beach the walking was so much better now that he made good progress and the sun had not reached its zenith when he found himself on the shore of a small stream which came down from some higher land in the interior and here poured itself into the sea he walked some distance by this stream in order to get some water which might be free from brackishness and then with very little trouble he crossed it before him was a knoll of moderate height and covered with low foliage mounting this he found that he had an extended view over the interior of the island in the background there stretched a wide savanna and at the distance of about half a mile he saw very near a little cluster of trees a thin column of smoke his eyes rounded and he stared and stared he now perceived from behind the leaves the end of a thatched roof  people dickory exclaimed and his heart beat fast with joy why his heart should be joyful he could not have told himself except that there was no earthly reason to believe that the persons who were making that fire near that thatchedroof house were pirates to go to this house whatever it might be to take his chances there instead of remaining alone in the wide forest was our young mans instant determination but before he started there was something else he thought of he took off his coat and with a bunch of leaves he brushed it then he arranged the plumes of his hat and brushed some mud from them gave himself a general shake and was ready to make a start all this by a fugitive pursued by savage pirates on a desert island but dickory was a young man and he wore the uniform of a naval officer  after a brisk walk which was somewhat longer than he had supposed it would be dickory reached the house behind the trees at a short distance burned the fire whose smoke he had seen over the fire hung an iron pot oh blessed pot a gentle breeze blew from the fire towards dickory and from the heavenly odour which was borne upon it he knew that something good to eat was cooking in that pot  a man came quickly from behind the house he was tall with a beard a little gray and his scanty attire was of the most nondescript fashion with amazement upon his face he spoke to dickory in english  what sir he cried has a manofwar touched at this island  dickory could not help smiling for the mans countenance told him how he had been utterly astounded and even stupefied by the sight of a gentleman in naval uniform in the interior of that island an almost desert region  no manofwar has touched here said dickory and i dont belong to one i wear these clothes because i am compelled to do so having no others yesterday afternoon i escaped from some pirates who stopped for water and since leaving them i have made my way to this spot  the man stepped forth quickly and stretched out his hand  bless you bless you he cried you are the first human being other than my family that i have seen for two years  a little girl now came from behind the house and when her eyes fell upon dickory and his cocked hat she screamed with terror and ran indoors a woman appeared at the door evidently the mans wife she had a pleasant face but her clothes riveted dickorys attention it would be impossible to describe them even if one were gazing upon them it will be enough to say that they covered her her amazement more than equalled that of her husband she stood and stared but could not speak  from the spring at the end of the island cried the man to this house since yesterday afternoon i have always supposed that no one could get here from the spring by land i call that way impassable you are safe here sir i am sure pirates would not follow very far through those forests and morasses they would be afraid they would never get back to their ship but i will find out for certain if you have reason sir to fear pursuit by boat or otherwise  and then stepping around to the other end of the house he called lucilla  you are hungry sir said the woman presently you shall share our meal which is almost cooked  now the man returned  this is not a time for questions sir he said either from you or from us you must eat and you must rest then we can talk we shall not any of us apologize for our appearance and you will not expect it when you have heard our story but i can assure you sir that we do not look nearly so strange to you as you appear to us never before sir did i see in this climate and on shore a man attired in such fashion  dickory smiled i will tell you the tale of it he said when we have eaten i admit that i am famished  the man was now called away and when he returned he said to dickory fear nothing sir your ship is no longer at the anchorage by the spring she has sailed away wisely concluding i suppose that pursuit of you would be folly and even madness  the dinner was an exceedingly plain one spread upon a rude table under a tree the little girl who had overcome her fear of the soldier as she considered him made one of the party  during the meal dickory briefly told his story confining it to a mere statement of his escape from the pirates  blackbeard exclaimed the man truly you did well to get away from him no matter into what forests you plunged or upon what desert island you lost yourself at any moment he might have turned upon you and cut you to pieces to amuse himself i have heard the most horrible stories of blackbeard  he treated me very well said dickory but i know from his own words that he reserved me for a most horrible fate  what exclaimed the man and he told you he is indeed a demon  yes said dickory he said over and over again that he was going to take me to england to marry me to his daughter  at this the wife could not refrain from a smile matrimony is not generally considered a horrible fate said she perhaps his daughter may be a most comely and estimable young person girls do not always resemble their fathers  do not mention it exclaimed dickory with a shudder that was one reason that i ran away i preferred any danger from man or beast to that he was taking me to  he is engaged to be married thought the woman it is easy enough to see that  now tell me your story i pray you said dickory but first i would like very much to know how you found out that blackbeards ship was not at her anchorage  thats a simple thing said the man of course you did not observe for you could not that from its eastern point where lies the spring this island stretches in a long curve to the south reaching northward again about this spot consequently there is a little bay to the east of us across which we can see the anchoring ground of such ships as may stop here for water your way around the land curve of the island was a long one but the distance straight across the bay is but a few miles upon a hill not far from here there is a very tall tree which overtops all the other trees and to the upper branches of this tree my daughter who is a great climber frequently ascends with a small glass and is thus able to report if there is a vessel at the anchorage  what exclaimed dickory that little girl  oh no said the man it is my other daughter who is a grown young woman  she is not here now said the mother and this piece of unnecessary information was given in tones which might indicate that the young lady had stepped around to visit a neighbour  it is important said the man that i should know if vessels have anchored here for if they be merchantmen i sometimes do business with them  business said dickory that sounds extremely odd pray tell me how you came to be here  my name is mander said the other and about two years ago i was on my way from england to barbadoes where with my wife and two girls i expected to settle we were captured by a pirate ship and marooned upon this island i will say to the pirate captains credit that he was a good sort of man considering his profession he sailed across the bay on purpose to find a suitable place to land us and he left with us some necessary articles such as axes and tools kitchen utensils and a gun with some ammunition then he sailed away leaving us here and here we have since lived under the circumstances we have no right to complain for had we been taken by an ordinary pirate it is likely that our bones would now be lying at the bottom of the ocean  here i have worked hard and have made myself a home such as it is there are wild cattle upon the distant savannas and i trap game and birds cultivate the soil to a certain extent and if we had clothes i might say we would be in better circumstances than many a respectable family in england sometimes when a merchantman anchors here and i have hides or anything else which we can barter for things we need i row over the bay in a canoe which i have made and have thus very much bettered our condition but in no case have i been able to provide my family with suitable clothes  why did you not get some of these merchant ships to carry you away asked dickory  the man shook his head there is no place he said sadly to which i can in reason ask a ship to carry me and my family we have no money no property whatever in any other place i would be far poorer than i am here my children are not uneducated my wife and i have done our best for them in that respect and we have some books with us so as you see it would be rash in me to leave a home which rude as it is shelters and supports my family to go as paupers and strangers to some other land  the wife heaved a sigh but poor lucilla she said it is dreadful that she should be forced to grow up here  lucilla asked dickory  yes sir she said my eldest daughter but she is not here now  dickory thought that it was somewhat odd that he should be again informed of a fact which he knew very well but he made no remarks upon the subject  still wearing his cocked hatfor he had nothing else with which to shield his head from the sunand with his uniform coat on for he had not yet an opportunity of ripping from it the letter he carried and this he would not part fromdickory roamed about the little settlement mander was an industrious and thrifty man his garden his buildings and his surroundings showed that  walking past a clump of low bushes dickory was startled by a laugha hearty laughthe laugh of a girl looking quickly around he saw peering above the tops of the bushes the face of the girl who had laughed  it is too funny she said as his eyes fell upon her i never saw anything so funny in all my life a man in regimentals in this weather and upon a desert island you look as if you had marched faster than your army and that you had lost it in the forest  dickory smiled you ought not to laugh at me he said for these clothes are really a great misfortune if i could change them for something cool i should be more than delighted  you might take off your heavy coat said she you need not be on parade here and instead of that awful hat i can make you one of long grass do you see the one i have on isnt that a good hat i have one nearly finished which i am making for my father you may have that  dickory would most gladly have taken off his coat if without observation he could have transferred his sacred letter to some other part of his clothes but he must wait for that he accepted instantly however the offer of the hat  you seem to know all about me he said did you hear me tell my story  every word of it said she and it is the queerest story i ever heard think of a pirate carrying a man away to marry him to his daughter  but why dont you come from behind that bush and talk to me  i cant do it said she i am dressed funnier than you are now i am going to make your hat and in an instant she had departed  dickory now strolled on and when he returned he seated himself in the shade near the house the letter of captain vince was taken from his coatlining and secured in one of his breeches pockets his heavy coat and waistcoat lay upon the ground beside him with the cocked hat placed upon them as he leaned back against the tree and inhaled the fragrant breeze which came to him from the forest dickory was a more cheerful young man than he had been for many many days he thought of this himself and wondered how a man carrying with him his sentence of lifelong misery could lean against a tree and take pleasure in anything be it a hospitable welcome a sense of freedom from danger a fragrant breeze or the face of a pretty girl behind a bush but these things did please him he could not help it and when presently came mrs mander bringing him a light grass hat fresh from the manufacturers hands he took it and put it on with more evident pleasure than the occasion seemed to demand  your daughter is truly an artist said dickory  she does many things well said the mother because necessity compels her and all of us to learn to work in various ways  can i not thank her said dickory  no the mother answered she is not here now  dickory had begun to hate that selfevident statement  shes looking out for ships her pride is a little touched that she missed blackbeards vessel yesterday  perhaps said dickory with a movement as if he would like to make a step in the direction of some tall tree upon a hill  no said mrs mander i cannot ask you to join my daughter i am compelled to state that her dress is not a suitable one in which to appear before a stranger  excuse me said dickory and i beg madam that you will convey to her my thanks for making me such an excellent hat  a little later mander joined dickory i am sorry sir said he that i am not able to present you to my daughter lucilla it is a great grief to us that her attire compels her to deny herself other company than that of her family i really believe sir that it is lucillas deprivations on this island which form at present my principal discontent with my situation but we all enjoy good health we have enough to eat and shelter over us and should not complain  as soon as he was at liberty to do so dickory walked by the hedge of low bushes and there above it was the bright face with the pretty grass hat  i was waiting for you said she i wanted to see how that hat fitted and i think it does nicely and i wanted to tell you that i have been looking out for ships but have not seen one i dont mean by that that i want you to go away almost as soon as you have come but of course if a merchant ship should anchor here it would be dreadful for you not to know  i am not sure said dickory gallantly that i am in a hurry for a ship it is truly very pleasant here  what makes it pleasant said the girl  dickory hesitated for a moment the breeze from the forest said he  she laughed it is charming she said but there are so many places where there is just as good a breeze or perhaps better how i would like to go to some one of them to me this island is lonely and doleful every time i look over the sea for a ship i hope that one will come that can carry us away  then said dickory i wish a ship would come tomorrow and take us all away together  she shook her head as my father told you said she we have no place to go to  dickory thought a good deal about the sad condition of the family of this worthy marooner he thought of it even after he had stretched himself for the night upon the bed of palmetto leaves beneath the tree against which he had leaned when he wondered how he could be so cheerful under the shadow of the sad fate which was before him     chapter xxviii  lucillas ship   as soon as dickory had left off his cocked hat and his goldembroidered coat the little girl lena had ceased to be afraid of him and the next morning she came to him seated lonelyfor this was a busy householdand asked him if he would like to take a walk so hand in hand they wandered away presently they entered a path which led through the woods  this is the way my sister goes to her lookout tree said the little girl would you like to see that tree  oh yes said dickory and he spoke the truth  she goes up to the very top said lena to look for ships i would never do that id rather never see a ship than to climb to the top of such a tree ill show it to you in a minute were almost there  at a little distance from the rest of the forest and upon a bluff which overlooked a stretch of lowland and beyond that the bay stood a tall tree with spreading branches and heavy foliage  up in the top of that is where she sits said the child and spies out for ships thats what shes doing now dont you see her up there  your sister in the tree exclaimed dickory and his first impulse was to retire for it had been made quite plain to him that he was not expected to present himself to the young lady of the house should she be on the ground or in the air but he did not retire a voice came to him from the treetop and as he looked upward he saw the same bright face which had greeted him over the top of the bushes below it was a great bunch of heavy leaves  so you have come to call on me have you said the lady in the tree i am glad to see you but im sorry that i cannot ask you to come upstairs i am not receiving  he could not come up if he wanted to said lena he couldnt climb a tree like that  and he doesnt want to cried the nymph of the baytree i have been up here all the morning said she looking for ships but not one have i seen  isnt that a tiresome occupation asked dickory  not altogether she said the branches up here make a very nice seat and i nearly always bring a book with me you will wonder how we get books but we had a few with us when we were marooned and since that my father has always asked for books when he has an opportunity of trading off his hides but i have read them all over and over again and if it were not for the ships which i expect to come here and anchor i am afraid i should grow melancholy  what sort of ships do you look for asked dickory who was gazing upward with so much interest that he felt a little pain in the back of his neck and who could not help thinking of a framed engraving which hung in his mothers little parlour and which represented some angels composed of nothing but heads and wings he saw no wings under the head of the charming young creature in the tree but there was no reason which he could perceive why she should not be an angel marooned upon a west indian island  there are a great many of them said she and theyre all alike in one waythey never come but theres one of them in particular which i look for and look for and look for and which i believe that some day i shall really see i have thought about that ship so often and i have dreamed about it so often that i almost know it must come  is it an english ship asked dickory speaking with some effort for he found that the girls voice came down much more readily than his went up  i dont know said she but i suppose it must be for otherwise i should not understand what the people on board should say to me it is a large ship strong and able to defend itself against any pirates it is laden with all sorts of useful and valuable things and among these are a great many trunks and boxes filled with different kinds of clothes also theres a great deal of money kept in a box by itself and is in charge of an agent who is bringing it out to my father supposing him to be now settled in barbadoes this money is generally a legacy for my father from a distant relative who has recently died on this ship there are so many delightful things that i cannot even begin to mention them  and where is it going to asked dickory  that i dont know exactly sometimes i think that it is going to the island of barbadoes where we originally intended to settle but then i imagine that there is some pleasanter place than barbadoes and if thats the case the ship is going there  there can be no pleasanter place than barbadoes cried dickory i come from that island where i was born there is no land more lovely in all the west indies  you come from barbadoes cried the girl and it really is a pleasant island  most truly it is said he and the great dream of my life is to get back there then he stopped was it really the dream of his life to get back there that would depend upon several things  if then you tell me the truth my ship is bound for barbadoes and if she should go would you like to go there with us  dickory hesitated not directly said he i would first touch at jamaica  for some moments there was no answer from the treetop and then came the question is it a girl who lives there  yes said dickory unguardedly but also i have a mother in jamaica  indeed said she a mother well we might stop there and take the mother with us to barbadoes would the girl want to go too  dickory bent his head alas said he i do not know  then spoke the little lena i would not bother about any particular place to go to said she id be so glad to go anywhere that isnt here but it is not a real ship you know  i dont think i will take you called down lucilla i dont want too many passengers especially women i dont know but i often think there will be a gentleman passengerone who really wants to go to barbadoes and nowhere else sometimes he is one kind of a gentleman and sometimes another but he is never a soldier or a sailor but rather one who loves to stay at home and now sir i think i must take my glass and try to pick out a ship from among the spots on the far distant waves  come on said lena do you like to fish because if you do i can take you to a good place  the rest of the day dickory spent with mr mander and his wife who were intelligent and pleasant people they talked of their travels their misfortunes and their blessings and dickory yearned to pour out his soul to them but he could not do so his woes did not belong to himself alone they were not for the ears of strangers he made up his mind what he would do until the morrow he would stay as a visitor with these most hospitable people then he would ask for work he would collect firewood he would hunt he would fish he would do anything and here he would support himself until there came some merchant ship bound southward which would carry him away if the mander family were anyway embarrassed or annoyed by his presence here he would make a camp at a little distance and live there by himself perhaps the lady of the tree would kindly send him word if the ship he was looking for should come  it was about the middle of the afternoon and lena had dropped asleep beneath the tree where dickory and her parents were conversing when suddenly there rushed upon the little group a most surprising figure at the first flash of thought dickory supposed that a boy from the skies had dropped among them but in an instant he recognised the face he had seen above the bushes it was lucilla the daughter of the house upon her head was a little straw hat and she wore a loose tunic and a pair of sailors trousers which had been cut off and were short enough to show that her feet and ankles were bare around her waist she had a belt of skins from which dangled a string of crimson seabeans her eyes were wide open her face was pale and she was trembling with excitement  what do you think she cried not caring who was there or who might look at her theres a ship at the spring and theres a boat rowing across the bay a boat with four men in it  all started to their feet  a boat cried mander with four men in it run my dear to the cave press into its depths as far as you can there is nothing there to be afraid of and no matter how frightened you are press into its most distant depths you sir will remain with me or would you rather escape if it is a pirate ship it may be blackbeard who has returned  not so cried lucilla it is a merchant vessel and they are making straight for the mouth of our stream  i will stay here with you said dickory and stand by you unless i may help your family seek the cave you speak of  no no said mander they dont need you and if you will do so we will go down to the beach and meet these men that will be better than to have them search for us they will know that people live here for my canoe is drawn up on the beach  is this safe cried dickory would it not be better for you to go with your family and hide with them i will meet the men in the boat  no no said mander if their vessel is no pirate i do not fear them but i will not have them here  now after mander had embraced his family they hurried away in tears the girl lucilla casting not one glance at dickory impressed by the impulse that it was the proper thing to do dickory put on his coat and waistcoat and clapped upon his head his high cocked hat then he rapidly followed mander to the beach which they reached before the boat touched the sand  when the man in the stern of the boat which was now almost within hailing distance saw the two figures run down upon the beach he spoke to the oarsmen and they all stopped and looked around the stop was occasioned by the sight of dickory in his uniform and this under the circumstances was enough to stop any boats crew then they fell to again and pulled ashore when the boat was beached one of its occupants a roughly dressed man sprang ashore and walked cautiously towards mander then he gave a great shout  heigho heigho he cried and mander this is you  then there was great handshaking and many words  excuse me sir said the man raising his hat to dickory it is now more than two years since i have seen my friend here when he was marooned by pirates we were all on the same merchantman but the pirate took me along being short of hands i got away at last sir all the time addressing dickory instead of mander this being respect to his rank and shipping on board that brig sir i begged it of the captain that he would drop anchor here and take in water although i cannot say it was needed and give me a chance to land and see if my old friend be yet alive i knew the spot having well noted it when mander and his family were marooned  and this is lucillas ship said dickory to himself but to the sailor he said this is a great day for your friend and his family but you must not lift your hat to me for i am no officer  for a long time at least it seemed so to dickory who wanted to run to the cave and tell the good news they all stood together on the sands and talked and shook hands and laughed and were truly thankful the men who had come in the boat as much so as those who were found on the island it was agreed and there was no discussion on this point that the mander family should be carried away in the brig which was an english vessel bound for jamaica but the happy mander would not ask any of the boats crew to visit him at his home instead he besought them to return to their vessel and bring back some clothes for women if any such should be included in her cargo  my family said he are not in fit condition to venture themselves among wellclad people they are indeed more like savages than am i myself  i doubt said manders friend if the ship carries goods of that description but perhaps the captain might let you have a bale of cotton cloth although i suppose and here he looked a little embarrassed  oh we can buy it cried dickory taking some pieces of gold from his pocket being coin with which blackbeard had furnished him swearing that his first lieutenant could not feel like a true officer without money in his pocket take this and fetch the cloth if nothing better can be had  thank you cried mander my wife and daughters can soon fashion it into shape  and added dickory reflecting a little and remembering the general hues of lucillas face if there be choice in colours let the cloth be pink  when mander and dickory reached the house they did not stop but hurried on towards the cave both of them together for each thought only of the great joy they were taking with them  come out come out shouted mander as he ran and before they reached the cave its shuddering inmates had hurried into the light when the cries and the tears and the embraces were over lucilla first looked at dickory she started her face flushed and she was about to draw back then she stopped and advancing held out her hand  it cannot be helped she said anyway you have seen me before and i suppose it doesnt matter im a sailor boy and have to own up to it i did hope you would think of me as a young lady but we are all so happy now that that doesnt matter oh father she cried it cant be we are not fit to be saved we must perish here in our wretched rags  not so cried dickory with a bow ive already bought you a gown and i hope it is pink  as they all hurried away the tale of the hopedfor clothes was told and although mrs mander wondered how gowns were to be made while a merchantman waited she said nothing of her doubts and they all ran gleefully lucilla and dickory being the fleetest led the others and dickory said now that i have seen you thus i shall be almost sorry if that ship can furnish you with common clothes what you wear becomes you so  oho cried lucilla thats fine flattery sir but i am glad you said it for that speech has made me feel more like a woman than i have felt since i first put on this sailors toggery  in the afternoon the boat returned mander and dickory watching on the beach when it grounded davids manders friend jumped on shore bearing in his arms a pile of great coarse sacks these he threw upon the sand and handing to dickory the gold pieces he had given him said the captain sends word that he has no time to look over any goods to give or to sell but he sends these sacks out of which the women can fashion themselves gowns and so come aboard then the ship shall be searched for stuffs which will suit their purposes and which they can make at their leisure  it was towards the close of the afternoon that all of the mander family and dickory came down to the boat which was waiting for them  do you know said dickory as he and lucilla stood together on the sand that in that gown of gray with the white sleeves and the red cord around your waist you please me better than even you did when you wore your sailor garb  and what matters it sir whether i please you or not     chapter xxix  captain ichabod   kate bonnet was indeed in a sad case she had sailed from kingston with high hopes and a gay heart and before she left she had written to master martin newcombe to express her joy that her father had given up his unlawful calling and to say how she was going to sail after him fold him in her forgiving arms and bring him back to jamaica where she and her uncle would see to it that his past sins were forgiven on account of his irresponsible mind and where for the rest of his life he would tread the paths of peace and probity in this letter she had not yielded to the earnest entreaty which was really the object and soul of master newcombes epistle many kind things she said to so kind a friend but to his offer to make her the queen of his life she made no answer she knew she was his very queen but she would not yet consent to be invested with the royal robes and with the crown  and when she had reached belize how proudly happy she had been she had seen her father no longer an outlaw honest though in mean condition earning his bread by honourable labour then with a still greater pride she had seen him clad as a noble gentleman and bearing himself with dignity and high complacence what a figure he would have made among the fine folks who were her uncles friends in kingston and in spanish town  but all this was over now with his own hand he had told her that once again she was a pirates daughter she went below to her cabin where with wet cheeks dame charter attended her  mr delaplaine was angry intensely angry such a shameful wicked trick had never before been played upon a loving daughter there were no words in which to express his most justifiable wrath again he went to the town to learn more but there was nothing more to learn except that some people said they had reason to believe that bonnet had gone to follow blackbeard from things they had heard they supposed that the vessel which had sailed away in the night had gone to offer herself as consort to the revenge to rob and burn in the company of that notorious ship  there was no satisfaction in this news for the heart of the good merchant and when he returned to the brig and sought his nieces cabin he had no words with which to cheer her all he could do was to tell her the little he had learned and to listen to her supplications  oh uncle she exclaimed we must follow him we must take him we must hold him i care not where he is even if it be in the company of the dreadful blackbeard we must take him we must hold him and this time we must carry him away no matter whether he will or not i believe there must be some spark of feeling even in the heart of a bloody pirate which will make him understand a daughters love for her father and he will let me have mine oh uncle we were very wrong when he was here with us we should have taken him then we should have shut him up we should have sailed with him to kingston  all this was very depressing to the soul of kates loving uncle for how was he to sail after her father and take him and hold him and carry him away he went away to talk to the captain of the belinda but that tall seaman shook his head his vessel was not ready yet to sail being much delayed by the flight of bonnet and moreover he vowed that although he was as bold a seaman as any he would never consent to set out upon such an errand as the following of blackbeard it was terrifying enough to be in the same bay with him even though he were engaged in business with the pirate for no one knew what strange freak might at any time suggest itself to the soul of that most bloody roisterer but as to following him it was like walking into an alligators jaws he would take his passengers back to kingston but he could not sail upon any wild cruises nor could he leave belize immediately  but kate took no notice of all this when her uncle had told it to her she did not wish to go back to jamaica she did not wish to wait at belize it was the clamorous longing of her heart to go after her father and to find him wherever he might be and she did not care to consider anything else  dame charter added also her supplications her boy was with blackbeard and she wished to follow the pirates ship even if she should never see major bonnetwhom she loathed and despised though never saying soshe would find her dickory she too believed that there must be some spark of feeling even in a bloody pirates heart which would make him understand the love of a mother for her son and he would let her have her boy  mr delaplaine sat brooding on the deck the righteous anger kindled by the conduct of his brotherinlaw and his grief for the poor stricken women sobbing in the cabin combined together to throw him into the most dolorous state of mind which was aggravated by the knowledge that he could do nothing except to wait until the belinda sailed back to jamaica and to go to jamaica in her  as the unhappy merchant sat thus his face buried in his hands a small boat came alongside and a passenger mounted to the deck this person after asking a few questions approached mr delaplaine  i have come sir to see you he said i am captain ichabod of the sloop restless  mr delaplaine looked up in surprise that is a pirate ship said he  yes said the other im a pirate  the newcomer was a tall young man with long dark hair and with wellmade features and a certain diffidence in his manner which did not befit his calling  mr delaplaine rose this was his first private interview with a professional searobber and he did not know exactly how to demean himself but as his visitors manner was quiet and as he came on board alone it was not to be supposed that his intentions were offensive  and you wish to see me sir said he  yes said captain ichabod i thought id come over and talk to you i dont know you bedad but i know all about you and i saw you and your family when you came to town to visit that old fox bedad that sugarplanter that captain blackbeard used to call sir nightcap not a bad joke either bedad i have heard of a good many dirty mean things that people in my line of business have done but bedad i never did hear of any captain who was dirty and mean to his own family fine people too who came out to do the right thing by him after he had been cleaned out bedad by one of his brothers of the coast a rare sort of brother bedad dont you say so  you are right sir said mr delaplaine in what you say of the wild conduct of my brotherinlaw bonnet it pleases me sir to know that you condemn it  condemn i should say so bedad answered captain ichabod and i came over here to say to youthat is just to mention not knowing of course what youd think about it bedadthat im goin to start on a cruise tomorrow that is as soon as i can get in my water and some stores bedadwater anyway and if you and your ladies might happen to fancy it bedad id be glad to take you along ive heard that youre in a bad case here the captain of this brig being unable or quite unwilling to take you where you want to go  but where are you going sir in great surprise  anywhere said captain ichabod anywhere youd like to go im starting out on a cruise and a cruise with me means anywhere and my opinion is sir that if you want to come up with that crackbrained sugarplanter youd better follow blackbeard and the best place to find him will be on the carolina coast thats his favourite huntingground bedad and i expect the sugarplanter is with him by this time  but will not that be dangerous sir asked mr delaplaine  oh no said the other i know blackbeard and we have played many a game together you and your family need not have anything to do with it ill board the revenge and you may wager bedad that ill bring sir nightcap back to you by the ear  but theres another said delaplaine theres a young man belonging to my party  oh yes i know said the other the young fellow blackbeard took away with him clapped a cocked hat on him bedad that was a good joke i will bring him too one old man one young manill fetch em both then ill take you all where you want to go to that is as near as i can get to it bedad now you tell your ladies about this and ill have my sloop cleaned up a bit and as soon as i can get my water on board im ready to hoist anchor  but look you sir exclaimed mr delaplaine this is a very important matter and cannot be decided so quickly  oh dont mention it dont mention it said captain ichabod just you tell your ladies all about it and ill be ready to sail almost any time tomorrow  but sir cried the merchant  very good said the pirate captain you talk it over im going to the town now and ill row out to you this afternoon and get your instructions  and with this he got over the side  mr delaplaine said nothing of this visit but waited on deck until the captain came on board and then many were the questions he asked about the pirate ichabod  well well the captain exclaimed thats just like him hes a rare one ichabod is not his name of course and im told he belongs to a good english familya younger son and having taken his inheritance he invested it in a sloop and turned pirate he has had some pretty good fortune i hear in that line but it hasnt profited him much for he is a terrible gambler and all that he makes by his prizes he loses at cards so he is nearly always poor blackbeard sometimes helps him so i have heardwhich he ought to do for the old pirate has won bags of money from himbut he is known as a good fellow and to be trusted i have heard of his sailing a long way back to belize to pay a gambling debt he owed he having captured a merchantman in the meantime  very honourable indeed remarked mr delaplaine  as pirates go a white crow said the other now sir if you and your ladies want to go to blackbeard and a rare desire is that i swear you cannot do better than let captain ichabod take you you will be safe i am sure of that and there is every reason to think he will find his man  when mr delaplaine went below with his extraordinary news dame charter turned pale and screamed  sail in a pirate ship she cried ive seen the men belonging to one of them and as to going on board and sailing with them id rather die just where i am  to the good dames astonishment and that of mr delaplaine kate spoke up very promptly but you cannot die here dame charter and if you ever want to see your son again you have got to go to him which is also the case with me and my father and as there is no other way for us to go i say let us accept this mans offer if he be what my uncle thinks he is after all it might be as safe for us on board his ship as to be on a merchantman and be captured by pirates which would be likely enough in those regions where we are obliged to go and so i say let us see the man and if he dont frighten us too much let us sail with him and get my father and dickory  it would be a terrible danger a terrible danger said mr delaplaine  but uncle urged kate everything is a terrible danger in the search were upon let us then choose a danger that we know something about and which may serve our needs rather than one of which were ignorant and which cannot possibly be of any good to us  it was actually the fact that the little party in the cabin had not finished talking over this most momentous subject before they were informed that captain ichabod was on deck up they went dame charter ready to faint but she did not do so when she saw the visitor she thought it could not be the pirate captain but some one whom he had sent in his place he was more soberly dressed than when he first came on board and his manners were even milder the mind of kate bonnet was so worked up by the trouble that had come upon her that she felt very much as she did when she hung over the side of her fathers vessel at bridgetown ready to drop into the darkness and the water when the signal should sound she had an object now as she had had then and again she must risk everything on her second look at captain ichabod which embarrassed him very much she was ready to trust him  dame charter she whispered we must do it or never see them again  so when they had talked about it for a quarter of an hour it was agreed that they would sail with captain ichabod  when the sloop restless made ready to sail the next day there was a fine flurry in the harbour nothing of the kind had ever before happened there two ladies and a most respectable old gentleman sailing away under the skull and crossbones that was altogether new in the caribbean sea to those who talked to him about his quixotic expedition captain ichabod sworeand at times as many men knew he was a great hand at being in earnestthat if he carried not his passengers through their troubles and to a place of safety the restless and all on board of her should mount to the skies in a thousand bits although this alternative would not have been very comforting to said passengers if they had known of it it came from captain ichabods heart and showed what sort of a man he was  old captain sorby came to the restless in a boat and having previously washed one hand came on board and bade them all goodbye with great earnestness  you will catch him said he to kate and my advice to you is when you get him hang him thats the only way to keep him out of mischief but as you are his daughter you may not like to string him up so i say put irons on him if you dont hell be playin you some other wild trick he is not fit for a pirate anyway and he ought to be taken back to his calves and his chickens  kate did not resent this language she even smiled a little sadly she had a great work before her and she could not mind trifles  none of the other pirates came on board for they were afraid of sorby and when that great man had made the round of the decks and had given captain ichabod some bits of advice he got down into his boat the anchor was weighed the sails hoisted and amid shouts and cheers from a dozen small boats containing some of the most terrible and bloody searobbers who had ever infested the face of the waters the restless sailed away the only pirate ship which had perhaps ever left port followed by blessings and goodwill goodwill although the words which expressed it were curses and the men who waved their hats were blasphemers and cutthroats  away sailed our gentle and most respectable party with the jolly roger floating boldly high above them kate looking skyward noticed this and took courage to bewail the fact to captain ichabod  he smiled while were in sight of my brethren of the coast he said our skull and bones must wave but when were well out at sea we will run up an english flag if it please you     chapter xxx  dame charter makes a friend   captain ichabod was in high feather he whistled he sang and he kept his men cleaning things all that he could do for the comfort of his passengers he did even going so far as to drop as many of his bedads as possible whenever he had an opportunity and these came frequently he talked to mr delaplaine addressing a word or two to kate if he thought she looked gracious for the first day or two dame charter kept below she was afraid of the men and did not even want to look at them if she could help it  but the good womans all wrong said captain ichabod to mr delaplaine my men would not hurt her theyre not the most tremendous kind of pirates anyway for i could not afford that sort i have often thought that i could make more profitable voyages if i had a savager lot of men ill tell you sir we once tried to board a big spanish galleon and the beastly foreigners beat us off bedad and we had a hard time of it gettin away there are three or four good fellows in the crew tough old rascals who came with the sloop when i bought her but most of my men are but poor knaves and not to be afraid of  this comfort mr delaplaine kept to himself and on the second day out the food which was served to them being most wretchedly cooked dame charter ventured into the galley to see if she could do anything in the way of improvement  i think you may eat this she said when she returned to kate but i dont think that anything on board is fit for you when i went to the kitchen i came near dropping dead right in the doorway that cook mistress kate is the most terrible creature of all the pirates that ever were born his eyes are blistering green and his beard is all twisted into points with the ends stuck fast with blood which has never been washed off he roars like a lion with shining teeth but he speaks very fair mistress kate you would be amazed to hear how fair he speaks he told me and every word he said set my teeth on edge with its grating that he wanted to know how i liked the meals cooked that he would do it right if there were things on board to do it with which there are not mistress kate and when he was beatin up that batter for me and i asked him if he was not tired workin so hard he pulled up his sleeve and showed me his arm which was like a horses leg all covered with hair and asked me if i thought it was likely he could tear himself with a spoon im sure he would give us better food if he could for he leaned over and whispered to me like a gust of wind coming in through the door that the captain was in a very hard case having lately lost everything he had at the gamingtable and therefore had not the money to store the ship as he would have done  oh dont talk about that dame charter said kate if we can get enough to eat no matter what it is we must be satisfied and think only of our great joy in sailing to my father and to your dickory  that afternoon captain ichabod found kate by herself on deck and he made bold to sit down by her and before he knew what he was about he was telling her his whole story she listened carefully to what he said he touched but lightly upon his wickednesses although they were plain enough to any listener of sense and bemoaned his fearful passion for gaming which was sure to bring him to misery one day or another  when i have staked my vessel and have lost it said he then there will be an end of me  but why dont you sell your vessel before you lose it said kate and become a farmer  his eyes brightened i never thought of that said he bedadexcuse me misssome day when ive got a little together and can pay my men ill sell this sloop and buy a farm bedadi beg your pardon missill buy a farm  kate smiled but it was easy to see that captain ichabod was in earnest  the next day captain ichabod came to mr delaplaine and took him to one side i want to speak to you he said about a bit of business  you may have noticed sir that we are somewhat short of provisions and the way of it is this the night before we sailed hoping to make a bold stroke at the cardtable and thereby fit out my vessel in a manner suitable to the entertainment of a gentleman and ladies i lost every penny i had i did hope that our provisions would last us a few days longer but i am disappointed sir that cook of mine who is a softhearted fellow his neck always ready for the heel of a woman has thrown overboard even the few stores we had left for you the good dame charter having told him they were not fit to eat and more sir even my men are grumbling so i thought i would speak to you and explain that it would be necessary for us to overhaul a merchantman and replenish our food supply it can be done very quietly sir and i dont think that even the ladies need be disturbed  mr delaplaine stared in amazement do you mean to say he exclaimed that you want me to consent to your committing piracy for our benefit  yes sir answered the captain thats what i suppose you would call it but thats my business  now sir i wish you to know that i am a christian and a gentleman said mr delaplaine  thats all very true bedad said captain ichabod but youre also another thing youre a human being and you must eat  this is terrible exclaimed the merchant that at my time of life i should consent to a felony at sea and to profit by it i cannot bear to think of the wickedness and the disgrace of it  most respected sir said ichabod if the fellows behave themselves properly and dont offer to fight us then therell be no wickedness bedad i can make a good enough show of men to frighten any ordinary merchant crew so that not a blow need be struck and that is what i expect to do sir i would not have any disturbance before ladies you may be sure of that bedad we bear down upon a vessel we order her to surrender we take what we want and we let her go truly theres no wickedness in that and as for the disgrace we can all better bear that than starve  mr delaplaine looked at the pirate without a word he could not comprehend how a man with such a frank and honest face could thus avow his dishonest principles but as he gazed and wondered the thought of a scheme flashed across the mind of the merchant a thoroughly businesslike scheme this bold young pirate captain might seize upon such supplies as they were in need of but he felix delaplaine of spanish town jamaica would pay for them thus might their necessities be relieved and their consciences kept clean but he said nothing of this to ichabod the pirate might deem such a proceeding unprofessional and interpose some objection payment would be the merchants part of the business and he would attend to it himself a look of resignation now came over mr delaplaines face  captain said he i must yield to your reason it is absolutely necessary that we shall not starve  ichabods face shone and he held out his hand bedad sir he cried i honour you as a bold gentleman and a kind one i will instantly lay my course somewhat to the eastward and i promise you sir it will not be long before we run across some of these merchant fellows i beg you sir speak to your ladies and tell them that there will be no unpleasant commotion we may draw our swords and make a fierce show but bedad i dont believe therell be any fighting we shall want so littlefor i would not attempt to take a regular prize with ladies on boardthat the fellows will surely deliver what we demand the quicker to make an end of it  if you are perfectly sure said mr delaplaine that you can restrain your men from violence i would like to be a member of your boarding party it would be a rare experience for me  now captain ichabod fairly shouted with delight  bravo bravo he exclaimed i didnt dream sir that you were a man of such a noble spirit you shall go with us sir your presence will aid greatly in making our hopedfor capture a most orderly affair no one can look upon you bedad without knowing that you are a highminded and honourable man and would not take a box or case from any one if you did not need it now sir we shall put about and by good fortune we may soon sight a merchantman even if it be but a coastwise trader it may serve our purpose  mr delaplaine with something of a smile upon his sedate face hurried to kate who was upon the quarterdeck  my dear we are about to introduce a little variety into our dull lives as soon as we can overhaul a merchantman we shall commit a piracy but dont turn pale i have arranged it all  you exclaimed the wideeyed kate  yes said her uncle and he told his tale  and remember this my dear he added if we cannot pay we do not eat i shall be as relentless as the bloody blackbeard if they take not my money i shall swear to ichabod that we touch not their goods  and are you sure she said that there will be no bloodshed  i vouch for that said he for i shall lead the boarding party  she took him by both hands why she said it need be no more than laying in goods from a storehouse and i cannot but be glad dear uncle for i am so very very hungry  now dame charter came running and puffing do you know she cried that there is to be a piracy the word has just been passed and the cook told me there is to be no bloodshed and the other ship will not be burned and the people will not be made to walk a plank the captain has given those orders and he is very firm swearing i am told much more than is his wont it is dreadful it is awful just to think about but the provisions are gone and it is absolutely necessary to do something and it will really be very exciting the cook tells me he will put me in a good place where i cannot be hurt and where i shall see everything and mistress kate and master delaplaine i dare say he can take care of you too  kate looked at her uncle as if to ask if she might tell the good woman what sort of a piracy this was to be but he shook his head it would not do to interfere any more than was necessary with the regular progress of events the captain came up excited even now bedad he cried there are two sails in sightone far north and the other to the eastward beating up this way this one we shall make for we have the wind with us which is a good thing for the restless is a bad sailer and has lost many a prize through that fault and now miss he said addressing kate i shall have to ask your leave to take down that english flag and run up our jolly roger it will be necessary for if the fellows fear not our long guns they may change their course and get away from us  that will be right said kate if were going to be pirates we might as well be pirates out and out  captain ichabod glowed with delight what a girl this was and what an uncle  it was not long for the restless had a fair wind before the sail to the eastward came fully into sight she was in good truth a merchantman and not a large one dame charter very much excited wondered what she would have on board  the cook tells me said she to kate that sometimes ships from the other side of the ocean carry the most astonishing and beautiful things  but we shall not see these things said kate even if that ship carries them we shall take but food and shall not unnecessarily despoil them of that we may be pirates but we shall not be wicked  it is hard to see the difference said dame charter with a sigh but we must eat the cook tells me that they have made peaceful prizes before now this they do when they want some particular thing such as food or money and care not for the trouble of stripping the ship putting all on board to death and then setting her on fire the cook never does any boarding himself so he says but he stands on the deck here armed with his great axe which likes him better than a cutlass and no matter what happens he defends his kitchen  from his looks said kate i should imagine him to be the fiercest fighter among them all  but that is not so said dame charter he tells me that he is of a very peaceable mind and would never engage in any broils or fights if he could help it look look she cried theyre running out their long brass guns and do you see that other ship how her sails are fluttering in the wind and there that little spot at the top of her mast thats her flag and it is coming down down down it comes and i must run to the cook and ask him what will happen next     chapter xxxi  mr delaplaine leads a boarding party   steadily southward sailed the brig black swan which bore upon its decks the happy mander family and our poor friend dickory carrying with him his lifelong destiny in the shape of the bloodstained letter from captain vince  the sackcloth draperies of lucilla with the red cord lightly tied about them had given place to a very ordinary gown fashioned by her mother and herself which added so few charms to her young face and sparkling eyes that dickory often thought that he wished there were some bushes on deck so that she might stand behind them and let him see only her face as he had seen it when first he met her but he saw the pretty face a great deal for lucilla was very anxious to know things and asked many questions about barbadoes and also asked if there was any probability that the brig would go straight on to that lovely island without bothering to stop at jamaica it was during such talks as this that dickory forgot when he did forget the bloodstained letter that he carried with him always  our young friend still wore the naval uniform although in coming on the brig he had changed it for some rough sailors clothes but lucilla had besought him to be again a brave lieutenant  they sailed and they sailed and there was but little wind and that from the south and against them but lucilla did not complain at their slow progress the slowest vessel in the world was preferable just now to a desert island which never moved  davids was at the wheel and mander stood near him these old friends had not yet finished talking about what had happened in the days since they had seen each other mrs mander sat not far away still making clothes and the little lena was helping her in her childlike way lucilla and dickory were still talking about barbadoes there never was a girl who wanted to know so much about an island as that girl wanted to know about barbadoes  suddenly there was a shout from above  whats that asked mander  a sail said davids peering out over the sea but able to see nothing lucilla and dickory did not cease talking at that moment lucilla did not care greatly about sails there was so much to be said about barbadoes  there was a good deal of talking forward and after a while the captain walked to the quarterdeck he was a gruff man and his face was troubled  i am sorry to say he growled that the ship we have sighted is a pirate she flies the black flag  now there was no more talk about barbadoes or what had happened to old friends and the sewing dropped on the deck those poor manders were chilled to the soul were they again to be taken by pirates  captain cried mander what can we do can we run away from them  we could not run away from their guns growled the captain and there is nothing to do they intend to take this brig and thats the reason they have run up their skull and bones they are bearing directly down upon us with a fair wind they will be firing a gun presently and then i shall lay to and wait for them  mander stepped towards dickory and lucilla his voice was husky as he said we cannot expect my dear that we shall again be captured by forbearing pirates i shall kill my wife and little daughter rather than they shall fall into the bloody hands of ordinary pirates and to you sir i will commit the care of my lucilla if this vessel is delivered over to a horde of savages i pray you plunge your dirk into her heart  yes said lucilla clinging to the arm of dickory if those fierce pirates shall attack us we will die together  dickory shook his head in an awful moment such as this he could hold out no illusions no said he i cannot die with you i have a duty before me and until it is accomplished i cannot willingly give up my life i must rather be even a pirates slave than that but i will accept your fathers charge should there be need i will kill you  thank you very much said lucilla coolly  to the surprise of the people on the black swan there came no shot from the approaching pirate but as she still bore down upon them running before the wind the captain of the brig lay to and lowered his flag submission now was all there was before them no man on the brig took up arms nor did the crew form themselves into any show of resistance that would have but made matters worse  as the pirate vessel came on nearer and nearer a great number of men could be seen stretched along her deck and some brass cannon were visible trained upon the unfortunate brig  but to the surprise of the captain of the black swan and of nearly everybody on board of her the pirate did not run down upon her to make fast and board instead of that she put about into the wind and lay to less than a quarter of a mile away then two boats were lowered and filled with men who rowed towards the brig  they have special reasons for our capture said the captain to those who were crowding about him he may be well laden now with plunder and comes to us for our gold and silver or it may be that he merely wants the brig if that be so he can quickly rid himself of us  that was a cruel speech when women had to hear it but the captain was a rough fellow  the boats came on as quietly as if they were about to land at a neighbouring pier dickory and lucilla cautiously peeped over the rail dickory without his hat and lucilla hiding herself all but a part of her face behind him the manders crouched together on the deck the father with glaring eyes and a knife in his hand the crew stood with their hats removed and their chins lowered waiting for what might happen next  up to this time dickory had shown no signs of fear although his mind was terribly tossed and disturbed for whatever might happen to him it possibly would be the end of that mission which was now the only object of his life but he grated his teeth together and awaited his fate  but now as the boats came nearer he began to tremble and gradually his knees shook under him  i would not have believed that he was such a coward as that thought lucilla  the boats neared the ship and were soon made fast every help was offered by the crew of the brig and not a sign of resistance was shown the leader of the pirates mounted to the deck followed by the greater part of his men  for a moment captain ichabod glanced about him and then addressing the captain of the brig he said this is all very well i am glad to see that you have sense enough to take things as you find them and not to stir up a fracas and make trouble i overhauled you that i might lay in a stock of provisions and some wine and spirits besides having no desire if you treat us rightly to despoil you further so we shall have no more words about it bedad and if you will set your men to work to get on deck such stores as my quartermaster here may demand of you we shall get through this business quickly in the meantime lower two or three boats so that your men can row the goods over to my vessel  the captain of the black swan simply bowed his head and turned away to obey orders while captain ichabod stepped a little aft and began to survey the captured vessel as soon as his back was turned the captain of the brig was approached by a very respectable elderly gentleman apparently not engaged either in the mercantile marine or in piratical pursuits who stopped him and said sir my name is felix delaplaine merchant of spanish town jamaica i am against my will engaged in this piratical attack upon your vessel but i wish to assure you privately that i will not consent to have you robbed of your property and that although some of your provisions may be taken by these pirates i here promise as an honourable gentleman to pay you the full value of all that they seize upon  the captain of the black swan had no opportunity to make an answer to this most extraordinary statement for at that moment a naval officer shouting at the top of his voice came rushing towards the respectable gentleman who had just been making such honourable proposals almost at the same moment there was a great shout from captain ichabod who drawing his cutlass from its sheath raised the glittering blade and dashed in pursuit of the naval gentleman  hold there hold there cried the pirate dont you touch him dont you lay your hand upon him  but ichabod was not quick enough dickory swift as a stag stretched out both his arms and threw them around the neck of the amazed mr delaplaine  now the pirate ichabod reached the two his great sword went high in air and was about to descend upon the naval person whoever he was who had made such an unprovoked attack upon his honoured passenger when his arm was caught by some one from behind turning with a great curse his eyes fell upon the face of a young girl  illustration lucilla rescues dickory  oh dont kill him dont kill him she cried he will hurt nobody he is only hugging the old gentleman  captain ichabod looked from the girl to the two men who were actually embracing each other dickorys back was towards him but the face of mr delaplaine fairly glowed with delight  oho said ichabod turning to lucilla and what does this mean bedad  i dont know she answered but the gentleman in the uniform is a good man perhaps the other one is his father  to my eyes said captain ichabod this is a most fearsome mix  the mander family and nearly everybody else on board crowded about the little group gazing with all their eyes but asking no questions  captain ichabod exclaimed mr delaplaine holding dickory by the hand this is one of the two persons you were taking us to find this is dickory charter the son of good dame charter now on your vessel he went away with blackbeard and we were in search of him  oho cried captain ichabod by my life i believe it thats the young fellow that blackbeard dressed up in a cocked hat and took away with him  i am the same person sir said dickory  so far so good said captain ichabod i am very glad that i did not bring down my cutlass on you which i should have done bedad had it not been for this young woman  now up spoke mr delaplaine we have found you dickory he cried but what can you tell us of major bonnet  ay ay added captain ichabod theres another one were after wheres the runaway sir nightcap  alas said dickory i do not know i escaped from blackbeard and since that day have heard nothing i had supposed that captain bonnet was in your company mr delaplaine  now the captain of the black swan pushed himself forward is it captain bonnet lately of the pirate ship revenge that youre talking about he asked if so i may tell you something of him i am lately from charles town and the talk there was that blackbeard was lying outside the harbour in stede bonnets old vessel and that bonnet had lately joined him i did not venture out of port until i had had certain news that these pirates had sailed northward they had two or three ships and the talk was that they were bound to the virginias and perhaps still farther north they were fitted out for a long cruise  gone again exclaimed mr delaplaine in a hoarse voice gone again  captain ichabods face grew clouded  gone north of charles town he exclaimed thats bad bedad thats very bad you are sure he did not sail southward he asked of the captain of the brig  that gruff mariner was in a strange state of mind he had just been captured by a pirate and in the next moment had made what might be a very profitable sale to a respectable merchant of the goods the pirate was about to take from him moreover the said pirate seemed to be in the employ of said merchant and altogether things seemed to him to be in as fearsome a mix as they had seemed to captain ichabod but he brought his mind down to the question he had been asked  no doubt about that said he there were some of his men in the townfor they are afraid of nobodyand they were not backward in talking  that upsets things badly said captain ichabod without unclouding his brow with my slow vessel and my empty purse bedad i dont see how i am ever goin to catch blackbeard if he has gone north finding blackbeard would have been a handful of trumps to me but the game seems to be up bedad  the captain of the brig and ichabods quartermaster went away to attend to the transfer of the needed goods to the restless mander with his wife and little daughter were standing together gazing with amazement at the strange pirates who had come aboard while lucilla stepped up to dickory who stood silent with his eyes on the deck  can you tell me what this means said she  for a moment he did not answer and then he said i dont know everything myself but i must presently go on board that vessel  what exclaimed lucilla stepping back is she there  yes said dickory     chapter xxxii  the delivery of the letter   the sea was smooth and the wind light and the transfer of provisions from the black swan to the pirate sloop which two ships now lay as near each other as safety would permit was accomplished quietly  during the progress of the transfer captain ichabods boat was rowed back to his ship and its arrival was watched with great interest by everybody on board that pirate sloop kate and dame charter as well as all the men who stood looking over the rail were amazed to see a naval officer accompanying the captain and mr delaplaine on their return but that amazement was greatly increased when that officer as soon as he set foot upon the deck removed his hat and made directly for dame charter who with a scream loud enough to frighten the fishes enfolded him in her arms and straightway fainted it was like a son coming up out of the sea sure enough as she afterward stated kate recognising dickory hurried to him with a scream of her own and both hands outstretched but the young fellow who seemed greatly distressed at the unconscious condition of his mother did not greet mistress bonnet with the enthusiastic delight which might have been expected under the circumstances he seemed troubled and embarrassed which perhaps was not surprising for never before had he seen his mother faint  kate was about to offer some assistance but as the good dame now showed signs of returning consciousness she thought it would be better to leave the two together and in a state of amazement she was hurrying to her uncle when dickory rose from the side of his mother and stopped her  i have a letter for you he said in a husky voice  a letter she cried from my father  no said he from captain vince and he handed her the bloodstained missive  kate turned pale and stared at him here was horrible mystery the thought flashed through the young girls mind that the wicked captain had killed her father and had written to tell her so  is my father dead she gasped  not that i know of said dickory  where is he she cried  i do not know was the answer  she stood holding the letter while dickory returned to his mother mr delaplaine saw her standing thus pale and shocked but he did not hasten to her he had sad things to say to her for his practical mind told him that it would not be possible to continue the search for her father he having put himself out of the reach of captain ichabod and his inefficient sloop if dickory had said anything about her father which had so cast her down how much harder would it be for him when he had to tell her the whole truth   but kate did not wait for further speech from anybody she gave a great start and then rushed down the companionway to her cabin there with her door shut she opened the letter this was the letter written in lead pencil in an irregular but bold hand with some letters partly dimmed where the paper had been damp       at the very end of my life i write to you that you have escaped      the fiercest love that ever a man had for a woman i shall carry      this love with me to hell if it may be but you have escaped it      this escape is a blessing and now that i cannot help it i give it      to you had i lived i should have shed the blood of every one whom      you loved to gain you and you would have cursed me so love me now      for dying                                 yours anywhere and always                                        christopher vince   kate put down the letter and some colour came into her face she bowed her head in thankful prayer  he is dead she said and now he cannot harm my father that was the only thought she had regarding this hotbrained and infatuated lover he was dead her father was safe from him how he died how dickory came to bring the letter how anything had happened that had happened except the death of captain vince did not at this moment concern her not until now had she known how the fear of the vengeful captain of the badger had constantly been with her  over and over again dickory told his tale to his mother she interrupted him so much with her embraces that he could not explain things clearly to her but she did not care she had him with her he was with her and she had fast hold of him and she would never let him go again what mattered it what sort of clothes he wore or where he had escaped froma family on a desert island or from a pirate crew she had him and her happiness knew no bounds dickory was perfectly willing to stay with her and to talk to her he did not care to be with anybody else not even with mistress kate who had taken so much interest in him all the time he had been away though of course not so much interest as his own dear mother  then the good dame charter being greatly recovered and so happy began to talk of herself slipping in a disjointed way over her various experiences she told her dear boy in strictest confidence that she was very much disappointed in the way pirates took ships she thought it was going to be something very exciting that she would remember to the end of her days and wake up in the middle of the night and scream when she thought of it but it was nothing of the kind not a shot was fired not a drop of blood shed there was not even a shout or a yell or a scream for mercy it was all like going into the pantry to get the flour and the sugar she was all the time waiting for something to happen and nothing ever did dickory smiled but it was like watered milk  i do not understand such piracy he said but supposed dear mother that these pirates had taken that ship in the usual way i being on board  at this he was clasped so tightly to his mothers breast that he could say no more  the boats plied steadily between the two vessels and on one of the trips mr delaplaine went over to the brig on business and also glad to escape for a little the dreaded interview which must soon come between himself and his niece  now sir said the merchant to the captain of the brig you will make a bill against me for the provisions which are being taken to that pirate but i hope you have reserved a sufficient store of food for your own maintenance until you reach a port and that of myself and two women who wish to sail with you craving most earnestly that you will land us in jamaica or in some place convenient of access to that island  which i can do said the captain for i am bound to kingston and as to subsistence shall have plenty  on the brig mr delaplaine found captain ichabod who had come over to superintend operations and who was now talking to the pretty girl who had seized him by the arm when he was about to slay the naval officer  i would talk with you captain said the merchant on a matter of immediate import and he led the pirate away from the pretty girl  the matter to be discussed was indeed of deep import  i am loath to say it sir said mr delaplaine when i think of the hospitality and most exceptional kindness with which you have treated me and my niece and for which we shall feel grateful all our lives but i think you will agree with me that it would be useless for us to pursue the search after that most reprehensible person my brotherinlaw bonnet there can be no doubt i believe that he and blackbeard have left the vicinity of charles town and have gone we know not where  no doubt of that bedad said ichabod knitting his brows as he spoke if blackbeard had been outside the harbour this brig would not have been here  and therefore sir continued mr delaplaine i have judged it to be wise and indeed necessary for us to part company with you sir and to take passage on this brig which by a most fortunate chance is bound for kingston my niece i know will be greatly disappointed by this course of events but we have no choice but to fall in with them  i dont like to agree with you said the captain but bedad i am bound to do it i am disappointed myself sir but i have been disappointed so often that i suppose i ought to be used to it if i had caught up with blackbeard i should have been all right and after i had settled your affairsand i know i could have done thati think i would have joined him but all i can do now is to hammer along at the business take prizes in the usual way and wait for blackbeard to come south again and then ill either sell out or join him  it is a great pity sir said mr delaplaine a great pity  yes it is interrupted ichabod its a very great pity sir a very great pity if i had known more about ships when i bought the restless i would have had a faster craft and by this time i might have been a man of comfortable means but that sloop over there bedad is so slow that many a time sir i have seen a fat merchantman sail away from her and leave us in spite of our guns cursing and swearing miles behind i am sorry to have you leave me sir and with your ladies but as you say heres your chance to get home and i dont know when i could give you another  mr delaplaine replied courteously and gratefully and by the next boat he went back to the restless captain ichabod his brow still clouded by the approaching separation walked over to lucilla and continued his conversation with her about the island of barbadoes a subject of which he knew very little and she nothing  when kate returned to the deck she found dickory alone dame charter having gone to talk to the cook about the wonderful things which had happened of which she knew very little and he nothing at all  dickory said kate i want to talk to you and that quickly i have heard nothing of what has happened to you how did you get possession of the letter you brought me and what do you know of captain vince  i can tell you nothing he said without looking at her until you tell me what i ought to know about captain vince and as he said this he could not help wondering in his heart that there were no signs of grief about her  ought to know she repeated regarding him earnestly well you and i have been always good friends and i will tell you and then she told him the story of the captain of the badger of his lovemaking and of his commission to sail upon the sea and destroy the pirate ship revenge and all on board of her  and now she said as she concluded i think it would be well for you to read this letter and she handed him the missive he had carried so long and with such pain he read the bold uneven lines and then he turned and looked upon her his face shining like the morning sky  then you have never loved him he gasped  why should i said kate  in spite of the fact that there were a great many people on board that pirate sloop who might see him in spite of the fact that there were people in boats plying upon the water who might notice his actions dickory fell upon his knees before kate and seizing her hand he pressed it to his lips  why should i said kate quietly drawing her hand from him for i have a devoted lover alreadymaster martin newcombe of barbadoes  dickory repulsed rose to his feet but his face did not lose its glow he had heard so much about martin newcombe that he had ceased to mind him  to think of it he cried to think how i stood and watched him fight how i admired and marvelled at his wonderful strength and skill his fine figure and his flashing eye how my soul went out to him how i longed that he might kill that scoundrel blackbeard and all the time he was your enemy he was my enemy he was a viler wretch than even the bloody pirate who killed him oh kate kate if i had but known  miss kate if you please said the girl and it is well dickory you did not know for then you might have jumped upon him and stuck him in the back and that would have been dishonourable  he thought said dickory not in the least abashed by his reproof that the revenge was commanded by your father for he sprang upon the deck shouting for the captain and when he saw blackbeard i heard him exclaim in surprise a sugarplanter  and he would have killed my father said kate turning pale at the thought  yes replied dickory he would have killed any man except the great blackbeard and to think of it i stood there watching them and wishing that vile englishman the victory oh kate you should have seen that wonderful pirate fight no man could have stood before him then with sparkling eyes and waving arms he told her of the combat when he had finished the souls of these two young people were united in an overpowering admiration almost reverence for the prowess and strength of the wicked and bloody pirate who had slain the captain of the badger  when mr delaplaine came on board kate who had been waiting took him aside  uncle she exclaimed i have great news captain vince is dead at last he came up with the revenge but instead of finding my father in command he found blackbeard who killed him now my father is safe  the good man scarcely knew what to say to this brightfaced girl whose fathers safety was all the world to her if he had heard that his worthless and wicked brotherinlaw had been killed it would have been trouble and sorrow for the present but it would have been peace for the future but he was a christian gentleman and a loving uncle and he banished this thought from his heart he listened to kate as she rapidly went on talking but he did not hear her his mind was busy with the news he had to tell herthe news that she must give up her loving search and go back with him to spanish town  and now uncle said kate theres another thing i want to say to you since this great grief has been lifted from my soul since i know that no wrathful and vindictive captain of a manofwar is scouring the seas armed with authority to kill my father and savage for his life i feel that it is not right for me to put other people who are so good to me to sad discomfort and great expense to try to follow my father into regions far away and to us almost unknown  some day he will come back into this part of the world and i hope he may return disheartened and weary of his present mode of life and then i may have a better chance of winning him back to the domestic life he used to love so much but he is safe uncle and that is everything now and so i came to say to you that i think it would be well for us to relieve this kind captain ichabod from the charges and labours he has taken upon himself for our sakes and if it be possible engage that ship yonder to take us back to jamaica she was sailing in that direction and her captain might be induced to touch at kingston this is what i have been thinking about dear uncle and do you not agree with me  high rose the spirits of the good mr delaplaine banished was all the overhanging blackness of his dreaded interview with kate the sky was bright her soul was singing songs of joy and thankfulness and his soul might join her he never appreciated better than now the blessings which might be shed upon humanity by the death of a bad man his mind even gambolled a little in his relief  but kate he said if we leave that kind captain ichabod and he be not restrained by our presence then my dear he will return to his former evil ways and his next captures will not be like this one but like ordinary piracies sinful in every way  uncle said kate looking up into his face it is too much to ask of one young girl to undertake the responsibilities of two pirates i hope some day to be of benefit to my poor father but when it comes to captain ichabod kind as he has been i am afraid i will have to let him go and manage the affairs of his soul for himself  her uncle smiled upon her now that he was to go back to his home and take this dear girl with him he was ready to smile at almost anything that he thought one pirate much better worth saving than the other and that his choice did not agree with that of his niece was not for him even to think about at such a happy moment it was not long after this conversation that the largest boat belonging to the restless was rowed over to the brig and in it sat not only kate dame charter and dickory but captain ichabod who would accompany his guests to take proper leave of them the crew of the pirate sloop crowded themselves along her sides and even mounted into her shrouds waving their hats and shouting as the boat moved away the cook was the loudest shouter and his ragged hat waved highest and as dame charter shook her handkerchief above her head and gazed back at her savage friend there was a moisture in her eyes up to this moment she never would have believed that she would have grieved to depart from a pirate vessel and to leave behind a pirate cook  lucilla watched carefully the newcomers as they ascended to the deck of the black swan that is the girl she said to herself and i am not surprised  a little later she remarked to captain ichabod who sat by her are they mother and daughter those two  oh no said he mistress bonnet is too fine a lady and too beautiful to be daughter to that old woman who is her attendant and the mother of the young fellow in the cocked hat  too fine and beautiful repeated lucilla  i greatly grieve to leave you all continued the young pirate captain although some of you i have known so short a time it will be very lonely when i sail away with none to speak to save the bloody dogs i command who may yet throttle me and it is to barbadoes you go to settle with your family  that is our destination said lucilla but i know not if we shall find the money to settle there we were taken by pirates and lost everything  now the captain of the brig came up to ichabod and informed him that the goods he demanded had been delivered on board his vessel and that the brig was ready to sail it was the time for leavetaking but ichabod was tardy presently he approached kate and drew her to one side  dear lady he said and his voice was hesitating while a slight flush of embarrassment appeared on his face you may have thought dear lady he repeated you may have thought that so fair a being as yourself should have attracted during the days we have sailed togethermay have attracted bedad i meanthe declared admiration even of a fellow like myself we being so much together but i had heard your story fair lady and of the courtship paid you by captain vince of the corvette badgerwhose family i knew in englandand acknowledging his superior claims i constantly refrained though not without great effort i must say that much for myself fair lady fromfrom  addressing me i suppose you mean said kate what you say kind captain redounds to your honour and i thank you for your noble consideration but i feel bound to tell you that there was never anything between me and captain vince and he is now dead  the young pirate stepped back suddenly and opened wide his eyes what he exclaimed and all the time you were  not free she interrupted with a smile for i have a lover on the island of barbadoes  barbadoes repeated captain ichabod and he bade kate a most courteous farewell  all the goodbyes had been said and good wishes had been wished when just as he was about to descend to his boat captain ichabod turned to lucilla and it is truly to barbadoes you go he asked  yes said she i think we shall certainly do that  now his face flushed and do you care for that fellow in the cocked hat  here was a cruel situation for poor lucilla she must lie or lose two men she might lose them anyway but she would not do it of her own free will and so she lied  not a whit said lucilla  the eyes of ichabod brightened as he went down the side of the brig     chapter xxxiii  blackbeard gives greenway some difficult work   the great pirate blackbeard inactive and taking his ease was seated on the quarterdeck of his fine vessel on which he had lately done some sharp work off the harbour of charles town he was now commanding a small fleet besides the ship on which he sailed he had two other vessels well manned and well laden with supplies from his recent captures satisfied with conquest he was sailing northward to one of his favourite resorts on the north carolina coast  to this conquering hero now came ben greenway the scotchman touching his hat  and what do you want cried the burly pirate havent they given you your prizemoney yet or isnt it enough  prizemoney exclaimed greenway i hae none o it nor will i hae any what money i haean it is but littlecame to me fairly  oho cried blackbeard and you have money then have you is it enough to make it worth my while to take it  ye can count it an see whenever ye like said ben but it isna money that i came to talk to ye about i came to ask ye at the first convenient season to put me on board that ship out there that i may be in my rightful place by the side o master bonnet  and what good are you to him or he to you asked the pirate with a fine long oath that i should put myself to that much trouble  i have the responsibeelity o his soul on my hands said ben an since we left charles town i hae not seen him he bein on ane ship an i on anither  and very well that is too said blackbeard for i like each of you better separate and now look ye me kirk bird you have not done very well with your responsibeelities so far and you might as well make up your mind to stop trying to convert that sneak of a nightcap and take up the business of converting me im in great need of it i can tell you  you cried ben  i tell you yes shouted blackbeard it is i myself that i am talking about i want to be converted from the evil of my ways and i have made up my mind that you shall do it you are a good and a pious man and it is not often that i get hold of one of that kind or if i do i slice off his head before i discover his quality  i fear me said the truthful scotchman that the job is beyond my abeelity  not a bit of it not a bit of it shouted the pirate i am fifty times easier to work upon than that nightcap man of yours and a hundred times better worth the trouble i put no trust in that downfaced farmer when he shouts loudest for the black flag he is most likely to go into priestly orders and the better is he reformed the quicker is he to rob and murder he is of the kind the devil wants but it is of no use for any one to show him the way there he is well able to find it for himself but it is different with me you canny scotchman it is different with me i am an openhanded and an openmouthed scoundrel and i never pretended to be anything else when you begin reforming me you will find your work half done  the scotchman shook his head i fear me he said  no you dont fear yourself cried blackbeard and i wont have it i dont want any of that lazy piety on board my vessel if you dont reform me and do it rightly ill slice off both your ears  at this moment a man came aft carrying a great tankard of mixed drink blackbeard took it and held it in his hand  now then you balking chaplain he cried heres a chance for you to begin what would you have me do drain off this great mug and go slashing among my crew or hurl it mug and all  nay nay cried greenway but rather give half o it to me then will it no disturb your brain an mine will be comforted  heigho cried blackbeard truly you are a better chaplain than i thought you drain half this mug and then by all the powers of heaven and hell you shall convert me now look ye said the pirate when the mug was empty and hear what a brave repentance i have already begun i am tired my gay gardener of all these piracies i have had enough of them even now my spoils and prizes are greater than i can manage and why should i strive to make them more i told you of my young lieutenant who ran away and who gave his carcass to the birds of prey rather than sail with me and marry my strapping daughter i liked that fellow greenway and if he had known what was well for him there might be some reason for me to keep on piling up goods and money but theres cursed little reason for it now i have merchandise of value at belize and much more of it in these ships besides money from charles town which ought to last an honest gentleman for the rest of his days  ay said ben but an honest gentleman is sparing of his expenditures  and you think i am not that kind of a man do you shouted the pirate but let me tell you this i am sailing now for topsail inlet on the north carolina coast and i am going to run in there disperse this fleet sell my goods and  be hanged interpolated greenway in surprise  not a bit of it you croaking crow roared the pirate not a bit of it dont you know you dullhead that our good king george has issued a proclamation to the brethren of the coast to come in and behave themselves like honest citizens and receive their pardon i have done that once and so i know all about it but i backslid showing that my conversion was badly done  it must hae been a poor hand that did the job for ye said greenway for truly the conversion washed off in the first rain  the pirate laughed a great laugh the fact is he said i did the work myself and knowing nothing about it made a bad botch of it but this time it will be different i am going to give the matter into your hands and i shall expect you to do it well if i become not an honest gentleman this time you shall pay for it first with your ears and then with your head  an yere goin to keep me by ye said greenway with an expression not of the best  truly so said blackbeard i shall make you my clerk as long as i am a pirate for i have much writing and figuring work to be done and after that you shall be my chaplain and whether or not your work will be easier than it is now it is not for me to say  the scotchman was about to make an exclamation which might not have been complimentary but he restrained himself  an master bonnet he asked if ye go out o piracy he may go too and take the oath  of course he may cried the pirate and of course he shall i will see to that myself then i will give him back his ship for i dont want it and let him become an honest merchant  give him back his ship exclaimed greenway his countenance downcast that will be puttin into his hands the means o beginnin again a life o sin i pray ye dont do that  blackbeard leaned back and laughed i swear that i thought it would be one of the very first steps in conversion for me to give back to the fellow the ship which is his own and which i have taken from him but fear not my noble pirates clerk he is not the man that i am he is a vile coward and when he has taken the oath he will be afraid to break it moreover  and if with that ship said greenway his eyes beginning to sparkle he become an honest merchant  i dont trust him said blackbeard he is a knave and a sharper and there is no truth in him but when you have settled up my business my clerk and have gotten me well converted i will send you away with him and you shall take up again the responsibility of his soul  the scotchman clapped his horny hands together and once i get him back to bridgetown i will burn his cursed ship  heigho cried blackbeard and that will be your way of converting him you know your business my royal chaplain you know it well and with that he gave greenway a tremendous slap on the back which would have dashed to the deck an ordinary man but ben greenway was a scotchman tough as a yewtree     chapter xxxiv  captain thomas of the royal james   when blackbeards little fleet anchored in topsail inlet stede bonnet who had not been informed of the intentions of the pirate was a good deal puzzled since joining blackbeards fleet in the vessel which came up from belize bonnet had considered himself very shabbily treated and his reasons for that opinion were not bad during the engagements off charles town his services had not been required and his opinion had not been consulted blackbeard having no use for the one and no respect for the other the pirate captain had taken a fancy to ben greenway while his contempt for the scotchmans master increased day by day and it was for this reason that greenway had been taken on board the flagship while bonnet remained on one of the smaller vessels  bonnet was in a discontented and somewhat sulky mood but when blackbeards full plans were made known to him and he found that he might again resume command of his own vessel the revenge if he chose to do so his eyes began to sparkle once more  ben greenway soon resumed his former position with bonnet for it did not take blackbeard very long to settle up his affairs and in a very short time he became tired of the work of conversion or to speak more correctly of the bore of talking about it bonnet was glad to have the scotchman back again although he never ceased to declare his desire to get rid of this faithful friend and helper for when the revenge again came into his hands there were many things to be done and few people to help him do it  it will be merchandise an fair trade this time said ben an yell find it no so easy as your piracies though safer an when yere off to see the governor an hae got your pardon itll be a happy day master bonnet for ye an for your daughter an for your brotherinlaw an everybody in bridgetown wha either knew ye or respected ye  no more of that cried bonnet i did not say i was going to bridgetown or that i wanted anybody there to respect me it is my purpose to fit out the revenge as a privateer and get a commission to sail in her in the war between spain and the allies this will be much more to my taste ben greenway than trading in sugar and hides  greenway was very grave  there is so little difference said he between a privateer an a pirate that it is a great strain on a common mind to keep them separate but a commission from the king is better than a commission from the deil an well hope there wont be much o a war after all is said an done  there was not much intercourse between blackbeard and bonnet at topsail inlet the pirate was on very good terms with the authorities at that place who for their own sakes cared not much to interfere with him and bonnet had his own work in hand and industriously engaged in it he went to bath and got his pardon he procured a clearance for st thomas where he freely announced his intention to take out a commission as privateer and he fitted out his vessel as best he could of men he had not many but when he left the inlet he sailed down to an island on the coast where blackbeard having had too many men on his return from charles town had marooned a large number of the sailors belonging to his different crews finding this the easiest way of getting rid of them bonnet took these men on board with the avowed intention of taking them to st thomas and then he set sail upon the high seas as free and untrammelled as a fishhawk sweeping over the surface of a harbour with clearance papers tied to his leg  stede bonnet had changed very much since he last trod the quarterdeck of the revenge as her captain he was not so important to look at and he put on fewer airs of authority but he issued a great many more commands in fact he had learned much about a sailors life of navigation and the management of a vessel and was far better able to command a ship than he had ever been before he had had a long rest from the position of a pirate captain and he had not failed to take advantage of the lessons which had been involuntarily given him by the veteran scoundrels who had held him in contempt he was now to a great extent sailingmaster as well as captain of the revenge but ben greenway who was much given to that sort of thing undertook to offer bonnet some advice in regard to his course  i am no sailor said he but i ken a chart when i see it an it is my opeenion that there is no need o your sailin so far to the east before ye turn about southward there is naething much stickin out from the coast between here an st thomas  bonnet looked at the scotchman with lofty contempt  perhaps you can tell me said he what there is stickin out from the coast between here and ocracoke inlet where you yourself told me that blackbeard had gone with the one sloop he kept for himself  blackbeard shouted the scotchman an what in the deil have ye got to do wi blackbeard  do with that infernal dog cried bonnet i have everything to do with him before i do aught with anybody or anything besides he stole from me my possessions he degraded me from my position he made me a laughingstock to my men and he even made me blush and bow my head with shame before my daughter and my brotherinlaw two people in whose sight i would have stood up grander and bolder than before any others in the world he took away from me my sword and he gave me instead a wretched pen he made me nothing where i had been everything he even ceased to consider me any more than if i had been the dirty deck under his feet and then when he had done with my property and could get no more good out of it he cast it to me in charity as a man would toss a penny to a beggar before i sail anywhere else ben greenway continued bonnet i sail for ocracoke inlet and when i sight blackbeards miserable little sloop i shall pour broadside after broadside into her until i sink his wretched craft with his bedizened carcass on board of it  but wi your men stand by ye cried greenway yere neither a pirate nor a vessel o war to enter into a business like that  bonnet swore one of his greatest oaths there is no business nor war for me ben greenway he cried until i have taught that insolent blackbeard what manner of man i am  ben greenway was very much disheartened if blackbeard should sink the revenge instead of master bonnet sinking him he said to himself and would be kind enough to maroon my old master an me it might be the best for everybody after all master bonnet is vera humbleminded an complacent when bad fortune comes upon him an it is my opeenion that on a desert island i could weel manage him for the good o his soul  but there were no vessels sunk on that cruise blackbeard had gone nobody knew where and after a time bonnet gave up the search for his old enemy and turned his bow southward now ben greenways countenance gleamed once more  itll be a glad day at spanish town when mistress kate shall get my letter  and what have you been writing to her cried bonnet  i told her said ben greenway how at last ye hae come to your right mind an how ye are a true servant o the king wi your pardon in your pocket an your commission waitin for ye at st thomas an that whatever else ye may do at sea therell be no more black flag floatin over your head nor a seesaw plank wobblin under the feet o onybody else the days o your piracies are over an yere an honest mon once more  you wrote her that said bonnet with a frown  ay said greenway an i left it in the care o a good mon whose ship is weel on its way to kingston by this day  that afternoon captain bonnet called all his men together and addressed them  he made a very good speech a better one than that delivered when he first took real command of the revenge after sailing out of the river at bridgetown and it was listened to with respectful and earnest interest in brief manner he explained to all on board that he had thrown to the winds all idea of merchandising or privateering that his pardon and his ships clearance were of no value to him except he should happen to get into some uncomfortable predicament with the law that he had no idea of sailing towards st thomas but intended to proceed up the coast to burn and steal and rob and slay wherever he might find it convenient to do so that he had brought the greater part of his crew from the desert island where blackbeard had left them because he knew that they were stout and reckless fellows just the sort of men he wanted for the piratical cruise he was about to begin and that in order to mislead any government authorities who by land or sea might seek to interfere with him he had changed the name of the good old revenge to the royal james while its captain once stede bonnet was now to be known on board and everywhere else as captain thomas with nothing against him he concluded by saying that all that had been done on that ship from the time she first hoisted the black flag until the present moment was nothing at all compared to the fire and the blood and the booty which should follow in the wake of that gallant vessel the royal james commanded by captain thomas  the men looked at each other but did not say much they were all pirates although few of them had regularly started out on a piratical career and there was nothing new to them in this sort of piratical dishonour in the little cruise after blackbeard their new captain had shown himself to be a good man ready with his oaths and very certain about what he wanted done so whenever stede bonnet chose to run up the jolly roger he might do it for all they cared  poor ben greenway sat apart his head bowed upon his hands  you seem to be in a bad case old ben said bonnet gazing down upon him but you throw yourself into needless trouble as soon as i lay hold of some craft which i am willing shall go away with a sound hull i will put you on board of her and let you go back to the farm i will keep you no longer among these wicked people ben greenway and in this wicked place  ben shook his head i started wi ye an i stay wi ye said he an ill follow ye to the vera gates o hell but farther than that master bonnet i willna go at the gates o hell i leave ye     chapter xxxv  a chapter of happenings   for happiness with a flaw in it it was a very fair happiness which now hung over the delaplaine home near spanish town kate bonnets father was still a pirate but there was no captain vince in hot pursuit of him seeking his blood kate could sing with the birds and laugh with dickory whenever she thought of the death of the wicked enemy this was not it may be thought a proper joy for a young maidens heart but it came to kate whether she would or not the change was so great from the fear which had possessed her before  the old home life began again although it was a very quiet life dickory went into mr delaplaines countinghouse but it was hard for the young man to doff the naval uniform which had been bestowed upon him by blackbeard for he knew he looked very well in it and everybody else thought so and told him so but it could not be helped and with all convenient speed he discarded his cocked hat and all the rest of it and clothed himself in the simple garb of a merchants clerk although it might be said that in all the west indies at that day there was no clerk so goodlooking as was dickory dame charter was so thankful that her boy had come safely through all his troubles so proud of him and so eminently well satisfied with his present position that she asked nothing of her particular guardian angel but that stede bonnet might stay away if after tiring of piracy that man came back as his relatives wished him to do the good dame was sure he would make mischief of some sort and as like as not in the direction of her dickory if this evil family genius should be lost at sea or should disappear from the world in some equally painless and undisgraceful fashion dame charter was sure that she could in a reasonable time quiet the grief of poor kate for what rightminded damsel could fail to mingle thankfulness with her sorrow that a kind death should relieve a parent from the sins and disgraces which in life always seemed to open up in front of him  about this time there came a letter from barbadoes which was of great interest to everybody in the household it was from master martin newcombe and of course was written to kate but she read many portions of it to the others the first part of the epistle was not read aloud but it was very pleasant for kate to read it to herself this man was a close lover and an ardent one whatever had happened to her fortunes nothing had interfered with his affection whatever he had said he still bravely stood by and to whatever she had objected in the way of obstacles he had paid no attention whatever  in the parts of the letter read to her uncle and the others master newcombe told how not having heard from them for so long he had been beginning to be greatly troubled but the arrival of the black swan which after touching at kingston had continued her course to barbadoes had given him new life and hope and it was his intention as soon as he could arrange his affairs to come to jamaica and there say by word of mouth and do in his own person so much for which a letter was totally inadequate the thought of seeing kate again made him tremble as he walked through his fields this was read inadvertently and dickory frowned dame charter frowned too she had never supposed that master newcombe would come to spanish town she had always looked upon him as a very worthy young farmer so worthy that he would not neglect his interest by travelling about to other islands than his own she did not know exactly how her son felt about all this nor did she like to ask him but dickory saved her the trouble  if that newcombe comes here he said i am going to fight him  what cried his mother you would not do that that would be terrible it would ruin everything  ruin what he asked  his mother answered diplomatically it would ruin all your fine opportunities in this family  dickory smiled with a certain sarcastic hardness i dont mean said he that i am going to hack at him with a sword because neither he nor i properly know how to use swords and after the wonderful practice that i have seen i would not want to prove myself a bungler even if the other man were a worse one no mother i mean to fight with him by all fair means to gain the hand of my dear kate i love her and i am far more worthy of her than he is he is not a welldisposed man being rough and inconsiderate in his speech dickory had never forgiven the interview by the river bank when he had gone to see madam bonnet and as to his being a stout lover he is none of it had he been that he would long ago have crossed the little sea between barbadoes and here  do you mean you foolish boy exclaimed dame charter to say that you presume to love our mistress kate and her eyes glowed upon him with all the warmth of a mothers pride for this was the wish of her heart and never absent from it  ay mother said dickory i shall fight for her i shall show her that i am worthier than he is and that i love her better i shall even strive for her if that mad pirate comes back and tries to overset everything  oh do it before that cried dame charter anxiety in every wrinkle do it before that  mr delaplaine was a little troubled by the promised visit from barbadoes he had heard of master newcombe as being a most estimable young man but the fault about him in his opinion was that he resided not in jamaica for a long time the good merchant had lived his own life with no one to love him and he now had with him his sisters child whom he had come to look upon as a daughter and he did not wish to give her up it was true that it might be possible under favourable pressure to induce young newcombe to come to jamaica and settle there but this was all very vague had he had his own way he would have driven from kate every thought of love or marriage until the time when his new clerk dickory charter had become a young merchant of good standing worthy of such a wife then he might have been willing to give kate to dickory and dickory would have given her to him and they might have all been happy that is if that harebrained bonnet did not come home  the delaplaine family did not go much into society at that time for people had known about the pirate and his ship the revenge and the pursuit upon which captain vince of the royal corvette badger had been sent they had all heard too of the death of captain vince and some of them were not quite certain whether he had been killed by the pirate bonnet or another desperado equally dangerous knowing all this although if they had not known it they would scarcely have found it out from the speech of their neighbours the delaplaines kept much to themselves and they were happy and the keynote of their happiness was struck by kate whose thankful heart could never forget the death of captain vince  mr delaplaine made his proper visit to spanish town to carry his thanks and to tell the governor how things had happened to him and the governor still showed his interest in mistress kate bonnet and expressed his regret that she had not come with her uncle which was a very natural wish indeed for a governor of good taste  this is a chapter of happenings and the next happening was a letter from that good man ben greenway and it told the most wonderful splendid and glorious news that had ever been told under the bright sun of the beautiful west indies it told that captain stede bonnet was no longer a pirate and that kate was no longer a pirates daughter these happy people did not join hands and dance and sing over the great news but kates joy was so great that she might have done all these things without knowing it so thankful was she that once again she had a father this rapture so far outshone her relief at the news of the death of captain vince that she almost forgot that that wicked man was safe and dead kate was in such a state of wild delight that she insisted that her uncle should make another visit to the governors house and take her with him that she herself might carry the governor the good news and the governor said such heartwarming things when he heard it that kate kissed him in very joy but as dickory was not of the party this incident was not entered as part of the proceedings  now society both in spanish town and kingston opened its arms and insisted that the fair star of barbadoes should enter them and there were parties and dances and dinners and it might have been supposed that everybody had been a father or a mother to a prodigal son so genial and joyful were the festivitieskate high above all others  at some of these social functions dickory charter was present but it is doubtful whether he was happier when he saw kate surrounded by gay admirers or when he was at home imagining what was going on about her  there was but one cloud in the midst of all this sunshine and that was that mr delaplaine dame charter and her son dickory could not forget that it was now in the line of events that stede bonnet would soon be with them and beyond that all was chaos  and over the seas sailed the good ship the royal james captain thomas in command     chapter xxxvi  the tide decides   it was now september and the weather was beautiful on the north carolina coast captain thomas late bonnet of the royal james late revenge had always enjoyed cool nights and invigorating morning air and therefore it was that he said to his faithful servitor ben greenway when first he stepped out upon the deck as his vessel lay comfortably anchored in a little cove in the cape fear river that he did not remember ever having been in a more pleasant harbour this welltried pirate captainstede bonnet as we shall call him notwithstanding his assumption of another namewas in a genial mood as he drank in the morning air  from his point of view he had a right to be genial he had a right to be pleased with the scenery and the air he had a right to swear at the scotchman and to ask him why he did not put on a merrier visage on such a sparkling morning for since he had first started out as captain thomas of the royal james he had been a most successful pirate he had sailed up the virginia coast he had burned he had sunk he had robbed he had slain he had gone up the delaware bay and the people in ships and the people on the coasts trembled even when they heard that his black flag had been sighted  no man could now say that the former captain of the revenge was not an accomplished and seasoned desperado even the great blackbeard would not have cared to give him nicknames nor dared to play his blithesome tricks upon him he was now no more captain nightcap to any man his crew of hairy ruffians had learned to understand that he knew what he wanted and more than that he knew how to order it done they listened to his great oaths and they respected him this powerful pirate now commanded a small fleet for in the cove where lay his flagship also lay two goodsized sloops manned by their own crews which he had captured in delaware bay and had brought down with him to this quiet spot a few miles up the cape fear river where now he was repairing his own ship which had had a hard time of it since she had again come into his hands  for many a long day the sound of the hammer and the saw had mingled with the song of the birds and captain bonnet felt that in a day or two he might again sail out upon the sea conveying his two prizes to some convenient mart while he with his good ship freshened and restored would go in search of more victories more booty and more blood  greenway i tell you said bonnet continuing his remarks you are too glum youve got the only long face in all this my fleet even those poor fellows who man my prizes are not so solemn although they know not when i have done with them whether i shall maroon them to quietly starve or shall sink them in their own vessels  but i hae no such reason to be cheerful said ben i hae bound mysel to stand by ye till ye hae gone to the deil an i hae no chance o freein mysel from my responsibeelities by perishin on land or in the sea  if anything could make me glum ben greenway it would be you said the other but i am getting used to you and some of these days when i have captured a ship laden with scotch liquors and scotch plaids i believe that you will turn pirate yourself for the sake of your share of the prizes  which is likely to be on the same mornin that ye turn to be an honest mon said ben but i am no in the way o expectin miracles  on went the pounding and the sawing and the hammering and the swearing and the singing of birds although the latter were a little farther away than they had been and in the course of the day the pirate captain erect scrutinizing and blasphemous went over his ship superintending the repairs in a day or two everything would be finished and then he and his two prizes could up sail and away it was a beautiful harbour in which he lay but he was getting tired of it  there were great prospects before our pirate captain perhaps he might have the grand good fortune to fall in with that lowborn devil blackbeard who when last he had been heard from commanded but a small vessel fearing no attack upon this coast what a proud and glorious moment it would be when a broadside and another and another should be poured in upon his little craft from the long guns of the royal james  bonnet was still standing reflecting with bright eyes upon this dazzling future and wondering what would be the best way of letting the dastardly blackbeard know whose guns they were which had sunk his ship when a boat was seen coming around the headland this was one of his own boats which had been posted as a sentinel and which now brought the news that two vessels were coming in at the mouth of the river but that as the distance was great and the night was coming on they could not decide what manner of craft they were  this information made everybody jump on board the royal james and the noise of the sawing and the hammering ceased as completely as had the songs of the birds in a few minutes that quick and able mariner bonnet had sent three armed boats down the river to reconnoitre if the vessels entering the river were merchantmen they should not be allowed to get away but if they were enemies although it was difficult to understand how enemies could make their appearance in these quiet waters they must be attended to either by fight or flight  when the three boats came back and it was late before they appeared every man upon the royal james was crowded along her side to hear the news and even the people on the prizes knew that something had happened and stood upon every point of vantage hoping that in some way they could find out what it was  the news brought by the boats was to the effect that two vessels not sailing as merchantmen and well armed and manned were now ashore on sandbars not very far above the mouth of the river now bonnet swore bravely if the work upon his vessels had been finished he would up anchor and away and sail past these two grounded ships whatever they were and whatever they came for he would sail past them and take with him his two prizes he would glide out to sea with the tide and he would laugh at them as he left them behind but the royal james was not ready to sail  the tide was now low five hours afterward when it should be high those two ships whatever they were would float again and the royal james whatever her course of action should be would be cut off from the mouth of the river this was a greater risk than even a pirate as bold as bonnet would wish to run and so there was no sleep that night on the royal james the blows of the hammers and the sounds of the saws made a greater noise than they had ever done before so that the night birds were frightened and flew shrieking away every man worked with all the energy that was in him for each hairy rascal had reason to believe that if the vessel they were on did not get out of the river before the two armed strangers should be afloat there might be hard times ahead for them even ben greenway was aroused the deil shall not get him any sooner than can be helped he said to himself and he hammered and sawed with the rest of them  on his stout and wellarmed sloop the henry mr william rhett of charles town south carolina paced anxiously all night frequently from the sandbar on which his vessel was grounded he called over to his other sloop also fast grounded giving orders and asking questions on both vessels everybody was at work getting ready for action when the tide should rise  some weeks before the wails and complaints of a tortured seacoast had come down from the jersey shores to south carolina asking for help at the only place along that coast whence help could come a pirate named thomas was working his way southward spreading terror before him and leaving misery behind these appeals touched the hearts of the people of charles town already sore from the injuries and insults inflicted upon them by blackbeard in those days when bonnet sat silently on the pirate ship doing nothing and learning much  there was no hesitancy for their own sake and for the sake of their commerce this new pirate must not come to charles town harbour and an expedition of two vessels heavily armed and well manned and commanded by mr william rhett was sent northward up the coast to look for the pirate named thomas and to destroy him and his ship mr rhett was not a military man nor did he belong to the navy he was a citizen capable of commanding soldiers and as such he went forth to destroy the pirate thomas  mr rhett met people enough along the coast who told him where he might find the pirate but he found no one to tell him how to navigate the dangerous waters of the cape fear river and so it was that soon after entering that fine stream he and his consort found themselves aground  mr rhett was quite sure that he had discovered the lair of the big game he was looking for just before dark three boats well filled with men had appeared from up the river and they had looked so formidable that everything had been made ready to resist an attack from them they retired but every now and then during the night when there was quiet for a few minutes there would come down the river on the wind the sound of distant hammering and the noise of saws  it was after midnight before the henry and the sea nymph floated free but they anchored where they were and waited for the morning whether they would sail up the river after the pirate or whether he would come down to them daylight would show  mr rhetts vessels had been at anchor for five hours and every man on board of them were watching and waiting when daylight appeared and showed them a tall ship under full sail rounding the distant headland up the river now up came their anchors and their sails were set the pirate was coming  whatever the royal james intended to do mr rhett had but one plan and that was to meet the enemy as soon as possible and fight him so up sailed the henry and up sailed the sea nymph and they pressed ahead so steadily to meet the royal james that the latter vessel in carrying out what was now her obvious intention of getting out to sea was forced shoreward where she speedily ran upon a bar then from the vessels of charles town there came great shouts of triumph which ceased when first the henry and then the sea nymph ran upon other bars and remained stationary  here was an unusual conditionthree ships of war all aground and about to begin a battle a battle which would probably last for five hours if one or more of the stationary vessels were not destroyed before that time it was soon found however that there would only be two parties to the fight for the sea nymph was too far away to use her guns the royal james had an advantage over her opponents since when she slightly careened her decks were slanted away from the enemy while the latters were presented to her fire  at it they went hot and heavy bonnet and his men now knew that they were engaged with commissioned war vessels and they fought for their lives mr rhett knew that he was fighting thomas the dreaded pirate of the coast and he felt that he must destroy him before his vessel should float again the cannon roared muskets blazed away and the combatants were near enough even to use pistols upon each other men died blood flowed and the fight grew fiercer and fiercer  bonnet roared like an incarnate devil he swore at his men he swore at the enemy he swore at his bad fortune for had he not missed the channel the game would have been in his own hands  so on they fought and the tide kept steadily rising the five hours must pass at last and the vessel which first floated would win the day  the five hours did pass and the henry floated and bonnet swore louder and more fiercely than before he roared to his men to fire and to fight no matter whether they were still aground or not and with many oaths he vowed that if any one of them showed but a sign of weakening he would cut him down upon the spot but the hairy scoundrels who made up the crew of the royal james had no idea of lying there with their ship on its side while two other shipsfor the sea nymph was now afloatshould sail around them rake their decks and shatter them to pieces so the crew consulted together despite their captains roars and oaths and many of them counselled surrender their vessel was much farther inshore than the two others and no matter what happened afterward they preferred to live longer than fifteen or twenty minutes  but bonnet quailed not before fate before the enemy or before his crew if he heard another word of surrender he would fire the magazine and blow the ship to the sky with every man in it raising his cutlass in air he was about to bring it down upon one of the cowards he berated when suddenly he was seized by two powerful hands which pinned his arms behind him with a scream of rage he turned his head and found that he was in the grasp of ben greenway  let go your sword master bonnet said ben it is o no use to ye now for ye canna get awa from me im nae older than ye are though i look it an ive got the harder muscles ye may be makin your way steadily an surely to the gates o hell an it mayna be possible that i can prevent ye but im not goin to let ye tumble in by accident so long as ive got two arms left to me  pale haggard and writhing stede bonnet was disarmed and the jolly roger came down     chapter xxxvii  bonnet and greenway part company   it was three days after this memorable combatfor the vessels engaged in it needed considerable repairswhen mr rhett of charles town sailed down the cape fear river with his five vesselsthe two with which he had entered it the pirate royal james and the two prizes of the latter which had waited quietly up the river to see how matters were going to turn out  on the henry sailed the pirate thomas now discovered to be the notorious stede bonnet and a very quiet and respectful man he was as has been seen before bonnet was a man able to adapt himself to circumstances there never was a more demure countinghouse clerk than was bonnet at belize there never was an humbler dependent than the almost unnoticed bonnet after he had joined blackbeards fleet before charles town and there never was a more deferential and respectful prisoner than stede bonnet on board the henry it was really touching to see how this cursing and raging pirate deported himself as a meek and uncomplaining gentleman  there was no prisonhouse in charles town but stede bonnets wicked crew including ben greenwayfor his captors were not making any distinctions in regard to common men taken on a pirate shipwere clapped into the watchhouseand a crowded and uncomfortable place it wasand put under a heavy and military guard the authorities were however making distinctions where gentlemen of family and owners of landed estates were concerned no matter if they did happen to be taken on a pirate ship and major bonnet of barbadoes was lodged in the provost marshals house in comfortable quarters with only two sentinels outside to make him understand he was a prisoner  the capture of this celebrated pirate created a sensation in charles town and many of the citizens were not slow to pay the unfortunate prisoner the attentions due to his former position in society he was very well satisfied with his treatment in charles town which city he had never before had the pleasure of visiting  the attentions paid to ben greenway were not pleasing sometimes he was shoved into one corner and sometimes into another he frequently had enough to eat and drink but very often this was not the case bonnet never inquired after him if he thought of him at all he hoped that he had been killed in the fight for if that were the case he would be rid of his eternal preachments  greenway made known the state of his own case whenever he had a chance to do so but his complaints received no attention and he might have remained with the crew of the royal james as long as they were shut up in the watchhouse had not some of the hairy cutthroats themselves taken pity upon him and assured the guards that this man was not one of them and that they knew from what they had heard him say and seen him do that there was no more determined enemy of piracy in all the western continent so it happened that after some weeks of confinement greenway was let out of the watchhouse and allowed to find quarters for himself  the first day the scotchman was free he went to the provostmarshals house and petitioned an interview with his old master bonnet  heigho cried the latter who was comfortably seated in a chair reading a letter and where do you come from ben greenway i had thought you were dead and buried in the cape fear river  ye did not think i was dead replied ben when i seized ye an held ye an kept ye from buryin yoursel in that same river  bonnet waved his hand no more of that said he i was unfortunate but that is over now and things have turned out better than any man could have expected  better exclaimed ben i vow i know not what that means  bonnet laughed he was looking very well he was shaved and wore a neat suit of clothes  ben greenway said he you are now looking upon a man of high distinction at this moment i am the greatest pirate on the face of the earth yes greenway the greatest pirate on the face of the earth i have a letter here which was received by the provostmarshal and which he gave me to read which tells that blackbeard the first pirate of his age is dead therefore ben greenway i take his place and there is no living pirate greater than i am  an ye pride yoursel on that an at this moment asked ben truly amazed  that do i said bonnet and think of it ben greenway that presumptuous overbearing blackbeard was killed and his head brought away sticking up on the bow of a vessel what a rare sight that must have been ben think of his long beard all tied up with ribbons stuck up on the bow of a ship  an ye are now the head deil on earth said ben  you can put it that way if you like said bonnet but i am not so looked upon in this town i am an honoured person i doubt very much if any prisoner in this country was ever treated with the distinction that is shown me but i dont wonder at it i have the reputation of two great pirates joined in onethe pirate bonnet of the dreaded ship revenge and the terrible thomas of the royal james my man there are people in this town who have been to me and who have said that a man so famous should not even be imprisoned i have good reason to believe that it will not be long before pardon papers are made out for me and that i may go my way  an your men asked greenway will they go free or will they be hung like common pirates  bonnet frowned impatiently i dont want to hear anything about the men he said of course they will be hung what could be done with them if they were not hung but it is entirely different with me i am a most respectable person and now that i am willing to resign my piratical career having won in it all the glory that can come to one man that respectability must be considered  weel weel said the scotchman an when it comes that respectabeelity is better for a mans soul an body than righteousness then i am no fit counsellor for ye master bonnet and he took his leave  the next morning when ben greenway left his lodging he found the town in an uproar the pirate bonnet had bribed his sentinels and with some others had escaped ben stood still and stamped his foot such infamy such perfidy to the authorities who had treated him so well the scotchman could not at first imagine but when the truth became plain to him his face glowed his eye burned this vile conduct of his old master was a triumph to bens principles wickedness was wickedness and could not be washed away by respectability  the days passed on bonnet was recaptured more securely imprisoned put upon trial found guilty and in spite of the efforts of the advocates of respectability was condemned to be hung on the same spot where nearly all the members of his pirate crew had been executed  during all this time ben greenway kept away from his old master he had borne illtreatment of every kind but the deception practised upon him when at his latest interview bonnet talked to him of his respectability having already planned an escape and return to his evil ways was too much for the honest scotchman he had done with this man faithless to friend and foe to his own blood and even to his own bad reputation  but not quite done it was but half an hour before the time fixed for the pirates execution that ben greenway gained access to him  what cried bonnet raising his head from his hands you here i thought i had done with you  ay i am here said ben greenway i hae stood by ye in good fortune an in bad fortune an i hae never left ye no matter what happened an i told ye i would follow ye to the gates o hell but i could go no farther i hae kept my word an here i stop fareweel  the only comfortable thing about this business said bonnet is to know that at last i am rid of that fellow     chapter xxxviii  again dickory was there   there were indeed gay times in spanish town and with the two loads lifted from her heart kate helped very much to promote the gaiety if this young lady had wished to make a good colonial match she had opportunities enough for so doing but she was not in that frame of mind and encouraged no suitor  but bright as she was she was not so bright as on that great and glorious day when she received ben greenways letter telling her that her father was no longer a pirate there were several reasons for this gradually growing twilight of her happiness and one was that no letter came from her father to be sure there were many reasons why no letter should come there were no regular mails in these colonies which could be depended upon and besides the new career of her father sailing as a privateer under the kings flag would probably make it very difficult for him to send a letter to jamaica by any regular or irregular method moreover her father was a miserable correspondent and always had been thus she comforted herself and was content though not very well content to wait  then there was another thing which troubled her when she thought of it that good man and steady lover martin newcombe had written that he was coming to spanish town and she knew very well what he was coming for and what he would say but she did not know what she would say to him and the thought of this troubled her in a letter she might put off the answer for which he had been so long and patiently waiting but when she met him face to face there could be no more delay she must tell him yes or no and she was not ready to do this  there was so much to think of so many plans to be considered in regard to going back to barbadoes or staying in jamaica that really she could not make up her mind at least not until she had seen her father she would be so sorry if mr newcombe came to spanish town before her father should arrive or at least before she should hear from him  then there was another thing which added to the twilight of these cheerful days and this kate could scarcely understand because she could see no reason why it should affect her the governor whom they frequently met in the course of the pleasant social functions of the town looked troubled and was not the genial gentleman he used to be of course he had a right to his own private perplexities and annoyances but it grieved kate to see the change in him he had always been so cordial and so cheerful he was now just as kind as ever perhaps a little more so in his manner but he was not cheerful  kate mentioned to her uncle the changed demeanour of the governor but he could give no explanation he had heard of no political troubles but supposed that family matters might easily have saddened the good man  he himself was not very cheerful for day after day brought nearer the time when that uncertain stede bonnet might arrive in jamaica and what would happen after that no man could tell one thing he greatly feared and that was that his dear niece kate might be taken away from him dame charter was not so very cheerful either only in one way did she believe in stede bonnet and that was that after some fashion or another he would come between her and her bright dreams for her dear dickory  and so there were some people in spanish town who were not as happy as they had been  still there were dinners and little parties and society made itself very pleasant and in the midst of them all a ship came in from barbadoes bringing a letter from martin newcombe  a strange thing about this letter was that it was addressed to mr delaplaine and not to miss kate bonnet this of course proved the letter must be on business and although he was with his little family when he opened his letter he thought it well to glance at it before reading it aloud the first few lines showed him that it was indeed a business letter for it told of the death of madam bonnet and how the writer martin newcombe as a neighbour and friend of the family had been called in to take temporary charge of her effects and having done so he hastened to inform mr delaplaine of his proceedings and to ask advice this letter he now read aloud and kate and the others were greatly interested therein although they cautiously forbore the expression of any opinion which might rise in their minds regarding this turn of affairs  having finished these business details mr delaplaine went on and read aloud and in the succeeding portion of the letter mr newcombe begged mr delaplaine to believe that it was the hardest duty of his whole life to write what he was now obliged to write but that he knew he must do it and therefore would not hesitate at this the reader looked at his niece and stopped  go on cried kate her face a little flushed go on  the face of mr delaplaine was pale and for a moment he hesitated then with a sudden jerk he nerved himself to the effort and read on he had seen enough to make him understand that the duty before him was to read on  illustration in an instant dickory was there  briefly and tersely but with tears in the very ink so sad were the words the writer assured mr delaplaine that his love for his niece had been and was the overpowering impulse of his life that to win this love he had dared everything he had hoped for everything he had been willing to pass by and overlook everything but that now and it tore his heart to write it his evil fortune had been too much for him he could do anything for the sake of his love that a man with respect for himself could do but there was one thing at which he must stop at which he must bow his head and submit to his fatehe could not marry the daughter of an executed felon  thus came to that little family group the news of the pirate bonnets death there was more of the letter but mr delaplaine did not read it  kate did not scream nor moan nor faint but she sat up straight in her chair and gazed with a wild intentness at her uncle no one spoke at such a moment condolence or sympathy would have been a cruel mockery they were all as pale as chalk in his heart mr delaplaine said i see it all the governor must have known and he loved her so he could not break her heart  in the midst of the silence in the midst of the chalky whiteness of their faces in the midst of the blackness which was settling down upon them kate bonnet still sat upright a coldness creeping through every part of her suddenly she turned her head and in a voice of wild entreaty she called out oh dickory why dont you come to me  in an instant dickory was there and cold and lifeless kate bonnet was in his arms     chapter xxxix  the blessings which come from the death of the wicked   it was three weeks after martin newcombes letter came before ben greenway arrived in spanish town he had had a hard time to get there having but little money and no friends to help him but he had a strong heart and an earnest and so he was bound to get there at last and although kate saw no visitors she saw him she was not dressed in mourning she could not wear black for herself  she greeted the scotchman with earnestness he was a friend out of the old past but she gave him no chance to speak first  ben she exclaimed have you a message for me  no message he replied but i hae somethin on my heart i wish to say to ye i hae toiled an laboured an hae striven wi mony obstacles to get to ye an to say it  she looked at him with her brows knit wondering if she should allow him to speak then with the words scarcely audible between her tightly closed lips she said ben what is it  it is this an no more nor less replied the scotchman he was never fit to be your father an it is not fit now for ye to remember him as your father i was faithful to him to the vera last but there was no truth in him it is an abomination an a wickedness for ye to remember him as your father  kate spoke no word nor did she shed a tear  it was my hearts desire ye should know it said the scotchman an i came mony a weary league to tell ye so  ben said she i think i have known it for a long time but i would not suffer myself to believe it but now having heard your words i am sure of it  uncle said she an hour afterward i have no father and i never had one  with tears in his eyes he folded her to his breast and peace began to rise in his soul no greater blessing can come to really good people than the absolute disappearance of the wicked  and the wickedness which had so long shadowed and stained the life of kate bonnet was now removed from it it was hard to get away from the shadow and to wipe off the stain but she was a brave girl and she did it  in this work of her lifea work which if not accomplished would make that life not worth the livingkate was much helped by dickory and he helped her by not saying a word about it or ever allowing himself when in her presence to remember that there had been a shadow or a stain and if he thought of it at all when by himself his only feeling was one of thankfulness that what had happened had given her to him  even the governor brightened he had striven hard to keep from kate the news which had come to him from charles town suppressing it in the hopes that it might reach her more gradually and with less terrible effect than if he told it but now that he knew that she knew it the blessings which are shed abroad by the disappearance of the wicked affected him also and he brightened there were no functions for kate but she brightened striving with all her soul to have this so for her own sake as well as that of others as for mr delaplaine dame charter and dickory they brightened without any trouble at all the disappearance of the wicked having such a direct and forcible effect upon them  dickory charter who matured in a fashion which made everybody forget that kate bonnet was eleven months his senior entered into business with mr delaplaine and jamaica became the home of this happy family whose welfare was founded as on a rock upon the disappearance of the wicked  here then was a brave girl who had loved her father with a love which was more than that of a daughter which was the love of a mother of a wife who had loved him in prosperity and in times of sorrow and of shame who had rejoiced like an angel whenever he turned his footsteps into the right way and who had mourned like an angel whenever he went wrong she had longed to throw her arms around her fathers neck to hold him to her and thus keep off the hangmans noose her courage and affection never waned until those arms were rudely thrust aside and their devoted owner dastardly repulsed  true to herself and to him she loved her father so long as there was anything parental in him which she might love and true to herself when he had left her nothing she might love she bowed her head and suffered him as he passed out of his life to pass out of her own     chapter xl  captain ichabod puts the case   in the river at bridgetown lay the good brig king and queen just arrived from jamaica on her deck was an impatient young gentleman leaning over the rail and watching the approach of a boat with two men rowing and a passenger in the stern  this impatient young man was dickory charter that morning arrived at bridgetown and not yet having been on shore he came for the purpose of settling some business affairs partly on account of miss kate bonnet and partly for his mother  as the boat came nearer dickory recognised one of the men who were rowing and hailed him  heigho tom hilyer he cried i am right glad to see you on this river again i want a boat to go to my mothers house know you of one at liberty  the man ceased rowing for a moment and then addressed the passenger in the stern who having heard what he had to say nodded briefly  well well dick charter cried out the man and have you come back as governor of the colony you look fine enough anyway but if you want a boat to go to your mothers old home you can have a seat in this one were going there and our passenger does not object  pull up here cried dickory and in a moment he had dropped into the bow of the boat which then proceeded on its way  the man in the stern was fairly young handsome sunburned and well dressed in a suit of black when dickory thanked him for allowing him to share his boat the passenger in the stern nodded his head with a jerk and an air which indicated that he took the incident as a matter of course not to be further mentioned or considered  the men who rowed the boat were good oarsmen but they were not thoroughly acquainted with the cove especially at low tide and presently they ran upon a sandbar then uprose the passenger in the stern and began to swear with an ease and facility which betokened long practice dickory did not swear but he knit his brows and berated himself for not having taken the direction of the course into his own hands he who knew the river and the cove so well the tide was rising but dickory was too impatient to sit still and wait until it should be high enough to float the boat that was his old home that little house at the head of the cove and he wanted to get there he wanted to see it part of the business which brought him to barbadoes concerned that little house with a sudden movement he made a dive at his shoes and stockings and speedily had them lying at the bottom of the boat then he stepped overboard and waded towards the shore in some of the deeper places he wetted the bottom of his breeches but he did not mind that the passenger in the stern sat down but he continued to swear  presently dickory was on the dry sand and running up to that cottage door a little back from the front of the house and in the shade there was a bench and on this bench there sat a girl reading she lifted her head in surprise as dickory approached for his bare feet had made no noise then she stood up quickly blushing  you she exclaimed  yes cried dickory and you look just the same as when you first put your head above the bushes and talked to me  except that i am more suitably clothed she said  and she was entirely right for her present dress was feminine and extremely becoming  dickory did not wish to say anything more on this subject and so he remarked i have just arrived at the town and i came directly here  lucilla blushed again  this is my old home added dickory  but you knew we were here she asked with a hesitating look of inquiry  oh yes said he i knew that the house had been let to your father  now she changed colour twicefirst red then white are you she said i mean  the other is she  i left her in jamaica said dickory but i am going to marry her  for a moment the rim of her hat got between the sun and her face and one could not decide very well whether her countenance was red or white  i am very glad to find you here said dickory and may i see your father and mother  yes said she but they are both in the field with my young sister but who is this man walking up the shore and is that the boat you came in  it is said dickory we stuck fast but i was in such a hurry that i waded ashore i dont know the man he had hired the boat and kindly took me in i was in such haste to get here  for a moment lucilla bent her eyes on the ground in such haste to get here she said to herself then she raised her head and exclaimed oh i know that man he is the pirate captain who captured the belinda which afterward brought us here and with both hands outstretched she ran to meet him  the face of captain ichabod glowed with irrepressible delight one might have thought he was about to embrace the young woman notwithstanding the presence of dickory and the two boatmen but he did everything he could do before witnesses to express his joy  dickory now stepped up to captain ichabod oh now i know you cried he and he held out his hand you were very kind indeed to my friends and they have spoken much about you this is my old home this is the house where i was born  yes yes indeed said captain ichabod a very good house bedad a very good house but hesitating a little and addressing lucilla you dont live here alone do you  the girl laughed  oh no she cried my father and mother will be here presently in fact i see them coming  thats very well said ichabod very well indeed its quite right that they should live with you i remember them now they were on the ship with you  oh yes said lucilla still laughing  quite right quite right said ichabod that was very right  i will go meet your father and mother and the dear little lena i remember them so well said dickory he started to run off in spite of his bare feet but he had gone but a little way when lucilla stopped him she looked up at him and this time her face was white  are you sure said she that everything is settled between you and that other girl  very sure said dickory looking kindly upon her and remembering how pretty she had looked when he first saw her face over the bushes  she did not say anything but turned and walked back to captain ichabod she found that tall gentleman somewhat agitated he seemed to have a great deal on his mind which he wished to say feeling at the same time that he ought to say everything first  thats your father and mother said he stopping to talk to the young man who was born here  yes she answered and they will be with us presently  very good very good thats quite right said captain ichabod hurriedly but before they come i want to saythat is i would like you to knowthat i have sold my ship i am not a pirate any longer i am a sugarplanter bedad beg your pardon that is i intend to be one you remember that you once talked to me about sugarplanting in barbadoes and so i am here i want to find a good sugar plantation to buy it and live on it i heard that you were stopping on this side of the river and so i came here  but there is no sugar plantation here said lucilla very demurely  oh no said ichabod oh no of course not but you are here and i wanted to find you a sugar plantation would be of no use without you  she looked at him still very demurely i dont quite understand you she said she turned her head a little and saw that her family and dickory were slowly moving towards the house she knew that with diffident persons no time should be lost for if interrupted it often happened that they did not begin again  then i suppose she said her face turned up towards him but her eyes cast down that you are going to say that you would like to marry me  of course of course exclaimed ichabod i thought you knew that that is what i came here for bedad  very well then said lucilla turning her eyes to the face of the man she had dreamed of in many happy nights no no she added quickly you must not kiss me they are all coming and there are the two boatmen  he did not kiss her but later he made up for the omission  the moment mrs mander saw captain ichabod and her daughter standing together she knew exactly what had happened she had noticed things on board the belinda she hurried up to lucilla and drew her aside  my dear she whispered with a frightened face you cannot marry a pirate you never never can  dear mother said lucilla he is not a pirate he has sold his ship and is going to be a sugarplanter  now they all came up and heard these words of lucilla  yes indeed said captain ichabod you may not suppose it but your daughter and i are about to marry and will plant sugar together now i want to buy a plantation where is that young man who was born here bedad  dickory advanced laughing here was a fine opportunity a miraculous opportunity of disposing of the bonnet estate which was part of the business which had brought him here so he told the beaming captain that he knew of a fine plantation up the river which he thought would suit him  very good said captain ichabod i have a boat here let us go and look at the place and if it suits us i will buy it bedad  so with mrs mander and her husband beside her and with lucilla and the captain by her the boat was rowed up the river with dickory and young lena in the bow  when the boat reached the bonnet estate it was run up on the shore near the shady spot where kate bonnet had once caught a fish then they all stepped out upon the little beach even the oarsmen made the boat fast and joined the party who started to walk up to the house suddenly captain ichabod stopped and said to mr mander i dont think i care to walk up that hill you know and if you and your good wife will look over that house and cast your eyes about the place i will buy it if you say so you know a good deal more about such things than i do bedad i suppose of course that will suit you he said to lucilla  it suited lucilla exactly they sat in the shade in the very place where kate had sat when she saw master newcombe crossing the bridge  a small boat came down the river rowed by a young man as he passed the old bonnet property he carelessly cast his eyes shoreward but his heart took no interest in what he saw there what did it matter to him if two lovers sat there in the shade close to the rivers brink his sad soul now took no interest in lovers he had just been up the river to arrange for the sale of his plantation to one of his neighbours he had decided to leave the island of barbadoes and to return to england  the house suited captain ichabod exactly when mrs mander told him about it and lucilla agreed with him because she was always accustomed to trust her mother in such things  so they all got into the boat and rowed back to dickorys old home and on the way captain ichabod told dickory that when they returned together to the town he would pay him for the plantation having brought specie sufficient for the purpose  it was a gay party in the boat as they rowed down the river it was a gay party at the house when they reached it and they would have all taken supper together had the manders been prepared for such hospitality but they were poor having taken the place upon a short lease and having had but few returns so far but they were all going to live at the old bonnet place and happiness shone over everything it was twilight and the two young men were about to walk down to the boat one of them promising to come again early in the morning when lucilla approached dickory  where are you going to live with that girl she asked in a low voice  in jamaica said he  i am glad of it she replied quite frankly                                       they were well content those jamaica people when ben greenway came to live with them it had been proposed at one time that he should go to his old bridgetown home and take charge of the place as he used to but the good scotchman demurred to this  i hae served ane master before he became a pirate he said an i dont want to try anither after he has finished bein ane if i serve ony mon let him be one wha has been righteous wha is righteous now an wha will continue in righteousness  then serve mr delaplaine said dickory                                       the manders soon removed to the little house where dickory was born the mansion of their daughter and her husband was a hospitable place and a lively but the life there was so wayward erratic and eccentric that it did not suit their sober lives and the education of their young daughter so they dwelt contentedly in the cottage at the head of the cove and there was much rowing up and down the river                                       it was upon a fine morning that the expirate ichabod thus addressed a citizen of the town  yes sir i know well who once lived in the house i own i knew the man myself i knew him at belize he was a dastardly knave and would have played false to the sun the moon and the stars had they shown him an opportunity bedad but i also knew his daughter she sailed on my ship for many days and her presence blessed the very boards she trod on she is a most noble lady and if you will not admit sir that her sweet spirit and pure soul have not banished from this earth every taint of wickedness left here by her father then sir bedad stand where you are and draw   the end
