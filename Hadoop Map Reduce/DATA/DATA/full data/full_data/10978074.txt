   pibroch of donald dhu    introduction    since there is room in this volume for more verses than colonel hays 1 i have added to them a few poems by sir walter scott the first written in 1811 at the time of the struggle with napoleon in the peninsula the second in 1815 after waterloo  thus there is over all this volume a thin haze of battle through which we see only the finer feelings and the nobler hopes of man  the day is to come when war shall be no more but wars have been and may again be necessary to bring on that day and it is of such war not untinged with the light of heaven that we have passing shadows in this little book  the vision of don roderick a poem by walter scott esq was printed at edinburgh by james ballantyne  co in 1811  they are the present representatives of that firm by whom it is here reprinted  it was originally inscribed to john whitmore esq and to the committee of subscribers for relief of the portuguese sufferers in which he presides as a poem composed for the benefit of the fund under their management  the legend of don roderick will be given in the next volume of our companion poets for robert southey founded upon it a romantic tale in verse which is one of the best tales of the kind in the english language  southeys tale of roderick himself was written at the same time when walter savage landor was writing a play upon the subject and scott was in the piece here reprinted making it the startingpoint of a vision of the war in the peninsula  the fatal palace of don roderick may have been a fable connected with the ruins of a roman amphitheatre  the fable as translated by scott from a spanish history of king roderick was this  one mile on the east side of the city of toledo among some rocks was situated an ancient tower of magnificent structure though much dilapidated by time which consumes all  four estadoes ie four times a mans height below it there was a cave with a very narrow entrance and a gate cut out of the solid rock lined with a strong covering of iron and fastened with many locks above the gate some greek letters are engraved which although abbreviated and of doubtful meaning were thus interpreted according to the exposition of learned men the king who opens this cave and discovers the wonders will discover both good and evil things  many kings desired to know the mystery of this tower and sought to find out the manner with much care but when they opened the gate such a tremendous noise arose in the cave that it appeared as if the earth was bursting many of those present sickened with fear and others lost their lives  in order to prevent such great perils as they supposed a dangerous enchantment was contained within they secured the gate with new locks concluding that though a king was destined to open it the fated time was not yet arrived  at last king don rodrigo led on by his evil fortune and unlucky destiny opened the tower and some bold attendants whom he had brought with him entered although agitated with fear  having proceeded a good way they fled back to the entrance terrified with a frightful vision which they had beheld  the king was greatly moved and ordered many torches so contrived that the tempest in the cave could not extinguish them to be lighted  then the king entered not without fear before all the others  he discovered by degrees a splendid hall apparently built in a very sumptuous manner in the middle stood a bronze statue of very ferocious appearance which held a battleaxe in its hands  with this he struck the floor violently giving it such heavy blows that the noise in the cave was occasioned by the motion of the air  the king greatly affrighted and astonished began to conjure this terrible vision promising that he would return without doing any injury in the cave after he had obtained sight of what was contained in it  the statue ceased to strike the floor and the king with his followers somewhat assured and recovering their courage proceeded into the hall and on the left of the statue they found this inscription on the wall unfortunate king thou hast entered here in an evil hour   on the right side of the wall the words were inscribed  by strange nations thou shalt be dispossessed and thy subjects foully degraded  on the shoulders of the statue other words were written which said i call upon the arabs  and upon his heart was written i do my office  at the entrance of the hall there was placed a round bowl from which a great noise like the fall of waters proceeded  they found no other thing in the halland when the king sorrowful and greatly affected had scarcely turned about to leave the cavern the statue again commenced its accustomed blows upon the floor  after they had mutually promised to conceal what they had seen they again closed the tower and blocked up the gate of the cavern with earth that no memory might remain in the world of such a portentous and evilboding prodigy  the ensuing midnight they heard great cries and clamour from the cave resounding like the noise of battle and the ground shaking with a tremendous roar the whole edifice of the old tower fell to the ground by which they were greatly affrighted the vision which they had beheld appearing to them as a dream  scotts poem on the field of waterloo was written to assist the waterloo subscription  h m  quid dignum memorare tuis hispania terris  vox humana valetclaudian    the vision of don roderick     preface   the following poem is founded upon a spanish tradition bearing in general that don roderick the last gothic king of spain when the invasion of the moors was depending had the temerity to descend into an ancient vault near toledo the opening of which had been denounced as fatal to the spanish monarchy  the legend adds that his rash curiosity was mortified by an emblematical representation of those saracens who in the year 714 defeated him in battle and reduced spain under their dominion  i have presumed to prolong the vision of the revolutions of spain down to the present eventful crisis of the peninsula and to divide it by a supposed change of scene into three periods  the first of these represents the invasion of the moors the defeat and death of roderick and closes with the peaceful occupation of the country by the victors  the second period embraces the state of the peninsula when the conquests of the spaniards and portuguese in the east and west indies had raised to the highest pitch the renown of their arms sullied however by superstition and cruelty  an allusion to the inhumanities of the inquisition terminates this picture  the last part of the poem opens with the state of spain previous to the unparalleled treachery of buonaparte gives a sketch of the usurpation attempted upon that unsuspicious and friendly kingdom and terminates with the arrival of the british succours  it may be further proper to mention that the object of the poem is less to commemorate or detail particular incidents than to exhibit a general and impressive picture of the several periods brought upon the stage  edinburgh june 24 1811   introduction   i   lives there a strain whose sounds of mounting fire

silverstudded belts their shoulders grace where ivory quivers ring in the broad falchions place  iv   in the light language of an idle court     they murmured at their masters long delay   and held

and shame the bosom wring     and guilt his secret burden cannot bear and conscience seeks in speech a respite from despair  vi   full on the prelates face and silver hair     the stream of failing light was feebly rolled   but rodericks visage though his head was bare     was shadowed by his hand and mantles fold   while of his hidden soul the sins he told     proud alarics descendant could not

and secret nook   then on an ancient gateway bent his look     and as the key the desperate king essayed   low muttered thunders the cathedral shook     and twice he stopped and twice new effort made till the huge bolts rolled back and the loud hinges brayed  xiii   long large and lofty was that vaulted hall     roof walls and floor were all of marble stone   of polished marble black as funeral pall     carved oer with signs and characters unknown   a paly light as of the dawning shone     through the sad bounds but whence they could not spy   for window to the upper air was none     yet by that light don roderick could descry wonders that neer till then were seen by mortal eye  xiv   grim sentinels against the upper wall     of molten bronze two statues held their place   massive their naked limbs their stature tall     their frowning foreheads golden circles grace   moulded they seemed for kings of giant race     that lived and sinned before the avenging flood   this grasped a scythe that rested on a mace     this spread his wings for flight that pondering stood each stubborn seemed and stern immutable of mood  xv   fixed was the righthand giants brazen look     upon his brothers glass of shifting sand   as if its ebb he measured by a book     whose iron volume loaded his huge hand   in which was wrote of many a fallen land     of empires lost and kings to exile driven   and oer that pair their names in scroll expand      lo destiny and time to whom by heaven the guidance of the earth is for a season given   xvi   even while they read the sandglass wastes away     and as the last and lagging grains did creep   that righthand giant gan his club upsway     as one that startles from a heavy sleep   full on the upper wall the maces sweep     at once descended with the force of thunder   and hurtling down at once in crumbled heap     the marble boundary was rent asunder and gave to rodericks view new sights of fear and wonder  xvii   for they might spy beyond that mighty breach     realms as of spain in visioned prospect laid   castles and towers in due proportion each     as by some skilful artists hand portrayed   here crossed by many a wild sierras shade     and boundless plains that tire the travellers eye   there rich with vineyard and with olive glade     or deepembrowned by forests huge and high or washed by mighty streams that slowly murmured by  xviii   and here as erst upon the antique stage     passed forth the band of masquers trimly led   in various forms and various equipage     while fitting strains the hearers fancy fed   so to sad rodericks eye in order spread     successive pageants filled that mystic scene   showing the fate of battles ere they bled     and issue of events that had not been and ever and anon strange sounds were heard between  xix   first shrilled an unrepeated female shriek      it seemed as if don roderick knew the call   for the bold blood was blanching in his cheek      then answered kettledrum and attabal   gongpeal and cymbalclank the ear appal     the tecbir warcry and the lelies yell   ring wildly dissonant along the hall     needs not to roderick their dread import tell  the moor he cried the moorring out the tocsin bell  xx   they come they come  i see the groaning lands     white with the turbans of each arab horde   swart zaarah joins her misbelieving bands     alla

closing on the plain  now god and saint iago strike for the good cause of spain  xxi   by heaven the moors prevail the christians yield     their coward leader gives for flight the sign   the sceptred craven mounts to quit the field      is not yon steed orelioyes tis mine   but never was she turned from battleline     lo where the recreant spurs oer stock and stone    curses pursue the slave and

kingly likeness tried   but the deep eddies whelmed both man and horse     swept like benighted peasant down the tide   and the proud moslemah spread far and wide     as numerous as their native locust band   berber and ismaels sons the spoils divide     with naked scimitars mete out the land and for the bondsmen base the freeborn natives brand  xxiii   then rose the grated harem to enclose     the loveliest maidens of the christian line   then menials to their misbelieving foes     castiles young nobles held forbidden wine   then too the holy cross salvations sign     by impious hands was from the altar thrown   and the deep aisles of the polluted shrine   echoed for holy hymn and organtone the santons frantic dance the fakirs gibbering moan  xxiv   how fares don roderickeen as one who spies     flames dart their glare oer midnights sable woof   and hears around his childrens piercing cries     and sees the pale assistants stand aloof   while cruel conscience brings him bitter proof     his folly or his crime have caused his grief   and while above him nods the crumbling roof     he curses earth and heavenhimself in chief  desperate of earthly aid despairing heavens relief  xxv   that scythearmed giant turned his fatal glass     and twilight on the landscape closed her wings   far to asturian hills the warsounds pass     and in their stead rebeck or timbrel rings   and to the sound the belldecked dancer springs     bazars resound as when their marts are met   in tourney light the moor his jerrid flings     and on the land as evening seemed to set the imaums chant was heard from mosque or minaret  xxvi   so passed that pageant  ere another came     the visionary scene was wrapped in smoke   whose sulphrous wreaths were crossed by sheets of flame     with every flash a bolt explosive broke   till roderick deemed the fiends had burst their yoke     and waved gainst heaven the infernal gonfalone   for war a new and dreadful language spoke     never by ancient warrior heard or known lightning and smoke her breath and thunder was her tone  xxvii   from the dim landscape rolled the clouds away      the christians have regained their heritage   before the cross has waned the crescents ray     and many a monastery decks the stage   and lofty church and lowbrowed hermitage     the land obeys a hermit and a knight    the genii those of spain for many an age     this clad in sackcloth that in armour bright and that was valour named this bigotry was hight  xxviii   valour was harnessed like a chief of old     armed at all points and prompt for knightly gest   his sword was tempered in the ebro cold     morenas eagle plume adorned his crest   the spoils of africs lion bound his breast     fierce he stepped forward and flung down his gage   as if of mortal kind to brave the best     him followed his companion dark and sage as he my master sung the dangerous archimage  xxix   haughty of heart and brow the warrior came     in look and language proud as proud might be   vaunting his lordship lineage fights and fame     yet was that barefoot monk more proud than he   and as the ivy climbs the tallest tree     so round the loftiest soul his toils he wound   and with his spells subdued the fierce and free     till ermined age and youth in arms renowned honouring his scourge and haircloth meekly kissed the ground  xxx   and thus it chanced that valour peerless knight     who neer to king or kaiser vailed his crest   victorious still in bullfeast or in fight     since first his limbs with mail he did invest   stooped ever to that anchorets behest     nor reasoned of the right nor of the wrong   but at his bidding laid the lance in rest     and wrought fell deeds the troubled world along for he was fierce as brave and pitiless as strong  xxxi   oft his proud galleys sought some newfound world     that latest sees the sun or first the morn   still at that wizards feet their spoils he hurled      ingots of ore from rich potosi borne   crowns by caciques aigrettes by omrahs worn     wrought of rare gems but broken rent and foul   idols of gold from heathen temples torn     bedabbled all with bloodwith grisly scowl the hermit marked the stains and smiled beneath his cowl  xxxii   then did he bless the offering and bade make     tribute to heaven of gratitude and praise   and at his word the choral hymns awake     and many a hand the silver censer sways   but with the incensebreath these censers raise     mix steams from corpses smouldering in the fire   the groans of prisoned victims mar the lays     and shrieks of agony confound the quire while mid the mingled sounds the darkened scenes expire  xxxiii   preluding light were strains of music heard     as once again revolved that measured sand   such sounds as when for silvan dance prepared     gay xeres summons forth her vintage band   when for the light bolero ready stand     the mozo blithe with gay muchacha met   he conscious of his broidered cap and band     she of her netted locks and light corsette each tiptoe perched to spring and shake the castanet  xxxiv   and well such strains the opening scene became     for valour had relaxed his ardent look   and at a ladys feet like lion tame     lay stretched full loath the weight of arms to brook   and softened bigotry upon his book     pattered a task of little good or ill   but the blithe peasant plied his pruninghook     whistled the muleteer oer vale and hill and rung from villagegreen the merry seguidille  xxxv   grey royalty grown impotent of toil     let the grave sceptre slip his lazy hold   and careless saw his rule become the spoil     of a loose female and her minion bold   but peace was on the cottage and the fold     from court intrigue from bickering faction far   beneath the chestnuttree loves tale was told     and to the tinkling of the light guitar sweet stooped the western sun sweet rose the evening star  xxxvi   as that seacloud in size like human hand     when first from carmel by the tishbite seen   came slowly overshadowing israels land     a while perchance bedecked with colours sheen   while yet the sunbeams on its skirts had been     limning with purple and with gold its shroud   till darker folds obscured the blue serene     and blotted heaven with one broad sable cloud then sheeted rain burst down and whirlwinds howled aloud  xxxvii   even so upon that peaceful scene was poured     like gathering clouds full many a foreign band   and he their leader wore in sheath his sword     and offered peaceful front and open hand   veiling the perjured treachery he planned     by friendships zeal and honours specious guise   until he won the passes of the land     then burst were honours oath and friendships ties he clutched his vulture grasp and called fair spain his prize  xxxviii   an iron crown his anxious forehead bore     and well such diadem his heart became   who neer his purpose for remorse gave oer     or checked his course for piety or shame   who trained a soldier deemed a soldiers fame     might flourish in the wreath of battles won   though neither truth nor honour decked his name     who placed by fortune on a monarchs throne recked not of monarchs faith or mercys kingly tone  xxxix   from a rude isle his ruder lineage came     the spark that from a suburbhovels hearth   ascending wraps some capital in flame     hath not a

bids its fame endure hath not a source more sullen stagnant and impure  xl   before that leader strode a shadowy form     her limbs like mist her torch like meteor showed   with which she beckoned him through fight and storm     and all he crushed that crossed his desperate road   nor thought nor feared nor looked on what he trode     realms could not glut his pride blood could not slake   so oft as eer she shook her torch abroad      it was ambition bade her terrors wake nor deigned she as of yore a milder form to take  xli   no longer now she spurned at mean revenge     or stayed her hand for conquered foemans moan   as when the fates of aged rome to change     by caesars side she crossed the rubicon   nor joyed she to bestow the spoils she won     as when the banded powers of greece were tasked   to war beneath the youth of macedon     no seemly veil her modern minion asked he saw her hideous face and loved the fiend unmasked  xlii   that prelate marked his marchon banners blazed     with battles won in many a distant land   on eaglestandards and on arms he gazed     and hopest thou then he said thy power shall stand   oh thou hast builded on the shifting sand     and thou hast tempered it with slaughters flood   and know fell scourge in the almightys hand     goremoistened trees shall perish in the bud and by a bloody death shall die the man of blood  xliii   the ruthless leader beckoned from his train     a wan fraternal shade and bade him kneel   and paled his temples with the crown of spain     while trumpets rang and heralds cried castile   not that he loved himnoin no mans weal     scarce in his own eer joyed that sullen heart   yet round that throne he bade his warriors wheel     that the poor puppet might perform his part and be a sceptred slave at his stern beck to start  xliv   but on the natives of that land misused     not long the silence of amazement hung   nor brooked they long their friendly faith abused     for with a common shriek the general tongue   exclaimed to armsand fast to arms they sprung     and valour woke that genius of the land   pleasure and ease and sloth aside he flung     as burst the awakening nazarite his band when gainst his treacherous foes he clenched his dreadful hand  xlv   that mimic monarch now cast anxious eye     upon the satraps that begirt him round   now doffed his royal robe in act to fly

romance of dunois   from the french   1815    the original of this little romance makes part of a manuscript collection of french songs probably compiled by some young officer which was found on the

style of composition to which it belongs  the translation is strictly literal  it was dunois the young and brave was bound for palestine but first he made his orisons before saint marys shrine and grant immortal queen of heaven was still the soldiers prayer that i may prove the bravest knight and love the fairest fair  his oath of honour on the shrine he graved it with his sword and followed to the holy land the banner of his lord where faithful to his noble vow his warcry filled the air be honoured aye the bravest knight beloved the fairest fair  they owed the conquest to his arm and then his liegelord said the heart that has for honour beat by bliss must be repaid  my daughter isabel and thou shall be a wedded pair for thou art bravest of the brave she fairest of the fair  and then they bound the holy knot before saint marys shrine that makes a paradise on earth if hearts and hands combine and every lord and lady bright that were in chapel there cried honoured be the bravest knight beloved the fairest fair    the troubadour   from the same collection   1815    glowing with love on fire for fame   a troubadour that hated sorrow beneath his ladys window came   and thus he sung his last goodmorrow my arm it is my countrys right   my heart is in my trueloves bower gaily for love and fame to fight   befits the gallant troubadour  and while he marched with helm on head   and harp in hand the descant rung as faithful to his favourite maid   the minstrelburden still he sung my arm it is my countrys right   my heart is in my ladys bower resolved for love and fame to fight   i come a gallant troubadour  even when the battleroar was deep   with dauntless heart he hewed his way mid splintering lance and falchionsweep   and still was heard his warriorlay my life it
