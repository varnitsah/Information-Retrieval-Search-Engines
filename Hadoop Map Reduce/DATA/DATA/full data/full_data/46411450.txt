cushing  coberwick  smith norwood mass usa     preface   the campaign of the jungle is a complete story in itself but forms the fifth volume of the old glory series a line of tales depicting life and adventure in our army and navy of today  the heroes of these various stories are the three russell brothers larry walter and ben in the first volume we told of larrys adventures while under dewey at manila in the second and fourth we followed ben as a young volunteer in cuba and during the opening campaign under otis in the philippines while in the third tale we saw what walter could do fighting in cuban waters  in the present volume the reader is asked to follow the fortunes of both larry and ben in two important expeditions of that gallant soldier general henry w lawton the first directed against santa cruz on the laguna de bay where the insurgents were left badly scattered and the second from manila to san isidro a winding advance of about one hundred and fifty miles through the jungle which took twenty days to complete and during which time twentytwo battles were fought and twentyeight towns were captured along with large quantities of army stores and the like this latter expedition was one of the most daring of its kind and could not have been pushed to success had not the man at its head been what he was a trained indian fighter of our own west and one whose nerve and courage were almost beyond comprehension small wonder it was that when later on general lawton was killed on the firing line general otis cabled great loss to us and to his country  as in the previous volumes of this series the author has endeavored to be as accurate historically as possible and for this reason has examined the reports of the officers high in command as well as listened to many tales related by the returning soldiers themselves it is therefore hoped that if any errors have crept in they may not be of sufficient magnitude to hurt the general usefulness of the work from an historical standpoint as a story of adventure the writer trusts it will find equal favor with those that have preceded it in the series  edward stratemeyer      newark n j     march 1 1900

                                              236   down went the sapling over the edge of the cliff               281     the campaign of the jungle     chapter i  dismaying news   how are you feeling today ben  fairly good larry if it wasnt for this awfully hot weather the wound wouldnt bother me at all the doctor says that if i continue to improve as i have i can rejoin my company by the middle of next week  you mustnt hurry matters you did enough fighting at caloocan malabon polo and here to last you for some time let the other fellows have a share of it and larry russell smiled grimly as he bent over his elder brother and grasped the hand that was thrust forward  i am willing the other fellows should have their share of the fighting larry but you must remember that now captain larchmore is dead and lieutenant ross is down with the fever there is nobody to command our company but meunless of course sergeant gilmore takes charge  then let gilmore play captain for a while while you take the rest you have so well earned why youve been working like a steamengine ever since you landed in luzon gilbert pennington says he never dreamed there was so much fight in you and predicts that youll come out a brigadier general by the time aguinaldo and his army are defeated  well i believe in pushing things responded ben russell smiling more broadly than ever as his mind wandered back to that fierce attack on malolos where he had received the bullet wound in the side if we can only keep the insurgents on the run well soon make them throw down their arms but tell me about yourself larry what have you been doing since you were up here last  oh ive been putting in most of my time on board the olympia as usual replied the young tar about all we are doing is to nose around any strange vessels that come into the harbor since the outbreak in manila last february the navy has had next to nothing to do and im thinking strongly of asking to be transferred to the marines at cavite or elsewhere  i dont blame you ben russell paused have you heard anything more about braxton bogg and that hundred and forty thousand dollars he said he had left hidden in benedicto lupezs house in manila  a shade of anxiety crossed larry russells face yes ive heard a good dealmore than i wanted to ben but i wasnt going to speak of it for fear of adding to your worry and making you feel worse  why larry you dont mean has braxton bogg escaped from jail and got hold of the money again  no braxton bogg is still in prison at manila although the buffalo bank officials are about to have him returned to the united states for trial but the money has disappeared the police authorities at manila went to benedicto lupezs house to find it locked up and deserted they broke in and made a search but they couldnt find a dollar either in spanish or american money although they did find braxton boggs valise and a dozen or more printed bands of the hearthstone saving institutionthe kind of bands they put around fivehundreddollar and onethousanddollar packages of bills  then this spaniard found where bogg had hidden the money and made off with it  that is the supposition and i reckon its about right too of course it may be possible that braxton bogg never left the stolen money in lupezs house although he swears he did he says lupez was an old friend of his and was going to have the bills changed into spanish money for him so that bogg could use the cash without being suspected of any wrongdoing  its too bad and just as we thought our fifteen or sixteen thousand dollars of the amount was safe i wonder what the bank people at home will say now  of course they wont like it they would rather have the money than their missing cashier and i would rather have the money toonot but that braxton bogg ought to be punished for his crimes  yes larry braxton bogg deserves all the law can give him for the depositors in the hearthstone saving institution were mostly poor hardworking persons and the wrecking of the bank meant untold hardships for them the wounded brother sighed deeply if that money isnt recovered well be as badly off as we were when we first came to manila he concluded  ben russell was the eldest of three brothers walter coming next and larry being the youngest they were orphans and at the death of their widowed mother had been left in the care of their uncle job dowling a miserly man whose chief aim in life had been to hoard money no matter at what cost so long as his method was within the limit of the law  the boys were all sturdy and had been used to a good home and job cowlings harsh and dictatorial manner cut them to the quick a clash between guardian and wards had resulted in the running away of the three youths and the guardian had tried in vain to bring them back larry had drifted to san francisco and shipped on a merchantman bound for china he had become a castaway and been picked up by the asiatic squadron of the united states navy this was just at the time of the outbreak of the war with spain and how gallantly the young tar served his country has already been told in detail in under dewey at manila  ben had found his way to new york and walter had drifted to boston after several adventures the war fever had caught both and ben had joined the army to become a young volunteer in cuba as already related in the volume of that name while walter had joined the armored cruiser brooklyn and participated in the destruction of the spanish fleet in santiago bay as told in fighting in cuban waters  while the three boys were away from home job dowling had overreached himself by trying to sell some of the russell heirlooms which it had been willed the lads should keep the heirlooms had been stolen by a sharper and it had cost the old man a neat sum of money to get them back the experience made him both a sadder and a wiser man and from that time on his manner changed and when the boys returned from the war they found that he had turned over a new leaf in the future he was perfectly willing that they should do fer themselves as he expressed it  after a brief stay in buffalo walter had left to rejoin the brooklyn which was bound for a cruise to jamaica and elsewhere at this time trouble began to break out between the united states troops in the philippines and the insurgents who had been fighting the nowconquered spaniards and it looked as if another fairsized war was at hand this being so ben lost no time in reënlisting in the army while larry hastened to join admiral deweys flagship olympia once more if theres to be any more fighting i want to be right in it was what the young tar said and ben agreed with him how they journeyed to manila by way of the mediterranean the suez canal and the indian ocean has already been related in under otis in the philippines ben was at this time second lieutenant of company d of his regiment with the two boys went gilbert pennington bens old friend of the rough riders who was now first sergeant of company b of the same regiment and half a dozen others who had fought with the young volunteer in cuba on arriving at manila larry found matters so far as it concerned his ship very quiet but ben was at once sent to the front and participated with much honor to himself in the campaign which led to the fall of malolos a city that was at that time the rebel capital as company d with ben at its head as acting captain had rushed down the main street of the place an insurgent sharpshooter had hit the young commander in the side and he had fallen to be picked up later and placed in the temporary hospital which was opened up in malolos as soon as it was made certain that the rebels had been thoroughly cleaned out fortunately for the young volunteer the wound though painful was not serious  of the fifteen thousand to twenty thousand dollars coming to the russell brothers more than threequarters had been invested by job dowling in the heathstone saving institution a buffalo bank that had promised the closeminded man a large rate of interest the cashier of this bank braxton bogg had absconded taking with him all the available cash which the institution possessed bogg had come to manila and there ben had fallen in with him several times and finally accomplished his arrest it was found that braxton bogg had very little money on his person and the guilty cashier finally admitted that he had left his booty at the house of one benedicto lupez a spaniard with whom he had boarded as all the spaniards in manila were being closely watched by the soldiers doing police duty in the disturbed city both ben and larry had supposed that there would be no further trouble in getting possession of the missing money but benedicto lupez had slipped away unperceived taking the stolen money with him and the russell inheritanceor at least the larger portion of itwas as far out of the reach of the boys as ever     chapter ii  something about the situation at malolos   do you know if the manila authorities have any idea where this benedicto lupez has gone to asked ben after partaking of some delicacies which larry had managed to obtain for him  they think he got on a small boat and went up the pasig river he is supposed to have a brother living in santa cruz on the laguna de bay this brother is said to be in thorough sympathy with the insurgents  in that case he is out of our reach for the present as the rebels so i understand have a pretty good force in and around santa cruz but if this lupez has the money i cant understand how he would join the rebels theyll try to get the cash from him if they need it  perhaps he is foolish enough to think that they will win out in this fight ben you know how hotheaded some of these people are they havent any idea of the real power of uncle sam i believe if they did know they would submit without another encounter  it would be best if they did larry for now that we are in this fight we are bound to make them yield once they throw down their arms i feel certain our country will do what is fair and honest by them  its the leaders who are urging the ignorant common people onive heard more than one of the officers say so the leaders are well educated and crafty and they can make the masses believe almost anything why just before i came away from manila i saw a dozen or more igorottes brought intall strapping fellows but as ignorant as so many children they seemed to be dazed when their wounds were cared for and they were offered food the interpreter said they thought they would be massacred on the spot by the bloodthirsty americanos and they had a lurking suspicion that they were being cared for just so they could be sold into slavery  at this juncture a tall thoroughly browned soldier came in wearing the uniform of a first lieutenant  well ben how is it today he said cheerily as he extended his hand and how are you larry and he likewise shook hands with the young tar  im hoping to get out soon gilbert answered ben but whats thisa lieutenants uniform  yes ive been promoted to first lieutenant of company b returned gilbert pennington i tell you we are all climbing up the ladder and larry must look to his laurels i understand you are to be made permanent captain of company d  but where is first lieutenant crunger of your company  disappeared and the young southerners face took on a sober look thats the only thing that mars my happiness over my promotion after the taking of malolos jack crunger disappeared utterly and we havent been able to find hide nor hair of him although half a dozen scouting parties have been sent out and the stream has been dragged in several places  perhaps he was taken prisoner suggested larry i heard some of the kansas and utah men were missing too  we are afraid he is a prisoner and if that is so aguinaldos men have probably taken him up to san fernando where the insurgents are setting up their new capital  and what is going on at the firing line asked ben eagerly are they following up the rebels retreat  im sorry to say no general macarthur made a reconnaissance in the direction of calumpit but it amounted to little  i understand that the charleston has sailed up the coast and is going to shell dagupan put in larry dagupan you know is the terminus of the railroad line  thats good came from the sick brother if we can get a footing in dagupan we can work the railroad territory from both ends but this was not to be as coming events speedily proved for the shelling of the city by the warship amounted to but little  gilbert pennington knew all about the braxton bogg affair and listened with interest to what larry had to relate  its too bad he declared id like to give you some hope boys but im afraid youll have to whistle for your fortune that spaniard will keep out of the reach of the americans and if the worst comes to the worst hell slip off to spain or south america you mark my words  larrys leave of absence was for fortyeight hours only and soon he was forced to bid his brother and his friend goodby now take good care of yourself ben he said on parting and do stay here until you are stronger remember that a wounded man cant stand this broiling sun half as well as one who isnt wounded and even the strongest of them are suffering awfully from the heat  ill make him stay put in gilbert with mock severity surgeon fallox wont give him clearance papers until i tell him for hes a great friend of mine  im going to have a word with stummer before i go added larry and hurried to the ward in which the sturdy german volunteer had been placed he found the member of bens company propped up on some grass pillows smoking his favorite brierroot pipe  sure an i vos glad to see you larry cried carl his round face broadening into a smile on beholding his visitor yah i vos doin putty goot und i peen out on der firin line next veek maype but say i vos sorry i peen shot town pefore we got to malolos i vos dink sure i help clean dose repels out  never mind you did your duty carl ive heard they are going to make you a corporal for your bravery  sure an thats right came in an irish voice behind the pair and dan casey another volunteer of bens company appeared its mesilf as has the honor av saying it first too carl you are to be first corporal carl wid meself doin juty as second corporal  the german volunteers face lit up for a second then fell suspiciously say dan vos dis a choke maype he said slowly  a joke is it burst out casey sure an do ye think id be afther playin a joke on a wounded man carl no its no joke were raised to the dignity av officers be the forchunes av war an the recommendations av our superior actin captain russell which same will soon be our captain be commission providence an the president willin  good for ben exclaimed larry you both deserve it and after a few words more he hurried off leaving the two old soldiers to congratulate themselves on their advancement and speculate upon how high they might rise in the service before the rebellion should close casey had his eye set on a captaincy but stummer said he would be quite content if any commissioned office came his way even if it was but a secondlieutenancy  malolos had been captured on friday march 31 1899 at a little after ten oclock in the morning although the fighting kept up until nearly nightfall as soon as the rebels were thoroughly cleaned out many of the soldiers were called upon to do duty as firemen for a large portion of the town was in flames while the fire was being put out other soldiers went about stopping the chinese from looting the deserted mansions the coolies were at first made prisoners and put under guard in the public park but later on they were released and set to work to clean the streets  as gilbert had said the days immediately following the fall of malolos were not of special activity the hard running fight along the railroad through caloocan polo and other places had all but exhausted the army under general macarthur and when the insurgents capital was taken it was felt that the soldiers had earned a wellneeded rest moreover many had been wounded and many more were down suffering from the heat and tropical fever and these had to be cared for in the temporary hospitals established at various points in the neighborhood in the meantime the railroad was repaired and malolos was made a new base for supplies there were several skirmishes in the neighborhood north and northeast of malolos and in these the rebels were compelled to fall back still further yet the outbreaks amounted to but little  in the meantime the philippine commission of the united states issued a proclamation translated into the spanish and tagalog languages calling upon the insurgents to throw down their arms and promising them good local government the immediate opening of schools and courts of law the building of railroads and a civil service administration in which the native should participate this proclamation was widely distributed yet it did little good for the common people of the islands were given to understand by their leaders that the americans did not mean what they said but had come to their country only to plunder them and would in the end treat them even worse than had the spaniards  it was no easy work to repair the railroad running from manila to malolos station which was some distance from the town proper all tools and equipments had to be brought up from manila and from cavite and soon the engineering corps found themselves harassed by some rebels in the vicinity of marilao and guiguinto at once general macarthur sent out a force to clear the ground and several sharp attacks ensued which resulted in the loss of twentythree killed and wounded on the american side and double that number to the enemy in the end the rebels fled to the mountains to the eastward and to calumpit on the north  we are going out tomorrow said gilbert as he came to see ben on the day following the engagements just mentioned general wheaton says he is going to drive the rebels straight into the mountainsand i reckon hell keep his word  ben was at once anxious to go along but this was not yet to be and he was forced to sit at a window of the hospital and see his regiment march by with colors flying gayly and all the boys eager for another contest the members of his own company gave him a cheer as they passed youll soon be with us again captain cried one we wont forget you hurrah and on they marched with a lieutenant from company a leading them and with gilbert and major morris and many old friends with the regiment ben watched them out of sight and heaved a long sigh over the fact that he was not of their number but there was still plenty of fighting in store for the young captain and many thrilling and bitter experiences in the bargain     chapter iii  an adventure on the pasig river   hurrah luke i reckon i am going to see a bit of fighting at last  it was larry who spoke as he rushed up to his old friend luke striker now one of the gun captains on board the olympia it was the day after the young tar had paid the visit to ben  fighting where demanded the yankee gunner do you mean to say as how the olympia is goin to do some scoutin alongshore lad  no the ship is going to remain right where she is but general lawton is going to take an expedition up the pasig river from san pedro macati to the laguna de bay and some of the sailors are going along to help manage the cascos and other boats i just applied for a place along with jack biddle and we both got in  and why cant i get in returned luke eagerly this here everlastin sitting still doin nuthin is jest akillin of me  you might apply although there are already more volunteers than they want answered larry he told his old friend how to make the necessary application and soon luke had joined the expedition and the three friends hastened ashore and on board a shallow river transport which was to take them and a number of others up to san pedro macati  the brief journey to the latternamed village was without incident here larry found assembled a body of about thirteen hundred soldiers infantry and cavalry and with them two hundred picked sharpshooters and two guns manned by members of the regular artillery owing to the sickness of the commanding general general lawton took personal charge of the expedition  no man was better fitted for fighting in the philippines than major general henry w lawton who had but lately arrived in the islands and who was destined to die the death of a hero upon the firing line of commanding appearance being six feet three inches in height and weighing over two hundred pounds he was a soldier by nature and a natural leader among leaders he had fought all through the great civil war with much credit to himself and it was he who during the great apache indian uprising followed the crafty geronimo through mountain and over desert for a distance of nearly fourteen hundred miles and at last caused him to surrender for this it is said the indians called him manwhogetsupinthenighttofight and they respected him as they respected few others  with the outbreak of the war with spain general lawton was in his element and when the army of occupation sailed for santiago he was with them and it was this same lawton who stormed el caney and captured it as related in a young volunteer in cuba when general shafter wanted to call lawton away from el caney after the troops had been fighting many hours lawton sent him word i cant stopive got to fight and went forward again and in less than an hour the spanish flag at the top of the hill was down and old glory had taken its place  general lawton was addressing several members of his staff when larry first saw him at san pedro macati he stood war map in hand in front of the river landing a conspicuous figure among the halfdozen that surrounded him  hes a fighteryou can see that whispered larry to luke who stood beside him just look at that squareset jaw he wont let up on the rebels an inch  jest the kind were awantin out here responded the yankee gunner the more they force the fightin the sooner the war will come to an end hes coming toward us he added as general lawton stepped from out of the circle around him  you are from the olympia i believe he said addressing luke  yes general replied the old gunner touching his forelock while larry also saluted we volunteered for this expedition  you look all right but general lawton turned to larry im afraid you are rather young for this sort of thing my lad he went on  i hope not sir cried larry quickly ive seen fighting before  he was in the thickest of it when we knocked out admiral montojo general interposed luke you can trust him to do his full share come what may  oh if he was in that fight i guess hell be all right responded general lawton with a grim sort of a smile and he turned away to overlook the shipping of some ammunition on one of the tinclad gunboats which was to form part of the expedition  the troops were speedily on the cascos which were to be towed by several steam launches and escorted by three tinclads although larry and his friends did not know it till several hours later the destination was santa cruz a pretty town situated on a slight hill overlooking the placid waters of the laguna de bay the generals plan was to reach the lake by nightfall and steal over the silent waters in the dark until the vicinity of santa cruz was gained in hopes that the garrison might be caught napping as it is called  for the time being the sailors were separated one from another each being put in charge of a casco the shallow rowboats being joined together in strings of four to six each and pulled along with many a jerk and twist by the puffing little launches which at times came almost to a standstill  we wont reach the lake by sunrise and i know it remarked one of the soldiers to larry who stood in the bow of the casco with an oar ready to do whatever seemed best for the craft weve a good many miles to go yet  at that instant the casco ahead ran aground in the shallow river and larry had all he could do to keep his craft from running into it as the two boats came stem to stern one of the soldiers in the craft ahead called out to those behind  say idaho do you know where we are bound  bound for santa cruz so i heard our captain remark answered one of the soldiers in larrys boat got any tobacco north dakota  nary a pipeful wuss luck was the response and then the line straightened out as the casco ahead cleared herself from the mud and the two boats moved apart once more  are we really going to santa cruz questioned larry as soon as he got the chance i thought we were bound for the north shore of the lake  i can only tell you what i heard the captain say answered the soldier with a shrug of his shoulder general lawton aint blowing his plans through a trumpet you know  i hope we do go to santa cruz mused larry as he thought of what had been said of benedicto lupez and if we take the town i hope we take that rascal too  the best laid plans are often upset by incidents trifling in themselves it was the dry season of the year and the pasig river usually broad and turbulent was now nothing better than a muddy shallow creek winding and treacherous to the last degree as night came on the expedition found itself still in the stream and many miles from the lake and here cascos and launches ran aground and a general mixup ensued  hullo what have we run up against now growled the lieutenant in charge of the soldiers in larrys boat cant you keep out of the mud jackie  im doing my best panted the youth as he shoved off for at least the fourth time with the lines forward and aft pulling one way and another its rather difficult to keep to the channel especially in the dark  oh youre only a boy and dont understand the trick growled the lieutenant who was in a bad humor generally i dont see why they let you come along  our boat is doing about as well as any of them answered larry bound to defend himself two boats are aground to our left and three behind us  see here dont talk back to me you tend to business and keep us out of the mud roared the lieutenant in worse humor than before  an angry retort arose to larrys lips but he checked it a quarrel wont do any good he thought but what a bulldog that fellow isas bad as quartermaster yarrow who caused me so much trouble on the trip out here  on went the cascos once more around a tortuous bend and past a bank fringed with bushes and reeds the mosquitoes were numerous likewise the flies and everybody began to wish the journey at an end  wed better make a charge on the insects growled one old soldier they are worse nor the rebels ten times over and just then many were inclined to agree with him tobacco was scarce or smoking would have been far more plentiful than it was  midnight came and went and found the expedition still some distance from the lake a few of the soldiers were sleeping but the majority remained wide awake fighting off the marshland pests and aiding in keeping the cascos and launches from running high and dry in the mud had it not been for the tinclads it is doubtful if the laguna de bay would have been gained at all by more than half of the craft composing the turnout but they came to the rescue time and again and so the expedition crawled along until at four oclock the clear sheet of water beyond was sighted  they were making the last turn before the lake was gained when the casco ahead of that steered by larry went aground once more dragging larrys craft behind it the youth did all he could to back water but in vain and once more they heard the unwelcome slish of mud under their bottom  now youve done it again howled the lieutenant leaping up from his seat you numskull give me that oar and he tried to wrench the blade from larrys hand  it was not my fault began the youth when the officer forced the blade from him and hurled him back on one of the soldiers then the lieutenant tried to do some poling for himself and got the oar stuck so tightly in the mud that he could not loosen it  burning with indignation larry felt himself go down in a heap and at once tried to get up again at the same time the soldier beneath him gave him a shove which pitched him several feet forward he landed up against the lieutenant with considerable force and in a twinkle the officer went overboard head first into the water and mud where the casco had stuck fast     chapter iv  the gap in the firing line   hullo lieutenant horitz has fallen overboard  pull him out of the mud before he smothers or drowns  such were some of the cries which arose among the soldiers that filled the casco then larry was shoved back and two of them caught hold of the legs of the man who had disappeared as for an instant they showed themselves there was a long pull a strong pull and a pull altogether and up came the lieutenant minus his hat and with his face and neck well plastered with the black ooze of the river bottom  for a moment after he sank on the seat that was vacated to receive him he could not speak one of the soldiers handed him a handkerchief and with this he proceeded to clear his eyes and ears at the same time puffing vainly to get back his breath at last he cleared his throat and glared angrily at larry  youyou young whelp he fumed youyou knocked me over on purpose  no sir i did not answered the young tar promptly one of the soldiers shoved me up against you  i dont believe you roared the unreasonable one as he continued to clean himself off you shall pay dearly for this assault mark me  didnt you shove me asked larry appealing to one of the soldiers  i shoved you off of my neck yes answered the enlisted man but i didnt throw you into lieutenant horitz you did that yourself  of course he did it himself said another soldier who did not wish to see his tentmate get into trouble you had it in for the lieutenant ever since he first spoke to you  i shall report you the first chance i get growled lieutenant horitz i reckon youll find that general lawton wont allow any such disgraceful conduct while he is in command  whats the row back there came out of the darkness hurry up and get afloat or well cut the rope and leave you to shift for yourselves  our officer was just shoved overboard answered snapper the soldier who had given larry the unlucky push and weve lost our oar  no i have the oar put in larry making a clutch into the water for the article just as it was about to float out of reach he leaped into the bow once more and began to work vigorously and in a few seconds they were again afloat  fortunately for the lieutenant the night was warm so he suffered no inconvenience so far as his wet clothing was concerned but it was no mean task to clean both himself and his uniform and what to do for another hat he did not know he would have taken larrys headgear had that article been anyway suitable but it was not  it must be confessed that larry felt thoroughly ill at ease that there was trouble ahead went without saying and he half wished himself safe back on the olympia hell make out the worst case he can against me he thought and his men will back him up in all he says yet he felt that he was guilty of no intentional wrongdoing and resolved to stand up for himself to the best of his ability  the lieutenant had learned one lessonthat he knew no more about handling the casco than did larry if as much and consequently he offered no more suggestions as to how to run the craft but he kept muttering under his breath at the youth and larry felt that he was aching to get square  it was early dawn when the casco turned into the lake proper as the sun came up it shed its light on one of the prettiest sheets of water larry had ever beheld the lake was as smooth as a millpond and surrounded with long stretches of marshland and heavy thickets of tropical growth fish were plentiful as could be seen by gazing into the clear depths below and overhead circled innumerable birds villages dotted the lake shore at various points but these the expedition gave a wide berth setting out directly for santa cruz still several miles distant behind the hill previously mentioned  if it had been general lawtons intention to attack the town from in front in the dark that plan had now to be changed and the expedition turned toward shore at a point at least three miles from the town proper  but even here the rebels could be seen to be on the alert and a rapidfiring gun was put into action and directed along the lake front the gun was manned by some men from the napadan and did such wonderful execution that soon the insurgent sentries were seen to be fleeing toward the town at utmost speed then a small detachment from some brush also retreated and the coast was clear  it was no easy matter to land as the water here was shallow and the cascos had to be poled along over the soft mud the sharpshooters were the first ashore and they soon cleared a spot for the others but a few of the rebels were game and as a result one man was wounded although not seriously the cavalry remained on the boats to land closer to the hill later on  the landing had consumed much valuable time and it was now after noon a hasty meal was had and then the column moved off spreading out in fan shape as it advanced the sharpshooters to the front and the rear and a number of special scouts on the alert to give the first warning of danger soon the scouts in front came back with the news that the insurgents were forming in front of our troops and that santa cruz and its garrison seemed thoroughly aroused to the danger which threatened  forward boys was the cry the more time we give them the better they will be prepared to meet us forward without delay and the boys went forward with a wild hurrah for everything promised well and they were much pleased to have general lawton lead them even though they had no fault to find with their other commanders  the first skirmish began on the extreme right some rebels had found their way to a hill behind the town and they began the attack from a patch of wild plantains thickly interlaced with tropical vines up the hill after them dashed the right wing and the sharp rattle of musketry resounded upon both sides for the best part of half an hour then the rebels broke and ran and in their eagerness our troops followed them until a point less than two miles from santa cruz was gained here the insurgents scattered and could not be rounded up and the right wing fell back to unite with the main body of the expedition but the woods were thick the ground new to the americans and in the gathering darkness it was several hours before the firing line was compact once more then the expedition rested for the night  larry had landed with the soldiers and as the other cascos came up he was speedily joined by luke striker and jack biddle  i wonder what part we air to take in this comin mixup queried luke  like as not they will leave us here to mind the boats replied larry i can tell you that i am rather sorry i came along he added soberly  sorry ejaculated jack biddle surely larry ye aint afraid  no im not afraid interrupted the youth and then he told of the scene in the casco and of what lieutenant horitz had said when he had finished jack cut a wry face and luke uttered a low whistle  youve run up agin a rock fer sartin larry remarked luke i reckon he can make things look putty bad for ye if hes of a mind to do it  keep quiet an say nuthin an he may forgit all about it was jack biddles advice  the boats having been cared for the sailors followed the soldiers through the field and into the woods all told there were twentyfive jackies and by common consent they formed themselves into a company of their own with a petty officer named gordell at their head gordell went to general lawton for directions and was told to follow the volunteers until given further orders each sailor was armed with a pistol and a ships cutlass  the march was a hot one but larry was now getting accustomed to the tropics and hardly minded this the little company advanced with caution nobody desiring to run into an ambush soon the firing on the right reached their ears and they knew that some sort of an engagement was on then came a halt and presently the darkness of night fell over them and they went into camp beside a tiny watercourse flowing into a goodsized stream which separated the expedition from the outskirts of santa cruz  supper disposed of larry and luke striker took a stroll forward to find out what the firing line was really doing and if the insurgents were in front in force we may have a bigger fight on hand nor any of us expect suggested the old yankee gunner  you can trust general lawton not to run his head into the lions mouth returned larry a soldier who has whipped the apache indians isnt going to suffer any surprise at the hands of these tagals no matter how wily they are  dont be too sure o thet larry the best on us make mistakes sometimes answered the yankee with a grave shake of his head but general lawton made no mistake as we shall speedily see  as has been said the right wing had become detached from the main body of the expedition during the fight on the hill back of santa cruz the firing line of this wing had not yet united with the centre consequently there was a gap of over a quarter of a mile in the front had the tagalogs known of this they might have divided the expedition and surrounded the right wing completely but they did not know so the temporary separation did no damage to the soldiers but that gap brought a good bit of trouble to larry and his friend  on and on went the pair down a narrow road lined on either side with palms and plantains and sweetsmelling shrubs from the hollows the frogs croaked dismally and here and there a night bird uttered its lonely cry but otherwise all was silent  humph theyve pushed the firing line ahead further than i thought remarked luke after half a mile had been covered heres a small river do ye reckon as how they went over thet lad  it must be so answered the boy certainly we havent been challenged  crossing the rude bridge they found that the road made a sharp turn to the southward beyond was a nipa hut back of which burnt a small campfire both hut and fire seemed deserted  they have cleaned the rebels out from there said larry come ahead and they continued on their way little dreaming of the trap into which they were walking  the nipa hut passed they came to a tall fence built of bamboo stalks sharpened at the tops and bound with native ropevine farther on still were a dozen shelters and here could be seen several women and children sitting in the doorways  perhaps they can give us some information said larry as they approached the natives as soon as they saw the americans the children shrieked dismally and rushed out of sight but the women held their ground feeling that they would not be molested  see anything of our soldiers demanded luke of the women but one and all shook their heads no englees talk mumbled one meaning they did not understand or speak our tongue  the natives manner made larry suspicious and he glanced around hurriedly as he did so there was a click of a trigger from behind the bamboo fence  americanos surrender came in bad english from back of the fence surrender quick or we shoot both dead on the spot     chapter v  an encounter at the river   to say that both larry and his old friend were surprised at the sudden demand which had been made upon them would be to put the truth very mildly they had been of the firm belief that the insurgents had retreated and to find themselves in a reglar hornets nest as luke afterward expressed it dumfounded them  do you surrender or not came the words after an awkward pause  it was dark about the huts yet not so dim but that they could see the barrels of several mauser rifles thrust toward them the sight made larry shiver for he had never before met the rebel soldiers at such close quarters  were in a box muttered luke somethin wrong somewharour soldiers didnt come this way ye kin reckon on thet  i move we run for it whispered larry if they take us prisoners he did not finish but his silence was more impressive than mere words would have been he had heard many stories of terrible cruelty practised by the insurgents on their prisoners and whether these tales were true or not they had had their full effect on both him and his shipmates  where are ye goin to run to lad we dont want to run an be shot down in cold blood  get in front of me and take to the woods opposite luke was the hurried reply here goes i dont think theyll fire now  as larry concluded he sprang to the side of one of the native women standing nearest to him before the woman could resist he had her in his arms behind him and was running off as speedily as the weight of his living load permitted seeing this luke scuttled off before and away they went for the woods not twenty yards distant  a howl arose on the night air and one gun went off but the bullet did no damage then the leader of the rebels was heard calling to his men not to fire for fear of killing the woman who chanced by good luck to be a close relative for the soldiers behind the bamboo fence were part of a home guard brought out that very afternoon to defend the road and santa cruz  the woman on larrys back shrieked in terror and clawed at his neck and hair causing him considerable pain but he held his burden tight until the shelter of the trees was gained when he let her slip to the ground and darted after luke who was running with all the speed of his lanky limbs  it was pitch dark in the jungle and the pair had not advanced more than a hundred yards when they found themselves going down into a hollow which both felt must lead to a dangerous swamp or morass for the island of luzon is full of such feverbreeding places  go slow lad whispered luke as he caught larry by the hand we dont want to land out o the fryinpan into the fire  they both became silent and listened attentively at a distance they heard the insurgents coming on slowly and cautiously spreading out as they advanced probably they knew the topography of the country and meant to surround the hollow completely  they are coming thats sure whispered larry and clutched his pistol i wonder if we cant get away from them by climbing a tree  we canif they aint afollowin the trail putty close answered his companion  they began to search around for a tree and in doing so came to several large rocks much overgrown with trailing vines there was an opening between two of the rocks and luke slipped into this hauling larry after him  jest as good as a tree an mebbe better he whispered as he rearranged the vines over the opening  the hidingplace was not a large one and larry felt very much like a sardine in a box as he crouched close to his yankee friend the vines covered the opening completely yet they remained on guard each with his finger on the trigger of his weapon resolved if the worst came to the worst to fight the best they knew how before surrendering  the filipinos were evidently puzzled for they had come to a halt and made not the slightest noise possibly they were listening for some sound from those they were pursuing but if so none came for luke clapped his hand warningly over larrys mouth and the youth understood and remained as motionless as a statue  five minutes went byto the boy they seemed an ageand then the rebels came on again halting every few steps to make sure of their ground three passed close to the rocks so close in fact that larry and luke could have shot them down without trouble but this would have given the alarm to the entire party and neither the boy nor the man wanted to shed blood unless it became absolutely necessary  at last the filipinos had left the rocks behind and were circling around the swamp at the bottom of the hollow now is the time to give em the slip whispered luke and crawled once more into the open larry followed and both hurried away from the vicinity with all possible speed it was the last seen or heard of the party who had so unexpectedly blockaded their progress on the highway  the jungle at the top of the hill was as dense as that below and the pair had not proceeded far before they found themselves in a veritable tangle of bushes and vines the bushes were of the thorny kind peculiar to this locality and more than once larry found himself caught and held as if in a vice  my clothing will be in tatters if this keeps on he panted as he cut himself loose with difficulty did you ever see such a thicket  we missed it when we started out tonight returned luke gravely weve gone astray o the firm line and everything else to my way o lookin at it  bad as was their situation they felt it would be worse with the coming of daylight we must get out of the enemys territory before the sun rises said larry if we dont well have no show at all  but getting out was not easy indeed the farther they advanced the more difficult did it seem to become until both came to the conclusion that they had missed their bearings entirely and were lost and cant even see the stars to read em groaned luke larry we might as well make the best of it and wait for daylight  but the youth demurred and insisted on going ahead were bound to strike something soon he said and did immediately afterward it was a log lying on the edge of an incline and down he pitched and log and lad rolled over and over with luke following to bring up with a loud splash in the river below  the force of their fall took them under the surface of the stream and in the struggle to save themselves both lost their cutlasses but as old readers know each could swim well and they speedily came up and struck out for the most available landingplace which was on the opposite bank  alto came the sudden cry in spanish halt and now a sentry appeared from behind a pile of cordwood lying but a short distance away  illustration alto came the sudden crypage 47  discovered again muttered luke and felt for his pistol soaked he muttered in disgust  the cry of the rebel on guard had given the alarm to several others and in a twinkling larry and the old yankee tar found themselves confronted by an even more determined crowd than that encountered on the road with the water behind them escape was out of the question for a jump back into the river would have courted a fire which must have resulted in death  americanos muttered one of the rebels drawing closer and sailors not soldiers he added in his native tongue where did you come from  larry and luke shook their heads talk united states and well speak to you said the old sailor  you gif up demanded an under officer as he pushed his way forward with his pistol covering larrys heart  aint nuthin else to do i reckon replied luke before larry could answer he was afraid the boy might be rash and try running away again  throw down de pistoles den muttered the tagal with an ugly frown  down went the weapons on the ground and then two of the rebels advanced to search them they found nothing of special value excepting the pairs jackknives and these were confiscated and turned over to the officer in command  the prisoners were then told to march up the river shore to a road leading into santa cruz with their hands bound tightly behind them they were placed in charge of a detail of four filipinos who were instructed to take them without delay before the general in charge of the citys defences  they may hold information of importance said the under officer do not delay a minute and off went the crowd the soldiers prodding the prisoners with their bayonets whenever larry and luke did not walk fast enough to suit them  the course taken was through a narrow and exceedingly dirty street it was after midnight yet the expected attack of the americans had kept all the inhabitants awake the prisoners were jeered at repeatedly and at one point were covered with a shower of mud and stale vegetables the onslaught might have been more serious had not the soldiers interfered  get back you dogs shouted the leader a little tagal scarcely five feet in height but with an air of magnificent importance these men are to go before the general and at once and much abashed the natives fell back and the prisoners were molested no further  it would naturally be supposed that the general in command would be found at the front at such a time when an attack on the city was but a matter of a few hours instead however general bamodo was found at one of the government buildings calmly smoking a cigar and conversing with several native business men  spies eh he queried when the guard had told him about the prisoners bring them in immediately  larry and luke were told to enter the room and did so their still wet clothing forming little puddles at their feet the guards stood beside and behind them general bamodo eyed them critically he spoke no english and so called in an interpreter  where are you from demanded the interpreter presently after a few words with his superior  we are from the warship olympia answered luke briefly  you were sent here by general otis as spies not so  no sir we are jest plain everyday sailors  then what brought you here demanded the interpreter after translating their words to general bamodo  we missed our way on the road put in larry before luke could answer he thought it best not to say anything about accompanying general lawtons expedition  you must have missed it very much general bamodo says growled the interpreter after another consultation with his superior santa cruz is a good many miles from manila harbor  to this larry remained silent and another talk in spanish followed then a sudden shot from a distance caused general bamodo to leap to his feet and dash down his cigar  take them to the prisoni will examine them later on he said in spanish and hurried away  a few minutes later larry and his yankee friend were marched off this time to a stone building several squares away here they were taken inside thrust into a cell the ironbarred door was locked upon them and they were left to their fate     chapter vi  in which luke striker is wounded   the plan to surprise santa cruz had failed yet general lawtons command was just as eager as ever to press forward and do battle with the native garrison of which the town on the laguna de bay boasted it was thought the filipino command could not be a strong one and even if it had been the americans would have gone ahead just the same so accustomed were they to victory over their misguided foes  it was arranged that the centre and left wing of the infantry should move directly upon the town while the right wing should swing around to cut off the filipinos retreat should they start such a movement in the meantime protected by a cross fire from the tinclads laguna and oeste the cavalry landed on the hill overlooking the bay and began to do battle with the enemys force in that territory cutting its way over field and brush to the left wing as it swung closer to the river already mentioned several times the cavalry developed a strong resistance which lasted for over an hour but in the end the filipinos were glad enough to fall back into the town proper  out on the main road leading to the principal bridge over the river the sun was boiling hot and many a soldier felt more like seeking shelter and resting than like pushing forward with his heavy gun and other equipments but general lawton was here and there encouraging every one and they pushed on until a sharp fire between the enemy and the advance guard told that a running fight and perhaps a regular battle would soon be at hand  at them my men cried the various commanders theyll run no doubt of it they havent stood up against us yet and away went the long skirmishing line and soon there was a steady crack and pop of guns and pistols as the americans pushed on catching many a poor filipino who was too late in either running or throwing down his arms a number surrendered and these were promptly sent to the rear  presently the river was gained and here the americans came to an unexpected halt there was a long bridge to cross and beyond was a barricade of stone and wood were the insurgents massed behind that barricade if they were to cross the bridge in column of fours or otherwise would mean a terrible slaughter  here goes sang out one petty officer and made a dash forward which was as reckless as it was daring as he moved along the bridge several held their breath expecting to see him go down at any instant but then came a rush of first half a dozen then a score and then whole companies and it was speedily seen that the barricade was practically deserted the insurgents were hurrying into the town as hard as they could with uncle sams men after them both sides keeping up a steady firing as they ran  in the meantime soaked to the skin and utterly miserable over their capture larry and his yankee friend had been thrust into the prison cell and left to themselves after the door was locked and the jailer walked away the youth uttered a longdrawn sigh  luke were in a pickle this trip he groaned what do you suppose they will do with us  heaven alone knows my lad responded the old tar bein as how they aint cannibals i dont reckon theyll eat us up and he smiled grimly  they think we are spies  thets so  do you know that they shoot spiesand do it in short order too  and why shouldnt i know it larry ive heard tell on it often enough but they have got to prove we air spies first aint they  theyll do what they please i believe half of these filipinos think the americans are nothing but cutthroats they cant conceive that we should want to come here and govern them for their own good  because they would rather govern themselves even if they made a mess of it than be under anybodys thumb nail larry howsomever thet aint the pint jest now the pint is kin we git out o here before they settle to do wuss with us  get out you mean break jail  exactly we dont want to stay here if we kin git out do we  to be sure not larry leaped up from the bench upon which he had been resting and ran to the door at this luke smiled glumly and shook his head  ye wont go it thet way ladthe guard locked it i seen him do itand the lock is a strong one too  luke was right as a brief examination proved then the boy turned to the window an affair less than a foot square having over it several iron bars set firmly into the stones no thoroughfare there was his comment  the two next examined the floor to find it of brick and as solid as the walls only the ceilin left now said luke i reckon we might as well give it up even if we do git out moren likely a guard outside will shoot us down  but larry was determined to test the ceiling which was but a couple of feet over their heads so he had his companion hold him for that purpose  there is a loose board up there he cried as he was feeling his way along hold me a little higher luke and perhaps i can shove it up  the old sailor did as requested and with a strong push larry shifted one end of the plank above so that it left an opening ten inches wide and several feet long catching a good hold he pulled himself to the apartment above to find it stored with boxes and barrels containing old military uniforms and other army equipments relics of spanish rule  any way out up thar queried luke if there is we dont want to waste any time ye know  ill tell you in a minute replied larry in a low voice and ran first to one end window of the storeroom and then the other in front was the street fast filling with soldiers in the rear was a stable which just now seemed deserted the several windows of the storeroom were all barred but here the bars were screwed fast to wood instead of being set in stone  i think there is a chance here said the boy coming back to the opening here give me your hand and ill help you up and he bent down and soon luke stood beside him  think we can git out thet way eh said the yankee tar surveying the prospect in the rear well i reckon its worth workin for larry but the drop from the window even if we pull away the bars  here is a ropewe can use that answered the boy pointing out the article around several small boxes while luke pried away the bars of one of the rear windows he possessed himself of the rope and tied it fast to a bar which was not disturbed as soon as the opening was sufficiently large to admit of the passage of each ones body luke swung himself over the windowsill  come on he cried softly and slipped from view never had he gone down a ships rope quicker and never had larry followed his friend with such alacrity both felt that life or death depended upon the rapidity of their movements  the ground was hardly touched by luke when a filipino boy appeared at the entrance to the stable for an instant the youth stared in openedmouthed astonishment then he uttered a yell that would have done credit to an indian on the warpath  the jigs up cried the yankee tar come larry our legs have got to save us if were to be saved at all  he leaped across the yard and for the corner of the stable where he collided with a tagal soldier who was coming forward to learn what the yelling meant down went both the sailor and the guard but the rebel got the worse of it for he lay half stunned while luke was up in a trice as the soldier fell his gun flew from his hands and larry tarried just long enough to pick the weapon up  behind the stable was a narrow winding street lined on either side with huts and other native dwellings with here and there a barnlike warehouse into this street darted our two friends and there paused not knowing whether to move toward the wharves or in the opposite direction  look out suddenly yelled larry and dropped flat followed by the yankee tar a sharp report rang out and a bullet whistled over their heads coming from the prison yard on the instant larry fired in return and the prison guard disappeared as if by magic long afterward larry learned that he had hit the tagal in the arm  there was now a general alarm throughout the prison and the two escaped prisoners felt that any other locality would be better for them than the one they now occupied let us try to find our soldiers said luke and once again they started to run this time up the road where far away they could make out a forest of some sort then came a second report and luke striker staggered back hit in the shoulder  luke luke you are struck gasped larry his heart seemed to leap into his throat what if his dearest friend had been mortally wounded  iireckon itit aint much came with a shiver the sailor straightened himself up and started to run again they are after us hotlike aint they  a turn in the road soon took them out of sight of the prison and they breathed a bit more freely but the strain was beginning to tell upon luke and watching him larry saw that he was growing deathly pale  you cant keep this up luke he said and put out his arm to aid his friend as he did so the yankee tar gave a short groan threw up both hands and then sank down in a heap at the boys feet     chapter vii  the retreat to the ricehouse   larry was greatly alarmed not knowing but that his companion was about to die on his hands quickly he knelt at the yankees side to learn that luke had fainted away from loss of blood the shoulder of his shirt and jacket were saturated through and through  what shall i do the boy asked himself and gazed hurriedly at the surroundings to one side of the road were several nipa huts to the other a long rambling warehouse the doorways of all the buildings stood open and no one seemed to be in sight  as quickly as he could the youth took up his friend and staggered with his heavy burden to the warehouse which was about half filled with rice entering the structure he passed to a small apartment somewhat in the rear here there was a quantity of old sacking in a heap and upon this rude couch larry placed the unconscious form  the boy had been taught on shipboard just what to do in case of such an emergency and now he worked as he never had before for luke was very dear to him and the thought that his friend might die was horrible to contemplate he prayed to heaven that the old gunners life might be spared to him  the wound was an ugly one yet even to larrys inexperienced eye it did not look as if it could be fatal and the boy breathed a long sigh of relief as he bound it up then he went in search of water and finding a well back of the warehouse brought a bucketful in and began to bathe luke soon the sufferer stirred and opened his honest eyes wonderingly  whyerhows this he stammered did ioh i remember now and he sank back again  keep quiet whispered the boy he had heard voices coming toward the warehouse if you make a sound it may be all up with both of us  the old tar breathed heavily and nodded throwing some sacking over the prostrate form larry slipped back into the main apartment of the warehouse he still held the gun but it was empty and could be used only as a club  two men were approaching the warehouse both tall slim and evidently of spanish extraction they were talking loudly and excitedly to one another but as larry understood but few words of spanish what they were saying was lost upon the boy  i dont believe they are after us thought the lad when the strangers came to a halt just outside the warehouse as they did so a long volley of rifle shots came from a distance followed by another and then another the shooting came from the centre of the town and made larrys heart beat fast our soldiers must be coming in he thought oh i hope they make the town ours  the shots appeared to disturb the two spaniards greatly for both clutched each other by the arm and looked thoroughly frightened  presently an old woman came running out of one of the huts she yelled at the two spaniards in her own tongue and pointed at the warehouse evidently she had seen larry and luke but had been afraid to expose herself  the strangers listened to the old woman with interest then began to talk to each other perhaps we can get some information josé said one in spanish  perhaps we shall get a bullet answered his companion grimly nevertheless he consented to enter the building and both passed through the great doorway of the warehouse  hardly knowing how to receive the newcomers larry stepped for a moment behind a bin of rice but then as the pair moved toward where luke lay he raised his gun threateningly  halt he called as sternly as he could halt or i shall fire  we are betrayed roared one of the spaniards in his native tongue no shoot no shoot he added in broken english we mean you no harm  up with your hands then went on larry resolved to make the most of the situation even though the gun was empty and four hands went promptly into the air for the two men before him were as cowardly as they were unprincipled  there was an awkward silence for several seconds while boy and men surveyed each other larry lowered the gun slightly but still kept his finger on the trigger he noted that the newcomers appeared to be unarmed although they had both knives and pistols hidden upon their persons  you are an americano sailor not so asked one of the spaniards  i am was larrys prompt reply are you one of aguinaldos rebels  no no we are no rebelswe are peaceful spanish gentlemen put in the second spaniard  do you belong here  i belong here said the man who had first spoken my brother he belongs at manila  the brother mentioned shot an angry glance at the speaker yes i come from manila he said but i belong truly in spain being a merchant of madrid  well our war with you folks is over said larry slowly hardly knowing how to proceed if you are not going to help the rebels you ought to help us we are doing all we can for your prisoners out here he added meaning the spaniards that were being held by the forces under general aguinaldosoldiers who were captured during the struggle between spain and her philippine colonies  we can do but little came with a shrug of the shoulders we are not armed and if we help the americanos aguinaldo says he will behead all the spanish prisoners he is holding such a threat was actually made but it is doubtful if the filipinos would have been base enough to carry it out  we came in here not to make trouble went on the second spaniard we came to learn what the firing means are the americanos coming here in force  they are  then santa cruz is doomed groaned the spaniard he dropped his hands and began to pace the warehouse floor i shall lose much if the city falls the rebels will burn all my property for they hate me  i trust not answered larry his fear of the pair gradually leaving him hark to that he added as the rattle of guns was again heard our men must be coming in fast and orders are to save everything that can be saved if the rebels  he broke off short as a cry from luke reached him running to the yankee sailor he found luke kicking out vigorously with his foot  i couldnt keep still no longer nohow burst out the old tar a plagued rat came right up and wanted to nibble my leg hang him whos them air fellows out thar  but the spaniards had already followed larry and were now gazing at luke in wonder wounded not so said one you were in the fight then  no we escaped from the prison answered larry simply we were captured during last night i wish i was sure wed be safe here until our soldiers come along he turned to the old sailor again how do you feel now  better larry a heap better but i aint ready fer no more foot races jest yet  then well have to remain here or perhaps you had better remain here while i go scouting around and see if i can find some of our soldiers or the ambulance corps  an what o these gentlemen  we shall go too said one of the spaniards your friend will be safe hereif he keeps hidden under the sacks he added  waiting for the strangers to move first larry came behind them still holding the gun as though the weapon were ready for use the men had spoken fairly enough yet there was that about them which did not please larry in the least they are regular rascals or else i miss my guess thought the youth  the roadway still seemed deserted but far off they could see the natives flying in several directions then from a distance came a cheer which larry knew could only come from american throats  our soldiers must be over there he said to the spaniards will you come with me  the men hesitated and consulted together in their native tongue i do not know what to say said one slowly and began to follow larry along the highway seeing this the other came too  suddenly a loud shout came to them from a thicket back of some nipa huts and instantly a band of insurgents burst into view armed with guns and bolos they were firing as they retreated and made a stand on the opposite side of the road  josé lupez cried one of the officers of the rebels addressing one of the two spaniards what do you here  and have i no right here asked the spaniard sharply  who is that with you  my brother benedicto from manila who was visiting me  he has betrayed us into the hands of the americanos if he  the rest of the sentence was drown out in a volley of musketry and two rebels were seen to fall some started to run but others held their ground  larry listened in amazement he had heard the names josé lupez and benedicto and knew that the two spaniards were brothers could this spaniard benedicto lupez be the man who had made off with the money braxton bogg had stolen from the hearthstone saving institution     chapter viii  a prisoner of the filipinos   larry had retreated to a small nipa hut standing close to the roadway feeling that if the americans were coming in that direction they would soon be at hand to give luke and himself aid  while the insurgents and the spaniards were conversing the latter had approached the hut and now both followed the young sailor inside  is your name benedicto lupez demanded larry approaching the taller of the pair  yes was the short response  then you are from manilayou ran away from there about two weeks ago  ha what do you know of that demanded the spaniard eying larry darkly  i know a good deal about you answered the youth boldly after braxton bogg was arrested you made off with the money he had left at your residence  tis false roared the spaniard but his face blanched even as he spoke i know nothing of that man or his money ii was deceived in him  if that is so why did you leave manila in such a hurry  ii wanted to help my brother who was in trouble i have not seen a dollar of boggs money tis he who still owes me for his board black wretch that he was roared benedicto lupez savagely  at these words larry was startled was lupez really telling the truth and if so where was the money that had wrecked the saving institution  he didnt even pay his board  not one piaster boynothing and i thought him honest or i would not have taken him in  but his valise is gone and the bands around the money  were as he left them i can swear i touched absolutely nothing answered benedicto lupez earnestly  larry was nonplussed had the spaniard looked less of a villain the young sailor would have been inclined to believe him but that face was so crafty and calculating that he still hesitated  well if you are innocent you will not object to helping me rejoin our soldiers he ventured  i want nothing to do with the americanosthey mean to get me into trouble even though i am innocent growled benedicto lupez come josé we will go he added to his brother in their native language  his brother was already at the doorway the shouting and firing outside was increasing leaping forward larry caught benedicto lupez by the arm  youll stay here he began when the spaniard let out a heavy blow which hurled the young sailor flat  i will not be held by a boy cried the man let go do you hear for larry had caught him by the foot the boys hold was good and in a trice benedicto lupez lay flat on his back then he rolled over and over and a fierce tussle ensued which came to a sudden end when josé lupez leaped forward and kicked larry in the head rendering him partly unconscious  what followed was more like a dream than reality to the bruised youth he heard a confused murmur of voices and a dozen or more shots and then as benedicto lupez and his brother ran off several rebels swarmed into the hut one stumbling over the lads form and pitching headlong this insurgent was about to knife larry when he saw that the young sailors eyes were closed and that he was bleeding about the head  un americano and wounded he said speaking in the tagalog dialect if he lives he may make us a useful prisoner and a few minutes later larry felt himself picked up and borne away first in a mans arms and then on horseback he tried to locate himself but when he opened his eyes all went swimming before them and he was glad enough to sink back once more and shut out the swirling sight  on and on and still on went the rebels some on foot and a few on their steeds in front were a few wagons and caribao carts piled high with camping outfits and also one or two light gunsall that had been saved from the garrison general lawtons attack had been a brilliant success and santa cruz itself had surrendered with hardly the loss of a man to the americans the troops coming in did their best to round up the insurgents but they had scattered in all directions and only a few were caught and these swore that they were amigos or friends and had to be given their liberty this pretending to be friends after they were routed was a great trick with thousands of the natives they would come into the american camp under the pretext that they had just escaped from the insurgents who had threatened to kill them if they would not join aguinaldos forces what to do with such people was one of the most difficult problems of the rebellion they could not be placed under arrest and yet that is what nine out of ten deserved  when larry was once more himself he found that it was night he was in a heap in a large casco which several tagals were propelling with all speed across the laguna de bay there were several other cascos in front and behind all filled with natives with guns the entire procession moved along in almost utter silence  the youth wanted to know where he was being taken but no sooner did he open his mouth than one of the soldiers clapped a dirty hand over it and commanded him to be silent as the soldier carried a bolo in his hand larry considered discretion the better part of valor and for the time being held his peace  a swarm of mosquitoes soon told the boy that they were approaching a marsh and presently the casco ran in between the reeds and under some high overhanging tropical bushes then those on board leaped ashore and the youth was made to follow them  a weary tramp over the marsh and then up a high hill followed the hill was covered with wild plantains monstrous ferns and a species of cedar tree all thickly interlaced with the ever present tropical vines which crossed and recrossed the tortuous path the party was following overhead the stars shone down dimly while the forest was filled with the cries of the birds the chattering of an occasional monkey and the constant drone and chirp of the innumerable insects the path was uneven and more than once larry pitched into a hollow along with the tagal who accompanied him and who never let go his hold on the youthful prisoner  at last they came to a halt before a series of rocks here there was a rude cave partly concealed by bushes as the party halted several natives came from the cave to give them welcome there was no doubt but that this was a rendezvous well known to the insurgents  a prisoner is it said one of the natives coming forward and holding up a torch of pitch a mere boy bah lanza cannot you do better  he was with the soldiers who took santa cruz and he wears the cap from a warship replied lanza it may be we can get more out of him than out of somebody older  well perhaps but i would rather you had brought in a man was the brief response  the conversation was in the tagalog dialect and consequently larry did not understand a word of it the boy was made to march into the cave which he found to be much larger than he expected it was fully forty feet broad by sixty feet deep and at the farther end a bright fire was burning the blaze mounting high up in a natural chimney and rendering the surroundings as light almost as day  on coming to his senses the youths hands had been bound behind him and now he was made to sit down with his back against a fairsized tree trunk which had been dragged into the cave for firewood a rope was passed around the log and this in turn was fastened to the cord about his wrists thus making him a close prisoner  for several hours the rebels paid but scant attention to him further than to furnish him a bowl of rice pap from which he might sup while it was held to his lips they also gave him a drink of water and one young rebel considerately washed the wound on his head on which the blood had dried presenting anything but a pleasant sight  as the hours went by the rebels around the cave kept increasing in numbers until there were several hundred all told those who came in last told of the complete downfall of santa cruz but none of them had the least idea of what the americans were going to do next perhaps they will follow us to here said one grimly  no they know better than to follow us into the jungles and mountains said the leader fipile if they did that we could shoot them down like so many monkeys they had still to learn the true character of the tireless general who had now taken up their trail and who knew no such words as fear or failure  it was well toward noon of the day following when captain fipile came in to have a talk with larry he spoke english remarkably well for he had spent several years of his life in san francisco and in hong kong among the english located at that port  your name my boy he said sitting down beside the young tar and when larry had given it he continued you were with the american troops who carried santa cruz  i was sir although i got into the city before they did  indeed and how was that questioned the filipino leader and larry told as much of his story as he deemed necessary  to the tale captain fipile listened with interest even smiling when larry told how he had broken out of the prison you did wonderfully well for a boy he remarked a man could not have done more what became of your friend  i left him at the warehouse i hope he rejoined the soldiers  and what of señors benedicto and josé lupez  i dont know what became of them  i know this josé lupez fairly well and i always thought him an honest man captain fipile stroked his chin thoughtfully we are fighting you americans it is true but we would not wish to shelter a thief who had run away from among you we are above that even though a good many of your countrymen will not give us credit for it  we know that some of the filipinos are honest enough said larry hesitatingly what do you intend to do with me he went on after a pause  that remains to be seen would you like to join our army  me no sir cried the youth promptly  captain fipile laughed outright you are honest enough about it i must say how about giving us a little information will you object to that  i have given you considerable information already  i mean military information  i havent anything to say on that point  cant i persuade you to tell me what you may happen to know  no sir  if i can get you to talk it may go much easier with you while you remain our prisoner went on the captain suggestively  im sorry but i havent anything to say  very well then master russell if you are rather harshly treated in the future remember you have only yourself to blame as a general rule we take prisoners only for the purpose of squeezing what information we can out of them  and thus speaking captain fipile arose and quitted the cave leaving larry to his own reflections which were more dismal than they were encouraging     chapter ix  the advance into the jungle   santa cruz had been taken but there was still much to do around the shores of the laguna de bay to make it safe territory for the americans to hold from the city the rebels were pursued eastward and a number of cascos and larger boats were captured inside of a few days paete longos lumban and several other villages were visited by detachments of general lawtons command and the insurgents fled in each instance leaving all behind them nearly a hundred who stopped to fight were either killed or wounded and victory was entirely upon the side of the americans  but now it was learned that the forces under general aguinaldo and general luna were concentrating once more to the north and east of malolos and much as he regretted the necessity general otis was compelled to order general lawton and his command back to the territory above manila no garrisons could be spared for santa cruz or the other places captured so these settlements were allowed to fall once more into the hands of the enemy after all the fortifications had been destroyed and the arms and munitions of war confiscated it seemed a pity to leave these towns and villages after having once taken them but to garrison them properly would according to general lawtons estimate have taken thousands of soldiers  with the taking of santa cruz the americans marched through all the streets and byways looking for lurking rebels and hidden arms and in this search a squad of infantry came upon luke striker who had propped himself up on the sacking in the warehouse and was making himself as comfortable as possible  hullo sailor cried the sergeant in charge of the squad where did you come from  illustration hullo sailor where did you come frompage 82  lukes story was quickly told and he begged the soldier to look for larry fearing that serious harm had befallen the lad at once two soldiers were detailed to care for the old yankee while the rest went on a hunt which lasted far into the night  as we know nothing was seen of larry but from a wounded and dying filipino the soldiers learned that the boy had been taken a prisoner and must now be many miles away from the city news of this reached luke while he was in the temporary hospital opened up after the first fight and the information made the old fellow feel as bad as did his wound  if theyve captured him hes a goner im afraid he said to jack biddle who had come in to help look after his messmate poor larry what will his brother ben say when he hears of it  better not tell him right away suggested biddle give him a chance to get strong fust besides larry may give em the slip hes putty cute ye know  the news soon spread that larry and several others were missing and a description of the absent ones was given out the next day one of the missing soldiers was found dead in the jungle but nothing was learned of the others  it serves the young sailor right growled lieutenant horitz he knew too much for his own good he had not forgotten the disaster on the river and secretly he wished larry all manner of illluck during the rush through the woods the lieutenant had tumbled and struck his nose on a stone that member was much swollen and cut in consequence and this put him in a worse humor than ever before  by the time the expedition was to return to manila luke was able to walk around again and he was put on one of the larger boats and jack biddle was detailed to look after him the return to manila was made without special incident and two days later found luke on board the olympia among all his old friends  but the yankee tar was thoroughly out of sorts i wouldnt care for the wound at all if only i knew larry was safe he was wont to say a dozen times a day barrow castleton and all the boys old friends were likewise troubled because of his strange disappearance  it was jack biddle who got shore leave and travelled up to malolos to break the news to ben he found the acting captain of company d just preparing to take his place in the command once more  im glad to see you lookin well leftenant he said after shaking hands warmly ye look almost as healthy as ye did on the voyage from brooklyn to manila  and i feel almost as well replied ben the rest has done me a world of good but what brought you up jack did larry come with you  no larry didnt come stammered the old tar and looked down at the floor fact is leftenant larryhehe couldnt come  couldnt come why whats the matter cried ben quickly is he sick  i reckon notleaswise i dont know fact is leftenant none on us know ye see he went upon thet santa cruz expedition  yes yes i know that and what of it was hewas he ben could not utter the words which came to his mind  no he wasnt shot thet is so far as we know but heswell hes missin an we cant find hide nor hair o him anywhere i might ez well tell ye fust ez last though it cuts my heart to do it leftenant and jack biddle shook his head dubiously  it was a great shock to ben yet he stood it better than the old tar had expected he asked immediately for details and though he drank in every word his manner showed that his thoughts were far away  i wish i had been along he said bitterly if he wasnt killed the filipinos must have carried him off a pretty good distance i wonder if general lawton tried to find out anything under a flag of truce  everything that could be done was donei have captain gastons word on that answered jack biddle captain gaston and ben were well known to each other  ben sank down on a bench and for several minutes said not a word but the tears stood in his eyes tears which he hastily dried that nobody might see them then gilbert pennington came in to tell him that the regiment was ordered to move within the hour  its too bad declared the young southerner but brace up ben while there is life there is hope and its a pretty sure thing that he wasnt killed and with this ray of comfort ben had to be content  during the days that general lawton had been in the vicinity of the laguna de bay the regiment to which ben and gilbert belonged had not been idle with a number of other troops they started for the town of santa maria where they came upon the enemy and dislodged them with shells the town already in flames was allowed to burn and the americans pursued the rebels quite a distance into the mountains but failed to catch them  in the meantime the camp of the third artillery situated some distance to the west of malolos was attacked a fierce engagement in the swamps took place and in the end the rebels were driven northward and began then to concentrate at tarlac which soon became one of their new capitalsthey shifting the seat of government as often as it suited their convenience  it was now felt by general otis and others in command that no time should be lost in an endeavor to round up the insurgents to the north of malolos who were the main support of the rebellion although scattering bands were still operating to the south and southeast the rainy season was but a few weeks off and once this set in military operations would be much retarded if not stopped altogether for taken as a whole the roads throughout the island of luzon are bad and heavy rains render them wellnigh impassable  in order to make the campaign against the rebels as effective as possible general otis decided to send out two columns one under general macarthur to strike out for calumpit and the second under general lawton to take a route to the eastward along the base of the hills leading to san isidro by this it was hoped if the rebels at calumpit were defeated and tried to take to the mountains they would fall directly into lawtons hands and not only have to surrender but also give up all their war supplies  it was in the furtherance of this plan that general lawton left manila with his brigade and struck out for novaliches which was gained after a small skirmish at tuliahan river from here the column moved to norzagaray to await reënforcements which were coming in from malolos and vicinity to these reënforcements belonged the command to which ben and gilbert were attached  it had begun to rain and those who understood tropical weather predicted that the wet season was at hand yet it was very hot and the water which fell arose in clouds of steam on the road rendering marching anything but comfortable  sure an it makes a man feel as if he was takin a stame bath so it does remarked dan casey as he swung along on the route step i dont know as i iver see it rain hot wather before bedad he added as he wiped the perspiration from his sadly freckled face  during the days march which was trying to everybody ben was silent wondering what had become of larry and if he would ever again see his younger brother when the command went into camp under the shelter of a grove of tall trees both gilbert and major morris visited his tent to comfort him  he is not the only one who is missing remarked the major of the first battalion so far i understand the warships have lost about a dozen men who went ashore and failed to return and you know there are six men missing from our own regiment  that is true major was the acting captains answer but its only when its a close relative that the blow really comes home to one you know  i suppose that is true captain but dont be disheartened it may be that your brother is already back at manila  i cant see what the rebels would do with him as a prisoner said gilbert they have to move around so lively that i cant see what they want with prisoners anyway  and so the talk ran on until it came time to retire that night ben slept but little and it was not the rain or the aching of his wound that kept him awake either he was bound to think of larry constantly until something was heard of the missing lad     chapter x  the taking of angat   we are out for a fight today  it was sergeant gilmore who spoke and he addressed ben the sergeant was still acting as first lieutenant of company d and it looked as if he might hold the position permanently as for ben it was settled that he would be appointed permanent captain of the command as soon as the necessary papers could be made out  the regiment had joined general lawtons command and was now in the vicinity of angat a pretty town full of quaint buildings and a place which as yet the rebellion had scarcely touched but the insurgents had been developed in force by the sharpshooters in front and now a constant rattle of musketry was heard which made bens blood tingle as of old when the cry had been on to santiago and on to malolos  yes you are right gilmore answered the young captain and i am not sorry it will help us to forget the rain and our other discomforts ben did not say it would help him to forget about larry but that is what he meant  the regiment was soon advancing on the doublequick it was spread out in skirmish order and the route lay over what had once been a ricefield but which was but little more than a sheet of dirty water four to eight inches deep here and there were holes and into these some of the soldiers would sometimes step thus getting an involuntary bath much to their disgust  it aint all a picnic remarked one of the unfortunates as he leaped up out of a hole and shook himself like a big dog folks at home as just read the newspaper accounts of the war dont know anything of what us fellows have to put up with all they think we do is to rush forward kill the enemy and cover ourselves with glory ill wager some of em would put on a mighty sour face if they had to tramp ten or twenty miles in the mud and wet carry a gun and other luggage and hardly knowing when the next meal was going to turn up and what it was going to amount to  oh youve got em bad bradner shouted a comrade here light my pipe and take a smoke it will dry off your nose if nothing else and bradner took the pipe and was thankful that tobacco at least was still forthcoming  half an hour later ben received orders to take his company up to the firing line and away went the command on the doublequick with the young captain at the head the rain had let up a bit and the rebels could be seen making a stand behind a grove of halfwild plantains where were located a score of nipa huts  run them out boys shouted ben as they drew closer if we go at them with a rush well soon have them on the run and on swept the company with orders to fire at will soon there was a constant cracking of rifles and ben and the other officers joined in with their pistols the insurgents fired in return and one man of the company fell back hit in the arm  just before the grove was gained there was a brook to cross this was much swollen and here a number of the soldiers came to a halt fearing that fording was out of the question  dont stop came in a loud cry from major morris you can leap the stream easily enough come im going and over he went with a bound and a score of soldiers followed a raking fire came from the nipa huts but now the rebels were seen to be fleeing the americans answered the fire with volley after volley from their own guns and the huts were surrounded as quickly as possible  captain russell you will take the trail to the left said an orderly dashing up major morris will rejoin you at the fork in the road  the trail to the left repeated ben and turned to his company forward boysleft oblique he shouted and on they went again past the nipa huts and down a trail leading along the edge of a rich plantation several more huts were passed but the inmates were nothing but women and children and offered no resistance then at a distance could be seen a stone wall as if the insurgents had endeavored to construct a rude fortification in a great hurry  the company was going at the stone wall pellmell when ben called a sudden halt to the right boys and come at the end of the wall were his orders and the command swept around as desired  bang the report was hardly expected and with it half a dozen of the stones composing the rude fortification gave way disclosing a cannon made of a boredout treetrunk wound round and round with telegraph wire stolen from the lines along the railroad this wooden cannon had been heavily charged with cartridges old nails and bits of iron and the first discharge rent the mouth into a dozen pieces  that was a narrow shave cried gilmore as he and ben looked around to find all the company unharmed who ever supposed the rascals would put up such a job as that on us  theyll do anything replied the young captain but that isnt a new idea wooden cannons were used in the civil war so ive been told  with the discharge of the wooden gun the rebels concealed behind the stone fortification had fled the americans now made after them more hotfooted than ever and the incessant crack of firearms was followed by many a groan and yell of pain as over a dozen filipinos went down three to their death  at the fork mentioned by major morris ben brought his company to a halt all were panting for breath for the brush at close quarters had put them on their mettle the rest of the battalion soon came up and the other battalions followed from another road and then the regiment with the other troops pushed on into angat  much to the astonishment of all the beautiful town with its centuryold churches and quaint government buildings was found practically deserted the only inhabitants left were a few women and a handful of aged men all of whom said they would do anything for the americanos if they were spared their lives these frightened people were soon put at ease and then an inspection of the captured place was instituted  in various places such as the vaults of convents and government buildings huge quantities of pilai that is unhulled rice were found some of the rice was confiscated for army use and a large quantity was distributed to the natives who gradually drifted in saying they wanted to be friendly and that they were starving  it may be that the rice we give away may go to the rebels said the general in command but we cant let these poor wretches starve war or no war and so the bags were given out until very little remained  it was not general lawtons intention to quarter at angat for any length of time and having entered the town in the morning he left it in the afternoon to begin an advance up the river the next day striking san rafael on the right bank and muronco on the left bank  somebody has set angat on fire exclaimed ben as the regiment marched away a thick column of smoke had suddenly risen from the upper end of the town  i dont believe it was our men answered major morris who walked beside the young captain they had strict orders not to loot or burn  the flames speedily increased as one nipa hut after another caught and the warehouses added to the blaze the americans always thought the rebels started this conflagration while the insurgents laid the crime at our door however it was angat burned fiercely and by nightfall little remained of its many picturesque buildings  the weather was beginning to tell upon the troops and out of bens regiment fully forty men were on the sick list with either colds or tropical fever and these had to be sent back to a sick camp the balance of the command it was decided should join the troops that were to attack san rafael  as before the sharpshooters were in front while the infantry were escorted by scotts battery who as soon as the enemys firing line was located began to pour in a hot fire of shrapnel much to the latters discomfiture then bens regiment went into action once more the young captains company on the edge of some heavy brush  the sharp clip clip of mauser bullets made unpleasant music as the soldier boys rushed through the thickets to surprise not a few filipinos who were in hiding and who imagined that the americans would pass them by unnoticed once ben came upon a man lying on his face in a mass of tall grass every part of his body concealed but his back  can he be dead thought the young captain when of a sudden the native leaped up like lightning and darted behind the nearest bushes before anybody could stop him half a dozen soldiers fired on him and he fired in return but none of the shots took effect and ben could not but think that the poor creature had earned his escape for ten chances to one he doesnt know what he is fighting about he said to gilmore  right you are answered the lieutenant i believe if we could corral the whole crowd and explain the true situation to them they would throw down their arms without hesitation it is only the leaders who are keeping this rebellion alive  over near the battery just mentioned stood general lawton tall and erect directing every movement without a single thought of personal danger many a shot was directed at him but he seemed to bear a charmed life  san rafael will soon be ours said one of the officers of the staff see the enemy are retreating he cried enthusiastically  at that moment an orderly dashed up carrying an order from general otis the order read that the column must rest at angat until supplies could be forwarded from malolos a shadow fell over the commandos face another victory was at handbut orders were orders and must be obeyed slowly the retreat was sounded and the insurgents were left in possession of the field they thought the americans were being forced back on account of a heavy loss and went almost wild with delight proclaiming the encounter a great victory for the filipino cause     chapter xi  the crossing of the rio grande river   for gracious sake what did we want to retreat for demanded ben as soon as the command halted and major morris had come within speaking distance the young captain had been at the very front of the firing line and had seen that complete victory was only the work of a quarter of an hour or less  orders from general headquarters replied the major in a low tone i fancy the staff is pretty angry too he added  we could have whipped them with ease  so we could captain but and major morris finished with a shrug of his shoulders which meant a good deal  i dont believe general otis would have given such an order had he been here to see what was going on continued ben earnestly  well were ordered back to angat and that is all there is to it the army must have supplies you know  hang the supplies muttered gilmore but under his breath we can get all the supplies we want as we go along and ben was rather inclined to agree with him  there was no help however for the turn in the situation and with crestfallen faces the soldiers moved still further back and went into temporary camp only a few had suffered and the wounded ones were promptly cared for by the hospital corps  and how do you feel asked gilbert as he came up to see ben does the wound hurt still  it itches thats all answered ben but this retreat  makes one feel sore all over doesnt it finished the young southerner i must say i dont understand it at all if we are going to round up any of these rebels we cant do it by falling back and waiting for supplies  impatient as they were however the troops had to wait for two days before another movement was made during this time supplies were hurried forward in large quantities that there might be no more delays in the future  in the meantime the troops under general macarthur were by no means idle they consisted of two brigades that of general hale on the right wing and that of general wheaton on the left wing of these troops the first advance was by some men of the fourth cavalry who went forward to reconnoitre the enemys position near quingua the start was made during the early morning and before long the insurgents opened a heavy fire which the americans returned with difficulty as the rebels were well concealed by the tall grass and their intrenchments to aid the cavalry a number of other troops were hurried forward also several fieldpieces and in the end the filipinos were forced from their position with a heavy loss in this battle the americans lost six killed and forty wounded among the killed was colonel stotsenburg commanding the first nebraska volunteers who after most gallantly leading his men was shot down in the final rush upon the enemys earthworks  from quingua the whole of general hales brigade moved down the quingua river to pulilan here no resistance was encountered and after a brief rest the brigade pushed on toward logundi that town was not yet reached when the advance guard reported a breastwork across the main road running to the river on the west and into the jungle on the east  never mind well go ahead anyhow shouted the soldiers of the nebraska regiment and go ahead they did with the south dakota and iowa troops beside them and several guns of the sixth artillery protecting their advance the fight at the earthworks was a fierce one some of the filipinos refusing to surrender even when they knew they were beaten and as a consequence many of them were slain whose lives might otherwise have been spared to them  a short distance to the northwest of logundi the quingua and the bagbag rivers join in flowing into the calumpit the railroad crosses the bagbag but a short distance away and at this point general hales command reunited with that of general wheaton which had come up along the tracks from malolos without difficulty general wheaton had with him the troops from montana and kansas some utah artillery and one or two other commands along with two armored cars fitted out with gatling and hotchkiss guns and sixpounders  it was soon discovered that the rebels had built strong breastworks in a semicircle along the north bank of the bagbag and the western bank of the calumpit rivers and had injured the railroad track for a distance of several hundred yards and also the bridge spanning the river as the approach to both rivers was largely an open one how to dislodge the filipinos became a serious problem  forward with the armored cars was the cry and they were rushed ahead as far as the tornup condition of the railroad tracks admitted a cannonading lasting for half an hour followed in which one of the batteries on the highway also took part the aim of the gunners was good and soon the insurgents were seen to be pouring from the trenches which were getting too hot to hold them yet a fair number held their ground and when the troops on foot advanced they opened a blistering fire which laid not a few americans low but the victory was ours and soon the followers of old glory were wading or swimming the river while the engineering corps set to work to repair the damage done to railroad and bridge so that the armored and baggage cars might pass through  the cry was now on to calumpit which town lies on the calumpit river and is divided into two parts by another stream called the rio grande it was found that the insurgents had practically deserted the lower half of the town but had intrenchments on the upper bank of the rio grande which were even more formidable than those taken on the bagbag here the rebels had also a maxim and other guns and it seemed as if for once the advance of the americans was thoroughly blocked numerous good positions along the south bank of the river were held by our troops but it looked as if they could not get over the stream without a tremendous loss of life  it is said that the opportunity makes the man and in this instance the saying proved a true one with the soldiers under general wheaton were the twentieth kansas volunteers who had already made a record for themselves at malolos and elsewhere as related in a previous volume of this series they were commanded by colonel frederick funston a man comparatively young in years and small in stature but one who was daring to the last degree and who had seen much of fighting and hardships during his adventurous existence in cuba funston had fought most valiantly under garcia for cuban liberty long before any interference by the united states  to colonel afterward brigadier general funston belongs the honor of the passage of the rio grande for it was he who planned what was done and he and a score of his fighting kansans who carried it out the daring of the scheme is one which will live long in american history  as before mentioned the bridge was partly broken but enough remained for the passage of soldiers who could climb from one iron crosssection to another at first it was hoped that a body might go over the bridge in the dark raise a great commotion and cause the filipinos a panic this scheme was tried but it failed for the enemy was on strict guard and would have shot down the men as rapidly as they appeared on the bridge  colonel funston then proposed to go down the river bank for a considerable distance build rafts and by means of a stout rope ferry some of the best of his men across the stream in the dark the landing of the men was to be covered by the heaviest possible fire from the american side and as soon as they were safe ashore the kansas soldiers were to secure some position where they might enfilade the enemys trenches that is fire through them from one end so that the filipinos might no longer find them safe in the meantime more troops were to come over with all possible speed  on the way down the stream the kansas soldiers demolished several huts selecting the best of the timber with which to build their rafts the moon was under a cloud and it looked as if they might get across the river without serious trouble  but as the crowd were constructing their rafts and getting their ferry rope ready for use the moon came out brightly and very soon the insurgents became suspicious and fired on the americans who were forced to retreat to the nearest shelter the firing kept up the greater part of two hours and at last the plan to cross over that night was abandoned  but the kansas colonel and his gallant men had determined to be the first into the enemys camp and once again they went to the spot previously selected but this time in the broad daylight when they might clearly see the shore opposite no insurgents were in sight and after having made three rafts all right and tight the rope was brought forth and two men named white and trembly were asked to carry it across the stream the soldiers plunged into the water without delay being watched by hundreds of their comrades left behind the men were without their uniforms or weapons of any kind  slowly the pair swam the turbulent waters of the stream and hardly had they gotten fifty feet from shore when the rebels opened fire upon them at first a few scattering shots and then a perfect volley that the swimmers escaped is little short of a miracle but they remained untouched and gaining the opposite bank they ran forward and tied the ropes end to a treestump in the meantime two other soldiers started over the rio grande in a dugout but this upset and let the men into the water and they had to swim as had the others but they landed with their guns intact and at once opened fire at the nearest natives that showed themselves  all this had happened with great rapidity and now the first raft was coming across the river loaded with kansas soldiers officered by colonel funston himself the raft became the target for the hottest kind of fire and as the ferrying had to be done by the soldiers pulling along the rope stretched from shore to shore the passage was as slow as it was dangerous but the soldiers on the craft went over in safety and soon more followed until over fifty were on the beach fronting the enemys intrenchments then with a wild yelling to give the rebels the impression that a large body had come over they pushed forward to enfilade the enemys trenches as first proposed  but now another difficulty arose there was a small stream flowing into the rio grande near this spot and this had to be crossed before the fire of the americans could be made effective how to get across was a problem as the insurgents had a machine gun trained on the spot this worked for a while and then stopped and in the lull colonel funston secured a rowboat and went over with some of his men and the others soon followed  the filipinos were now thoroughly frightened for the americans were making a great outcry down by the railroad bridge and they imagined that they were to be attacked from several points at once some started to run and as soon as colonel funstons men began to rain their bullets into the long trenches more followed until the enemy was in a panic then the americans began to cross the bridge and stream in great numbers and the filipinos although reënforced by a body of macabebes just at this time could not make an effective stand calumpit was left behind and a running fight ensued which ended at apalit when a violent tropical thunderstorm put an end to the days operations it was thought that the rebels headquarters would be found at apalit but this had at the last moment been removed to san isidro toward which general lawton was now advancing     chapter xii  something about a poisoned well   after the rest at angat the taking of san rafael by general lawtons troops was an easy matter and on may 1the anniversary of admiral deweys great victory in manila baythe soldiers set out for the town of baliuag five miles to the northward  in spite of the recent rain the road was hard and even dusty in spots the heat was still as great as ever and ben was glad to take the benefit of any shade that afforded itself as he marched along at the head of his command the date made him think of the battle just mentioned and this brought him around to larry once more and he began to wonder if his brother would ever turn up again  i suppose ill have to write to walter and to uncle job about this he muttered dismally but i hate to do it especially if larry does turn up for i know it will worry both of them greatly  the road was thick with palms and plantains and trailing plants the latter of gorgeous colorings nipa huts and bamboo cottages were numerous but the inmates kept themselves well hidden as the little army passed by in the distance were paddyfields and canebrakes and along the road were numerous mudholes some of which had to be bridged over before the artillery could pass in safety more than once horses and cannon got stuck and many a shoulder had to be put to the pieces to budge them  if there was no war this would be a delightful spot in which to spend a vacation remarked gilbert who had come up for a little talk as was his habit when they were pushing ahead in irregular formation i reckon the natives take solid comfort in their homes  i suppose it puts you in mind of the south at home returned ben with a smile it is nice certainly but i fancy this continual heat would make one mighty lazy in time  well the natives are lazy you can easily see that laughed the young southerner i wish i could get a good drink of water he added a minute later  they soon came to a pretty dwelling set in a perfect wilderness of flowers and shrubs toward the side they made out a well and ran forward to fill their canteens  the pair were at the well when a shrill cry from one of the side rooms of the house attracted their attention looking up they saw a native girl waving her hand frantically at them the girl was nicely dressed and evidently belonged to the better classes  we only want a drink shouted ben thinking that the maiden might imagine they had come into the garden to steal  but the girl shouted more loudly than ever and waved them away from the well bad bad she cried  oh no we are not so bad as you think gilbert shouted back and was about to take a drink from a cocoanutshell dipper which hung handy when the girl came out of the cottage on a run and dashed the dipper to the ground at the same time an evillooking filipino appeared at the doorway shook his fist at the girl and then suddenly ran for the barns behind the dwelling and disappeared  i want a drink and im going to have it began gilbert sternly for he did not like the manner in which the water had been spilt over his clothing if you  the well is poisoned dont drink it will kill you gasped the girl in spanish  illustration the well is poisoned dont drink it will kill youpage 115  as old readers know gilbert understood a little of the language having picked it up while on a trip to cuba and also while serving as a rough rider in that island he started back and caught the maiden by the arm  poisoned you are certain he cried  yes señor my uncle put the poison in only yesterday he lost much at angat and he is very angry at the americanos in consequence he knew the soldiers were coming this way and he wanted to poison as many as he could he put a waterbarrel down on the road full of the poisoned water too  who is your uncle the man who just ran off  yes señor but oh do not go after him i pray you cried the girl in high alarm i would not have spoken but i could not see you poisoned before my very eyes no not that  as quickly as he could gilbert translated her words to ben who listened in amazement  the villain ejaculated the young captain ive heard of this sort of thing being done before i wonder where that barrel is that she spoke about we must find it and empty it of its contents  gilbert put the question to the girl who announced that the barrel was on another road back of the plantation whether any of the soldiers had reached it or not was a question  as quickly as he could ben reported the situation to his superior and received orders to divide his company leaving a part to guard the poisoned well so that no americans might drink from it while the rest should go and hunt up the waterbarrel gilbert was detailed to accompany ben and the girl was given to understand that she must take the soldiers to where the barrel had been set up  at first the maiden demurred but there was no help for it and the kind smiles which gilbert and ben gave her were an assurance that no harm was about to befall her yet she was afraid that when the reckoning came her uncle would deal harshly with her and trembled violently as she moved through the ricefields with the two young officers beside her  the little command had nearly reached the back road when the report of a gun rang out coming from the direction of a wood behind the ricefields the bullet sped past bens shoulder to bury itself in the fleshy part of one of his privates arms  tis my uncle cried the girl oh he will kill us all i am sure of it and she became so agitated that she sank down and could not go another step  without hesitation ben ordered his men forward on the run and away went the detachment for the spot from whence the unexpected shot had come as the soldiers neared the wood they beheld a filipino in the act of running across a small opening  thats him the rascal roared dan casey and taking a hasty aim he fired and the rebel was seen to plunge forward on his face when the party came up they found that the man had been hit in the hip and that the wound while not necessarily dangerous was serious and would put the fellow out of the contest for several months  it serves him right said ben poisoning drinking water is not fair fighting  the girl soon came up crying bitterly she wished to remain by her uncle but ben made her understand that she must point out the waterbarrel first and after that he would have two soldiers remove the wounded man to the cottage  ten minutes later the rear road was gained and here the waterbarrel was found set up on end with the top knocked out it was threequarters full of water and a dozen or more soldiers were drinking and filling their canteens  stop drinking ordered ben when still at a distance that water has been doctored and will make you sick he refrained from saying the water was poisoned for fear of creating a panic  the water was at once poured out on the ground and the barrel smashed up then a surgeon was found to whom ben related the facts of the case a canteen of the water was examined and the surgeon decided to give the man who had drunk the stuff an emetic a few of the soldiers were taken with cramps inside of an hour afterward and two of them were seriously sick for a week but no lives were lost but if the soldiers could have got at the filipino who had poisoned the water they would have shot him on the spot  as soon as the danger was over ben returned to the wood and had two men carry the wounded man back to the cottage where he was left in charge of his wife and his niece through gilbert it was learned that the wife had also remonstrated against using the poison so it was fair to suppose that the aunt would protect her niece to a certain degree but shell have a hard time of it for doing us a service im afraid said the young southerner as he and ben resumed the march  the scouts under chief young were in advance and now a steady firing from the front told that another battle was at hand soon general lawton came dashing through the crowd on the road followed by his staff  forward boys was the cry and then bens command left the road and took to the ricefields on the outskirts of baliuag the line was a long one with the oregon and minnesota soldiers forming the skirmishing end and scotts battery in a paddyfield on the extreme right so far the insurgents had kept well hidden but as the americans drew closer to the town they could be seen running in half a dozen directions as if undecided whether to fight or to flee  the townspeople themselves were in a panic and down the streets ran filipinos and chinese some with their household effects piled high on their backs they had heard of the coming of the americanos but had hoped almost against hope that their beloved town would be passed by unmolested  bens regiment was moving along rapidly when they came to a ditch which seemed to divide the ricefield in half a short pause followed when along came the cry of down and every man dropped and none too soon for the insurgents had opened up unexpectedly from a canebrake behind the ricefield  we must take that canebrake came the order from the colonel and the word was passed along quickly and away went the companies with a ringing cheer firing as they ran and reloading with all possible speed  ben was now truly in his element and waving his sword he urged company d well to the front so that the cane was soon reached but the rebels were not game for a handtohand encounter and fled once more through the cane and over a field of heavy grass leading to the very outskirts of the town beyond  they are running away was the cry on we go boys and the town will be ours in less than half an hour  but now a halt was ordered on the edge of the canebrake from the outskirts of the town appeared a filipino waving a white rag over his head  flag of truce cried the american general cease firing and the order was instantly obeyed major morris you can select a detail of three men and find out what they want  i will general answered the major of the first battalion and saluted he had soon chosen his men one of whom was gilbert pennington and waving a white flag before them the party of four advanced into the open field     chapter xiii  in which a flag of truce is fired upon   major morris well knew the wiliness of the filipinos yet he did not doubt but that they would pay due respect to a flag of truce which they had themselves invited accordingly he advanced boldly with his little party until the four had covered fully onehalf of the distance which separated the american troops from the point where the rebels had taken a stand  he is thrustin thim a whole lot groaned dan casey who was the closest man in the ranks to ben if he gits plugged  they wont dare to fire dan said a companion if they did  the speech was cut short by the pop of a mauser rifle followed by two more pops and the private who carried the white flag was seen to fling the banner down and fall headlong in the meantime the filipinos who had appeared with the white rag were running back to their own ranks with all possible speed  they have fired on the flag of truce the cry arose from a hundred throats and then a scattering volley rang out at the same time the filipinos opened up in a body and major morris gilbert and the third man were seen to pitch into the tall grass in such a manner that they were almost hidden from view  gilbert is shot and major morris too such was the painful thought which ran through bens brain he looked at the colonel pleadingly  advance at once captain russell with the first battalion to the rescue of the flag of truce ordered the colonel understanding him fully after this give the enemy no quarter  forward men to the rescue shouted the young captain almost before his superior had finished deploy to the left and fire at will and make every shot tell he added bitterly  forward it is shouted dan casey down wid the haythins that dont know the manin av honor and he led in the rush over the long grass  the whole line was soon advancing but bens company was in front and kept there until within a hundred feet of where the four men had gone down then to his amazement the young captain saw major morris leap up followed by gilbert and the third soldier and run with all speed toward the american line  not shot cried ben joyfully heaven be thanked for that and he almost felt like embracing his two friends only the flagbearer had been struck and he not seriously the others had gone down in the long grass to destroy the enemys aim the wounded flagcarrier was taken to the rear and then the whole line pushed on with a yell which was as savage as it was loud and long the incident short as it was was not forgotten and when one end of the american line closed in on the retreating insurgents the latter fought to the last knowing only too well that little quarter would be given to them because of their perfidy  the long american line had swung toward baliuag in a semicircle and now when the insurgents tried to flee by way of the north they found themselves confronted front and rear this put them in more of a panic than ever and had general lawton had a thousand additional troops it is more than likely he could have surrounded the rebels completely and compelled every one in that territory to throw down his arms  but he had not the extra men nor could he get them moreover he had hardly a decent map of the territory while the enemy knew every field every road and every stream they could not make a stand at baliuag nor could they run in the direction of san rafael so their only course was to take to the ricefields the canebrakes and the jungle and this they did in short order  by the time the outskirts of the town was gained bens command was almost exhausted yet the colonel of the regiment felt that now was no time to rest and company after company was sent out in the hope that some of the scattering bands of insurgents might be rounded up  major morris you will take your four companies up yonder road said the colonel after receiving orders from general lawtons orderly and the head of the regiment pointed out the road in question soon the battalion was off on the doublequick the major more than eager to wipe out the treachery which had been shown to him and his companions but an hour or two before  the road which the battalion followed was a winding one lined with cottages of the better sort showing that this was a fashionable outskirt of the town only a few people showed themselves and nothing was seen or heard of the insurgents until a quarter of a mile had been covered and the best of the habitations had been left behind then came an unexpected fire from a canebrake and out dashed fully two hundred savagelooking tagals armed with guns and bolos  halt fire came the commands and the americans obeyed as quickly as possible several of our men had been hit one seriously and now half a dozen filipinos went down for several minutes the fighting was at close quarters and it looked as if the battalion had run into an ambush and were about to be slaughtered  to the shelter of the trees shouted ben and was about to guide his men when a fiercelooking rebel officer leaped before him with drawn sword his own blade met that of the enemy and both flashed fire but the tagal was a fine swordsman and kept at his work feeling certain that he could run the americano through and through clack clack went the blades up and down side to side and straight forward  take care there came from major morris and just then the tagals sword pricked bens arm the young captain leaped back a step then came forward and as quick as lightning his sword found the tagals ribs at the same time dan casey fired at the enemy and the officer went down flat on his back shot through the breast  i had to do it cried the irish volunteer i thought he was afther stickin ye like a pig  it was a close shave murmured ben as he passed on he handled his sword like an expert i shant forget you for that casey  sure an thats all right captain answered the soldier quickly is your arm hurted much  i guess not come weve got them on the run again and away the pair went into the canebrake through which the rebels were crashing like so many wild cattle  the day had been full of excitement but much more was to follow the canebrakes were heavy and soon ben and casey found themselves separated from the main body of the battalion and out of sight of their own company then several filipinos confronted them and called upon them to surrender  we aint surrenderin just yit we aint howled the irish soldier and let drive at the nearest rebel while ben discharged his pistol two of the enemy were wounded and in an instant the others took to their heels evidently convinced that such fighters were too many for them  the encounter however had taken time and now ben called upon his companion to stop running we want to know where we are running to first he said listen  they listened and made out a distant firing to both the right and the left im afther thinkin our bys is to the right said dan casey  i believe you are right casey although both of us may be mistaken rejoined the young captain of company d we will try that direction anyway  they continued on their way through the canebrake until they reached a small stream here the ground was soft and full of treacherous bogholes and both looked at each other in dismay  sure an this is more than we bargained fer eh captain remarked casey as he pulled himself out of a hole into which he had gone almost to his knees if we dont look out well git stuck so tight therell be no budgin av us  the ground to the right seems to be firmer replied ben come we will move in that direction  but to get out of the soft spot was not easy and soon they found themselves between the tall cane and up to their knees in a muck that seemed to stick worse than glue  sure an this is fightin wid a vengeance said the irish volunteer smiling grimly its sthuck we are like flies on a fly paper eh captain russell  weve got to get out somehow casey answered ben half desperately our command is marching farther and farther away and well have all we can do to get up to them  sure thin an major morris betther send a detail back wid a long rope to pull us out we couldnt fly from the inimy now if we thried could we  this is no joke casey  joke bedad no captain im afther thinkin its a mighty sarious difficulty but theres no use av cryin no matther how bad it is finished the irish soldier philosophically  a moment of reflection convinced ben that the best thing he could do was to go back part of the distance they had come and make an endeavor to cross the little stream at another point  they retreated with difficulty first one sinking into some treacherous hole and then the other once casey went flat on his back and gave a loud yell of dismay when he found himself covered with a mud that was more like a paste than anything else  sure an ill not go in such a canefield again bedad he muttered as he started to pick up the gun he had dropped as he did so a cracking of canestalks near them caused both to straighten up in alarm  who comes cried ben and drew the pistol he had shoved into his belt  there was no answer and he repeated the demand are you americans he added  still there was no reply but the cracking of the stalks continued and the sounds seemed to move around the pair in something of a circle then came a soft command in the tagalog dialect at once dan casey clutched ben by the arm  they be afther surroundin us captain he whispered be the noises there must be tin or a dozen av thim phwat shall we do fight or run fer it     chapter xiv  surrounded by the enemy   for the moment after dan casey spoke ben was silent not knowing himself what was best to do that the filipinos were surrounding them there could be no doubt since those approaching would have answered the young captain of company d had they been americans  the position of the pair was dangerous in the extreme for the tall canestalks surrounded them upon all sides giving shelter to the enemy while the tagals could see the volunteers with ease  keep quiet casey whispered ben as the soldier started to speak again they may not know how many there are of us here and sneak off fearing an ambush  the irish volunteer nodded to show that he understood he was holding his gun before him ready to shoot whenever it appeared necessary  presently there was another whispered command coming from directly in front of our friends a slight movement in the canebrake followed and then all became silent once more  come whispered ben dont fire until you see me do so  thus speaking the young captain moved slowly and cautiously from the spot they had occupied for five minutes or more he picked his steps and they fell as silently as those of a cat after a bird casey was at his heels almost holding his breath and his small eyes glistening with expectancy both knew that they were carrying their lives in their hands  two rods had been covered and still nothing was seen of the filipinos was it possible that they had withdrawn but no there was another cracking of canestalks and another command in the tagalog language coming now from their left then of a sudden a mauser rang out and a bullet whistled back of bens head and across caseys face  the report had not yet died out when ben fired straight for the flash of fire of which he had caught a momentary glimpse that his shot reached its mark was proven by the wild yell of pain which followed  the jig is up cried dan casey we must run fer it captain and as a tagal came into view before them he fired pointblank at the fellow hitting him in the breast and killing him on the spot  as luck would have it the filipino whom casey had killed was a petty officer and the leader of the detachment and his sudden takingoff disconcerted the insurgents for a minute who yelled one to another that their leader was shot taking advantage of the confusion our friends rushed headlong through the canebrake firing several times as they ran a dozen shots answered them but none of these took effect  i think the road is yonder said ben pointing with his pistol as they progressed hark  from a distance came a scattering volley proving that the fighting was not yet over it came from the direction in which they were running but now those left behind were after them shooting and shouting with vigor for they were ten to two and were determined that the wicked americanos should not escape their clutches  at last the canebrake was left behind beyond was a small part of a ricefield and close by a cottage which appeared deserted  sure captain an well be shot down like dogs if we show ourselves in th open panted casey who was almost out of breath  get behind the house answered ben it is our one chance and he started in advance again the filipinos fired on them and this time a bullet touched the young captains side cutting a straight hole through his clothing  they were yet a hundred feet from the cottage when two american soldiers came rushing forth guns in hand the strangers took in the situation at a glance and let drive with such good aim that two of the enemy fell back wounded the others paused not knowing how many americans might be concealed in the building and in another minute ben and casey were for the time being safe  by gum ef it aint captain russell cried one of the soldiers as he faced ben im right glad to be yere to help ye capn and he smiled broadly  ralph sorrel returned ben as he recognized the tall tennesseean who had once accompanied him on a search for gilbert when the young southerner was missing what are you doing here  jeming an me hev got a wounded man with ussergeant kaser o our company we war takin him back o the lines when he got so bad we brung him in yere to rest a spell but you  thim rebels is comin agin announced dan casey six eight nine av thim wid wan limpin how many av us are there here he asked as he looked around  four answered ben load up boys and when you shoot  well make every shot tell answered jeming a hardylooking soldier almost as tall as his companion  i dont believe they will come very close continued ben they know that we have the advantage of them even if we are but four to nine  the young captain was right the filipinos had showed themselves only for a few seconds now as sorrel raised his gun they lost no time in darting behind cover  the cottage consisted of four rooms all on the ground floor and a low loft upstairs it was well built and fairly furnished in native fashion on the single bed it contained lay the wounded soldier sergeant kaser whom ben had met several times he was hit in the neck and looked as if he could last but a few hours at the most  sorry we cant git ye back to camp sergeant said sorrel as he did what he could to ease the wounded ones pain the house is surrounded by the enemy i reckon we kin keep em out but i reckon likewise thet they kin keep us inat least fer a while  itdontmatter gasped sergeant kaser i am notnotlong for this world what a terrible thing war is i never thought i was going to be shot down like this and he gave another gasp his eyes were staring from his head for he was suffering severe pain  ben looked around the cottage for something which might be given to the sufferer to ease him but the dwelling had been stripped of all small things and nothing in the way of food drink or medicine remained sorrel had already bound a handkerchief soaked in cold water around the wounded neck so nothing more could be done excepting to raise the sufferer up to a sitting position at his request i dont know as thet is best fer him whispered the tall tennesseean to ben but he aint long fer this world as he says an he might as well hev his wish as not  in the meantime casey and jeming were on guard one watching to the front and right the other to the left and rear the nearest building to the cottage was a hundred and fifty feet away but bushes and small trees were numerous and the americans were afraid the rebels might try to sneak up behind these and surprise them  something is moving over there announced jeming after watching several of the bushes for a short spell cant make out though if its man or beast  have you plenty of ammunition asked ben who as an officer felt in charge of the party  seventeen rounds captain  and how about you casey  fifteen rounds returned the irish volunteer after counting up the contents of his belt  i have twelve rounds captain came from sorrel but i reckon you know how i shoot an jemings jest as good mebbe better  i think the supply is sufficient said ben so dont run any chances if you think that is an enemy give him a shot but dont hit one of our fellows by mistake he added by way of caution  its a tagal cried jeming while the young captain was yet beside him the gun was levelled like a flash a report followed and the filipino fell behind the bushes and was seen no more  thet will teach em to keep their distance was sorrels comment perhaps theyll clear out soon bein afeered some more o our troops will come this way  but the natives were game as ben expressed it and instead of withdrawing they began to come closer using every bush tree and outbuilding to the best advantage some of their fellows had joined them so that the attacking party now numbered fifteen and each well armed they had seen that ben wore the uniform of a captain and felt that the capture of such an officer would be much to their credit  sergeant kaser was now groaning so that he could be heard even outside of the building and as the rebels had fired through the windows several times they concluded that they had wounded one of the four men they knew to be inside if this was so but three americanos were now left and they felt that victory would soon be within their grasp  surrendor or we kill eferyboddy cried one of the number in english that could scarcely be understood we haf dreety mens outside  we aint surrenderin not by a jugful answered sorrel what in thunder does he mean by dreety mens he added to his companions  i think he means thirty answered ben but i dont believe there are that many  yes but there are more than there was announced casey quickly im just afther seein em pass yonder bushes he had pointed his gun but the filipinos had been too quick for him  do you surrendor demanded the voice again we shall begin to shoot if you no gif up  no surrender answered ben firmly  hardly had he spoken when something came rolling toward the cottage and stopped close to the porch it was a rude ball made of sugarcane husks and over a foot in diameter the ball was ablaze and burning fiercely as if covered with pitch     chapter xv  the escape from the burning house   hullo thats a new wrinkle exclaimed ben they are going to try burning us out  sure an thim haythins is up to all sorts av dodges cried dan casey its meself as would like to git a squint at th feller that threw that  ive got him i reckon whispered sorrel taking a ready aim at a thin hedge to the left of the house the report of his gun was followed by a shriek of pain and a filipino fell into view the blood flowing freely from a wound in his neck soon his companions caught him by the legs and dragged him back into cover  after this brief exchange of compliments as the tall tennesseean called it there came a lull evidently the natives were disconcerted by the unexpected fall of the man who had thrown the fireball and knew not what to do  do you suppose they have quitted the vicinity questioned jeming after listening vainly for some sound from without from a distance came a scattering fire but around the native house was the silence of death for the man who had been shot by sorrel had fainted from loss of blood  they are up to something you can be certain of that answered ben the filipino is at his worst when he is silent  right ye air capn put in sorrel yere she comes aginan a scorcher too  from over the bushes came a huge fireball blazing brightly it struck the thatch of the cottage close to the edge of the roof and before it fell to the ground had set fire to the abode which began to burn as though no shower had wet it for a month  that settles it came from jeming weve got to get out or well be burnt up like rats in a corncrib  but the sergeant began sorrel when a low moan issued from the corner  nevermindme boys came with several gasps imim going goodgoodbyetoto tell mother  he said no more but fell back exhausted all rushed to him but ere anybody could raise his form again he was gone from this earth forever  tears stood in the eyes of ralph sorrel and jeming was scarcely less affected for both had known the sergeant intimately another victim murmured the tall tennesseean how long is this yere blamed war goin ter last anyhow  not much longer i hope answered ben in a low voice i for one have seen enough of bloodshed then the young captain straightened up for fear he might break down but we must attend to our duty and get away if we can see the flames are eating in at the window  all right capn im ready said sorrel but we must carry this yere body outside fust we cant let it be burnt up nohow  he nodded to jeming who understood and covering the form of the dead man with a blanket they marched to the door with the stiffening form the coast seemed clear and they darted out and deposited their grewsome burden on the grass they were just returning to the shelter of the doorway when two shots rang out but neither was effective  by this time the cottage was burning so fiercely that to remain inside longer would have proved highly dangerous accordingly ben called a council of war  i think we had best strike out for the grove of trees on the right he announced the distance is shorter than to the other shelters and the grass is so high that perhaps we can get some benefit by stooping down as we run  right ye air capn answered sorrel and casey and jeming nodded  surrendor you americanos came in a shout from without surrendor you beasts  let them burn up they deserve it came in spanish  all ready asked ben and receiving a nod he hurried to a side window below was a small bush and in a moment he had dropped to the ground as he started through the long grass casey and the others followed him  a wild yell speedily showed that this new movement had been discovered and a dozen shots rang out but the filipinos were too excited to shoot straight and the bullets merely clipped their way through the mango and other trees or buried themselves in the side of the burning building  at first ben thought to fire in return but to find shelter was the prime consideration and on he went holding his pistol in readiness but without pulling the trigger here and there a filipino could be seen flitting from bush to tree but these glimpses were short and far from satisfactory  they are coming came from dan casey just as the nearest of the trees was gained back ye rascals he shouted and fired as quickly as he could casey was right the tagals were surrounding them and now they had to fight back to back in as hot a contest as the young captain had ever seen they were clearly outnumbered but retreat was impossible for the filipinos surrounded them upon every side  what happened during the next five minutes is almost impossible to describe for every movement was executed with lightninglike rapidity the filipinos bound to kill or capture the americans and at the same time afraid that they would slip like eels through their fingers after a score of shots taken at a distance they closed in and ben found himself confronted by two fiercelooking men one armed with a mauser rifle and the other with a wickedlooking bolo the mauser was empty and its owner evidently out of ammunition for as he advanced he used the weapon as a club  ben was hard pressed for his pistol was now empty and there was no chance to reload it but his sword kept the two tagals back and had it not been for his gun one of the enemy would have had his head split open from the blade but now the rascal with the bolo tried to attack the young captain from one side while he with the gun swung around to the other  illustration his sword kept the two tagals backpage 147  ben could expect no aid from his companions for all were as hotly engaged as himself indeed sorrel more so for he was fighting three men while jeming and dan casey side by side and with their backs against a heavy thornbush were fighting the balance of the detachment  the young captain felt that he could do little or nothing more and expected each instant to have his assailants hurl themselves directly upon him when a shout came from sorrel which gave all of our friends hope  some soldiers air comin sang out the tennesseean this way boys this way an be quick about it  whats the matter came in a hoarse growl from the roadway and in a few seconds a whole company of the north dakota troops burst into view their captain a short fat man but one who was an excellent fighter took in the situation at a glance and ordered the filipinos surrounded  taken by surprise the tagals were dumfounded and for half a minute knew not what to do then they started to run but this movement came too late and four went down at the first volley from the newly arrived men the others realizing their helplessness threw down their arms and surrendered  had it hot eh captain said the north dakota man to ben as he came up with a quizzical smile on his round face from which the perspiration was pouring in a stream  yes panted ben you came up in the nick of time and i must thank you for  thats all right captainno more than you would do for me and i know it the north dakota man shook hands its been a long running fight today he added where is your command  that remains to be found out answered ben have you seen any of them during the last two hours i and one of my men became separated from them in the canebrakes  i guess youll find them up near baliuag most of the troops are up there but i wouldnt try going around by this road for the rebels are scattered in small bands all over this territory youll find the main road all right  what will you do with these prisoners  take them up to the main road and send to the colonel for orders  then i will go with you said ben and spoke to the others about it soon the whole party was on the way sorrel and jeming carrying the dead form of sergeant kaser between them with casey trudging near to give them a lift whenever necessary  it was now growing dark and looked as if a thunderstorm was at hand seeing this the detachment pushed forward rapidly until at last the main road was gained here from one of the drivers of a quartermasters turnout they learned that bens regiment had gone into temporary camp on the outskirts of the town of baliuag which was a mile further on a number of americans were missing having become lost in a manner similar to ben and casey  the young captain now lost no time in marching forward once more and reached his regiment in less than half an hour he found his company in charge of gilmore many had given him up for dead and they were delighted at his reappearance  we cant do without you said the acting first lieutenant and as he shook hands his honest face showed that he meant what he said  and i dont know that i can do without my company replied ben anyway im awfully glad to be back in the future i must be a little more careful about keeping the boys in sight     chapter xvi  news from home   it was evident that the majority of the insurgents had now had enough of fighting for while the engagement just mentioned was taking place general luna of the filipinos sent forward his chief of staff to general macarthur with a request that hostilities cease pending a conference of americans and filipinos looking toward a settlement of existing difficulties  but our leaders knew only too well what delay meant and refused to enter into any compact unless the natives first threw down their arms the filipinos wanted their freedom but events had now so shaped themselves that absolute freedom for them appeared to be out of the question so the conference practically amounted to nothing and while this was taking place general hale began to move eastward to join general lawtons command on its march toward san isidro it was the policy of all the american commanders to give the filipinos no rest during the short time left to them before the heaviest of the rainy season set in  a rest of two days did bens company a world of good communications with malolos were now opened and supplies were coming forward rapidly with the supply wagons came carl stummer just from the hospital and still somewhat shaky but eager to be again on the firing line  i could not dink me of stayin any longer he said as he shook hands all around der docther say you vos besser here und i say i tont gits me no besser bis i schmell dot powder purning vonce more alretty  well its powdher yell be afther shmellin soon put in dan casey its forward we go tomorrow so th colonel is afther sayin  goot said carl then he added with a faint smile you see tan i vos afraid you kill all dem filibenos off pefore i could git here  sure an i saved a couple fer ye carl replied his chum yell not be wantin fer a scrap ill warrant and then he related his own and bens adventures to which the german volunteer listened with much interest  the wagon train had brought in the mail and this included the usual letters for benone from walter and the other from uncle job dowling ben breathed a long sigh as he opened the communications    im going to spring a surprise on you so wrote walter ive   been reading the newspapers and it makes me weary to think that i   am just cruising around with our squadron doing nothing while you   and larry are right in it head and heels ive applied for a   transfer to one of the warships in manila waters and it may be   that before this reaches you i will be on the bounding pacific on   my way to join you and larry in our fight with aguinaldo and his   supporters si doring my old yankee chum has applied with me so   well probably come on together and when we get there you and   larry will have to look to your laurels thats all  dear walter murmured ben after reading the letter twice what will he say when he hears that larry is missing if larry doesnt show up it will break his heart and it will break mine too and he brushed away the tears that sprang up in spite of his efforts to keep them down then he turned to the heavy twisted scrawl from his uncle job    its rare good news you have sent ben wrote the old man after   stating that he was in good health and the news comes none too   soon for the party who took a mortgage on my house wants his   money and where i am going to get it i dont know with money so   tight and interest and bonus so high ive told him that braxton   bogg is capturedand he saw it in the newspaper tooand he is   about of a mind to wait for his money now until the bank gets back   what was stolen and settles up for myself i cant hardly wait   till that time comes and after this you can be sure ill be   mighty careful where i put my cash and whats coming to you three   boys too you won that thousand dollars reward fairly and i   hope you and larry wont squander it like most soldiers would i   thought that war would end soon but it appears like it would go   on forever tell larry to take good care of himself and mind that   you dont get shot  poor uncle jobhell be in a hole again murmured ben evidently he wrote this right after i sent word braxton bogg was caught and he doesnt know anything of my being shot and getting over it and of benedicto lupez skipping out with what bogg stole hang the luck but everything seems to be going wrong and ben grated his teeth in a mood hard to explain  whats up ben the question came from gilbert who had just come up to watch the young captain in considerable surprise  ben showed the two communications im just thinking of what i had best write to my uncle job he returned im afraid it will break the old fellows heart to learn that the money is goneand after he is trying to turn over a new leaf too  and the news about larry will cause him pain too i reckon  no doubt butbutwell between you and me gilbert im afraid the money will hurt the worstuncle job always did set such a store by a few dollars as for me id give all ill ever be worth if only i knew larry was safe concluded the young captain arising from a seat under a palm tree as major morris came forward to speak to him  captain im ordered to the front tonight to do a little reconnoitring said the major of the first battalion i thought perhaps you would like to go out with me possibly we can again get on the track of that bogg fortune and he smiled faintly for he had been with ben on the night braxton bogg had been first made a prisoner  ill go out with you gladly answered the young captain promptly but i doubt if that money is ever foundor my brother larry either he added with bitterness  oh cheer up captain you are blue tonight come a little danger will put you on your mettle once more and youll forget all about this thingalthough ill allow its enough to make anybody heartsick  supper was served and the sun had long since sunk to rest over the vast plain and ocean to the westward when ben and major morris set out taking with them an ample supply of ammunition and likewise a days rations for they were to move directly into the heart of the enemys country and might be absent for a day or longer the object of their going was to find out if a certain lieutenant caspard who had deserted the american ranks was with the rebels now gathering at maasin and if so whether or not he was acting as an officer of the filipino forces if they could catch the deserter and bring him back they were to be well rewarded strange to say the orders were not to shoot him if it could be avoided  its a strange mission said major morris as they set out but such are colonel darcys orders and he is backed up in them by the general between you and me i think this caspard has been playing a double game between our forces and those of the filipinos and those at headquarters want to find out just what it means one man told me that this caspard was out of his head and had an idea that he could stop the war by telling the rebels we would grant them everything they want if only they would throw down their arms  would the rebels swallow such a yarn  some of the more ignorant might but that isnt the point caspard may have given them some military information of vast importance you must remember we are in a territory that may be full of pitfalls for us concluded the major  ben thought but little of the ending of this speech at the time but had good cause to remember it before midnight on they pushed past the picket guard and on to a side road which it was said would bring them around to the north side of maasin both were in fairly good humor by this time and the major told many an anecdote of army life which made ben laugh outright the major saw that his companion was indeed blue and was bound to dispel the blues if it could be done  and that story puts me in mind of one on general grant he continued presently grant was sitting in his tent one night when  hush interrupted ben and caught his companion by the shoulder then he pointed into the semidarkness ahead are those rebels or friends  the road they were pursuing was for the most part a winding one but they had now gained a straight stretch the farther end of which was somewhat in the open looking in that direction ben had discerned six or seven figures stealing silently along guns on shoulders and packs on their backs  major morris came to a halt and surveyed the figures attentively i dont believe they are our men he whispered none of the troops came as far as thisso the general stated  then if they are rebels what have they been doing went on ben see they have picks and shovels and axes  perhaps its an engineering corps and the major laughed softly at what he considered his little joke these tagals are bound to be uptodate you know  well if they are an engineering corps what have they been doing demanded the young captain who felt by no means satisfied at his companions words  ill give it upno i wont ill go forward and investigate came from the major there they go around the turn and walking just as fast as they can if we want to catch up to them we will have to hurry  we dont want to get too close major they are not the game we are after remember  true captain but it wont do any harm to find out what we can of them we may be doing general lawton a great service by such an action  the night was cloudy and as they pushed forward to the bend in the road it became darker than ever until they could see hardly anything of what was ahead of them the way was evidently little used for the grass grew thickly even in the centre of the highway  the pair were going on side by side and with eyes strained to catch sight of those who had gone before when suddenly major morris felt the ground giving way beneath him my gracious he ejaculated and caught ben by the arm at the same instant the young captain uttered a cry and also felt himself going down then came the snapping of slender bamboo poles and the scattering of some loose grass and down into darkness and space shot the pair swallowed up utterly by a hole which had unexpectedly opened to receive them     chapter xvii  in and out of a strange pitfall   major morris and ben had fallen into a pit dug by the filipinos for the purpose of catching their enemies it was an old trick and one which had been used quite extensively at the opening of the rebellion but which was now falling into disuse for the reason that few americans were ever caught by the device  the method was to dig a square hole in the centre of some trail or road which the americans would probably use in their advance at the bottom of this hole would be planted upright a number of sharp bamboo sticks and then the top would be covered over with slender bamboo sticks and loose grass or palm leaves if one or more persons stepped upon the top sticks they would break at once and the unfortunates would fall upon the sharp points below which were certain to inflict more or less serious injury  fortunately however for the young captain and his companion the hole into which they had tumbled was not provided with the sharp sticks mentioned the natives had just finished the opening when an officer had called upon them to leave the vicinity as it was getting dangerous owing to the rapid advances made by the americans so the trap had been set with its most dangerous element lacking  yet the fall was by no means a pleasant one and for a brief instant the young captain of company d thought that the bottom had dropped out of everything and that he would surely be killed he tried to catch hold of something but all he could reach was the majors shoulder and then both landed with a thud on the soft dirt left at the bottom of the hole  ben was the first on his feet which was not saying much since the bottom of the opening was not level and he stood in the soft loam up to his ankles shaking himself to find that no bones were broken he drew a long breath  major are you all right he asked  nonoim not allall right came with a gasp ive had my wiwind knocked ouout of me  any bones broken  i gueguess not but whwho ever heard of such a confounded trick  ive heard of it several times major but we are not as bad off as we might have been had the rebels put some sharp sticks down here to spit us with  true major morris gave a grunt and wiped the dirt from his eyes well i reckon weve learned what their engineering corps was up to  this was said so dryly that in spite of his discomfiture ben was compelled to laugh  yes weve learned the question is now we are down here how are we going to get out  better make a light and see how deep the hole is first replied the commander of the first battalion  fortunately ben had plenty of matches with him and striking one he lit a bamboo stalk and held it up as a torch by the flickering light thus afforded they saw that the hole was about eight feet wide and twice as long the level of the road above was fully eight feet over their heads  looks as if we were in a box eh captain said the major grimly  were certainly in a hole responded ben but i think we can get out without much trouble i wish we had a spade  well wishing wont bring one and there is nothing here to take the place of one either  nothing but our hands here if youll hold the light ill see what i can do  here is a bit of a flat stick try that rejoined major morris and taking the article mentioned ben set to work with vigor attacking one end of the hole by loosening the dirt so that a large portion of it soon fell at their feet standing upon the fallen portion he continued his operations and presently more of the dirt fell leaving an incline up which both began to scramble on hands and knees it was not a very dignified thing to do but it was far better than to remain in the hole and besides there was nobody at hand to comment on the want of dignity in the movement  we are well out of that began major morris brushing off his clothing as he spoke in the future  hold on major somebody is coming interrupted ben and pulled his companion back he had seen a faint light advancing toward them from a side road which joined the main road at a point but a few yards distant soon he made out a heavy cart approaching drawn by a pair of caribaos or water buffaloes on the seat of the cart sat two sleepylooking natives  we must stop that cart was the majors comment if we dont there will be a bad smashup  i dont think its a good plan to expose ourselves replied ben  but do you want those chaps to break their necks demanded the commander of the first battalion more than likely they are amigos  ive got a plan for warning them major  as ben spoke he picked up some of the driest of the grass and palm leaves and applied a match to the stuff it blazed up readily and he threw the mass in with the other stuff about the edge of the hole  there if they cant see that they must be blind he said come let us get out and off they ran for the thicket close at hand from here they watched the cart and saw it come to a halt near the hole and knew that the turnout was safe  i shouldnt think the rebels would care to leave those holes about was major morris comment as they pushed on once more they are as dangerous to their own people as they are to us  i suppose they tell their own people about them  those men on the buffalo cart evidently knew nothing  the rebels dont care for the amigos their idea is if a native is not with them he is against them and must suffer with the americans  to play the part of spies in such a country as this was not easy for the americans were easily distinguished from the natives had ben and the major spoken spanish fluently they might have passed for spaniards as each was tanned from constant exposure to the strong sun but this could not be and so they had to go ahead and trust to luck to see them through with their dangerous errand  at length they felt that they must be close to the enemys picket line and paused to consider the situation before them was a gentle slope terminating at a small but deep stream which flowed into the rio grande river  i think some of the rebels are over there said the major pointing to a hill from the top of which could be seen a faint glow there is certainly a campfire back there  there is a house just below us returned ben or is it a mill  a mill most likely they wouldnt build an ordinary dwelling right at the waters edge  perhaps the rebels are using the mill as a sort of headquarters what do you say if we investigate  the major agreed and they began to pick their way along the stream soon they reached a rude bridge and were on the point of crossing when a sharp cry rang out from the building they were approaching  hullo thats a womans voice exclaimed ben somebody is in trouble  help thief murderer came in spanish oh help for the love of kind heaven help  its a woman true enough ejaculated the major i wonder what the trouble is  im going to find out answered ben the cry for aid appealed to his heart and he bounded toward the millhouse for such the building proved to be without further hesitation nor was major morris far behind him  as they came closer they saw that the structure was dark saving for a faint light that came from one of the rooms built over the mill stream it was in this room evidently that some sort of struggle was going on for now both heard the cry for help repeated followed by the overturning of a table then came the voices of two men and the cry came to a sudden end  two men are misusing some woman cried ben come on and rushing around to the front of the building he found the rickety stairs leading to the house floor and bounded upward the door at the top stood ajar and he pushed it in with major morris at his heels the room at hand was dark the struggle was going on in the apartment next to it  ben paused long enough to see that his pistol had not sustained any injury in the tumble into the hole and was ready for use and then threw open the door before him  the light in the room was not very bright but coming out of the darkness ben could see but little for a few seconds the room was thick with the smoke of cigarettes and through the haze the young captain made out two men standing beside an overturned table one with a knife in his hand to his intense surprise the men were americans and dressed in the uniforms of regulars  what does this mean he demanded what are you  and then ben got no further for a swift look around the room told him that the two men were alonethat the woman he had heard crying for help was not there     chapter xviii  the adventure at the millhouse   for the moment it must be confessed that ben was absolutely dumfounded and major morris also they had fully expected to see a woman in the hands of the regulars before them and they could scarcely believe the evidence of their own senses  but if the officers were astonished the men they confronted were likewise taken back and stared in amazement which quickly gave way to consternation  what do you want demanded one as soon as he could speak and then he glanced over their shoulders to see if the newcomers were alone  we thought we heard a woman in trouble answered ben slowly  and we did hear a woman put in the major where is she  the two regulars exchanged unsteady glances for each was somewhat the worse for liquor there aint no woman here answered one of them sullenly  then who was crying for help persisted the young captain  see here capn you are on the wrong trail came from the older of the regulars me and bills jest been having a little rumpus between ourselves we meant no harm by it  i dont believe you came from major morris promptly there is some mystery here and as sure as youre born im going to find out what it is he went on  the major had scarcely finished when bens eyes fell to the floor and he saw the outline of a trapdoor under one of the regulars feet one edge of the door was raised about half an inch above the floor proper as if the door had been opened and not put back evenly into place  major look at that trapdoor he cried ill wager they used it while we were coming up the outside stairs  you must be right captain if youll  we didnt use no trapdoor shouted the younger of the regulars but he appeared much disconcerted over the discovery ben had made  captain i have them covered came from major morris as he brought out the two pistols with which he had wisely provided himself perhaps you had better investigate  i will returned the young captain and backed out of the room the regulars wanted to stop him but aiming his weapons at them the major told them to hold their peace  if everything is all right you wont be harmed he said but it doesnt look right to me you have no business here for one thing  and what business have you here demanded the older regular and then he changed his manner we were captured in the fight of last week and were just trying to get back to our lines again  well talk about that when my friend the captain gets back my man if we are treating you unjustly ill apologize and do the handsome thing by you he added  in the meantime ben was making his way down to the bank of the stream under the mill with all possible speed it was extremely dark and he had to pick his way with caution for fear of tumbling into some ugly hollow below the mill was a fall of water and here the stream ran between a series of sharp rocks  ben had just gained the bank of the stream when a low moan reached his ears at first he could not locate the sound but presently discovered that it came from the vicinity of the rocks feeling his way along he managed but not without great difficulty to gain the top of the rocks here he saw the water foaming and boiling twenty feet below  that woman must be down there he muttered then he raised his voice where are you  down here by the rocks came back faintly help please help me  locating the voice as well as he was able the young captain began crawling down from one rock to another this was difficult work and he had to move with extreme care for fear of a tumble which would land him directly into the boiling stream at last however he found himself perched on a bit of a shelf with the water less than two feet away  from this point of view he beheld the sufferer who was swinging in the water with her arms tightly clutching a sharp stone which reared its point just above the surface of the stream he saw that she was evidently a spanish woman well along in years and that her dress was sadly torn and her long hair was floating loosely over her neck and face  it must be confessed that the young captain was perplexed over the situation that confronted him the sufferer was just beyond his reach and he felt that to plunge into the water after her would be to take a big risk for if the stream at this point was over his waist the force of the current would carry him off in an instant  can you hold on a few minutes longer he called out  illustration can you hold on a few minutes longerpage 173  no no i am too weak came more faintly than ever help me quickly and heaven will reward you  i will do what i canbut you must hold tight for a minute answered ben  just above his head a number of bushes were growing and among these he had espied a long stoutlooking shoot clambering to this he pulled out his pocketknife and cut it off then he leaped down once more and holding tight to the rocks with one hand shoved out the branch with the other catch hold if you can he cried  the woman understood and gave up the rock for the stick and ben pulled her toward him it was no easy task and once it looked as if she would lose her hold and be swept away but in a minute the danger was past and the young captain was hauling her up to where he stood she was thoroughly exhausted and no sooner did he have her in his arms than she fainted  one difficulty had been overcome but another still remained and that was to get up to the safe ground above the rocks but once again the bushes growing out of the crevices came into play and hauling himself from one to another ben at last found himself safe with his burden resting heavily over his shoulder  it was now that the young captain found the woman was suffering from a blow over the left temple from which the blood was slowly trickling laying the form down he brought out his handkerchief and bound up the wound as well as he was able this had just been accomplished when the sufferer came again to her senses and stared around her in bewilderment  youyouam i safe she asked in broken english but in a sweet voice which went straight to bens heart  yes madam you are safe he answered did those two men throw you into the stream  yes yes oh they are villains señorgreat villains  i must say they look it even if they are of our troops replied the young captain come do you think you can walk back to the mill with me  the woman said she would try and he assisted her to her feet she was still very weak and readily consented to lean on his arm and thus they moved slowly back the way the captain of company d had come  during all this time ben had not heard a sound from the house and he was anxious to know how major morris was faring although feeling positive that the major was fully capable of taking care of himself now as they came closer he heard loud talking  we aint goin to stay majoran it aint right fer you to ask us to the older of the regulars was saying  you will stay and thats the end of it came in the majors cleancut tones if you attempt to pass through that doorway ill put a bullet through you  but we are friends major and  i dont know that i am a friend to you it depends upon what my companion the captain will have to report when he gets back  he wont have nuthin to report so far as we are concerned put in the younger regular we aint done any wrong ceptin to quarrel a bit between us everybody has a setto once in a while you know  by this time ben was tramping up the outside stairs supporting the woman as before now he pushed his way into the outer room of the millhouse the woman following with some hesitancy at the appearance of their late victim the regulars fell back as though struck a blow  nice sort of chaps you are exclaimed ben hotly you dont deserve to wear uncle sams uniform a set of prison stripes would suit both of you much better  hullo youve found the lady cried the major sit down madam and tell us what this means  a bench was handy and the sufferer dropped heavily upon it the regulars looked as if they wished themselves anywhere but in their present situation yet they did not dare to budge for major morris still held the drop upon them and the commander of the first battalion looked as if he would stand no nonsense  these men came here to rob me said the woman slowly they are of your kind but they are not honest  then they are not of our kind answered ben promptly we do not allow our soldiers to rob anybody  we didnt come to steal began the older regular when major morris stopped him  silence not another word until the lady has finished her story  there was a second of painful silence and the lady continued i am staying at the mill alone for my husband has gone to the laguna de bay on business several hours ago these two soldiers came in and demanded that i serve them with a hot supper not wishing to have trouble i gave them the best i had but they were not satisfied and broke into my husbands wine closet and drank two bottles of his choicest wine and smoked his best cigarettes package after package then after drinking much wine they demanded that i give them money and that man pointing to the older prisoner told his companion that i must have money hidden somewhere as all the spanish millowners in luzon were rich while the truth is we are very poor as the war has taken away everything then the men drank more and at last they caught hold of me and threatened me with great violence if i did not give up what i had hidden away i gave them the little silver i had but they were not satisfied and when i tried to run away one hit me over the head with this bench then they plotted to get me out of the way entirely and go on a hunt for money themselves i cried louder than ever and then you started to come in one of the men had opened that trap leading to the river and as you came up the outer stairs both dropped me down no doubt to drown me i was swept down to the rocks at the falls and there the capitan saved me god bless him for it     chapter xix  news of larry   for a minute after the spanish woman finished nobody in the millhouse spoke her tale had impressed both ben and the major deeply and they looked with cold contempt at the two regulars who had so disgraced the uniform they wore  this is a fine doings truly said major morris at length i wonder what your commander will say when he hears of it  if you please they have deserted the american army put in the woman they said as much while they were drinking my husbands wine  it aint so burst out the older regular fiercely and that woman has told you a string of  shut up interrupted the major sternly i will take this ladys word against yours every timeafter what i have witnessed of both of you your name please  i aint telling my name jest now was the sullen response  arent you up came the majors pistol again your name i said  jack rodgrew  and what is yours went on the commander of the first battalion turning to the younger regular  the man hesitated for a second my name is jerry crossing  indeed how is it your mate called you bill awhile ago  whyerer  i dont believe either of the names is correct went on the major  he is called bill and the other is yadder put in the spanish woman i heard the names many times  then that will answer since i also have your company and regiment now then throw down your cartridge belts  throw em down howled the regular called bill  that is what i said throw them down at once  but see here major  i wont stop to argue with you throw the belts down or take the consequences  and what will the consequences be questioned yadder  the consequences will be that i will form myself into a courtmartial find you guilty of desertion and shoot you down where you stand come do those belts go down or not  i reckon they go down grumbled yadder and unloosening the article he allowed it to slip to the floor seeing which his companion followed suit  now both of you hold your hands over your heads while captain russell searches you for concealed weapons  we aint got no concealed weapons  i didnt ask you to talk i told you to hold up your hands  with exceeding bad grace the two deserters for such they really proved to be held up their arms approaching them ben went through one pocket after another and felt in their bosoms each had a long native knife such as are usually used in the ricefields  i suppose you do not call those concealed weapons was major morriss comment as ben came over to him with the knives and the cartridge belts the rascals guns stood back of the door behind the commander of the first battalion  it aint fair to take everything away from us began yadder when two shots fired in rapid succession cut him short the shots came from up the stream and not over fifty yards from the millhouse soon followed a shouting of voices and all in the place knew that a band of rebels were approaching  they are after somebody exclaimed ben they are coming  the young captain got no further for just then there sounded a clatter on the outer steps and a second later an american soldier burst into the millhouse he was in tatters and his left arm hung limply by his side for he had been shot in the shoulder  americans he gasped as he cast a hurried glance about thank god for that the rebels are after me half a dozen strong  he went up into the house came from without in the tagalog dialect  after him men the americano must not escape us  and then footsteps were heard around the house and on the stairs ben and the major looked at each other questioningly what was to be done  the trap whispered the young captain if they come up here we can escape through that  there was no time to say more for already the rebels were coming up the stairs shouting loudly for the escaped americano to give himself up they advanced in a body evidently not caring to separate in the darkness and thinking to find the man alone  with quick wit ben ran and placed the table against the door and on this piled the bench  now the trap and be quick he whispered and major morris understood flinging open the door in the floor he looked down to behold the stream flowing beneath  follow meits the best way out he said to the escaped prisoner then he dropped down holding his pistols over his head that they might not get wet  the wounded man was in a desperate humor and lost no time in following by this time the rebels were hammering lustily on the door which ben was holding shut  what are we to do demanded the older of the deserters are you  you can take care of yourselves answered the young captain and rushing over to the trapdoor he let himself through closing the trap after him then came a plunge into the water but the stream here was less than four feet deep and he followed major morris and the wounded man to the bank without difficulty a loud shouting came from overhead followed by a storm of words from both rebels and deserters and also from the spanish woman fortunately for the woman among the rebels was a nephew who at once came to her aid and had the two deserters from the american army made prisoners  we had better put a little distance between ourselves and that mill suggested major morris as all three shook the water from their lower garments  how is it are you badly wounded asked ben turning to their newly made companion  oh i can go ahead said the soldier its rather painful though  well take care of it for you at the first chance we get added ben and then the three set off at a brisk pace along the stream and over the rocks to a grove in which they felt they would be comparatively safe until daylight if no longer  as the millhouse was left behind all became quiet and in the grove nothing disturbed them but the hum of the insects and the occasional cry of some night bird  lighting a match ben examined the mans wound and bound it up with the majors handkerchief his own having been left behind with the spanish woman the stranger said that his name was barton brownell  i have been a prisoner of the insurgents for some time he said when asked to tell his story i was captured just before our troops took malolos they had six prisoners all told and they took us to a place called guinalo which is probably forty miles from here and up in the mountains  while you were a prisoner did you see or hear anything of a lieutenant caspard asked major morris quickly  to be sure i did burst out barton brownell he came to see me several times he has joined hands with the insurgents and he wanted me to join them too but i told him i would rot first added the wounded man and his firmness showed that he meant what he said  and was caspard in the field with the rebels  yes he was hand in glove with general luna and the other rebel leaders and i think he had turned over some messages from general otiss headquarters to the rebels but candidly speaking i think lieutenant caspard is somewhat off in his head once he came to me and said that if only i and the other prisoners would join him we could end this shedding of blood inside of a week  he must be crazy to join the rebels put in ben does he hold any position under them  they call him capitan but if he has such a position it is merely a nominal one i think the natives are beginning to suspect that he is not quite right in his mind but still they love to hear him praise them and they swallow a good bit of what he says like so many children  for the moment major morris was silent then he turned to ben our mission seems to have come to a sudden end he said brownell can tell colonel darcy all he wants to know and he related to the escaped prisoner the reason for their coming beyond the american lines  yes i reckon i can tell the colonel well enough answered barton brownell for i saw caspard often as i mentioned before and he never knew what it was to keep his tongue from wagging  and how did you escape asked ben with interest  in a very funny way and the soldier laughed as i said before we were kept up in the mountains in a large cave there were six of our troop but all told the prisoners numbered twentyeight there was a guard of four rebels to keep us from escaping and an old woman called mother beautiful because she was so ugly used to cook our food for usand the food was mighty scanty i can tell you that  well one day two of the guards went off leaving the old woman and the other two guards in sole charge there had been a raid of some kind the day before and the guards had some fiery liquor which made them about half drunk the old woman got mad over this and she was more angry than ever when one of the guards refused to get her a pail of water from a neighboring spring ill get the water mother says i bowing low to her and would you believe it she made the two guards let me out just to get her the water  and the water hasnt arrived yet said major morris laughing  no the water hasnt arrived yet answered barton brownell as soon as i reached the spring i dropped the pail and ran for all i was worth and hid in the brush along the mountain side i stayed there two days and nearly starved to death then they hunted me out and i received this wound but i escaped them and made my way through the jungle and over the ricefields to here and here i am  you say there were twentyeight prisoners all told cried ben did you ever hear anything of my brother larry russell  larry russell repeated barton brownell thoughtfully to be sure i did he is a sailor from the olympia isnt he  yes yes and was he with you  he was at first but he wasnt when i left they moved some of the prisoners away and he was among them so he was your brother that beats all doesnt itto think i should fall in with you in such a place as this     chapter xx  the advance upon maasin   ben was much surprised and also delighted to learn that barton brownell had met larry and he lost no time in questioning the escaped soldier regarding his missing brother  yes your brother was with me about two weeks said barton brownell he came up with a detachment of rebels from the laguna de bay after general lawton left that territory  and was he well or had he been wounded  he was suffering from a cut in the head a spaniard had kicked himand yes he told me it was a spaniard that you and he were after for having robbed a bank of some money  benedicto lupez ejaculated ben more astonished than ever  thats the name your brother had run across that man and his brother at santa cruz and he was trying to make this benedicto lupez a prisoner when the brother kicked him in the head and then both of them ran away and when your brother realized what was going on again he found himself a prisoner he was taken to a camp near the north shore of the laguna de bay and afterward transferred to the cave where i was held  i am thankful that he is alive murmured the young captain and breathed silent thanks to god for his mercy do you know where they took larry to  i cant say exactly but i know that a great many of the rebels are retreating to the mountains back of san isidro i wouldnt be surprised to hear of aguinaldo making his final stand there  i would give all i am worth to gain my brother his liberty  and i reckon he would give all he is worth to escape rejoined brownell the boys hate to be kept prisoners and try all sorts of devices to get away one fellow had some gold hidden on his person and tried to bribe a guard with it but the guard only laughed at him and stole the money  of course you do not know what became of benedicto lupez and his brother  no your brother knew nothing further than that they ran off after the assault on him concluded brownell  the talking had somewhat exhausted the wounded man and ben forbore to question him further just then while barton brownell rested easily on some moss the young captain turned to the commander of the first battalion  what shall we do next major  i think we had better be getting back was the ready answer the sooner we report to the colonel the better he will be pleased  i feel like pushing right through to san isidro on a hunt for my brother  it would be a foolish movement captain for unless i am greatly mistaken the insurgents have a large force in front of us and to attempt breaking through would be taking a big risk be thankful that your brother is safe thus far as long as he remains quiet i dont think the rebels will harm him  ben could not but believe that this was good advice and he agreed to do as the major thought best it was now three oclock in the morning and half an hour later they started thinking to rejoin their command before daylight  it was an exhausting tramp the more so because brownell had to be assisted by one or the other for the entire distance  im a great drag sighed the wounded soldier perhaps you had better push on and let me shift for myself but the major and the captain would not hear of this  they had one little brush with two of the filipino pickets before getting into the american lines but the rebels were young men and not very courageous and let them slip by without great trouble  it was major morris who made the report to the colonel taking ben and brownell with him colonel darcy was greatly interested  it is then as i supposed he said this information will be of great value to us major morris and he thanked the major and ben for what they had done brownells report was also received with close consideration by general lawton himself  if the prisoners have been taken to san isidro we must try our best to liberate them said the general i am so glad to learn though that the rebels are not illtreating them as i had supposed  it was ben assisted by casey who saw brownell to the hospital and had the wounded soldier given every attention when they parted brownell although now so exhausted that he could scarcely speak shook the young captains hand warmly  i hope you find your brother soon he said i can imagine how bad it makes you feel to know that he is a prisoner  the advance of general lawtons command was now directed at maasin a few miles beyond baliuag it was led by colonel summers who took with him some oregon dakota and third infantry troops and a battery of the utah light artillery with other troops following including bens battalion with major morris at its head as before the advance was along the main road and through the ricefields canebrakes and the jungle with the air so oppressive that it felt as though coming out of a steaming oven  i dink me i vos right in it from der start alretty exclaimed carl stummer as he plodded along dis vos vorse as der march on malolos eh tan  sure an its no picnic replied the irish volunteer but thin carl me by ye must remimber we didnt come out here fer fun we kem out fer to show thim haythins how to behave thimselves an grow up into useful an ornamental citizens av the greatest republic that iver brathed th breath av life  chust so returned the german volunteer but it vos uphill vork ennahow and he sighed deeply carl could fight as well as any oldtime trooper but the long tramps through the jungle always disgusted him  there was the river to cross upon which the millhouse was located and ben could not help but wonder if the spanish woman was still at the structure and how the american deserters had fared but the millhouse was too far away to visit and now the battalion was ordered into action on the upper side of the stream  gangway for general lawton was the cry that reached bens ears a few minutes later and then came a crashing of horses hoofs and the tall general rode through their open ranks followed by several members of his staff as was usual the general was bound for the firing line to personally direct the movements of the men under him many were the times that the members of his staff urged him not to make a target of himself he would not listen and in the end this daring exposure cost the gallant leader his life  but now all was excitement for a large force of rebels had been uncovered and there was no telling but what the jungle ahead concealed even more we are up against it fellows shouted one of the sergeants let us rush em for keeps and on swept the battalion until the steady poppop of mausers and the crack of the springfields could be heard upon every side  bens company was no longer as large as it had been for death and disease had sadly depleted the ranks yet the fortysix men in the command were now thoroughly seasoned fighters and all loved their young and dashing leader and would have followed him anywhere  presently an orderly dashed up to major morris  major colonel darcy wishes you to take your command up yonder hill the rebels have a battery up there as you can see if you can rush the position he will send another battalion to your support  tell colonel darcy i will obey the order answered major morris then he turned to the four companies boys we are ordered to take yonder hill and the two fieldpieces perched on top of it come on and i will lead you  he waved his sword and away went the first battalion on the double quick two companies to the front there was first a slight hollow to cross and then came a thicket of brambles where many a uniform was reduced to rags the battery at the top of the hill saw them coming and directed a heavy fire at their advance  hot work cried the major as he ranged up alongside of ben i am afraid the carrying out of this order will cost us dear  if youll allow me to make a suggestion major began ben  make a dozen captain  why not take a course to the left then  for what reason  there is a big rock on that side on the very top of the hill  but we cant climb that rock  no and neither can the rebels fire over it with their fieldpieces when we get up to the rock we can march around it  well spoken russellyoure a born strategist cried the major who was too generous to have any ill feeling because somebody offered him a suggestion well go that way and he immediately gave necessary orders  but the advance was by no means easy and soon the battalion found itself under such a galling fire that the men were glad enough to seek the shelter of every rock and bush which came handy the battery could not do everything and afraid of having his pieces taken from him the captain had called upon several companies of the filipinos to assist him in maintaining his position  down suddenly shouted gilbert pennington and down went the men and the next instant a shell burst directly over their heads  this is hot and no mistake murmured ben then he turned to his command forward men the sooner we take that position the better it will be for us and up the hill he dashed with casey stummer and the rest following as best they could for the way was steep and uncertain at last the very edge of the big rock was gained and company d poured around its left side to find themselves suddenly confronted by a body of tagalos fully a hundred strong in the meantime the other companies under major morris were coming up on the opposite side of the rock ben was on the point of shouting some additional words of encouragement to his men when he found himself face to face with a mighty igorrote warrior who with his long lance seemed determined to pierce the young captain through and through     chapter xxi  camping over a powder magazine   bang  it was the report of bens pistol and the weapon was aimed directly for the igorrotes head for the young captain had learned the value of aiming and firing quickly  but the filipino had been there before and as the trigger went down he dropped to the ground with the rapidity of lightning and the bullet intended for him struck a man some distance in the rear then up leaped the igorrote once more and bounded onward the lance point aimed directly for bens throat  the young captains pistol was now empty the other shots having been discharged during the climb up the hill his sword was out but the lance was three times the length of the blade so he was still at a disadvantage yet he aimed a blow at the barbed point and thus turned it aside  ha hissed the filipino and drew back then he struck again at ben and instantly both slipped on the moist grass and fell directly into each others clutches the igorrote was a powerful warrior and grasped bens throat with the tightness of a steel band  ben tried to cry out but not a sound could he make his eyes bulged from their sockets and he felt his breath leaving him a second igorrote leaped forward to hit him on the head with a war club such as some of the igorrote still insisted upon carrying of the use of rifles this tribe of the filipinos knew little or nothing  back ye nager came in dan caseys voice and there followed a sickening thud and down went the enemy with the club his head split open by a blow from the irish volunteers gunstock casey then aimed a second blow at the rebel who had hold of ben but not wishing to receive such a dose as had been meted out to his companion the other igorrote sprang up butted casey in the stomach with his head thus landing the irishman on his back and then ran for his life toward the nearest shelter of brush  oh be gracious to look at that now spluttered the irishman as he arose but i got wan av thim anyhow captain he added with a jerk of his thumb toward the igorrote who lay with a broken head  yes casey and you saved me too returned ben earnestly you are worth two ordinary men and then captain and private drifted apart as the tide of battle rolled forward  the top of the hill was gained but for once the insurgents did not know when they were whipped and held to their guns until more than half of their number were either killed or wounded the contest raged to the right and the left of the battery and this was fortunate for seeing they could not hold the pieces some of the rebels overcharged one of the guns and set it off blowing it into a thousand pieces then the main body retreated into the jungle carrying a few of their wounded with them  by this time it was raining again and the downpour on the top of the hill was so great that little could be seen of the condition of affairs at a distance sending word that the hill was taken and one oldfashioned spanish fieldpiece captured major morris rallied his battalion around him and stood on the defensive but the rebels had had enough of fighting for the present and once again took up the retreat in the direction of san isidro  i reckon that was hot enough for anybody said the major as he stalked up to ben and the other captains under him i wonder if anybody was killed by the explosion of that old cannon  nobody was killed but several were wounded answered one of the captains the rebel who charged her up and then fired her had lots of nerve he added  word soon came back from general lawton that the battalion should hold the hill until further orders the situation was not a pleasant one but orders must be obeyed and the various companies proceeded to make themselves as comfortable as possible which was not saying much since the top of the hill afforded little or no shelter one company was detailed to do picket duty but a little scouting soon proved that the rebels were a mile or more distant  when the main body of the troops under general lawton marched into maasin they found the pretty little town all but deserted in a few of the huts the inhabitants remained having hung out dirty white rags to show that they were amigos here were also numerous chinos or chinese some of mixed blood and all ready to do anything for the american soldiers provided they were paid for it natives and chinos went about bared to the waist casting fearful eyes at those who had so suddenly disturbed the peace of their homesteads for the inhabitants of maasin were peaceably inclined and took but little interest in the war aguinaldo and his followers had instituted  well we are one step nearer to san isidro remarked gilbert when he got the chance to talk to ben i suppose we cant get there any too quick for you  i dont know gilbert you must remember that while larry may be near san isidro now he may be miles off when we reach there these filipinos change their capital and their prisons as quickly as a flea jumps  never mind well keep them on the jump until they drop answered the young southerner they cant stand up before us forever  to my way of thinking i dont believe this war will come to definite end gilbert  what do you mean ben they have got to stop sometimeor else we have got to stop  these filipinos are not pulling togetheron the contrary they are split up into half a dozen factions if we defeat one faction the others will still keep on and besides that the worst of the rebels are of malayan blood pirates and bandits i believe after we have whipped them as an army they will still keep on fighting in small bodies somewhat after the order of the brigands in mexico and northern africa with the mountains to fly to such brigands could keep on worrying an american army for years  possibly but when the main body of the natives see what we want to do for them theyll be as anxious as we to wipe out such brigands and with their own people after them life will be pretty uncomfortable ill wager to be sure there will always be robbers just as there are outlaws and trainwreckers in the western states of our own country  some of the men had found a small opening between the rocks and over this had hung their tents making a rude shelter which ben and gilbert were glad to share with them in the crowd were casey and stummer and the latter busied himself in trying to make a cup of hot chocolate over a handful of dry twigs found in the shelter the attempt was hardly a success yet the drink was better for the convalescent than either water or liquor would have been  sure an if this shtorm kapes up well all be dhrowned out was caseys comment as he shifted his feet to keep them out of a rising puddle now who would think the water would rise on the top av a hill things do be mighty peculiar in luzon an thats a fact  never mind casey youll get back home some day put in another soldier and in years to come youll be telling your grandchildren what a mighty fighter you were out in the state of luzon recently annexed to the united states along with the state of hawaii and a laugh went up over the conceit  sure an you tont haf nodding to grumble ofer of you tont git shot said stummer  or dont get taken down with disease put in another my but i pity the fellows with fever and chills and malaria and the other things that are just as bad i believe about onefifth of the army is now on the sick list  some of the boys are going to send a petition to general otis for relief they say they cant stand it much longer  so the talk went on both ben and gilbert saying but little presently major morris poked his nose into the opening  i think you boys had better come out of there he said shortly  why major began several  are we to advance asked others  no we are not going to advance unless its skyward continued the major either come out of that or else put out that fire and be mighty careful about it  the fire aint doing no harm grumbled a private under his breath  i dont believe the enemy can see the smoke in this rain suggested another thinking that this was the cause of their being disturbed  im not thinking of the enemy boys im thinking of you better come out and then well put out that fire as carefully as we can  seeing that something unusual was in the wind one after another of the officers and privates came forth from the hollow stummer giving the fire a kick as he passed as soon as they were outside they surrounded the commander of the first battalion  now boys do you know why i called you out asked major morris with just the suspicion of a twinkle in his clear eyes  no why was it came from a dozen voices  because i wanted to save your lives was the quiet response  save our lives major you must be joking  no i am not joking we have just captured one of the rebel gunners who was in command of the piece that was blown to atoms he says that this hollow where you had your campfire was their powder magazine and that they left all of a hundred and fifty pounds of powder stored there hidden under the moss and dead leaves     chapter xxii  the result of an ambush   good gracious do you mean to say we have been camping over a powder magazine gasped gilbert as soon as he could speak  sure an its a wondher we wasnt all blowed to hivin came from dan casey  und i boil mine chocolate so calmly as you blease put in carl stummer with a shudder py chiminy i tont vos build no fire no more bis i vos sure of mine ground  for several minutes the excitement was intense and all of the soldiers retreated to a considerable distance from the hollow which had proved such a comfortable shelter  presently however ben gilbert and several others mustered up courage enough to go back and haul down the coverings put up then came another heavy downpour of rain which speedily extinguished the fire and the danger of an explosion was past  an examination under the rocks proved that the filipino gunner had told the truth the powder was there in big cans bearing the old spanish stamp some was marked 1876 and was so old as to be practically worthless  they ought to have shot that off in honor of our centennial remarked the young captain i dont wonder the rebels cant hit anything this powder has no carrying power left to it  nevertheless the powder was carted off and added to the american stock then general lawton rode up and major morris told in detail what had been accomplished  with the fall of maasin came another day of muchneeded rest for the majority of the troops under general lawton in the meantime while these soldiers were advancing from angat upon san isidro the command under general macarthur was far from idle the filipino commissioners wanted a three months armistice in order that the terms of a peace might be discussed but to this the americans would not listen as they felt the enemy wished mainly to gain time in which to reorganize their shattered forces  macarthurs command was now in possession of calumpit on the railroad and apalit just above on the rio grande while the rebels in this territory began to mass at st tomas and at san fernando still further northward on the railroad on may the 4th macarthurs division set out from apalit with hales command on the right wing and wheatons on the left  it was not supposed that the rebels would make a serious stand short of san fernando but at st tomas they were developed in force and a running fight ensued lasting several hours but without great loss to the americans finding they could not hold st tomas the filipinos set fire to the town and fled they were pursued with vigor and attempted to burn san fernando late that night but failed to do so  early in the morning the fighting was renewed and near san fernando another battle took place but the rebels were disheartened by the defeat at st tomas and were soon on the run and general hale drove them a mile beyond san fernando in taking possession of the town it was found that several of the public buildings were in ruins the defensive works here were very strong and had the filipinos stood up to their work like real fighters they might have held the position for a long time  on saturday may the 6th bens command moved forward again down the hill into maasin now patrolled by americans and then to the main road beyond  i dont believe we are in for much of a fight today remarked the young captain to gilmore who had now been appointed first lieutenant  i reckon you are right answered gilmore the scouts havent found any rebels within a mile  it would almost seem as if we could march straight through to san isidro went on ben thoughtfully i must say i never heard of such a campaign  they say general lawton puts it down as a regular indian campaign but then the rebels dont do much fighting in the dark  they are sick of it gilmore i believe they would give up in a minute if the leaders were only assured that they would come out whole as the saying goes  well theyve gone too far to come out whole captain general aguinaldo may mean well but he never went at this thing right he ought to know that he isnt dealing with some thirdrate power  on went the regiment about four hundred and fifty strong now for men were dropping out every day on account of fever and other tropical troubles ben had had a little fever himself but had dosed himself with quinine before it had a chance to permeate his system and bring him down on his back  the advance led the regiment along a small stream lined with fading flowers and wild plantains and the ever present thorns and trailing vines birds were numerous and here and there a sporting soldier could not resist the temptation to bring one of the feathered tribe down to be cooked at the next resting place once the regiment stirred up a flock of wild turkeys and a charge was made to capture the prizes a charge that was as enthusing as one on the rebels soldiers are but human and must have their fun no matter under what difficulties  its a fine turkey dinner well be afther havin today remarked dan casey as he hung one of the birds over his shoulder he had scarcely spoken when poppop went several mausers in a thicket beyond the bullets singing their strange tune in the leaves over the advancers heads  forward shouted major morris who was in temporary command of the regiment and away they went once more to suddenly find themselves on spongy soil which speedily let them down to their ankles in the meantime the insurgents fire became thicker than ever and it looked as if they were caught in an ambush  fire at will came the order to the left boys and make every shot tell  a roar of musketry drowned out the words and immediately bens company found itself all but surrounded to go into this quagmire had certainly been a grave error but all leaders make mistakes sometimes and major morris was suffering as greatly as his men  the next half hour was one ben never forgot the rebels evidently thought they had the americans at their mercy and pushed in closer and closer until more than half of the contestants were fighting hand to hand many had exhausted their ammunition and were using their bayonets or else handling their guns as clubs  die cried one tall tagal as he flashed up before ben with a bloody bolo die he repeated in bad english and made a lunge at the young captain but gilmore had his eye on the man and the lieutenants sword cut the bolo from the rebels grasp  good for you cried ben then he drew a long breath to think of the narrow escape he had had the native his hand flowing with blood retreated as suddenly as he had approached  the tide of the battle was now taking americans and insurgents toward a canebrake the rebels still fought desperately but they were beginning to lose confidence for the americans were pushing them hard  but now came a cheer from the rear and company b rushed up to the aid of bens command to the young captains astonishment gilbert was in command all the upper officers being either killed or wounded  gilbert he called but had no time to say more but the young southerner heard and waved the sword he had picked up soon the two companies were fighting shoulder to shoulder and the enemy were driven out into the canefield and then into a meadow here they tried to make a stand around an old ricehouse and it took another half hour to dislodge them but when they did retreat at last they went in great haste many leaving their weapons and outfits behind them  the fighting over ben started to find the major gilbert accompanied him their first hunt for the commander however was unsuccessful  its queer was bens comment i trust he isnt dead in the bushes  the hunt gradually brought them to a trail through the jungle and presently gilbert heard a faint moan for help running in the direction they found a soldier of company c lying on some moss his knee shattered from a mauser bullet  oh the pain groaned the poor fellow help me wont you  well do all we can for you answered ben and while he went to work gilbert ran back to bring up the hospital corps with a stretcher  you want to go after major morris said the wounded soldier as soon as he felt comfortable enough to talk  we are looking for major morris replied ben much astonished where is he  he was knocked over by one of the dagos and then three of em carried him away  this was certainly news and ben waited impatiently for gilbert to get back as soon as the young southerner returned both asked the wounded soldier in what direction the captured major had been taken  they went through the canebrake was the answer youll find the trail easily enough i think if you look for it one of the rebs wore boots with high heels so you cant miss em  the wounded man did his best to point out the right direction and was then taken back to the hospital tent without delay ben called ralph sorrel and half a dozen others to his aid  we must go after major morris and at once he said are you ready to undertake the work it may be a dangerous proceeding  were with yer capn answered sorrel and his sentiment was that of all of the others  the trail into the canebrake was followed without much difficulty and the party of eight advanced as rapidly as the nature of the ground permitted the storm had cleared off the night before and the sun shone down hotly making the air in the brake suffocating  this yere is a putty big canebrake an no error remarked sorrel after a quarter of a mile had been covered capn it wont do fer us to turn ourselves about an git lost  well stick to the one trail answered ben as yet ive seen no side trails although ive been watching every foot of the ground that we crossed  nor i capnan dont want to neither added the tall mountaineer  a little further on was a clearing in the centre of which stood a small canehouse halting on the edge of the opening they beheld several filipinos on guard outside the house in the doorway with his back to the opening stood major morris his hands bound behind him     chapter xxiii  the tornado in the canebrake   i reckon we have got em tight capn came from sorrel as the party of americans came to a halt and surveyed the scene before them  it depends upon how many of them there are answered ben sorrel supposing you skirt the clearing and try to count noses  the tennesseean was willing and started off taking gilbert with him he was gone probably ten minutes  not more than ten at the most he reported and of that number two are wounded and have their arms in slings  any other prisoners besides major morris  not that we could see came from gilbert we could rush them easily enough if it wasnt for the major he added  we dont want any harm to befall major morris said ben thoughtfully if we the rebels have discovered us look out  ben had scarcely finished when a report rang out and a bullet whizzed over their heads one of the soldiers outside of the canehouse had seen two of the americans and had fired upon them  the discharge of the firearm caused major morris to turn around and as he did so ben waved his cap at his commander and was recognized then two of the insurgents hurried the major out of sight  the americans were not slow to return the fire and although nobody was struck the insurgents lost no time in disappearing from view a lull followed as both sides tried to determine what was best to be done next  here comes a flag of truce said gilbert presently as a rebel appeared holding up a white rag if i were you i wouldnt honor it  i would like to hear what they have to say replied ben quietly  but remember how they fired on the other flag of truce insisted the young southerner youll be running your head into a lions mouth  sorrel keep that man covered said ben i wont move out any further than he does  if you go ill go with you said gilbert promptly  he would not be put off and together ben and he moved into the opening ben holding up a new handkerchief as he walked the rebel at once halted as if expecting them to come over to where he stood  you come over here cried gilbert and waved his hand  there was a full minutes delay and then of a sudden the rebel threw down his white flag and sped toward the house at the same time three reports rang out and gilbert fell back struck in the shoulder  what did i tell you he gasped they are treacherous to the last degree and then the young southerner fainted  as just mentioned three reports had rung out but only two had come from the house the third came from ralph sorrels weapon and the man who had carried the pretended flag of truce fell dead in his tracks  the dastardly attack angered ben beyond endurance and leaving gilbert resting comfortably on some cut cane he leaped to the front come boys we will root them out he cried and ran on toward the house as fast as he could firing as he went sorrel was at his heels and the others fired each redhot as they afterward expressed it  the insurgents saw them coming and fired several shots but nobody was struck and in a trice the house was surrounded then major morris came bounding through a window and it was ben who cut his bonds with a pocketknife  i saw it all exclaimed the major go for them men every one of the rascals deserves death and stooping over the dead rebel he took from his bosom a bolo and joined in the attack they are a pack of cowardsa mere set of camp followers  the major was right the rebels in the house were no regularly organized body and at the first sign of real peril they fled by the back way over a ditch and straight for the nearest jungle but our friends were determined that they should not escape thus easily and pursued them for nearly half a mile killing one more and wounding three others long afterward they learned that those who had thus forfeited their lives were bandits from the mountains back of san isidro they had joined the forces under general aguinaldo merely for the booty to be picked up in the towns through which the rebel army passed  as soon as the contest had come to an end ben hurried back to where he had left gilbert the wound from which the young southerner was suffering was painful but not dangerous yet it was likely to put gilbert in the hospital for the best part of a month  its too badi thought i could see the thing through to the end said gilbert shaking his head dolefully  youll have to take your dose as i did answered ben i am glad it is not serious our regiment couldnt afford to lose such a brave fellow as you  brave didnt i hang back until you proposed to go out alone ben if anybody was brave it was you and then gilbert turned his face away to conceal the pain that was coming on  the hospital corps was so busy that gilbert could not be carried back of the firing line for some time feeling that there would be no more fighting that day ben decided to remain by his old chum and requested sorrel to do likewise leaving the others to accompany major morris back to the command proper in the meantime a skirmish line was stretched to the north of the canebrake that the insurgents might not regain any of the lost territory  it was frightfully hot but scarcely had major morris left with his party than a faint breeze sprang up which gradually increased to a fairsized wind making gilbert as comfortable as possible under some of the tallest of the cane ben and sorrel sat down beside him to do what they could to help him forget his pain  the three had been sitting in the shade for the best part of half an hour and sorrel was sharpening his knife on the side leather of his shoe when glancing up ben noticed a peculiar cloud in the sky overhead  that looks rather queer he remarked does that denote a windstorm sorrel  it denotes something thats sartin responded the mountaineer surveying the cloud with care its something i aint seed out yere yit and he leaped to his feet  the cloud was about as large as a barrel in appearance and of a deep black color it seemed to be whirling around and around and as it came forward began to expand then it shot off to the southward but not out of sight  im glad its gone said gilbert who had roused up to watch the strange thing i dont want to get caught in a western cycloneand that cloud looks like those i have heard described  the rainy season is coming on here and i presume we are bound to have more or less tornadoes answered ben they say that last year they were something awful along the seacoast  the cloud was circling around the southern horizon but now it turned once again and came slowly toward them while it was yet quarter of a mile away it shot down to earth and a strange humming sound reached their ears followed by a whistling that caused each of them to shiver  its a whirlwind yelled sorrel come into yonder hollow capn and he caught hold of gilbert and lifted him up the hollow he mentioned was less than fifty feet away yet to reach it in time was almost impossible so swiftly did the tornado approach them the air became black as night and was filled with cane grass and branches of trees it struck the house in the clearing and with a single mighty crash the structure went up into the air to fall with another crash a hundred yards beyond  running with the tall tennesseean ben pitched into the hollow just as the first of the tornado hurled itself at them down came the mountaineer but taking good care that gilbert should not be hurt by his quick leap then all fell flat with their faces to earth  it was like some horrible nightmare to benthe whistling wind and the strange humming the blackness and the whirling cane and tree limbs in some places the ground was furrowed up as by a plough and down on their heads came dirt and grass and then a shower of stalks that buried them completely and still the wind kept up in a madder gallop than ever ben felt as if every moment was going to be his last  the time was an age yet by the watch it was not yet five minutes when the tornado had departed leaving its track of ruin behind but still the party of three under the canestalks lay still wondering if it was safe to get up  do yer calkerlate its over capn came from sorrel after a painful pause  it appears to be but there is no telling what such a thing will do next answered the young captain as he pressed on the stalks over him and got up gilbert are you hurt  no came with a gasp but ben that waswas a terror wasnt it  it was gilbert and something i never want to witness again  by this time sorrel was also on his feet and hauling gilbert into daylight the cloud was gone and the sun shone as brightly as ever but at a great distance they saw the tornado sweeping up into the mountains  we are well out of it was bens comment as they watched the cloud until it was out of sight that played sad havoc here i wonder what it will do in the mountains  no one could answer that question and no one tried ben would have been very much surprised had anybody told him that the same tornado which had visited him was also to visit his brother larry but so it proved as we shall speedily see     chapter xxiv  the flight for liberty   well this is getting too monotonous for anything  it was larry who spoke and he sat on the stump of a tree at the mouth of a wide cave gazing disconsolately at a fire which several insurgents were trying to build  the place was on the top of a high hill backed up by still higher mountains on every hand were sharp rocks and trees with a tangle of thorns small wonder then that aguinaldo and his cohorts considered these fastnesses inaccessible for american troops no regular body could have gotten to such a place and to forward supplies hither was totally out of the question  the rebels numbered fifteen all mountaineers and strong at general lunas request they had brought ten prisoners to the spot and the other prisoners were to come up some time later why the filipinos thus divided the men they had taken is not definitely known yet divided they were until some escaped and others died or were given up  since larry had been captured he had passed through half a dozen different hands it must be said he had been treated fairly well better perhaps than many of my readers may suppose to be sure his clothing was in rags and his shoes were almost minus their soles but in these respects he was no worse off than those who kept him captive then too the food given him was very plain but the rebels ate the same and to complain therefore would have been worse than useless  larry had missed barton brownell for the pair had been fairly friendly as we know with the transferal to new quarters the young sailor had struck up an acquaintanceship with dan leroy one of the yorktowns men also a prisoner a number of the sailors from the yorktownin fact a boatload had been captured but leroy had become separated from his messmates at the very start  yes it is monotonous lad said leroy who was resting at larrys feet but as ive said a hundred times afore we cant help ourselves consequently make the best on it aint that sound argyment lad  i reckon so leroy butbut  when ye git as old as i am youll see things in a different light we cant complain o the treatment here lad  but i would like to know how the war is going and if my brother knows i am alive  reckon the war is goin agin the tagals or they wouldnt be apushing back into the mountains like this  its a wonder they dont try to exchange us  at this dan leroy smiled grimly might be as how they consider us too vallyble he suggested he was a short stout fellow much given to joking and rarely out of good humor  it was about the middle of the afternoon and from a long distance came the sounds of firing but the booming came from big fieldpieces so larry knew it must be far away and so it gave him small hope  the rebels had just brought in some fresh meat procured from the town at the foot of the long hill and they speedily proceeded to make a beef stew with rice and yams the smell was appetizing and as nobody had had a square meal that day larry brightened over the prospect  the cave in the hillside was irregular in shape running back to a series of openings which nobody had ever yet explored in this cave the insurgents kept some of their supplies brought up from san fernando san isidro and other places it was a fact that aguinaldo hardly knew where to jump next  before nightfall the dinner was ready and the chief of the rebels had the prisoners supplied with bowls of the stew eat all of eet he said with a grin for maybe no geet such tings tomorrow  thanks well fill up then responded larry and set to with a will as did all the other prisoners  the captives were unarmed and though the rebels watched them they were allowed more or less of the freedom of the camp finishing his bowl of stew larry leaned over to where leroy sat  leroy if we can manage to get a kettle of that stew ill be for trying to get away tonight he whispered  and how are ye going to get it lad asked the sailor  wait and you will see was the answer and larry arose and sauntered over toward the fire  i spilt some of the stew on the ground he said which was true although the amount had not been large can i have more  yes take what you will returned the insurgent chief who felt in good humor through having obtained a leave of absence to start on the morning following and give some to your friends well fill up for once  thank you answered larry and hurried to the other prisoners with the big pot from over the fire the prisoners had a large tin kettle for water fitted with a cover so that bugs might be kept out and this he filled to the brim and also gave the others all they wished  going to eat all of that queried one of the men with a short laugh  sometimenot now answered larry then he took the pot back to the fire and carried his bowl and the kettle into the cave at once leroy followed him  and now whats this nonsense youre talkin about running away demanded the yorktown sailor as soon as they were alone  im going to try my luck tonight leroy if you dont want to go you can stay with the others  but how are you going theres a guard around the foot of the hill and they will shoot you on sight  im not going to try the foot of the hillat least not this side of it  well you cant get to the other for that cliff over this cave is in the way  im going to explore the caves back of this they must lead to somewhere  the old sailor shook his head moren likely they lead to the bowels of the earth youll fall into some pitfall and that will be the end of you  ill light a torch as soon as i am out of sight of this place and ill be very careful where i step  this cave may be as big as the mammoth cave of kentucky youll get lost in one of the chambers and never find your way out  ill have to risk that but im bound to try itif they give me the chance  youre foolish why confound it ive half of a mind to report the scheme  oh leroy surely you wont do that  i mean just to save you from yourself larry  i dont intend to remain a prisoner until i am baldheaded leroy im going to try to escapeand thats the end of it  will you take any of the others along  if they want to go  there wont a soul goand i know it responded the stout sailor in positive tones  when the other prisoners came in he told them of larrys plan one and all of them agreed it was foolhardy  i dont believe there is any opening said one or if there is its so high up in the mountains that youll never reach it  and what are you going to do for eating that kettle of stew wont last forever said another  so the talk ran on but the more he was opposed the more headstrong did larry becomeand that as old readers know was very much like him  i shall go and goodbye to all of you he said in conclusion and then he shook hands with one after another leroy last of all the yorktowns man was trembling  i hate ter see ye do it lad he said it seems like going to death butbuthang it ill go along so there  but you neednt if you dont wish to protested the youth i am not afraid to go alone  but i am agoing and well sink or swim together larry who else goes  dan leroy looked from one face to the next but not another prisoner spoke for each had taken a short walk to the rear caves and seen quite enough of them then a guard came in and the strange meeting broke up immediately  the prisoners lay down to rest but not one of them could go to sleep all of the others were waiting for larry and leroys departure at last satisfied that all was right for the night the guard went outside to join several of his companions around the campfire  now then whispered larry and arose to be followed immediately by dan leroy the kettle secured they hurried for the rear of the outer cave without so much as looking at the others who raised up to watch their shadowy disappearance  the flight for liberty had begun would it succeed or fail     chapter xxv  the caves under the mountain   for a distance of five hundred feet the way was known to both larry and his sailor friend and the pair passed along swiftly guided in part by the flickering rays from the campfire outside of the main cave  have a care now lad whispered leroy as they reached a narrow passage which turned first to the left and then upward the roof is low and you dont want for to dash your brains out on the rocks  never fear but ill be as careful as i can responded the youth feeling his way along better keep close leroy that we dont become separated  the turn made it was no easy matter to ascend the sloping floor with here and there a rough bowlder to cross or a hollow in which one might fall and break a leg without half trying as the yorktown sailor said presently leroy called a halt  better light the torch now larry  i was going to save it was the reply there is no telling how long we may have to depend upon it  that is true but its no longer safe to walk in this pitchy darkness  leroy was provided with matches used in smoking his pipe which had not been denied him and striking one he set fire to an end of the dry cedar branch which larry had laid away over a week before when the thought of running away had first crossed his mind at the start the branch spluttered wofully and threatened to go out but by coaxing it remained lit and presently burst into a flame that was sufficient to see by for a circle of twenty or thirty feet  on they plodded up an incline that seemed to have no end and then around another turn here the chamber widened out and beyond there were branches two to the left and one to the right  illustration on they plodded up an incline that seemed to have no endpage 236  this is as far as ive ever been said the boy the passages beyond seemed to lead downward for part of the way and its impossible to judge which is the best to take but i was of a mind to try that one on the right  well i reckon as how the right ought to be right laughed leroy if it aint all we can do is to come back to here an try over again eh  we havent got time to waste in experimenting leroy this is a serious business we are liable now to be shot on sight  an nobody knows thet better nor dan leroy your humble servant an if you say try one o the other passages im jes as willin  no well take that on the right returned the youth and started onward without further delay  the passage was a crooked one not over ten feet wide in any one part and but little over the height of a man at one place a great rock blocked the way and over this they went on their hands and knees  kind o a tight squeeze remarked leroy if that rock war a bit bigger we wouldnt be able to git over it at all  hark cried larry coming to a halt what is that somebody calling  they listened and from a distance ahead made out a low murmur of some kind its water running over the rocks cried leroy i hope its a river leading to the outer world  oh so do i ejaculated the boy and both started onward eagerly long before the fall of water was gained they found themselves splashing in an underground stream up to their ankles the waterfall was underground coming from the rocks overhead and running into the stream which in turn sank out of sight some distance further on  nothing in that muttered leroy his face falling  nevertheless they stopped for a drink for the tramp through the caves had made them thirsty the old sailor held the torch while larry carried the kettle it was well that the top of the kettle was on tight otherwise the contents would have been spilled long before this  beyond the waterfall the cave opened out once more in fan shape the roof running upward to a high arch from which hung stupendous stalactites of white and brown here the water dripped down in the form of a fine rain  were in a shower lad even though we are underground remarked leroy i must say i hope this dont last if it does well soon be wet to the skin the vaulted cave soon came to an end however and now they found themselves in an opening cut up into a hundred different chambers like a coal mine supported by arches each looked at the other in perplexity  we can easily miss the way here said larry soberly we had better lay out a course and stick to it  right you are lad leroy pointed with his hand this seems as good a trail as any shall we follow it  yes and forward it was again presently they came to another chamber and here the slope was again upward much to their satisfaction if we keep on going upward we are bound to get out at the top sometime was the way larry calculated  climbing now became difficult and in a number of places each had to help the other along then came a wall twelve feet high and here they were compelled to halt  it looks as if we were blocked remarked the yorktown sailor after an examination  im not going to give up yet answered the boy if we cant get up any other way we can build a stairs with those loose stones we just passed  hurrah youve solved the difficulty exclaimed the old sailor and they set to work with a will but rolling and lifting the stones into place was no mean job and when at last they were able to pull themselves to the passageway above both were utterly worn out and glad enough to sit down the rest lasted longer than either had intended for leroy who had not slept well the night before dozed off and larry was not of a heart to wake him up so the boy went to sleep too and neither awakened until early morning  hullo whats this cried leroy the first to open his eyes all was so dark about himlarry having extinguished the torchthat for the minute he could not collect his senses putting out his hand he touched the youth on the face and larry awoke instantly  they were both hungry and lighting the torch again warmed up the kettle of stew and then ate about onethird of the stuff touches the spot cried leroy smacking his lips he could have eaten much more but knew it was best to be careful of their supply until the outer world was gained  much refreshed by their sleep but somewhat stiff from the dampness and the unaccustomed work of the evening before they proceed on their way still climbing upward and still in a darkness that was only partly dispelled by the feeble glare of the torch which was now growing alarmingly small  the light wont last more than a couple o hours said leroy perhaps we had better split the stick in two this was done and thus the feeble light was reduced onehalf  would the caves never come to an end such was the question larry asked himself over and over again was it possible that they were to journey so far only to find themselves trapped at last the thought made him shiver and he pushed on faster than ever  do you know what i think said leroy an hour later i think we are moving around in a circle  a circle  ay lad dont you notice how the passageway keeps turning to the right  larry had noticed it but we are going upward he said  true but who knows but what well be going downward presently  still they kept on but now larrys heart began to fail him they had progressed so far had made so many turns that to get back would probably be impossible the caves were so vast one might wander about in them foreverif ones food did not give out larry shivered again and clutched the precious kettle of stew tighter than ever he was once more hungry but resolved to wait until the pangs of hunger increased before reducing the stock of food  the passageway was now level for a considerable distance with here and there a rock to be climbed over or a crack to cross both had just made a leap over an opening several feet wide when leroy set up a shout  what is it asked larry eagerly  put the torch behind ye lad an look ahead perhaps my eyes deceive me answered the old sailor  larry did as requested and gave a searching look up the passageway no there was no mistaking itthere was a faint glimmer of light coming from what appeared to be a bend he too gave a shout and both set off on a run  as they sped onward the light became brighter and brighter until the torch was hardly needed they were running side by side each trying to gain the outer air first  look out suddenly yelled leroy and caught larry by the arm the old sailor could hardly stop and had to throw himself flat dragging the boy down on top of him  a few feet beyond was an opening twelve to fifteen feet wide running from side to side of the passageway the walls of the opening were perpendicular and the hole was so deep that when a stone was dropped into it they could scarcely hear the thing strike bottom  heres a howdyedo cried leroy gazing into the pit we cant jump across that nohow  a real good jumper might answered larry but i shouldnt want to try it the other side seems to slope down toward the hole whats to be done  ah that was the question it looked as if their advance in that direction was cut off completely     chapter xxvi  boxer the scout   much chagrined man and boy stood on the brink of the chasm before them and gazed at the other side it was sloping as larry had said and wet which was worse a jump even for a trained athlete would have been perilous in the extreme  looks like we were stumped remarked leroy laconically  and just as we were so near to yonder opening cried larry vexed beyond endurance if we only had a plank or something  he looked around but nothing was at hand but the bare stone walls with here and there a patch of dirt and a loose stone he walked to one end of the hole  a fellow might climb along yonder shelf if he were a cat he said dismally but i dont believe a human being could do it  no and dont you go for to try it put in the old sailor if you do youll break your neck sure as guns is guns  well weve got to do something leroy  so we have an i move we sit down an eat a bite o the stew maybe eatin will put some new ideas into our heads  id rather wait until we gain the open air  but we cant make ityetso be content lad its something to know thet the blue sky is beyond  they sat down and soon finished onehalf of what remained of the mess in the kettle never had anything tasted sweeter and it was only by the exercise of the greatest selfcontrol that they kept back a portion of the food  perhaps well have to go back remember that said leroy as he put the cover on the kettle once more  go back no no leroy ill try jumping over first  i dont think i shall thet hole whats that  a sound had reached the old sailors ears coming from some distance ahead it was the sound of footsteps approaching  somebody is coming whispered larry and crouched down then a man put in an appearance coming from the opposite end of the passageway he was an american soldier hatless and almost in tatters  hullo there cried larry leaping up oh but im glad you came  at the cry the soldier stopped short in amazement larrys words echoed and reëchoed throughout the passage he looked toward the pair at the chasm but could make out little saving the torch which leroy was holding  who calls he asked at last  i called answered the boy cant you see us we are two lost sailors and we cant get over this beastly hole come this way but be careful of where you step  you must be americans by your voices am i right  yes and you are an american too said larry as the soldier came closer soon he stood facing them with a look of wonder on his bronzed features  how did you get here he demanded  its a long story answered leroy we escaped from some rebels at the other end of this cave and weve been wandering around since last night are you alone or are our forces outside of this hole  general lawtons troops are a good many miles from here answered the soldier i am one of his scouts and i became separated from our command and got up here to escape being hunted down by the crowd of filipinos that was after me they are in the woods just outside of this hole  then you are all alone said larry his face falling a little  yes although i think a couple of our men must be in this vicinity we are pressing the rebels pretty hard you know  the scouts name was george boxer and he was one of the best marksmen in chief youngs command he listened to their story with interest and at once agreed to do what he could for them they noted with satisfaction that he was provided with both a rifle and a pistol and also a belt well filled with ammunition  it was an easy matter for boxer to make his way into the open air and find a fallen tree limb of sufficient thickness to throw over the chasm as a makeshift bridge as soon as the limb was secure larry and leroy came over and then the party of three made their way to the mouth of the cave  it was a welcome sight to see the sky again and the sunshine and larrys eyes sparkled as he gazed down the mountainside and at the vast panorama spread out before him at their feet was a heavy jungle and beyond a plain and a small hill where a large body of insurgents were encamping  its good to be in the fresh air again eh lad observed leroy but im afraid well have a good bit o trouble gettin past them rebels he added to george boxer  we cant get past them in the daytime answered the scout but i think we can make it after the sun goes down and it will take us till sundown to get to the bottom of this mountain if i am not mistaken  now they were in the open it was decided to discard the kettle and the three ate up what remained of the stew along with the single ration which boxer carried then they began the descent of the mountainside slipping over rocks and dirt as best they could and finding their way around many an ugly pitfall  i suppose you think its queer i came up so far said boxer as they hurried downward the truth is i was so closely pursued i didnt realize how far i was going those rebels can climb the mountains like so many wildcats im afraid well never clean them out if they take a stand up here  it was hot and now leroy gazed from time to time at the sky a storm or something is coming he said  yes something is coming added boxer i can tell it by the way the birds are flying about they seem to be troubled  i see a cloud away off to the southward put in larry its not large but its mighty black  no more was said just then upon the subject and they continued their journey down the mountainside until they came to a fairsized stream where they quenched their thirst and took a wash they were about to go on again when boxer held up his hand as a warning  great gophers boys we are running right into a nest of the rebels he whispered back with you before it is too late  they looked ahead and saw that the scout was right they started to go back and as they turned a mauser rang out and a bullet clipped the bushes beside them  discovered came from leroys lips larry im afraid the jig is up those filipi  crack it was boxers rifle that rang out and as the scout was a sharpshooter it may be taken for granted that he brought down his man then the three set off on a run along the side of the mountain to where a slight rise of ground promised better hiding  we cant do much against such a crowd said the scout but in a good spot we can hold out awhile provided one of you can use my pistol  i can fire tolerably straight answered leroy and took the weapon soon the rise was gained and they plunged in behind a tangle of pines the filipinos were following them although taking good care not to expose themselves needlessly to the fire of such a crack marksman as boxer had proved himself to be  from behind the tangle of growth the three americans watched the skilful advance of the enemy with dismay they are trying to surround us whispered boxer then like a flash his rifle went up the report was followed by a yell of pain and a filipino fell into view from behind a tree less than fifty yards distant the poor fellow was hit in the side but managed to crawl back into cover again groaning dismally  leroy also fired a second later aiming at a tall tagal who was crossing a clearing to their left if he hit his mark the rebel gave no sign but the man disappeared in a great hurry then came a crashing through the bushes below and to the left proving that the filipinos were massing in those directions  perhaps we had better try to crawl away from this began larry when a humming sound caught his ear at the same time the sky grew black  look look yelled leroy what is thisthe end of the world  all looked up the humming had increased to a whistle and now came a crashing of trees and brush mingled with the wild cries of the filipinos as they rushed away toward a nearby mountain stream they knew what was coming even if our friends did not  and then the tornado was almost upon them i say almost for thanks to an allruling providence it did not strike them fairly but rushed to one side where the filipinos had been gathering the light of day seemed to die out utterly and the air was filled with flying débris and screaming birds and wild animals made homeless on the instant the very earth seemed to quake with the violence of the trees uprooted and branches and dirt flew all over the americans until they were buried as completely as ben and his companions had been larry thought it was indeed the end of the world and breathed a silent prayer that god might watch over him and those he loved  at last the rushing wind ceased and the crashing was lost in the distance but the birds kept up their wild cries and for several seconds neither larry nor those with him moved wondering if that was the end of the tornado or if worse was to follow but it was the end and gradually they came forth one after another to gaze on the mighty wreckage about them it was leroy who raised his hand solemnly to heaven  i thank god that we have been spared he said and larry and the scout uttered an amen  whether or not to leave the vicinity was a question at last seeing no more of the enemy they plucked up courage enough to move down the mountainside once more but the tornado had made the passage more difficult than ever and several times they had to turn back nightfall found them still some distance from the plain with yet another jungle to pass before the open would be gained  we might as well make a night of it here said boxer and footsore and weary larry and leroy agreed with him it was not long before all dropped asleep too tired to stand guard and hardly deeming that one was necessary  the tornado had killed numerous birds and small animals and it was easy to pick up a plentiful breakfast  i dont know about making a fire said leroy those rebels may spot us before we are aware  yet they were too hungry to go without eating and in the end they built a fire of the driest wood they could find and while boxer cooked the birds larry and the old sailor scattered the smoke with their jackets so that it might not go up in a cloud and also kept their eyes open for the possible appearance of the rebels but the tornado had scared the insurgents as much as it had anybody and not one showed himself  by eight oclock they were once more on the way boxer leading with his gun ready for use larry in the centre and leroy bringing up the rear with the pistol  they were just entering the jungle at the foot of the mountain when a strange moaning reached their ears and all halted there was a silence and then the moaning started up again  what is that questioned larry it cant be a human being  i think i know what it is returned the scout wait here till i make sure and he glided ahead and was soon lost to sight under a clump of tall trees which grew in somewhat of a clearing soon they heard him shouting for them to come on  it was a water buffalo that was moaning the beast had become caught under a partly fallen tree and could not release itself it was a handsome animal and weighed a good many hundred pounds  heres meat and to spare cried boxer and drawing forth a hunting knife he put the caribao out of his misery in short order this is some more work of that tornado he went on as he proceeded to cut out a choice steak we wont starve for the next fortyeight hours  i hope by that time well have reached the army answered larry and took the portion of meat handed to him it was not a dainty thing to carry but he had to shoulder it since boxer and leroy were carrying the weapons  as they proceeded the jungle appeared to become more dense until it was next to impossible to make any progress yet they felt that each step was bringing them closer to the open plain and to a point where few natives were likely to be congregated if we once get down to the bottom well be all right said boxer  but the scout had not reckoned on the fact that there was a hollow at the base of the mountain and that the heavy rains had filled this full to overflowing it was larry who first called attention to the fact that the ground was growing damp then of a sudden the whole party stepped into the water up to their ankles  here was a new dilemma to face and each looked at the others in anything but a happy mood beats everything what luck were having cried leroy in deep disgust id give a years pay to be safe on board the yorktown agin keelhaul me if i wouldnt  i suppose the best thing we can do is to march around the swamphole replied larry what do you say boxer  let us try it a bit further replied the scout and they moved forward with care at first the ground appeared to grow better but then they went down again halfway to their knees and in a muck that stuck to them like glue  its no use well have to go back groaned leroy and turned about silently the others followed him wondering where the adventure would end     chapter xxvii  the departure of the olympia   the advances of both general macarthur and general lawton had been so far nothing but a series of successes and so hard were the insurgents pressed that they scarcely knew what to do next again they sued for peace but as the americans were not inclined to grant them anything until they had surrendered unconditionally the war went on but in more of a guerillafight fashion than ever  near san fernando the rebels continued to tear up the railroad tracks and likewise attacked a train of supplies killing and wounding several who were on board they also attacked several gunboats coming up the san fernando river keeping themselves safely hidden in the meantime behind high embankments thrown up along the stream while this was going on general aguinaldo called a council of war at san isidro at which fiftysix of his main followers were present by a vote it was found that twenty were for peace twenty for war and sixteen wished to negotiate with the united states for better terms this gathering gave rise to a rumor that the war would terminate inside of fortyeight hours alas it was still to drag on for many months to come  the day after the tornado found ben safe in camp again with gilbert in the hospital receiving every attention it was sunday and a day of rest for the majority of the troops at a small tent a short service was held and ben walked over to hear a very good sermon on mans duty toward god under any and all circumstances the sermon was followed by the singing of several hymns and the soldiers remained at the spot for an hour or more afterward talking over the general situation  it always takes me back home to hear the preachin remarked ralph sorrel im mighty glad we have it it shows we aint no heathens even though we air livin a kind o hitanmiss life afollowin up these yere rebs  on monday the scouts went out to the front and a small brush was had with a number of the insurgents in the vicinity of san miguel de mayumo they reported that the filipinos had a number of intrenchments placed across the roads but seemed to be retreating toward san isidro  if aguinaldo makes a stand anywhere it will be at san isidro said ben to major morris as the two discussed the situation oh but i do wish we could have one big battle and finish this campaign  how about the big battle going against us demanded the major but with a twinkle in his eye  it would never go against us answered the young captain promptly and the insurgents know it that is why they keep their distance  the scouts had brought in a dozen or more prisoners and among them were a filipino and a spaniard both of whom could speak english quite fluently as soon as he could obtain permission ben hurried over to have a talk with the prisoners  he found that the filipino had belonged to those having some of the american prisoners in charge  and do you know anything of my brother he asked eagerly he is a young sailor from the olympia and his name is larry russell  yes yes i know him answered the filipino nodding his head he was at the cave where they have kept some of the prisoners for a long time and he described larry so minutely that ben felt there could be no mistake about the matter  is my brother well how do they treat him please tell me the truth  you may not believe it but we treat our prisoners good said the filipino and when i saw your brother last he was very well  and where is this prison cave  at this the insurgent shrugged his shoulder now capitan you are asking me too much i am pleased to tell you that your brother is safe more than that i cannot tell for it would not be right  this was not encouraging yet ben could not help but admire the prisoners loyalty to his cause very well he said i am thankful to know that my brother is well i was afraid that prison life might make him sick  a little later the young captain got the chance to talk to the spanish prisoner who was making an application for his release claiming that he was friendly to the united states and had never encouraged the rebels seldom had the young captain met more of a gentleman than señor romano proved to be  ah the war is terrible terrible said the señor after ben had introduced himself it is bloodshed bloodshed all the time where it will end heaven alone knowsbut i am afraid the filipinos will be beaten far worse than was my own country  i think you are right there replied ben but we cant do anything for them now until they lay down their arms  the war has ruined hundreds of planters and merchantswhole fortunes have been swept awayand the insurgents have levied taxes which are beyond endurance to some aguinaldo is their idol but to me he is a base schemer who wants everything and only for his own glory but he cannot hold out much longeryou are pressing him into the very mountainsand once away from the civilization of the towns his followers will become nothing but bandittimark me if it is not so  you are a resident of luzon went on ben  hardly i belong in spainbut i have lived here for several years  do you know one benedicto lupez or his brother josé  at this question the brow of señor romano darkened  do i know them ah yes i know them only too well they are rascals villains cheats of the worst order i trust they are not your friends  hardly although i should like firstrate to meet them and especially to meet benedicto  and for what excuse my curiosity but what can an american captain and gentleman like you have in common with benedicto lupez  i want to get hold of some bank money that he carried off answered the young captain and told the story of the missing funds and the part the spaniard was supposed to have played in their disappearance  it is like lupez answered señor romano he is wanted in cuba for having swindled a rich aunt out of a small fortune and in manila you will find a hundred people who will tell you that both brothers are rascals to the last degree although so far they have kept out of the clutches of the lawthrough bribery i think  not during general otiss term of office  no before the city fell into your hands the government was very corrupt and winked at lupezs doings so long as he divided with certain officials  and what did he work at  land schemes and loan companies he once got me interested in a land scheme and his rascality cost me many dollars and i came pretty near to going to prison in the bargain señor romano paused a moment if your troops take san isidro you will have a good chance to catch both of the brothers  what do you mean to say they are at san isidro exclaimed the young captain  they are or at least they were two or three days ago how long they will stay there i cannot say they were at the council of war held by aguinaldos followers  i see ben mused for a moment of course you do not know if they had the stolen money with them  they appeared to have some money for both were offered positions in the army and that would not have happened had not they had funds to buy the offices with they appeared to be very thick with a general named porlara tricky fellow of frenchmalay blood i believe the three had some scheme they wished to put through  well id like to catch the pair i wonder if aguinaldo would keep them around him if he knew their real characters  at this señor romano laughed outright you do not know how bad are some of the men around the arch rebel capitan he has some bad advisers i can tell you that to some of the worst of the crowd aguinaldo is but a figurehead  the pair discussed the matter for half an hour and during that time ben became convinced that señor romano had small sympathy for the insurgents and was certainly not of their number  i will do what i can for you señor he said on parting i do not believe you will be kept a prisoner long and the young captain was right on this score the spanish gentleman was released inside of fortyeight hours and journeyed to manila in company with a detachment bound for the capital of luzon  the two talks made ben do a good deal of sober thinking he now knew to a certainty that larry was alive and well and he knew also that benedicto lupez was at or near san isidro and more than likely had the stolen money on his person i wish we could push ahead without delay he muttered i might make a splendid strike all around i know larry is just aching to be at liberty once more  but supplies were again slow in coming to the front and general lawton did not feel like risking his men when the filipinos might surrender at any moment so a delay of several days occurred with only a little skirmish here and there to break the monotony  hullo heres news cried major morris as he rushed up to bens quarters one morning dewey is going to sail for the united states  with the olympia queried the young captain  yes the warship leaves next saturday with all on board wont he get a rousing reception when he arrives home  larry wont be with him said ben  by jove captain thats so its too bad isnt it i suppose he would like to go too  i cant say as to that perhaps he would just as lief stay here and join some command on land or some other ship especially if he knew that my brother walter was coming on but i am sure he would like to see his old messmates off concluded ben  admiral dewey started for the united states at four oclock in the afternoon of saturday may 20 the departure proved a gala time the harbor and shipping being decorated and the other warships firing a salute the bands played auld lang syne home sweet home and america and the jackies crowded the tops to get a last look at the noble flagship as she slipped down the bay toward the china sea with the admiral standing on the bridge hat in hand and waving them a final adieu in all the time he had been at manila admiral dewey had served his country well and his homecoming was indeed to be one of grand triumph     chapter xxviii  the advance upon san isidro   why luke striker is it possible i thought you had sailed for the united states on the olympia  well ye hadnt no right to think that captain responded the old gunner as he shook hands warmly it might be that the others could go away and leave larry behind but hes too much my boy for me to do thatyes sirree when i hears as we were to set sail for the states i goes up to the admiral himself an says i admiral says i do you remember how larry russell an yer humble servant comes on board of the olympia says i yes says he i remember it well says he well says i larry is ashore a prisoner of the enemy says i i dont want to go for to leave him nohow cant you leave me behind says i and he laughs and asks me all about larry and finally says i can go ashore and report to rear admiral watsonwho is comin onsometime later and here i am come to the front to find larry ef sech a thing is possible  the old sailors honest speech went straight to bens heart and he saw very plainly how deep was lukes affection for his younger brother youre a messmate worth having luke he exclaimed i dont wonder larry thought so much of you  avast im only a common seadog at the best captainan ef i remained behind to cast around fer the lad ye mustnt think thet jack biddle an the others have forgotten larry fer they aint not by a jugful every man jack o them is his friend an was almost from the start  luke had come up to the camp by way of malolos accompanying a packtrain of caribao carts carrying rations and army equipments he had left the olympia several days before and had not waited to witness the departure of the flagship  as luke wished to remain with ben the latter lost no time in presenting the matter to colonel darcy and to major morris and luke was taken into the regiment camp as a cook for he had once been a cook on a merchantman years before the position was largely an honorary one and the sailor was permitted to leave his pots and kettles whenever he pleased  its good news he said when the young captain had told him what the prisoners had said about larry and benedicto lupez ive an idee well get to larry soon an down thet tarnal spaniard in the bargain  the conversation took place on tuesday on wednesday orders came to strike camp and the march of the regiment was taken toward san isidro by way of baluarte a small village seven miles to the southeast of the new rebel capital in the meantime although the americans were not aware of it aguinaldo was preparing to decamp with his socalled congress into the mountain fastnesses still further northward  we are in for another fight said major morris as he came to ben that afternoon and ive an idea it is going to be something to the finish  that means then that we are bound for san isidro cried the young captain hurrah thats the best news ive heard in a week  the regiment was soon on the road spread out in proper battalion form the day was close and it looked as if a thunderstorm was at hand the growth along the road was thick and at certain points the overhanging branches had to be cut off that the troops might pass the trail was bad and often a gun or wagon had to stop so that a hole might be bridged over with bamboo poles here and there they passed a nipa hut but these places were deserted excepting in rare instances where an aged native would stand at the door holding up a white rag as a signal of surrender or to show that he was an amigo or friend  its pitiable said ben to major morris as they trudged along side by side i reckon some of these ignorant creatures have an idea that we have come to annihilate them  you can be sure that aguinaldo and his followers have taught them something like that replied the major otherwise they wouldnt look so terrified  at one point in the road they came to a tumbledown hut at the doorway of which rested a woman and her three small children all watching the soldiers with eyes full of terror going up to the woman ben spoke kindly to her but she immediately fled into the dilapidated structure dragging her trio of offspring after her  you cant make friends that way cried major morris they wont trust you ive tried it more than once  there was now a hill to climb thick with tropical trees and brush the regiment had scarcely covered a hundred feet of the ascent when there came a volley of shots from a ridge beyond which wounded two soldiers in the front rank  the rebels are in sight was the cry come on boys let us drive em back on to san isidro and away went one battalion after another fatigued by a two miles tramp but eager to engage once more in the fray it was found that the insurgents had the ridge well fortified and general lawton at once spread out his troops in a semicircle in the hope of surrounding the ridge and cutting off the defenders from the main body of aguinaldos army  bens regiment was coming head on for the top of the ridge the way was over ground much broken by treestumps rocks and entangling vines that brought many a soldier flat  sure an its a rigular fishnet spluttered dan casey as he tried in vain to rise with vines ensnaring both arms and legs i dont know but phwat a fellow wants a wirecutter here just as they had em in cuby to cut the wire finces wid  nefer mind so long as we got by der dop of dot hill answered carl stummer as he hauled his mate out of the entanglement be dankful dot you aint parefooted by dem dorns and on went both once more there was many a slip and a tumble but very little grumbling  down the cry came from the front and down went bens company into a little hollow for the rebels had them in plain view now and the two lines were less than three hundred yards apart a volley from the insurgents followed but nobody was struck  forward twentyfive yards cried ben and up went the company for another dash it was a soultrying moment and none felt it more than the young commander who ran on ahead to inspire his men he knew that at any instant a bullet might hit him to lay him low forever but his baptism of fire had been complete and he did not flinch  hot work this the words came from gilmore as he came up the hill close to ben its going to be no picnic taking that ridge  true gilmore but its got to be done answered the young commander down he shouted and again the company fell flat then began a firing at will which lasted the best part of ten minutes the insurgents likewise fired and a corporal and a private were wounded and had to be carried to the rear  looking around ben espied luke striker in the ranks of company d the old sailor had provided himself with a rifle and an ammunition belt and was popping away at a lively rate  i couldnt help it said luke when the young captain came up to him its the best fun ive had sence thet air muss in manila bay when we blowed old montojo out o the water off cavite say but well git to the top o the hill afore long jes see ef we dont and luke blazed away again and so ben left him  the rest of the battalion was now closing in and soon another advance was made until the first line of the american troops was less than a hundred and fifty yards away from the insurgents outer intrenchments then a yell came from a jungle on the left  whats that more rebels cried ben and listened  no no the filipinos are retreating came from a score of throats see they are scattering like sheep up the hill fellows the fight is ours and a regular stampede occurred each command trying to get to the top of the ridge first the rebels were indeed retreating into a thicket behind the ridge they went less than half a mile however and then made another stand this time on the upper side of a mountain streamthe very stream at which larry and his companions had stopped after the escape from the caves under the mountain  to ford the stream would have been an easy matter under ordinary circumstances but with the rebels guarding the upper bank it was extremely hazardous and the regiment came to a halt on the edge of the brush overhanging the water  they are straight ahead boys said major morris after his scouts had reported to him we will make a detour to the right forward and on the doublequick  every soldier felt that delay would mean a serious loss and a rapid rush was made through the jungle to a point where the stream became rocky and winding here an excellent ford was found and they went over in column of fours they could now enfilade the rebels position and this they did so disastrously that the filipinos speedily threw down a large part of their arms and fled helterskelter into the mountain fastnesses still further to the northward  the battle over the battalion came to rest under the shade of the trees lining the stream many of the soldiers throwing themselves down in a state bordering upon exhaustion for the humidity in the air told upon them greatly there was not a breath of a breeze and the water hardly quenched the thirst that raged within them as major morris declared it was the primest place to catch a fever in he had ever seen  ben was sitting at the foot of a tall tree talking to gilmore when he saw the advance guards bringing in two americans one evidently a sailor at once he sprang to meet the sailor thinking the man might know something about larry  the two men proved to be dan leroy and boxer the scout and when he mentioned his brothers name to them both were of course astonished  do we know him cried leroy sure and didnt he and i run away together from the rebels and boxer here helping us to get out of the prison caves yes yes i know larry well and then leroy told of the escape from the caves and of how all three of the party had become lost in the swamp lands  we were in the swamps two days and thought we would never get out he continued luckily we had some caribao meat with us otherwise we should have starved to death the swamps were full of mosquitoes and lizards and lots of other things and we were almost eaten up alive eh boxer  so we were replied the scout  but what of my brother asked ben impatiently  at this the faces of both of the men fell  we cant say what became o him said the sailor from the yorktown you see after we got out of the swamp we determined to stick to the high ground until we found a regular trail leading to the south well our walk took us up to a high cliff overlooking a gorge filled with trees and bushes we were walking ahead with larry at our heels as we thought when boxer chanced to look around and the boy was gone  gone gasped ben in horror  yes gone we couldnt understand it and called to him but he didnt answer then we went back about quarter of a mile past the spot where we had seen him last and fired the pistol as a signal but he had disappeared totally and we couldnt find hide nor hair o him try our level best  the confession was a sickening one and for several minutes ben could not trust himself to speak  andand what do you think became of my brother he asked at length  both men shrugged their shoulders im afraid he fell over the cliff said boxer you see the footpath was narrow and mighty slippery in spots  at once bens mind went back to that scene in faraway cuba when gerald holgait had fallen over a cliff had a similar fate overtaken his brother and if so was he still alive or had he been dashed to his death  how far is that spot from here he demanded abruptly  not over a mile capn answered boxer  i see you are a scout can you take me to the place  certainlybutbutits mighty risky capnso many rebs lurking about  never mindi must find larry alive or dead take me to him and ill pay you well for your services  i aint asking a cent capnthat aint my style  then you will take me  i will said boxer promptly only ill have to report first and get official permission  major morris will arrange that for you i feel certain answered ben turning to the major who sat near drinking in the conversation  yes ill arrange that said the major but i dont see how i am going to do without you captain  would you keep me from looking for my brother  no no go ahead and gilmore can take the company  so it was arranged and inside of quarter of an hour ben and boxer were ready to depart  captain cant i go with ye it was luke striker who asked the question the anxious look on his face spoke more eloquently than words and ben consented without argument  and so the three set off on the search for larry little dreaming of the strange happenings in store for them     chapter xxix  larry is sentenced to be shot   to go back to larry at the time mentioned by dan leroy when the boy had been following the old sailor and the scout along the cliff overlooking the valley in which both the filipino and the american troops were encamped  the adventures in the swamp had been exceedingly tiring and the youth could scarcely drag one foot after the other as the party of three hurried along over rocks and through thickets which at certain points seemed almost impassible  o dear ill be glad when this days tramp comes to an end he thought i wonder how far the american camp is from here  he tried to look across the valley but there was a bluish vapor hanging over trees and brush which shut off a larger portion of the view the party had been walking over a trail which now brought them directly to the edge of the cliff here the footpath was scarcely two feet wide and was backed up by high rocks and thorn bushes around which it was difficult to climb without injury  the men were as tired as the boy and it must be confessed that for a half hour or more they paid little attention to larry gradually the youth lagged behind until those ahead were lost to view around a sharp turn of the cliff  and it was then that an accident happened which put larry in great peril all in an instant in trying to make the turn the boy got hold of a slender tree by which to support himself leroy and boxer had grasped the same tree and their swinging around had loosened its frail hold on the rocks and as larry grasped it down went the sapling over the edge of the cliff carrying the youth with it  illustration down went the sapling over the edge of the cliffpage 281  the boy had no time to cry out and he clung fast not knowing what else to do until the tree landed with a mighty crash on the top of another tree at the foot of the cliff the sudden stoppage caused larry to loose his hold and he bumped from limb to limb in the tree below until he struck the ground with a dull thud and then for the time being he knew no more  when the boy came to his senses he found it was night and pitch dark under the thick tree through the branches of which he had fallen he rested on a bed of soft moss and this cushionlike substance had most likely saved him from fatal injury  his first feeling was one of bewilderment his next that his left foot felt as if it was on fire with a shooting pain that ran well up to his knee catching hold of the foot he felt that the ankle was much swollen and that his shoetop was ready to burst with the pressure scarcely realizing what he was doing he loosened the shoe at which part of the pain left him  i suppose i ought to be thankful that i wasnt killed he thought rather dismally i wonder where leroy and that scout are i dont suppose it will do any good to call for them the top of that cliff must be a hundred feet from here  the fall had almost finished what was left of larrys already ragged suit and he found himself scratched in a dozen places with a bad cut over one eye and several splinters in his left hand feeling in his pocket he found several matches which leroy had given him on leaving the prison cave and he lit one of these and set fire to a few dried leaves which happened to be ready to hand  the light afforded a little consolation and by its rays the boy made out a pool of water not far off and to this he dragged himself to get a drink and then bathe the ankle this member of his body had been so badly wrenched that standing upon it was out of the question as he speedily discovered by a trial which made him scream with pain  im in for it now he thought with such an ankle as this i cant go on and what am i to do here alone in the woods and with absolutely nothing to eat id be better off in a filipino prison  slowly the night wore along until a faint light in the east announced the coming of day during the darkness the jungle had been almost silent but now the birds began to tune up and here and there larry heard the movements of small animals although none of the latter showed themselves  it was more pleasant under the big tree than down by the pool and as daylight came on larry dragged himself back to his first restingplace as he came up to the tree he saw a broken branch resting there and on it a birds nest containing half a dozen speckled eggs  heres a little luck anyway he murmured and taking some of the tree limbs he made a fire and cooked the eggs in the hot ashes when they were done he broke off the shells and ate the eggs and although the flavor was by no means to be prized yet they did much toward relieving the hunger he had felt before taking the fall over the cliff  the day that followed was one which larry says he will never forget and for good reason neither human being nor beast came near him and even the birds flying overhead seemed to give him a wide berth time and again he cried out but the only answer that came back was the echo from the cliff repeating his own words as if in mockery occasionally he heard firing at a great distance but toward nightfall even this died out he could scarcely move from his restingplace and it was not until darkness came on that the pain in his ankle subsided sufficiently to allow of his sleeping in comfort  the long sleep did the boy a world of good and when he awakened he found the swelling in his ankle gone down along with much of the pain and on getting up he found that he could walk but it must be slowly and with care he was again hungry and his first effort was to supply himself with something to eat  to bring down even a small animal was out of the question but he thought he might possibly knock over a bird or two and with this in view cut himself several short heavy sticks the birds were coming down to the pool to drink and watching his chance he let fly with the sticks and managed to bring down two of the creatures and these formed the sum total of his breakfast although he could have eaten twice as many there were a number of berries to hand but these he refrained from touching fearing they might be poisonous  larry felt he must now go on to gain the top of the cliff was out of the question so he decided to strike out directly for the southwest feeling that this must sooner or later bring him into the american lines to be sure he had first to pass the filipinos but this could not be helped and he felt that the best he could do would be to keep his eyes and ears open and walk around any body of the enemy that he might discover instead of trying to steal his way straight through this would require many miles of walking and on the sore foot too but this hardship would have to be endured  half a mile was covered in a slow and painful fashion when larry reached a small clearing and here he sat down to rest on a fallen tree and to examine the ankle which he was afraid was again swelling he was engaged in looking at the wounded member when a rough tagalog voice broke upon his ears  what do you here demanded a heavyset native in his own tongue as he strode forward gun in hand followed by several others  larry was startled and leaped up in a twinkling he found himself surrounded and several mausers were levelled at his head  to resist would have been the height of foolishness and larry did not try the tagals asked him a number of questions in their own tongue but he shook his head to show them that he did not understand on their part not one could speak english so neither party could communicate with the other  the natives however soon understood that he was alone and when he pointed to his ankle and limped also understood that he had sprained that member one went into the bushes and presently returned with some leaves which he crushed and packed inside of the boys stocking the juice of the leaves proved very cooling and presently much of the pain from the sprain went away  the tagals were bound for the cliff but by a route different from that which larry had travelled as the boy was unarmed and could scarcely hobble along they did not take the trouble to bind him in any way he was made to march with half of the crowd before him and the others behind and thus they proceeded until the cliff was reached at a point where the jungle hid a series of rough steps leading to the top beyond the top of these steps was a mountain trail which by nightfall brought them to a plateau where were encamped at least three hundred filipinos of all classes the tagals predominating  a shout went up as larry appeared and he was at once recognized as one of the prisoners who had escaped from the caves which were fully four miles away  so they have caught you again remarked an underofficer as he strode up with a sinister smile on his swarthy countenance you did not get very far  no i had a bad fall and lamed my foot replied larry as cheerfully as he could he was never one to cry over spilt milk  a fall where  i fell over the high cliff just below here  and you live to tell it impossible  no it is true i fell into a large tree and that broke my fall but i was badly scratched up and my ankle was sprained  a rare fall truly boy it would have been better though if you had been killed  thank you i like that  i say it because you are a prisoner who has tried to escape from us do you know the fate of all such  at these words larry could not help but shiver he knew what the officer up at the cave prison had saidthat any prisoner trying to escape would be shot at the first opportunity which presented itself  surely you would not kill me for trying to get away he cried quickly  the underofficer shrugged his shoulders it is not for me to change our regulations of war boy your words prove that you knew beforehand the risk you were running  yes yesbut you would try to get away too if our soldiers caught you  possiblyi understand you treat your prisoners very badly  our prisoners are treated as well as yours and we would not kill a filipino for having tried to escapeunless of course he was shot in the attempt  it is you who say thati have heard vastly different stories how our men were starved and shot down without mercynot one man but hundreds of them i have it from friends in manila that your general otis is a monster who would rather kill than save at any time  your friends have told you that which is not true exclaimed larry warmly if anything general otis is too kindhearted especially with those who have done their best to put the city in a state of rebellion and those who have tried to burn it to the ground i suppose your friends had a purpose in telling you what was not true  i take my friends words in preference to yours boy was the angry answer who are you that come to take our country away from usthe country that we tried so hard to liberate from the iron grasp of spain the land is ours and no americans shall govern us we will fight to the lastfrom the cities to the towns and from the towns to the villages and then to the mountains from one island to anotherand you shall never conquer us no matter how large an army you send from across the ocean but bah i am talking to a mere boy when i might have better sense and turning on his heel the underofficer strode away out of humor with himself as well as with larry  the youth felt utterly crushed and sitting down on a rock with a heart as heavy as lead he wondered what was going to happen next would they really shoot him the thought was agony itself  there were no other prisoners in the camp so he was left for a long time alone although several soldiers kept their eyes upon him that he might not wander away soon supper was served and one of the tagals brought him a bowl of rice and meat it must be confessed that he was now tremendously hungry and ate all of what was given him despite his downheartedness  the meal finished the filipinos were sitting around their campfires when a certain general drummo was announced at once there was a parade which the general reviewed with satisfaction the newcomer was served with supper and then larry was brought before him  the general had his head full of his plans for the morrow and gave the boy but scant attention  you knew the risk you ran when you stole away he said in broken english it is true you are but a boy yet ill wager you can use a gun better than some of our own men i cannot pardon you for that would be setting a bad example so i hereby sentence you to be shot at sunrise tomorrowand may your death be an example to others who are thinking of escape  before larry could say a word if indeed he wanted to speak he was led away to a hollow back of the camp here he was tied fast to a tree and two soldiers were detailed to guard him until the hour for his execution should arrive     chapter xxx  a rescue under difficulties   nothing here capn  it was boxer the scout who spoke for two hours he ben and luke striker had been examining the trail running along the cliff they could find footprints without number but no trace of larry  he must have gone somewhere replied ben who could not bring himself to give up the hunt he wasnt spirited away ive a good mind to make a hunt at the bottom of the cliff  as you will capn but remember this air side o the valley is full of rebs and if they catch us  we must be on our guard boxer  ive got my eyes wide open put in luke i reckon on it as how i can see as far as any on em too  the walk to the cliff had not been accomplished without difficulty twice had they come close to running into the filipino pickets and once luke had been almost certain they were being followed but the alarm proved false a night had been spent in the jungle and at a point within half a mile of where larry lay senseless under the big tree  the hunt had revealed to the party the series of rough steps mentioned in the last chapter and down these they now went and continued their search at the base of the cliff  whats this came from the old sailor presently and he pointed to the broken sapling hanging in the branches of the big tree with the sapling was a shred of a garment fluttering in the breeze like a signal of distress  a close examination caused them to reach a conclusion which was as we already know true namely that larry had come down with the sapling and landed in the big tree  and he wasnt killed either said boxer for here is where he built a fire and cooked some birds eggs  and he visited the pool too added ben examining the tracks with care funny tracks these he added a second later  he was hopping on one foot announced the scout gravely that looks as if he had one leg hurt  it was an easy matter to follow the trail through the jungle for the ground was damp and covered with a moss which was torn with ease soon they reached the clearing where larry had stopped to examine his ankle  hullo more footprints ejaculated boxer his face falling and rebs too ill wager a new hat capn im afraid your brother has run into worse trouble  it certainly looks like it answered ben where do the footprints lead to  where but back to the very rocks down which they had come but a few hours before soon they were back at the top of the cliff again  before leaving the valley boxer studied the footprints closely and now although there were other footprints above he followed the party having larry in charge without making a single error but it was slow work and the encampment of the filipinos was not discovered until nightfall  weve tracked em to a finish announced boxer dont go any further capnunless you are ready to do some tall shooting  i can do some shooting if its necessary answered ben with a determined look on his face which was not to be mistaken i should like to make sure my brother is here  well walk around the camp and see said boxer and this they did slowly and cautiously each with his weapons ready for immediate use but the filipinos were busy eating their suppers and smoking cigarettes and did not discover them  theres larry cried luke after a while and he pointed to one side of the camp the guards were just taking the lad to the general to be sentenced  yes yes answered ben he handled his pistol nervously he could hardly restrain himself from rushing forward and embracing the long lost boxer saw what was in his mind and held him back  dont be rash capn whispered the scout if you are it may cost all of us our lives  i will try to be careful was the answer with an effort but what are they going to do with him  they are taking him over to yonder tent  soon larry disappeared inside the tent and they crouched behind the bushes to await developments while waiting ben made a mental calculation of the number of the enemy  a battalion or more he said to boxer i wonder what they are doing so far from the main body of the troops  oh their army is becoming badly scattered capn general lawton has em on the run and there wont be any of em left when he gets through with em  as we know the scene in the tent was a short one and soon they saw larry come out again and saw him tied to the tree the two soldiers detailed to guard him sat on either side of their prisoner on rocks about six or eight yards from the tree  he seems to be the only prisoner in the camp whispered ben i wonder if i cant crawl up and cut him loose i did that once for gilbert pennington  no no interposed boxer those guards are wide awake and will shoot you in a minute wait till it gets darkerwe may get a chance to do something then  slowly the minutes drifted by ben watching larry every instant he saw that his younger brother was exceedingly tired and held one foot up as if in pain the young sailor had asked if he might not lie down but this comfort had been denied him  both of the guards were puffing vigorously on their cigarettes when one chanced to throw down a lighted match close to the rock upon which he was sitting it set fire to some dry grass but instead of putting it out the guard watched the tiny conflagration grow stronger  playing with fire eh said his mate lightly  yes was the slow answer how i would like to see manila go up like that  yes i would like to see that too carlos and the americans in the flames ah but the day when we are to take the capital seems a long way off now  never mind aguinaldo says he is soon to have reënforcements from the south when they come let the american dogs beware  the talk was carried on in the tagalog dialect so larry understood not a word in the meantime the fire crept up making the guards seat anything but comfortable  thats too much he observed and was on the point of kicking the fire out with his foot when of a sudden he uttered a wild yell that startled everybody near him a snake a snake oh what a long creature  for from under the rock a huge reptile had glided roused up by the heat it was a snake peculiar to those mountains and all of ten feet long and as thick as a mans arm it struck the guard in the knee and then whipped around in increased anger for its tail had come in contact with the fire  a snake echoed the second guard and fired his mauser at the reptile but he was too excited to shoot straight and the bullet glanced along the rock and struck the first guard in the cheek inflicting a fairly serious wound  the cries of the two guards were taken up on all sides of the camp and especially in the vicinity of the rock from under which the reptile had appeared all the soldiers recognized the snake as a dangerous enemy and as the reptile moved about first one and then another ran to get out of its way several in the meantime taking hasty shots at it but failing to do any serious damage for several minutes the prisoner was entirely forgotten  it was ben who saw the opportunityben and the everfaithful lukeand rushing up they cut larrys bonds and fairly hustled him into the depth of the jungle behind the encampment the young sailor could hardly understand what was taking place but when he recognized his brother and his old messmate he gave a shout of joy  you ben and luke oh i must be dreaming  no you are not dreaming larry weve been watching you for a long while trying to do something can you run  no i sprained my ankle and it is still sore  ill carry him said luke you lead the way capn and boxer had better bring up the rear guard  right you are came from the scout have your weapons ready capn we may catch it hot in spite of the alarm over the snake those rebs will be as mad as hornets when they find the lad is missing  away they went ben trying to find an easy pathwhich was no small thing to do in that utter darknessand luke coming up behind breathing like a porpoise but vowing he could carry larry a mile were it necessary boxer kept as far to the rear as he dared without missing their trail and the life of any filipino who might have appeared would not have been worth a moments purchase at the scouts hands  they had covered but a few hundred yards when the shouting and firing at the encampment ceased i guess the snake is dead said ben now theyll be after us  the young captain was right and soon they heard the enemy breaking through the jungle in detachments of three or four men each all hotfooted to recapture the prisoner they had observed the cut ropes and wondered if it was possible that larry had severed them without assistance  it was not long before boxer got a good shot at the nearest of the pursuers his aim was true and the tagal went down without so much as a groan his companions stopped short and then called some other soldiers to the scene the boy is armed and shoots like a sharpshooter they told each other and after that the search was continued with extra care of course boxer kept out of sight and as soon as he could he joined ben and the others  i think there must be a stream close at handthe one we crossed a few days ago said he if we can get to that well have some chance to hide  lets get to it then gasped luke who felt that he could keep up but a short while longer  ill take larry luke put in ben and the transfer was made in spite of the old sailors protests then luke plunged ahead and soon announced that he could see the river through the bushes to the right soon they came out on some rocks the stream was a mountain torrent a rod wide and from two to three feet deep they plunged in without delay  as they could not walk against such a current they followed the stream on its downward course almost to the edge of the cliff where the torrent formed a pretty series of waterfalls then they crossed to the other side and climbed into a tree growing directly at the waters edgea species of willow with long drooping branches  we ought to be safe hereat least for a while said boxer  its hard to tell where one would be safe here answered ben the whole country seems to be invested with scattered bands of the insurgents  he asked larry about himself and in a few words the younger brother told his story then boxer stopped the talk  in a situation like this its best to have only ears and eyes he said and all saw at once the aptness of the remark  but though they remained on guard the larger part of the night nobody came to disturb them and the only sound that broke the stillness was that of the water as it tumbled over the rocks below  ben was much worried over larrys ankle which had begun to swell again through having stood so long on it while being tied to the tree he brought a canteen of water up from the stream and bathed it with this this moistened the mashedup leaves once more and then the injured member felt better and larry caught a nap  i reckon we had better be moving again said boxer while it wanted yet an hour to daylight those rebs may be waiting for to see us you know  well my brother cant run so perhaps it will be just as well if you take a scout around and see if the coast is clear said ben  certainly capn and boxer made off without delay moving through the jungle and along the stream as silently as some wild animal in search of its prey  fifteen minutes and more passed and they began to wonder when the scout would come back when a low whistle reached their ears  its all right came from boxer  nobody in sight questioned ben  nary a reb capn  im glad of it put in larry with a sigh of relief i never want to fall in with them again and he shuddered he would never forget how close he had been to death at their hands  they came down the tree and after a drink from the stream set out again this time following the watercourse over the rocks until the cliff was left behind here they struck a bit of marsh and had to make a detour finally coming out much to their surprise on what appeared to be a regular highway through the forest  now if we only knew where this leads to cried ben  i reckon it leads to san isidro came from boxer but we may be a good number of mil  look look ejaculated striker pointing up the road the rebels as sure as you air born an they air comin about a thousand strong too boys we air lost     chapter xxxi  the fall of san isidroconclusion   luke striker was right a large force of filipinos were sweeping down the road at a rapid rate bringing with them two old fieldpieces and a rapidfiring gun they were commanded by several officers on horseback and presented a formidable appearance to the wornout americans  out of sight quick the cry came from ben its our only chance to escape  the words had scarcely left his lips when the poppop of several mausers was heard as the filipino sharpshooters who were in advance of the main body opened fire upon them their aim was excellent and both striker and boxer were hit although neither seriously  theyve caught me ejaculated the old sailor and staggered up against ben at the same time boxer pitched headlong  oh luke the call came from larry who was limping painfully where did they hit you this is the worst of all  im struck in the shoulder but come ben is right to the jungle and striker clutched larrys hand in a deathlike grip bound to live or die with his closest friend as the case might be  the pair started forward ben hesitated and looked at boxer and saw the latter try to stagger up once more hes not dead thought the young captain and picked the sharpshooter up in a few seconds more the whole party were in the jungle again  but the filipinos were not going to let them escape thus easily and coming up on the doublequick a detachment began to search the bushes at the same time calling on the americans to surrender if they wanted to save their lives  with larry limping painfully and both luke and boxer groaning in spite of their efforts to keep silent the americans looked about for some spot which might prove a safe hidingplace but the ground here was level and the jungle rather spare and for those who were wounded to climb trees was out of the question  well have to make a stand im afraid said ben looking to his pistol to see if it was fully loaded they are coming hark  the young captain broke off short as a loud shouting from the road interrupted him then came a volley of musketry followed by a steady stream of shots  weve got them this time boys came in a ringing englishspeaking voice forward and dont let a man of them escape on to san isidro  our troops cried larry oh god be praised that they are coming this way  yes yes our troops ejaculated ben and what is more my regiment the revulsion of feeling was so great that he felt like dancing a jig  the shouting and firing now increased until it was almost upon them then followed a rush into the woods and the little party found itself face to face with a score of filipinos  at first our friends were greatly alarmed and ben and larry did their best to defend themselves by firing as rapidly as possible at the tagals as they appeared but the enemy was retreating and gave the little party scant attention then came a yell close at hand and in a few seconds a squad of american soldiers burst through the thicket  dan casey cried ben as he recognized the irish volunteer  sure an is it captain russell came from the soldier joyfully it is the saints be praised weve been awonderin what had become of yez  town mit dem filibinos the call came from carl stummer and soon he also put in an appearance dis vos von lucky tay he said when he saw the party ve haf dem repels on der run like neffer vos  then send them aflying stummer answered ben where is our camp  pack dere apout half a mile ve vos move up las night und steal von march on dem filibinos  there was no time to say more excepting to stop several of the soldiers and assisted by these the whole party moved to the rear through line after line of american troops now hurrying to the firing line for it was general lawtons plan to give the filipinos no rest until san isidro and the territory in its vicinity were captured  inside of half an hour ben had seen to it that larry luke and boxer were all made comfortable and then hastily swallowing a bowl of coffee and some bread and meat he hurried after his command which was threshing the jungle just outside of san isidro for scattered bands of the enemy such as the young captain and his party had met soon ben was on the firing line once more and warmly greeted by major morris gilmore and his other friends  the fighting was hot for the rebels felt that if san isidro was taken nothing would remain to them but the mountains they had constructed a high embankment just outside of their capital and this they were defending vigorously many of their leading generals being at the front to direct the movements  but general lawton was now in his element and feeling that his troops would do whatever he asked of them he began to spread out to the right and the left thus enfilading the trenches behind the embankment which presently became so uncomfortable that the rebels had to leave them at the same time a centre column continued the attack from the fronta centre column composed principally of minnesota troops and the regiment to which ben belonged  they are leaving the trenches exclaimed major morris who was watching the progress of the battle through a fieldglass forward boys they are on the run again  a rattle of rifleshots followed and the battalion carried the middle of the embankment with a wild rush planting old glory on the very top a minute later then the regiment pushed on for san isidro proper a hot skirmish was had on the main street of the town but the filipinos had had enough of it and by nightfall were making for the mountains as rapidly as their demoralized condition would permit  señor romano had told ben where benedicto lupez and his brother josé had been stopping in san isidro and as soon as the young captain could get the opportunity he hurried around to the place which was a large private boardinghouse  there is a man here by the name of lupez i believe he said as he presented himself followed by a detachment of half a dozen of his men  the boardinghouse keeper who had just hung out a white flag eyed him suspiciously how do you know that señor lupez is here he questioned slowly  i know it and i want to see him at once returned ben sharply  he isis not herehehe went away this morning came with much hesitation  dont ye believe him captain put in dan casey who was in the detachment  i will search the house said ben quietly  the keeper of the boardingplace protested but his protest was of no avail the house was searched from top to bottom and in a back wing they found benedicto lupez in bed suffering from a badly injured leg the result of trying to ride a halfbroken horse which the insurgents had captured from the americans he greeted the visitors with a villanous scowl  at first he tried to deny his identity but the americans had been furnished with his photograph and a wart on his forehead proved a clew that was conclusive at once his effects were searched and under his pillow was found a leather bag containing fifty thousand dollars in gold and in american bank bills  this is the money you stole from braxton bogg said ben severely you need not deny it where is the rest  at first benedicto lupez refused to talk but with a long term in an american prison in manila staring him in the face he confessed that just previous to the fall of san isidro he had divided what was left of the money with his brother josé who had now left for parts unknown this confession was afterward proved to be true and later on ben learned that with five thousand dollars of the stolen funds josé lupez had purchased himself a generals commission in the insurgent army  well i suppose we are lucky to get back the fifty thousand dollars said ben when he was telling larry of how he had found benedicto lupez a halfloaf is far better than no bread at all you know  yes answered the young sailor and who knows but that we may run across this josé lupez some day and get the balance anyway the recovery of that fifty thousand dollars means at least eight or ten thousand dollars in our pockets as well as something for uncle job ill wager uncle and walter will be mighty glad to get the good news we have to send them and then he added enthusiastically which was just like larry hurrah ben score one more victory for young america and old glory                                                  here we must bring to a close the adventures of ben and larry russell previous to and during the campaign of the jungle under gallant general lawton the campaign had lasted three weeks and during that time the troops had covered about a hundred and fifty miles of territory fought twentytwo battles captured twentyeight towns and destroyed large quantities of army stores including three hundred thousand bushels of rice the losses to the americans had been about fifty killed and wounded while the losses to the filipinos were nearly ten times as great  with the fall of san isidro general aguinaldo and his followers retreated to the mountains twelve miles to the north of that town at the same time the rebels who had been opposing general macarthurs advance fell back to tarlac thirty miles beyond san fernando but the americans had not sufficient troops at hand with which to garrison the many towns they had taken and so it was not long before some of the rebels came back to one place and another to take what they could get and to harass those natives who had been friendly to our soldiers in the meantime the rainy season put a stop to further activity on a large scale and while the filipinos sued again for peace but upon their own terms general otis sent for additional troops so that the next dry season might see the rebellion brought to such a finish that its resurrection would be an impossibility many americans pitied the sad condition of the tagalogs but all felt that as matters were now situated the supremacy of the united states throughout the philippines must be maintained once the insurgents submitted to american authority we would do the very best we could by them  shortly after the fall of san isidro general lawtons command marched to join that of general macarthur in the meantime larry and his wounded friends were removed to the hospital at manila whither gilbert pennington had already been taken along with many others here the sick were given every attention and soon the majority of our friends were on a speedy road to health  ben felt that there was no need to write to walter as his brother would ere long be in the philippines but he wrote to his uncle job telling about the capture of benedicto lupez and adding that the prisoner had been sent to join braxton bogg and that the recovered money was safe in the united states bank at manila waiting to be returned to buffalo he also told about larry and added that since the olympia had sailed away without him the young sailor was now going to throw in his fortunes with the soldiers  the letter brought great joy to job dowling and he immediately wrote back stating how pleased he was and adding that he hoped ben would catch josé lupez and recover what was still missing  that is easier said than done said ben to larry as the pair read the letter together still if this josé lupez is now a general in the rebel army we may meet some day strange as it may seem that day was not far off as will be related in a sixth and concluding volume of this series in which we shall meet all the russell boys as well as gilbert luke and many of our other friends again and see what each did toward carrying our flag to a final and lasting victory in the philippines  but now let us leave ben and larry and also the others all had done well and richly deserved the rest that came to them many adventures were still in store for them but it is doubtful if any were to be more thrilling than those encountered during the campaign of the jungle                                                      the old glory series  by edward stratemeyer  author of the
